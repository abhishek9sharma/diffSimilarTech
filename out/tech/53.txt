6900176
datagridcomboboxcolumn	datagridtemplatecolumn
instead of using datagridcomboboxcolumn use datagridtemplatecolumn and you can bind text property of the combobox to some property which will hold the free text value after closing drop down list

6900220
textview	imageview
the way your buttons look you might as well use a relativelayout containing a textview and an imageview

6900252
vsto	add-in
this question is similar to create excel add-in without vsto

6900255
hide	show
i want to show only the first 5 elements of a list and hide the remaining elements when you click on a more -link the remaning elements of the list must be shown.

6900304

6900379
post	get
a textbox control does not get its value from the view state but from the post data in the form in this event

6900379
post	get
so even if you disable view state for the textbox control it can get its value from the http post data if it implements ipostbackdatahandler interface

6900422
post	get
the catch is that you need to call the service a particular way with jquery in order to get a json response instead of xml specifically with a post request of content-type application json

6900427
post	get
and your goal is to get all user that have post

6900445

udp	tcp
here is some highly recommended technical material for udp or tcp hole punching

6900477
udp	tcp
also apparently udp protocol is used because it is more empirically successful than tcp

6900575
google-chrome	firefox
but it does work when i use google-chrome or firefox

6900603
udp	tcp
i am aware of the tcp udp hole punching method however i am not willing to setup and run a server on my machine 24 7 for this purpose besides my network is behind a nat anyway...

6900613
children	parent
this is basically the same setup as a tree structure in which each node has a single parent but many children

6900616
division	addition
actually thinking about it - to do the whole equation just replace the space with a + sign and run it through sp_executesql this should i havnt tested this right at this point convert 1 1 4 to 1+1 4 and the standard math engine will do the division before the addition so it will end up as 1.25

6900631
stdout	stderr
popen gives you a file handle on a process stdout not its stderr

6900642

int	chars
in fact i may have already written where int is one chars shorter than auto

6901058
memcpy	memmove
i d probably use memcpy memmove which is still going to be copying the memory around but at least it s been optimized and tested by your compiler vendor

6901150
put	get
if i run the code without initializing any of the objects i call the function with it runs fine but when i call getspace for an object then put data in it and then call getspace for another object i get a stack trace with a message like this

6901159

you should use the appropriate life-cycle event handlers to save data and restore it upon re-activation onsaveinstancestate onpause and onresume

6901451
width	height
you ll probably want to use a grid with the height width of the columns rows set to if the item is expanded or auto if not

6901451
width	height
also if you re using a grid in an itemscontrol you need to set the grid.row grid.column and width height properties on the contentpresenter not the itemtemplate since the itemtemplate in a itemscontrol is always wrapped in a contentpresenter

6901466
implements	extends
you should implements runnable instead of extends thread

6901468

then all objects that use this service can simply have an ivar of type nsmutableset to store the token for every enqueued block and â in their dealloc â enumerate the remaining tokens canceling them with the service

6901634
superclass	subclassing
instead of having to call a method setdao to allow your subclassing to pass the dao reference to your superclass why reverse the direction and force the subclassing to supply the dao to the superclass

6901637
google-chrome	firefox
everything works correctly in google-chrome and firefox but it won t work in ie

6901668
sigkill	sigaction
you can do it using signal or sigaction but the problem is that you only can use this method for any signal except sigkill or sigstop

the thing that bugs me is waiting for all the emails to get sent and finally receiving the http post response

6901847
google-chrome	firefox
i tested this on google-chrome and firefox still no luck

6901865

depending on where you put the id annotation on a field or on a getter all fields or getters not marked with transient will automatically be made persistent with a default column name

6901901
128bit	64bit
i don t see a problem here - a 128bit integer is represented by two 64bit integers which is the largest native type outside of sse registers a 64bit intel cpu can handle

6901910
for-loop	loops
if you have multiple different divs make a foreach loops for that too if you want same div to repeat 3 times wrap it around a for-loop

6901931
google-chrome	firefox
the problem is that the drop-down disappears perfectly in firefox but not in google-chrome

6901931
google-chrome	firefox
here is the actual page the script contains jquery and some plugins src ed and the rest - the actual code i wrote... i m aware it doesn t work in ie but in google-chrome the onblur for the buttons on the left of the search bar does not work but it works in ff5 so it must work in lower firefox s too

the issue however is that the grand total accounts for the shipping rate as shown below the order form however i d like to also have it displayed above the sales tax line

6902097
post	get
i m not to familiar with svg but if you re using javascript to manipulate can you get javascript to give you it as a string stuff it in an hidden input and post it to the server

6902108
selecteditem	selectedindex
use binding on selecteditem instead of selectedindex

6902134
ienumerable	iqueryable
for example iqueryable builds the expressiontree which it later parses according to the concrete provider executing shared code once for optimization while ienumerable accepts func and performs it as you would expect

6902137
put	get
all the get variables are put into a superglobal array

6902143
width	height
but like matias said you need to devide these values by width and height of the image respectively as texture coordinates are in 0 1

6902191
post	get
the documentation of jquery.post tells us that the query string in either post or get request is built from the second parameter of that method

6902191
submit	submission
there was never really a submission of the form but it was sent via ajax thus there s no input of type submit

6902234

google-chrome	firefox
possible problem - url in ie not supporting chars like ä while google-chrome and firefox does

i have a listview and custom layout consisting of textview imageview imagebutton

6902390
uitableview	reloaddata
is there a way to for a uitableview to show the begin of the results using reloaddata instead of showing the same position as before it s called

6902394
google-chrome	safari
this doesn t happen on ie9 latest google-chrome and latest safari

6902395
children	parent
because the tree is traversed in-order this means that parent will be drawn before behind their children with siblings drawn in the order they appear in the tree.

6902424
draggable	droppable
i have some images in a container they re all draggable and bellow there s some droppable containers with the class container

6902478
keydown	mouseup
click mouseup keydown etc

6902551
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
edit 0 by the way i don t know that they use a uitabbarcontroller for the bottom but from all indications they do use a uinavigationcontroller up top

6902562
webclient	httpwebrequest
use httpwebrequest instead of webclient and set allowautoredirect to false

6902568
maven	m2e
could it be a configuration problem due to eclipse m2e maven wtp or geronimo

6902588
implements	extends
but i went ahead and implements the method of extends the sessionidmanager class and overriding the createsessionid and validate methods to use a guid as explained in this msdn article

6902588
hash	md5
for example an md5 hash produces a 128 bit value

6902588
hash	md5
however the md5 hash of incremental values a timestamp or 8-bit random numbers are each insecure because the source of the random values can be easily predicted

6902589
jlist	jtable
there are maybe easiest and nicest way i think that jtable with one tablecolumn and without tableheader in all cases better as jlist here is your render macox version

6902597
inherited	properties
there is one thing that i did try that does work but i m not sure that it wont cause all sub folders to inherited the properties

6902604
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
embedding a uitabbarcontroller inside a uinavigationcontroller is not supported

6902668
nsbuttoncell	nscell
said in an other way i want an nscell that is a nstextfieldcell when not being edited and a nsbuttoncell or a custom view when being edited

6902670
uiview	subviews
the game that i m working on has a set of about 10 classes that all subviews uiview and are drawn once when they are loaded using quartz code in drawrect

6902670
uiview	subviews
initially the uiview subclass that itself adds all these subviews probably 20 instantiated objects of these classes had a drawrect method that would be called every frame with quartz code

6902688
entities	entitymanager
the point therefore is that the entitymanager or the persistence context must be associated with an active transaction before you perform any changes to entities so that all changes made to the entities in the persistence context can be flushed to the database

6902691
bash	zsh
files you want with bash not with zsh

6902713
chown	chmod
both directory and files have been chown d for ownership and chmod d for 775.

6902775
put	get
if you don t get the error then the problem is in that block otherwise put it back in and take the next block out

6902783
post	get
i ve seen a few different post on this but i can t seem to get it working

6902783
post	get
i followed this post uipopovercontroller toolbar at top in order to get started

6902789
google-chrome	firefox
i thought maybe it was my novice understanding of ajax but then i tried google-chrome firefox and everything is working as expected

6902797
width	height
without background and add an extra that has the same width and height as the links pagenumbers and then animate it s position by setting it position absolute

6902806
couchbase	couchdb
make sure to run these commands as the owner of all the other files in these directories couchbase or else couchdb won t have the permissions to use the files you create

6902809
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
the various subviews of uinavigationcontroller and uitabbarcontroller are both private and trying to mess with them is likely to not work correctly

6902809
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
and apple doesn t give us the tools to create container view controllers so you can t easily embed the uinavigationcontroller uitabbarcontroller inside another view controller or recreate uinavigationcontroller uitabbarcontroller yourself

6902831
subtract	add	multiplying	subtract	multiplying	add
checking the links in the other answers make it clear you ll never have a guarantee of whether floating point is correctly implemented or whether you ll always receive a certain precision for a given calculation but perhaps you could make a best effort by 1 truncating all calculations to a common minimum eg if different implementations will give you 32 to 80 bits of precision always truncating every operation to 30 or 31 bits 2 have a table of a few test cases at startup borderline cases of add subtract multiplying divide sqrt cosine etc. and if the implementation calculates values matching the table then not bother making any adjustments

6902855
glm	predict
is there perhaps a way package function in r which will use the coefficients of this glm model to predict ie

6902869
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this works in google-chrome and safari but not in firefox

6902880
width	height
linearlayouts call onmeasure once for width and once for height where as relativelayouts do not so they have no way of going back and filling in a vertical divider to the propper height once everything else has been laid out

6902906
min	max
check the min and max values of an integer data type

6902940
post	get
to get the post request right most of the magic is done by rails form builders

6902959
glm	predict
second the function you are seeking is likely to be predict which can take a glm model

6903048
getter	setter
in this super-simple case you d just be accessing public properties or fields when an instance is passed in to a function - you might have to access them through a public getter setter since you want the variables to be private

6903064
equals	compareto
edit my code as shown requires compareto to be consistent with equals even thought that s not a requirement

6903088
pop-up	dialog
when the user clicks that link pop-up the dialog to let them feed in the custom settings and save that on the server after performing the relevant validation

hide	show
showhideobjects div1 none div2 div3 flip and it d hide div1 show div2 and switch div3 from either hidden or show

6903262
int	chars
it s kind of a stupid workaround but how would i go about converting an int in c to a chars buffer with the same bit ordering

6903272
free	malloc
every malloc should have a matching free

6903295
profiling	debugging
using flash builder 4 on mac os x trying to debugging why it seems our air app is leaking the objects declared in the mxml files but if i try to expand the instance in the object reference tab of the profiling it runs for several minutes before throwing a java heap space error

6903297
multiplying	transpose
then following my link above you d like to multiplying by the transpose of a which will give you the 4x4 matrix a t a that you can invert

6903321
hide	show
if you have a div which has a class hidenseek you can use this to toggle it to show or hide

6903327
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
change your for obj in format_objects loops with a normal for-loop because format_objects is an arrays

6903330
google-chrome	firefox
and of course if you view the page from firefox or google-chrome there s no issue there either

6903348
int	double
how can i convert it to an int double float whatever in order to check if it s bigger smaller equal to.

6903349
rss	feed
if college is having its website and the website provides rss feed for time table you parse that xml file and show the data which is parse or you can save the time table information of which course in the database and display that using cursors

6903362
post	get
for example you could use post to do a search which is semantically more of a get request

6903362
post	put
the entire html version of the world wide web gets along pretty well without put or delete and it s perfectly fine to do deletes or updates with post but if you can support put and delete for updates and deletes and other idempotent operations it s just a little better because agents can assume that the operation is idempotent

6903389
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
web services don t know about runtimeexception so throwing unchecked-exception from your service will not have any effect

6903412
hide	show
however you can perform the same action hide show toggle on a group of elements by using the appropriate selector to get the group

6903423
post	get
if your button is clicked then a get or post request should be most probably be made

6903423
post	get
tip you could add a hidden variable which is sent via get or post and check if that variable is set along with your existing condition - that is one way to do it

6903426
int	chars
you are trying to compare a chars small int and a string

6903452
post	get
the value providers get queried in sequence and return a match from query string post data json request body etc

spaces	delimiter
you mentioned in the comments that our data is spaces delimiter

6903495
yacc	bison
i don t know about lexer parser generators for python but what i posted should work with lex flex and you can hook it up to yacc bison to create a parser

6903561
oncreate	setcontentview
just call requestwindowfeature right after the super.oncreate call in oncreate and then call setcontentview after that and you should be golden

6903568
width	height
in java for some reason the ellipse2d.double uses the parameters height width x y where as when i create a rectf in android the parameters are left top right bottom so i m a bit confused on adjusting to the differences

6903568
width	height
change the parameters to work with height and width rather than right and bottom

6903604

6903743
cassini	iis
problem only happens with real iis not iis express and not with cassini

6903743
cassini	iis

so after my research and findings i d recommend going with vlcj but definitely using out of process players if you just want to play record stream video stuff and xuggle if you want to do any low level video work with the codecs themselves

6905424
width	height
so i am trying to create a jframe that will resize to a width and height based off a certain fixed value

6905424
width	height
when you use the mouse to change the size of the jframe if the new width or height value is not a multiple of 20 the fixed size in the below code it will round the width or height to the nearest 20 then resize the jframe

6905424

this works and any subview frame changes you make are animated nicely as the device is rotated landscape - portrait

doesn t really help because this gets called before the rotation takes effect so when accessing self.view.frame you get the pre-rotation sizing so you can t know whether we re going for landscape or portrait

6905648
addclass	removeclass
you ll need to write some small functions like hasclass addclass and removeclass then your listener can be

block elements can have margin padding width height but they cause elements to be stacked vertically

6906029
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
they allow other inline elements to be placed vertically next to them however you can also add margin padding width height to them

6906921
hash	md5
instead of storing a password in your database you generate a md5 hash of the original password and store it

6906921
hash	md5
but when you re trying to login a user he s going to type the real password you will then run the md5 algorithm again and compare the hash with the one you have stored if they re the same then the user possibly typed the correct password

6906927
hash	md5
md5 is a one-way hash encryption algorithm

6906927
hash	md5
there is no way to directly decrypt a md5 hash

6906927

6906982
range	minimum
if the desirable range that you would like to amplify is not the true minimum or maximum you can set imgmin and imgmax values manually

if you actually want to adjust the range of the image you can just normalize it by subtracting the minimum value and dividing by the available range

yacc	bison
this declares token3 to have higher precedence that token2 but by your comments you may be misunderstanding what higher precedence means to yacc bison

6915293

6927811
subtract	add
when the functions are called they grab the value from the variable and add subtract it to from something

6927811
subtract	add
you could of course combine the two functions into one and decide wether you should add or subtract according to which button was pressed you get that by looking into the sender argument but i think it s less effective and the code woud be more complex for no reason

6927823
getter	setter
then i would avoid getter setter and use package local or public fields

6927823
getter	setter
if you have a class which you expect other modules developers to use following a getter setter model may be a safer approach in the long run

6927831
implements	extends
if instead of a class you want to extends you want to implements an interface take a look at java.lang.reflect.proxy

express	node.js
i have successfully implemented socket.io node.js and express to server realtime json data to all browsers except ie testing on 9 using a secure connection

6928410

is there such a tool for google-chrome or for firefox for that matter

6928515
mvp	presenter
in most of the mvp examples i ve seen the presenter calls some service which calls some repository which returns an entity

6928515
hide	show
where does the logic for show hide controls go

6928528
hide	show
when someone instantiates the control they ll pass in a popupid attribute which is assigned to the id of a div inside the control and will be used to call show and hide functions in javascript

6928544
dbcontext	objectcontext
if i add a new category and then write something like that i m intentionally not using repository here but row dbcontext or objectcontext if we are using ef 4.0 to be clearer to you

6928548

i browsed through the code on the next couple of pages and i can t find any release message anywhere except for a release being send to timelabel in dealloc

6928673
mvp	presenter
most mvp frameworks populate the presenter view relationship from the view especially since asp.net runs in the context of the page the page is the http handler processing the request so it s what is alive at that point

6928676
actionscript	mxml
in mxml you would do this in the metadata tag in actionscript it would be before the class definition

6928697
hash	md5
the only way i can imagine to do this is to connect to the database every time a page is loaded and check an md5 hash or something from the database and renew it but i imagine this would generate a lot of needless server traffic and i m almost sure there s a better way to do it

6928697
hash	md5
for the most part i m pretty solid on this part i hope but i don t know what my md5 hash should contain in order to be able to later re-check the hash with the one in the database the one in the cookie and a newly generated hash to make sure a cookie hasn t been conjured by an attacker

6928720
range	min	range	max	min	max
it takes an excel range like a1 a5 or a1 b5 and 2 optional paramters min and max

hash	salt
you won t be able to send people their passwords because you don t know either you just know the hash but you can implement a reset password option which generates a new salt and a random string which you then hash like any other password

6929721

the reason you want to hash it several times is that it makes it makes it unfeasible to use a rainbow table to reverse the hashing even if you know the salt s

6929721
hash	md5	hash	salt	salt	md5
if you just hash a password once with md5 and no salt it d be trivial to look up the hash and see what the unhashed password is unless your users are all smart enough to use really long random passwords which aren t found in any rainbow tables

first you need to create an object viewmodel that has all the properties from parent and a collection of children

6931908
implements	extends
you need to declare an abstract typequalifier that extends annotationliteral and implements type

6931917
pop-up	dialog
the alert dialog is supposed to pop-up once the person is done editing the text leaves the edit text focus thanks

6931940
int	chars
in the .net clr strings are laid out in memory pretty much the same way that bstrs were implemented in ole automation as a word-aligned memory buffer consisting of a four-byte int giving the length of the string followed by the chars of the string in two-byte chunks of utf-16 data followed by two zero bytes

6931947
put	get
put breakpoint to get set run the program and filter the columns

6931956
mouseover	mouseout
or something similiar to mouseover and mouseout

6931966
inherited	properties
it is easily possible to show or return alnone when the internal inherited properties is still set to alcustom but that is not an advice and would confuse only more

6931968
post	get
the data consists of a weekly count from each server s log for a particular request get login.php or post update.php

6931981
onchange	onblur
text inputs have onblur and select boxes have onchange events that can be wired into

6932002
int	chars
what i did was set the data type to string so it would work with maskedinput but then in a custom model binder i stripped out all the non-numeric chars so it could save to the database as an int

6932002
client-side	server-side
you still get both client-side and server-side protection because the user is prevented from entering non-numeric characters by maskedinput client-side and potentially bad characters are filtered out server-side

6932007
button	checkbox
high quality shapes and controls like window label button checkbox

6932007
gif	png	tiff	png
layered windows jpeg png tiff and gif format read write support

gtk	cairo
firemonkey ancestor aka dxscene was already linux ready using gtk pango cairo opengl and they already have an elf linker in-house the one from kylix which was very good

6932010
free	malloc
multiple heaps can be an issue when the library uses a different c-library and therefore a different malloc free and therefore a different heap

6932020
width	height
so it seems that for some reason the width and height are giving out-of-scale values for 125 although they work properly at 100 smaller and 150 higher

6932085
min	max
one alternative would be to specify every selected field using aggregate functions like max or min but this will probably make the scope even longer and less versatile

6932111
post	get
when php receives post get variables which i assume this is about because json_encode wont t do it replaces dots in keys with an underscore a register_globals legacy i think

6932165
hive	hdfs
when you use an olap data warehouse using hdfs and hive you are not quite barred from updating the fact data

6932165
hive	hdfs
table partitions in hive are implemented as hdfs directories so exchanging partitions is almost instantaneous it s the time needed to rename a hdfs directory

6932165
hive	hdfs
well you ll have to call hdfs directly bypassing the hive interface and you would likely employ straight mapreduce to maintain stage but in the datawarehouses developed by the company i work for it proved to be a good approach

6932206
pop-up	dialog
the dialog showing please wait appears but doesn t disappear when the download box pop-up

6932295
google-chrome	firefox
i have something working well on internet explorer and not on firefox and google-chrome

6932305
children	parent
think of a tree view or even objective-c inheritance structure where each child node has exactly one parent but itself can have many children nodes

6932309
dictionary	map
i m not sure what you are actually trying to achieve but it seems to me you are trying to mimic the behavior of a dictionary or map that can map two different values to each other

6932324
union	distinct
you may wish to swap that with a union distinct but you ll have to benchmark yourself

6932333
ubuntu	debian
on debian or ubuntu systems just install libmysqlclient-dev package using

6932355
children	parent
i have five children relations to a table this makes 5 foreign keys on the parent table

6932384
stdout	stderr
i need to merge stderr and stdout because i want my debug and the exceptions in the same log file

6932395
aggregate-functions	sum
if it not possible you need to use map reduce or available aggregate-functions like group good fit for your example of sum calculation

6932422
google-chrome	firefox
this does not occur in internet explorer 8 but does occur in google-chrome and firefox latest versions as of this date

6932437
mouseover	mouseout
i can certainly figure out how to switch the source of an image on mouseover and then switch it back on mouseout

6932475
width	height
how to get picasa rss image width and height

6932481
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
1. activex is ie only not firefox google-chrome safari etc

6932498
oncreate	setcontentview
you would use an activity that can use a view you create in your xml file by extending activity for your class and then in the oncreate method you say setcontentview r.layout.your_view

6932506
mouseleave	mouseenter
css3 is adding a bunch of transition properties to handle things like this but for the moment if you re set on using jquery you could make use of the .animate function combined with mouseenter and mouseleave

6932514
stdout	stderr
when you run the process redirect stderr to stdout like this

6932519
visualstatemanager	togglebutton
for example i ve created my own control and with visualstatemanager i m able to handle several events that fire for the control as a whole i d like just my togglebutton in the controlto fire the mouseover event

6932566
children	parent
edit i have explored having the children register themselves with the parent

6932567
maven	cobertura
see also maven cobertura plugin

6932600
inherited	properties
now you can stuff any object that inherited from the parent action object in to the actions list and it will properly serialize all their respective class properties as long as the object is listed as a knowntype

6932621
min	max
you can t use min or max function as it would pull the first or last record not the correct record

6932656
firefox	safari
strangely i moved the get document 1 and save document 1 lines outside of the tell application safari block and it saved the applescript as python.htm and it looked all goofy when opened with firefox

6932711
maven	buildr
you can see the dependencies for v2.6 here and here for v3.0 along with the required code to import the package using maven ivy buildr or groovy s grab

6932743
width	height
you can use the properties to get the frame rate similar to the way you got the frame width and height however since you are capturing from the camera you will probably have to test the capture rate by using a timer in your code and estimating from that

6932819
mongoid	mongomapper
code stats for mongoid and mongomapper

6932835
width	height
the -crop parameters are 1 4 of the width and height

6932841
range	min	range	max	min	max
the perl does not look like it s simply the python min max and range functions

6932859
udp	tcp
.net remoting allows for tcp udp ipc communication and to your code it just looks like you are calling a method property on an object

6932922
width	height
remove the height and width settings on your button and if you need the initial sizes add these setters to your style

6932923
width	height
without a code example it s hard to diagnose but i would recommend that you ensure that the width and height attributes are set to 100 on the iframe and that you have a height 100 style on the div and td that contain the iframe

6932935
put	get
how do i get the information the user enters in the job no field put it in job and submit it without page refresh

6932947
getter	setter
however the properties should have included the contents of the getter setter which yes would be a syntax error because of the invalid field name but it is an accurate representation of the il

6932950
stdout	stderr
using dup2 in unistd.h you could close both stderr and stdout and re-direct them to a file

6932950
stdout	stderr
now both stderr and stdout when used will write to my_log_file.txt

6932974
google-chrome	safari
works fine in google-chrome but in safari the source info changes within the audio tag and yet it plays the same song

6933017
google-chrome	safari
do the above on an ios device and in desktop safari google-chrome

6933081
accessor	properties
if that is done one may declare an object which implements any combination of interfaces using nested interfaces that implement iself and may without a typecast use any such object as its proper type by using the proper number of .self properties accessor

6933102
mouseleave	mouseenter
ordinarily code in the control will use the mouseenter and mouseleave events to set a boolean to indicate that the mouse is over the control and then call some updatestates method in which the developer will include logic to determine which visual states the control ought to be in currently

6933102
mouseleave	mouseenter
in your case rather than using the controls mouseenter and mouseleave events attach these handlers to your inner togglebutton instead

6933129
realloc	malloc
use hwloc_set_membind_nodeset to set the memory allocation binding policy for the nodeset and use plain malloc posix_memalign and realloc

6933292
stdout	stderr
you could redirect stderr to stdout

6933310
margin	height
you could set a max-height of the element and using css allow full height on hover - you d have to use some positioning and possibly some negative margin to prevent other elements jumping about

6933322
int	double
you can t represent a 16-byte 128-bit int precisely in a php number -- they re typically stored as double which lose precision before then

6933336
pull	push
git push or send a pull request

6933344

prior to ruby 1.9 would return an int between 0 and 255 but in ruby 1.9 with its new unicode support returns a chars string of length 1

6933397
int	chars
to get the int instead of chars you can call .ord on the chars

i haven t tested extensively but on recent firefox google-chrome and ie for pc

6934017
move	drag
i m thinking along the lines of drag n drop support to move your rows up and down

if you want it to run every 9 seconds then you can use setinterval handler 9000 or you can use settimeout handler 9000 and then set the next settimeout in your handler function

6934314
macports	homebrew	fink	homebrew	fink	macports
or you should update to using a newer python either a system one or one from python.org or one of the third-party open source distributors for mac os x like macports or homebrew or fink or activestate

6934314
macports	homebrew	fink	homebrew	fink	macports

6934316
range	min	range	max	min	max
i have date time information where i want to get the average min max range of the dates across seasons grouped by years and the only way i have been slightly successful of doing this is with tapply

6934316
min	median	min	max	median	max
results are what i only assume is a list by year of the min max 1st qu median etc

6934316
min	max
ive read about the plyr package and assume that ddply instead of the tapply to force the result into a dataframe should work but i can t figure out how to get that to even work because i can t get it to do the functions i would need such as the mean min max range.

6934328
width	height
make sure that the width and height match the image dimensions in the css

6934332
hex	binary	octal	hex	octal	decimal	octal	binary

6934579
profiling	instrumentation
in profiling an ios game on an iphone 3g instrumentation is reporting that the system call pthread_setspecific which is being called from many seemingly unrelated locations is the biggest cpu bottleneck

6934579
profiling	debugging	profiling	instrumentation
this is running a release build with debugging symbols through the coreanimation profiling in instrumentation

6934589
hide	show
a work around for this behavior is to use controlconditions to show hide two mutually exclusive text controls that use static text to represent the selected and unselected state

6934620
notepad++	scite
scintilla has a reference implementation called scite and is used in notepad2 notepad++ tortoisesvn and numerous other projects

integer	fractions
it s easy to plot with the integer years plus appropriate fractions additions like year . +quarter 4

6934743
integer	unsigned
i m coming across some number formats that are either too long for unsigned integer or have dashes in them like 123-456-789

6934743
integer	unsigned
recreate the table using a varchar 50 instead of unsigned integer for this column in question

6934796
requestfactory	gwt
we have our gwt application working fine on the development mode with gwt 2.4rc1 but when we deployed on tomcat 6 we get the following exception on the server side when the first requestfactory call is made

6934813
rss	feed
when clicked the button takes you to a second page where the results are pulled from a facebook rss feed and wrapped in an tag pointing to a bookmark on the same page in keeping with the jqm convention

6934845
setinterval	settimeout
because of the nature of requestanimationframe you should never queue animations using a setinterval or settimeout loop

6934845
setinterval	settimeout
if you continue to queue animations via setinterval or settimeout while animation is paused all of the queued animations will begin playing when the window tab regains focus

6934904
trie	tree
use the trie data structure or its memory-friendly version patricia tree

6934952
kerberos	ntlm
kerberos and ntlm are popular single sign-on protocols

6934971
innodb	myisam
myisam can also be very slow for inserts so i would also recommend changing the second table to innodb if you haven t already

6935006
stdout	stderr
is there a way to tell curl to output errors to stderr and everything else to stdout

6935006
stdout	stderr
i m redirecting stdout to a log file but leaving stderr unchanged so that cron will e-mail it to me if there is any output.

6935006
stdout	stderr
there are options to make curl silent or output everything to stdout however both these alternatives prevent errors from appearing on stderr - meaning i won t get an e-mail when there is actually an error i want to know about

6935006
stdout	stderr
so is there a way to make curl only output errors on stderr but leave normal output intact on stdout

6935010
post	get
however now my user wants to get all post containing a minimum of one of multiple tags

6935017
folder	directory
i copied log4net.dll to the bin directory of cbmi.common not the bin debug folder

6935046
children	parent
i could reformulate this to whats the best way to obtain a full tree given the parent node and all the folders in a same table other than querying for children recursively because otherwise i m querying the db 10000 times

6935053
division	modulo
the modulo does division and returns the remainder

6935094
django	web2py
we are looking for software components with permissive licenses though we re using some copyleft components i see that web2py is lgpl while django is bsd so +1 to django

6935094
django	web2py
as mentioned above i m especially interested in web2py because of its jquery integration though django s dominance is once again hard to ignore

6935103
width	height
i have almost 200 000 html pages and i need to figure out the height and width at which each html will render in any browser

6935104
post	get
i want to send a image to server in a json webservice by using a string parameter in json post method and i want to get image from uri path

6935175
width	height
just write an html parser and enough of a rendering engine to at least know the height and width of any html element for any screen size font setting

6935184
hash	md5
assuming you want to return the base64 representation of a md5 hash of a string this would be equivalent

6935190
width	height
c# does not execute inside of a browser and should not be used to try and determine the width and height a given html page will render at in a browser

6935190
width	height
optionally you can repeat step 3 with different browsers to get the width height for all the different browsers that you care about

6935238
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
opera and google-chrome do the job but firefox keep me logged in it doesn t send the expiry signal

6935287
prepare	execute
another way is that use prepare statement in your appplication when the prepare statement is execute

6935338
stdout	stderr
it works by temporarily storing all output stdout and stderr in a temporary file and then sending the contents of that file to stderr or stdout depending on curl s exit code

6935338
stdout	stderr
if curl failed the entire output will go to stderr and be e-mailed to me thanks to cron but if curl succeeded the output will go to stdout instead which is redirected to a log file in the cron command resulting in no e-mail.

6935361
octal	decimal
012 octal twelve is 010 octal ten which is decimal 8 plus 2 or decimal 10

the problem is that i can t see the cant be seen in firefox on the confirm box in my firefox browser but works well in other browsers ie google-chrome

6935475
width	height
if the height and width is unknown you can use approaches used for generating rounded corners on 4 divs for example

6935483
uitableview	uiswipegesturerecognizer
you may simply add an uiswipegesturerecognizer to every cell in the uitableview delegate cellforrowatindex and set the direction property as left right

6940533
maven	pom.xml
the maven super pom.xml has a dependency on v2.0 of the release plugin defined

6940577
int	double
to expand on amit s answer the operator should only be used on value types int double etc. a string is a reference type and should therefore be compared with the .equals method

6940797
portrait	landscape
5 images should be shown in portrait mode and 8 in landscape mode

6940840
hide	show
alternatively instead of re-creating the image object every time you could simply show hide the image as reqired

6940855
pop-up	dialog
is it possible to make a facebook wall post using the fb.ui but without showing the pop-up dialog box to the user

6940906
x86	64bit
amd64 is the 64bit version of x86

6940909
width	height
if you want the textview to have limited width or height call setmaxwidth setmaxheight setmaxlines or check it manualy and change is the way you like from a custom method

6940950
getter	setter
it looks like the class is a valid bean properly named getter and setter so anything that works with beans is probably fine too

6940956
webclient	webrequest
to cache an image you would download it to your local file store with either a webclient easiest or using the webrequest - webresponse mechanism

6940964
google-chrome	safari
in mozilla ie google-chrome safari it s showing vertical scroll bar to see all the rows in the girid

6940980
hide	show
then you could use javascript to show hide the answer section

6941004
sorting	grouping
or is there a way to use positioning to place each grouping item if sorting is not an option

6941017
post	get
also since it s a search form you should use an http get method to make the search result indexable and bookmarkable but you re not specifing it and the default overload of beginform will render a form tag using http post method

6941020
concave	convex
since your shape is usually kidney-shaped not convex calculating the area of its convex hull won t do and an alternative is to determine its concave hull see and calculate the area of that

6941020
concave	convex
but determining a concave hull is far more difficult than a convex hull

6941020
concave	convex
plus straggler points will cause trouble in both he convex and concave hull

6941045
textview	imageview
i am using textview and imageview display for some things in my layout i did not

6941083
put	get
put this into your .bashrc file or where is appropriate and whenever a crash occurs you will get a core dump of your application

6941088
textarea	pre
im using pre tags in order to allow a textarea box to pass over newlines because im stripping html out the form when its subitted

6941145
children	parent
which means it is missing the parent without any children

6941145
children	parent
how can i make the tags without children to become parent too

6941194
ubuntu	debian
varnish public ip 80 - default.vcl from ubuntu debian

6941232
public	protected
i found that its returning true if variable_name is a public but false if its private protected

6941267
allocator	stl
the stl container classes in turn use the global new delete operators for allocator

6941293
client-side	server-side
i m assuming that the server-side method would be a little faster but i have very little to go on and the client-side code to construct the table may be a little more convoluted than the php

6941297
move	drag
when you drag an icon in app drawer and move it out of container top or bottom bound the list begins to scroll

6941332
debian	linux
i build an application on a machine running linux debian with kernel 2.6.26-2-amd64 and i want to run this application on another machine running linux suse with kernel 2.6.16.60-0.21-smp but i get the error fatal kernel too old

6941350
ubuntu	debian
if you re using debian or ubuntu installing an smtp server may be as simple as

6941423
nsurl	nsstring
your applictiondocumentsdirectory is returning a nsurl not a nsstring so the third line is trying to call stringbyappendingpathcomponent on an nsurl-object

6941425
width	height
i m displaying a jquery ui date picker with z-index 200 a gray overlay div spanning the whole document height and width with z-index 199 and behind all that is the regular form

6941489
children	parent
i would like to remove all of the li children from a parent ul so that when i do

6941561
pthreads	fork
kill the processes with fuser -k or by obtaining the list of process ids with fuser or lsof fuser is in pthreads but not fuser -k . note that there s a race condition a process may fork between the time you call fuser and the time you kill it

6941561
unix	bsd
on many unix variants you can obtain the information with an option to ps such as ps -e on bsd or ps e on linux

6941640
google-chrome	firefox
when i run this code in google-chrome and firefox both display border differently

6941640
google-chrome	firefox
i see a dash in between adjacent cells in google-chrome while in firefox it s rendered without any dashes

6941647
put	get
to get its path and put it in a maven property i wrote the following gmaven script

6941676
pop-up	dialog
hi i am using following code to pop-up facebook application request dialog in my rails application

6941685
realloc	malloc	free	malloc	free	realloc
for example you could specify a heap check every 16 malloc realloc free and _msize operations with the following code

6941696
post	put
if user wants he may still put just any kind of data to post

6941698
folder	directory
you need to be in the src folder rather than right in the directory with the source files

6941750
portrait	landscape
this solution will work in both cases landscape and portrait mode

6941792
hive	hdfs
does hadoop hdfs guarantees this magic or does hive as a smart application makes sure that it will happen

6941898
post	get
when i switch the call from type post to type get the issue goes away

6942037
for-loop	loops
like in a for-loop with multiple loops variables

6942047
hazelcast	terracotta
we are thinking of using ehcache terracotta or hazelcast these cache hold resultsets locks info and some system specific varaibles

6942048
for-loop	arrays
when i iterate through the arrays using a for-loop like

6942065
post	get
truly madly deeply rest or if it uses http get post it s rest-ful enough for me

6942100
inherited	properties
for in loops iterate over every properties in an object including those inherited from prototypes

6942100
inherited	properties
you can check if myarray.hasownproperty i to skip inherited properties

6942102
apache	nginx
4 i d like to understand why nginx might be better than apache when one is long polling and why long polling is better than periodically polling a server

6942119
jquery	simplemodal
i have made sure that the jquery and simplemodal scripts are loaded and in the page where i want to display the map i include the jquery code

6942146
comparator	comparable
it should be used when implementing comparable or comparator

6942177
globalization	localization
i had the same error which came from adding resource files to a local folder and changing the build action to embedded resources resources - properties while modifying localization resources to mvc3 from webforms see mvc2 globalization

6942198
gson	jackson
i did something similar using the gson library i found it easier to use than jackson

6942289
jquery	simplemodal
seems that the jquery simplemodal plugin is not properly installed

6942349
pascal	delphi
delphi and .net platforms spring to mind but if you struggle with html you ll certainly not find object pascal or c# easy to pick up

6942369
jar	war
using gradle i have an ear myenterpriseapp file with a war myweb and set of jar files in the root folder

6942439
getter	setter
but for some strings or object types properties is used i know that when we set property cocoa creates some setter getter which are handling the relasing and retaining of the objects

6942441
post	put
plus i don t think you have to specify the method post part as form_for will decide if it should use put or post based on whether site is a new or an existing record

6942478
getter	setter
any class variables that are used internally need not have getter setter defined

6942501
coalesce	nvl
can a materialized view contain oracle functions such as coalesce nvl nvl2 etc and still be fast refreshable

6942517
opera	google-chrome
my site caches each page daily and for some reason some browsers opera and sometimes google-chrome display a warning message

6942522
websphere	ibm
therefore if you use websphere mq as the transport you will need to use the ibm mq jms classes to write a jms application

6942522
websphere	ibm
it is ibm websphere mq specific

6942540
javadoc	enunciate
but if you don t have java source code enunciate won t be able to pull stuff out of your javadoc to enhance its generated documentation

6942540
javadoc	enunciate
given that there should theoretically be a way to apply enunciate to compiled groovy bytecode but your docs won t be as rich because enunciate won t be able to see your javadoc documentation

6942563
gif	png	gif	bmp	bmp	png
image files magenta .jpg gif bmp png tif

6942576
.htaccess	httpd.conf
although you can t edit httpd.conf you can use .htaccess

6942599
integer	unsigned
if your compiler supports the c99 c++0x type uintptr_t defined in stdint.h cstdint that is the unsigned integer type specifically for storing pointer values as integers

6942631
inherited	properties
another approach which i tried is getting rid of the inherited and use tpt for b and c and used navigation properties to link b and c

6942641
equals	charat
test to see if it s equals to charat 0

6942706
inherited	properties
can you inherited from the standard faultexception and add a housedetails properties to if of type housedto

6942759
maven	pom.xml
but when running it through maven using the following pom.xml configuration

6942761
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
get safari google-chrome with their developer menus or firefox with firebug and have a look at how these web programming tools visually represent the things you want to know about

6942777
google-chrome	firefox
i use asp.net mvc 3 for creating web page and so i detect that my comboboxes html select-option tags are different in firefox and other browsers google-chrome and ie

6942785
google-chrome	safari
webkit google-chrome safari claims innerwidth is smaller than clientwidth

6942806
ethernet	wireless
your computer probably has an ethernet card or a wireless network adaptor or both and either of both of those could each have their own private address

6942842
int	double
i guess it s not possible to convert double to decimal without possible loss of precision but it is ok with an int

6942844
msdeploy	ajaxmin
how can we include the files created by ajaxmin in the msdeploy package created by msbuild

6942854
mkmapview	mkannotationview
however if you must add a button directly to the mkannotationview the problems with your approach are that the mkpinannotationview s default frame which can t easily be changed is smaller than the button you re adding so most of the button will not respond to touches and even if you switch to using an mkannotationview and increase the frame size the mkmapview will prevent the button from getting any touches

6942866
google-chrome	safari
i ve tested w javascript disabled tested on ff3.0+ safari 4.0+ google-chrome 10.0+ and ie6+ checked my z-index values and no matter what i do i am unable to duplicate this issue so therefore i am unable to find a solution

6942872
dbf	dbase
you can select your platform for example dbase for dbf files and look for a driver

6942925
put	get
in case your users can get kicked out in the middle of their work you can solve this by creating an action filter and put it on either

6942941
google-chrome	firefox
but when deployed the project and started the application on a browser i checked in google-chrome and firefox too the application did not start

6942995
int	double
they do this because double has such a huge range â 5.0 ã 10âˆ 324 to â 1.7 ã 10 308 whereas int is only -2 147 483 648 to 2 147 483 647

6942995
int	double
a decimal s range is -7.9 x 10 28 to 7.9 x 10 28 10 0 to 28 so it can hold an int but not a double

6943000
google-chrome	firefox
i m not surprised but i ve discovered that ie8 behaves very differently than google-chrome and firefox with respect to retrieving the caret position from a text or

6943000
google-chrome	firefox
whereas google-chrome and firefox report the caret position analogously to the index within the string value ie8 does not

6943000
google-chrome	firefox
first off here are the functions that i use to retrieve the caret positions respectively in google-chrome firefox and ie

6943000
google-chrome	firefox
the code above reports the following caret positions for the given criteria in google-chrome and firefox

6943030
for-loop	loops
in c using xcode how to change the while loops to mach the first for-loop

6943041
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox google-chrome

6943066
folder	directory
i need to change the current folder directory as well which is over 1000 records

6943092
for-loop	loops
to change while loops to for-loop

6943092
for-loop	loops
to make while loops print numbers like the for-loop

6943098
pygtk	pygobject
i m in the process of converting a program from pygtk to pygobject introspection for the first time and i ve hit a roadblock with threading

6943098
pop-up	dialog
i have a process that takes some time to complete so i pop-up a dialog with a progress bar on it and i use a thread to do the process and to update the progress bar

6943098
pygtk	pygobject
this worked fine with pygtk but after converting to pygobject i get all the usual improper threading weirdness the program hangs but it seems to hang in different parts of the process etc

6943108
public	protected
if the form is declared within a class under private protected or public section then the class needs to be instantiated then the form itself needs be instantiated and passed around wherever it is needed

6943118
x86	64bit
if you re running 64bit windows make sure to change the platform target of your c# project to x86

6943130
folder	directory
however i do not know how i can do the same thing with directory and folder

6943133
hash	salt
i was just thinking if creating a password hash by using a salt created from the password himself is safe to use

6943170
getter	setter
in delphi which was afaict one of the first languages with properties as language construct at all it is customary to wrap all ivars in properties but not all have to be public and there are many such unreal i am deliberately avoiding the term virtual here properties the ones that are only implemented in code and not just getter and setter for an ivar

6943170
getter	setter
it doesn t make sense to declare and implement either via synthesize or with custom setter and getter public properties for each ivar

6943186
hide	show
i tried changing it so it cloned and then did the show hide but i didn t notice any obvious difference in speed

6943188
capitalize	capitalization
setting the capitalization property to words will suggest that the user enter capitalize words

6943201
getter	setter
many people will tell you that using the getter setter instead of the variables is more robust to programming errors and changes and reduces code duplication

6943201
getter	setter
but as long as these getter setter are no inline functions you may get a small performance hit and as the implementation has to know the class s internals anyway why not just use the variables directly

6943212
getter	setter
i would prefer using setter and getter that way if way your change some implementation details for example introduce validation on value assign you jest have to change that in one place in setter.

6943241
getter	setter
when you have both getter and setter why not make the var1 public

6943250
button	checkbox
checkbox and radio button new simpler design

6943260
pop-up	dialog
in excel 2007 you use this according to the tag when you open a xml file it pop-up a dialog box asking what to do with the xml file

6943267
getter	setter
you should nearly always use getter setter methods to access a variable when you re outside of the class and often you have to because that s the only way to do so

6943268
for-loop	loops
i try to download a site in an infinite loops here only a for-loop and

6943269
getter	setter
using a setter getter reduces this to just a couple of methods

6943337
implements	extends
class panel extends surfaceview implements surfaceholder.callback

6943367
google-chrome	firefox
what i am trying to is after loginbutton is clicked opening dashboard.aspx and setting focus on it.and this code opens dashboard.aspx and sets focus in google-chrome and mozilla firefox 4.however when i try it on ie9 dashboard.aspx is opened but focus does not work and dashboard.aspx remains under the login page

6943386
ienumerable	ilist
here is an alternative implementation of gishu s answer that returns an ienumerable rather than an ilist and makes use of the yield keyword to simplify the code

6943391
jruby	mri
also notice with the neo4j server solution you can run a rails frontend on ruby mri and the backend using neo4j server with the active model compliant neo4j.rb on jruby

6943397
getter	setter
the point of the abstraction of setter and getter is that the method of retrieval may change

6943405
dictionary	map
if you re doing this lookup a lot it might be easier to create a dictionary to map from typea to typeb

6943411
put	get
you can then put an index on the new column and get the database to do the work for you

6943443
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
if the file name contains accents it works as expected in opera firefox google-chrome and ie9

6943458
g++	gcc
your are probably compiling and linking with gcc instead of g++

6943458
g++	gcc
gcc uses the file extension to guess the real language but when linking g++ also pulls in the c++ standard library which is where allocators are usually defined

6943480
int	double
since you are seemingly interested in numeric types a very natural requirement for such types is that they provide a constructor which takes a fundamental type int or double

6943481
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
currently works on google-chrome firefox edge opera but not safari 10 or ie11

6943515
docx	xlsx
microsoft office files doc docx xls xlsx ppt and pptx

6943596
post	get
you can get the post body string using

6943618
int	double
even the conversion from double to int

6943658
children	parent
example first number is pid the second one is number of children + 1 parent

6943670
hash	salt
so in this case just hashing their password and adding it as a salt would still make 2 user s final hash password equal when the same original password is given

6943694
ssl	https
i want to use ssl to make the site secure using https

6943695
pascal	delphi
see also is there a sax parser for delphi and free pascal

6943697
realloc	malloc
if you ve allocated a buffer with malloc you can use realloc to expand it

6943752
hide	show
when the value of a long list of elements is set to hide show the hidden elements are removed from the flow and placed on the bottom of the page in the order they were removed

6943824
fold	catamorphism	catamorphism	unfold
extremely loosely speaking a catamorphism is just a slight generalization of fold and an anamorphism is a slight generalization of unfold

6943858
put	get
so whenever the byte stream received and put into a bytebuffer by java we call getint to get the value

6943947
setinterval	settimeout
there is js optimalization causing inactive tabs to slow down setinterval and settimeout in ff5 and chrome

6943962
udp	tcp
udp sockets are much simpler then tcp ones

6943962
udp	tcp
to elaborate a bit after your comment - when you get a datagram on a udp socket you don t get a new socket descriptor like with tcp so your parent still handles all the input

6943964
ienumerator	idisposable
additionally ienumerator doesn t implement idisposable whereas does. if you re new to generics that s more than can easily be covered in an answer here.

6943965
nunit	mstest
i would say you use the setup and teardown nunit or classinitialize and classcleanup mstest for this

6944009
getter	setter
when we set property cocoa creates some setter getter which are handling the relasing and retaining of the objects

6944009
getter	setter
in order to automatically generate the getter and setter you need to synthesize it

6944009
getter	setter
you could alternatively write your own getter and setter which do not even have to reference a real ivar

6944014
implements	extends
then a new node is simply implements by extends one or both of these abstract classes

6944023
getter	setter
could it be because i have not defined the getter and setter

6944023
getter	setter	mutators	getter	mutators	setter
i defined isfirstwordbeinganimated at the top of my .m file without creating the mutators setter and accessor getter methods.

6944025
cairngorm	flex
i am creating an crm application using flex cairngorm 2 java hibernate

6944039
client-side	server-side
it also includes features like client-side browser history support that don t make much sense on the server-side

6944039
client-side	server-side
though you could technically use it on the server-side with node backbone is targeted at building single page interface apps on the client-side

6944071
put	get
try to put it to the topmost of your page however since the dom isnt loaded yet you cant get any other elements

6944073
innodb	myisam
i am using the mysql workbench to alter some huge millions of rows myisam tables to innodb

6944073
innodb	myisam
so i thought i could wright a sql script that loops oversy every 10000 entry or so and copy the content of the myisam table in chunks to the innodb table

6944119
width	height
returns a mutable bitmap with the specified width and height

6944154
vmware	virtualbox
i m trying to migrate an existing vm from vmware to virtualbox

6944196
tortoisegit	svn
tortoisegit and tortoise svn

6944202
imagemagick	im4java
fortunately imagemagick has 2 popular java bindings and if the jmagick api doesn t let you deal with inputstreams you might look at im4java which is a straight wrapper to the command line version of imagemagick

6944202
imagemagick	im4java
if that is the case you can use imageio.read inputstream to read the image data into a bufferedimage before sending it off to imagemagick for processing using the im4java api

6944209
uiview	calayer
though the nice fellow then answered with even more helpful advice uiview contains a .layers which contains calayer in which i m trying to access the calayer .contents to try to see if i can add an image manually to uiview using cgimageref

6944236
switching	screens
in order to disable switching to full screens mode either form button or pinch gesture you can use this

6944251
getter	setter
because by accessing directly the ivar you are bypassing the setter and getter

6944308
pop-up	dialog
i assume you re referring to registration - the dialog that pop-up when you request push notification registration for the first time

6944390
comparator	comparable
you need to use the comparator method on comparable instead

6944396
content-disposition	content-type
it s not 100 clear what you mean but the browser will use the content-type and content-disposition headers to decide whether to display a resource in the browser or to show the download prompt

6944411
websphere	ibm
i am using websphere 6.1 with ibm rad - connecting via a datasource that implements com.ibm.db2.jcc.db2connectionpooldatasource

6944424
getter	setter
secondly you created the getter setter fine but you re not actually using it

6944426
put	get
even if you had put more effort into obfuscation an attacker with strong motivation would still be able to get what he wants

6944435
inherited	properties
when trying to map an inherited properties using attributeoverride annotation openjpa throws an error that it cannot find the properties in the super class

6944470
draggable	droppable
i have initialized box to be draggable and div b to be droppable using jquery ui libraries

6944493
implements	extends
though not every possible feature is implements in jqm by default it s not that difficult to extends

6944501
hide	show
i have a simple show hide jquery script that works fine on its own the problem is that i am using it on the comments section off a php mysql driven site

6944501
hide	show
i am struggling to pass the commment id variable to the jquery script so that the show hide function works for each comment independently

6944541
width	height
my recommendation add a background color to #col2 such as #ff0000 which is red to see its width and height

6944554
post	get
i think you don t have to use the twebbrowser and can use anything that can issue get and post requests

6944621
jar	war
as for war files you can extract the class files from war or jar by unzipping it

6944621
jar	war
you can even zip and unzip the war with jdk jar -xvf tobe_extracted.war

6944672
pop-up	dialog
pre-ie9 when the user clicked my preview button on the pop-up window they would get a dialog like this once the report rendered

6944672
pop-up	dialog
i ve looked for ways on the net to either show the the download bar on the pop-up window preferred revert to the old dialog or remove it all together

6944679
google-chrome	firefox
tried the same file in firefox 5.0 and it didn t work either only google-chrome is able to play the mp4 video

6944707
sorting	grouping
you use groupingview having groupdatasorted false so the sorting of the grouping in your case with do jqgrid for you

6944725
jar	war
the jar file must be under web-inf lib in the war

6944771
int	chars
an int chars constant has type int note that it has type chars

6944771
int	chars
in c++ ...the value of an int chars constant containing more

6944772
google-chrome	firefox
this works in the latest versions of google-chrome and firefox

6944780
setinterval	settimeout
first of all i m asking this for settimeout and for setinterval

6944783
opera	firefox
however html5 has also defined limits on these attributes and webkit browsers have implemented these restrictions likely with firefox and opera not far behind

6944783
min	max	width	height	required	placeholder
the following content attributes must not be specified and do not apply to the element accept alt autocomplete checked dirname formaction formenctype formmethod formnovalidate formtarget height list max maxlength min multiple pattern placeholder readonly required size src step and width

6944783
submit	submission
webkit browsers are responding by not submission the form at all and not triggering javascript s submit event

6944783
submit	submission

min	max
you should pass into this container the min and max for the x-axis probably as separate properties and a dataprovider that describes when to show a highlighted section

6945831
min	max
you might have to compute the min and max based on the dataprovider you pass into the chart

6946655
udp	tcp
there are literally hundreds of posts on stackoverflow and elsewhere that talk about preserving application message boundaries on tcp hint you need to do this yourself tcp is a byte stream interface and doesn t so i won t go into the details here suffice it to say you need a mechanism to know how big an application message or packet is on the recv side to enable you to do what you want over tcp or you need to switch over to udp

6946664
onresume	onpause
this could happen if you are still rendering the lw while he configuration activity is open try to pause it using the onpause call and resume rendering on onresume

listview table gridview

6947134
ssl	https
i was thinking of using the global filter approach provided in mvc 3.0 in order to verify what are the pages being accessedâ if the user is accessing public pages them make sure heâ s in http if the user is accessing an ssl page then make sure it prints out the https

6947149

6947163
treeview	tabcontrol
there is a treeview inside a tabcontrol inside a splitcontainer inside a panel on the main form

6947180

a typical approach is to implement some kind of rtf generator that builds an rtf-compatible string using fast string manipulation stringbuilder stringwriter etc and then replace the richtextbox control s rtf code with your own

6947184
width	height
it resizes to maximum width and height of the actual screen but no larger

6947195
tabcontrol	tabitem
i would use a tabcontrol with it s itemssource bound to the details property and then use a datatrigger within the tabitem to determine how the itemtemplate tab content should get drawn

everything works perfectly in ff5 safari and google-chrome but when i test on ie 8 i see the following behavior

int	chars	unsigned	short
i want data to hold max of either unsigned chars unsigned short int and unsigned long int the data_t enum contains

6947437
button	checkbox	put	get
mx checkbox extends mx button so if you put added css that skinned mx button mx checkbox would also get it

my firebug and firepath were working fine but they just started acting strange

uitableview	uisearchbar
i am attempting to add a uisearchbar with its corresponding search logic but there is a problem i am using the uitableviewcontroller subclass s automatically generated uitableview instead of a separate nib file and manipulating everything programmatically in terms of the table view

6947858
uitableview	uisearchbar
is there a way to accomplish this same task programmatically or is it in my favor to abandon the default uitableview and transfer to a custom uitableview nib file so that i can easily add the uisearchbar

memcached	apc
create a cron job that runs once a day preferably during a light traffic time to do your heavy lifting save or cache the result for example using apc or memcached or even just overwriting the currently-used image with the new one and display that result to your users

your render function would in this case never hide a div just show another one

6947932
versioning	upgrade
the upgrade was not carried out as new versioning of jira needs 64 bit hardware

6947985

contacts is of type iqueryable which itself implements ienumerable so whtat you are actually looking at is a collection of contacts not a single one

6948002
hide	show
changing textboxes and labels works perfectly but when i want to show or hide the whole gui from another thread this fails

6948002
hide	show
is it necessary to show hide the gui with a delegate or can i do it from every possible thread

6948082
hash	salt
also as mentioned it would be possible to brute-force a users password quite easily as the attacker can intercept the salt going from server-- client and then the hash password coming back

6948082
hash	md5
md5 being a fast hash algorithm it would likely be quite an effective attack against standard user passwords

6948112
int	double
int and double are different types but are and also different

but when i call it with settimeout or setinterval i am able to see only blank screen and the page does not stop loading

6948513
namedtuple	dictionary
i suppose here you could see a namedtuple which has both a name and a value for each element as an immutable analogue of a dictionary

6948513
namedtuple	dictionary
there are now namedtuple -- starting to feel more like a special-case dictionary

6948581
namedtuple	dictionary
first of all ordered dictionary and namedtuple were introduced in python 2 but that s beside the point

6948597
portrait	landscape
i would look at the display size and determine myself if i am in landscape or portrait

6948597
portrait	landscape
there is a method getrotation on the display object but that is the rotation value from its natural orientation which depending on device may be landscape or portrait

6948604
hide	show
the nice thing about this is it s directly interfaced with jquery s show and hide functions

6948607
put	get
you can put to get the old value

6948629
getter	setter
by synthesizing it in your eventstablecontroller.m file you are telling xcode to generate the getter setter you need to correctly touch mydata which is where your program seems to be failing

6948646
union	distinct
selectmany will flatten the list of lists into one list then you can just pick out the distinct entries in this enumeration instead of using union between individual sub-lists

6948651
namedtuple	dictionary
namedtuple exist for convenience and are intended to replace simple classes rather than dictionary really

6948680

width	height
it s width is 850px and height is 567px

6948973
serializable	deserialization
objects events do not survive the serializable deserialization round-trip because they are logically function pointers - so when the object is removed from memory and later re-built the entire memory landscape has changed so those events pointers would no longer be valid

6948994
opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari
then you will have pages that show virtually the same on ie opera safari and firefox

6949006
google-chrome	firefox
this happens on firefox but not google-chrome or ie

6949009
umask	chmod
perhaps the report file should be chmod -ed after generation to allow others to delete it or the app users should have a correctly set umask

6949015
folder	directory
the program monitors two folder and sends files in those two folder to certain directory on the computer

6949015
folder	directory
i thought about using messagebox.show to let the user know lets say the folder does not exist but with 10000 or so files unable to be moved or if access to directory is denied the computer might just run out of memory with 10000 popups

6949018
vim	kate	vim	gedit	vim	emacs	emacs	kate	emacs	gedit	kate	gedit
emacs and vim should be able to view them without any problem as should gedit kate or pretty much any other syntax-highlighting text editor

6949076
subclass	abstract-class
the jvm doesn t really know or care about that - so it s only as expensive as creating an instance of any other class which happens to be a subclass of an abstract-class

6949085
google-chrome	firefox
the image in firefox is displaying with different colors than the one in google-chrome

6949365
treelist	gridcontrol
if you don t know which assembly it s defined in you can create a collection of devexpress assemblies typeof gridcontrol .assembly typeof treelist .assembly .

6949383
for-loop	loops
i should have mentioned this is removing one object from the collection then breaking out of loops which prevents any errors you have described although using a for-loop with the count is the better option

6949393
typedef	struct
as someone else said here it s probably a typedef now but i don t think c had typedef back in 79 as it only just had struct

6949438
put	get
get the headers from a response in javascript is a little bit cumbersome with some tools but if the http headers give us the right tools to put the meta-information of the request why don t using it

6949445
superclass	subclassing
edit also the superclass forcegaugeviewcontroller should not include the subclassing forcegaugeviewcontroller in the header file

6949463
post	get
first it tells some script to get an url then it instructs to post to

6949479
for-loop	loops
note that i substituted your foreach with a for-loop since we aren t able to modify values within a foreach loops

6949482
width	height
oh and i should also mention that because of how the css box model works having an element set to 100 of height or width with a padding won t work well for you

google-chrome	firefox
referring to ecmascript 5 compatibility table page firefox 4 - 6 and google-chrome 13 - 14 are the most compatible browsers

6949802
uisearchbar	uisegmentedcontrol
in regards to the second part of your question regarding your uisearchbar s scope i d strongly recommend replacing the uisearchbar with your own uisegmentedcontrol that s all the scope of a uisearchbar is anyway so that the user isn t confused by there being an off-screen uisearchbar that doesn t do anything

6949803
strcpy	strncpy
you re going to need to use strcpy or better strncpy

6949817

6949888
hash	salt
passwords should be stored with a strong cryptographic hash function including a random salt you ll see this mentioned in the owasp link as well

6949897
int	double
it effectively says treat 1 3 as a double - don t use truncating int division

6949897
int	double
it effectively says treat 1.0 3 as a int - don t use as much memory as you would with a double

6949924
int	double
this means that 1 gets converted to a double and 3.0 is automatically a double so you ll end up doing a floating point division rather than int division

6949924
int	double
the same thing would happen with double 1 3 because the divisor is a double so even though the dividend is an int the system realizes that you want to do floating-point division

6949924
int	double
so when you say int 1.0 3 you re doing double division but then you re converting the double into an int afterwards producing 0

6949928
int	double
double 1 3 - first evaluate the expression in parenthesis - 1 3 is an int division so the result is 0 then cast it to double you get 0.0

6949943
xfce	gnome	xfce	kde	kde	gnome
instead you have to tell your desktop environment what to do when double clicking a jar or png-file and you have to do it on linux the same way you do it in windows - maybe the installer on windows does it for you because there is normally just on desktop environment windows on the os windows but linux has gnome kde xfce lxde fluxbox and millions more

if that doesn t work you can always iterate and then use ord and chr

6951023
int	chars
if you really want to write the function yourself python s string library has a list of ascii lowercase letters but you could exploit the fact that ascii chars are really just int values and add 32 to each letter that has a value between 65 and 90 65 a and 90 z in ascii but there are a few punctuation values in between z and a. no need to parse lists

6951027
comparator	comparable
even if your employee class implements comparable if your subclasses overrides the implementation of comparator you can have problems if you are not careful

6951045

i have the ability now thanks to some pointers in the right direction to place the correct pictures with the correct post but i would like to actually drop them into the text based on where i put the tag in the post itself

6951539
for-loop	loops
everything works fine but in the for-loop it only execute once transfer only one folder and then break out loops

6951546
many-to-one	one-to-many
if you have a one-to-many list on one side and a many-to-one on the other side you should be able to let the list control the relationship so that nhibernate can take care of setting the index values for you

6951546
set	bag
collections like bag list set etc

6951546
many-to-one	one-to-many
if they exist in conjunction with another relationship however like your traditional one-to-many many-to-one they should be specified as

6951548
serializable	deserialization
implement some interface for serializable deserialization which you can use as a parameter to the static method to lessen the dependency between the serializable deserializeton process and the class

6951548
serializable	deserialization
just implement your serializable deserialization interface accordingly

6951563
hash	salt
i want everything to use a unique salt that i will store along side the hash in the mongo document

6951563
hash	salt
for authentication do i have to just salt and encrypt the input and match it to a stored hash

6951655
spaces	delimiter
the default delimiter for stream is spaces so when the stream encounters a spaces it simply stops reading that is why it reads only one word

6951661
division	multiplication
if you want multiplication and division to have higher precedence 2+3 5 gives 17 you d need to create a stack and hold operators and temporary intermediate values and some other complexity

6951664
client-side	server-side
you cannot do this as javascript is a client-side language and ruby is a server-side language

6951675
keydown	keyup
if the text shows up before keyup then it s probably triggered in keydown event

6951680
put	get
this is the degree character from a website but when i put that into my model i get the dreaded invalid byte sequence in utf-8 error

6951751
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and apparently the latest versions of firefox too reduce the speed of setinterval when the tab is in the background to improve foreground performance

6951751
setinterval	settimeout
use repeated settimeout instead of setinterval with some type of repeated settimeout like this

6951752
uiview	subviews
if you have uiview i would imagine at least one uiviewcontroller then you could for instance design view a in interface builder adding view b as a subviews on top of view a

6951752
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
if you used uiviewcontroller and had a uinavigationcontroller you could set a s view controller as the root view controller and simply push b s view controller

6951769
stdout	stderr
the reason for the error mail is that the mta thinks there was an error if the executed program has written something on stdout or stderr i m not shure - this is what php does when it is emitting a warning

6951839
client-side	server-side
but if you need a certain value to exist in both the server-side where your rails is and client-side where your js is you would probably be better off storing that value in the server-side

6951865
ubuntu	centos
i would however argue that ubuntu or centos is a better option when it comes to server installations

6951899
post	get
and thus gives a 405 error but without the auth info on my post request i get a 403 error

6951947
mezzanine	cartridge
mezzanine which integrates cms+blog and cartridge as shopping cart application

6951947
django-cms	mezzanine
both combinations are nice although not perfect...at the moment there is problem integrating released versions of django-cms zinnia due to their usage of non-compatible versions of django-mptt or mezzanine is missing some features like linkback support in blog etc

6951947
django	web2py
we are aware it s younger project with smaller community less apps etc. but wonder if there is some set of web2py applications which can compare with the two above-mentioned django sets so that we can choose to start with web2py learn it and in that process replace php sites with it

6951947
rss	feed
rss feed

6951947
django	web2py
considering the features we would like to have our non experience working with any framework which one - django or web2py - you consider is more suitable in terms of ease of learning ease of use application support etc

6951949
rtp	sip
i am trying to develop an application in which a sip call is established and then i am capturing rtp audio packets

6952002
onclick	onchange
in your php code for the event try onclick or onchange to trigger the delete

6952025
setinterval	settimeout
i d favour using settimeout repeatedly over using setinterval - so many things can go wrong with setinterval and you don t know how busy the browser is and whether the interval is realistic

6952032
int	double
number data types db2 has many more standard types such as smallint int double etc

6952086
post	get
one thing i would suggest you change is the get method change it to post

6952113
hide	show
everytime you refresh it will show the ajax spinner and when the dom is ready it hide the ajax spinner

6952137
put	get
from there i have get that path and put it in bitmap bitmap bitmapfactory.decodefile filepath

6952160
gitolite	gitosis
gitosis or its more uptodate version gitolite always manage bare repos to allow any user they authorize to push to without worrying about a working tree not in sync with the index

6952160
redmine	gitolite
for example it uses gitolite areponame where gitolite is a ssh shortcut defined in your config file see here for an example of config file try using a full ssh uri scheme ssh user host port path and check that address works both from your workstation and from the redmine server

6952296
inherited	subclassing
example a person object has 2 subclassing called parent and child both subclassing have the same hierchical structure as they inherited person therefore this is a valid type conversion

6952326
stdout	stderr
cron reads the stdout stderr of the command that gets executed if something is written then cron sends an e-mail

6952326
stdout	stderr
redirect stderr and stdout to dev null that means append to your cron command

6952349
switching	screens
this way you will have the back button act as it should be and it would be easier for you to handle when switching screens

6952424
int	double
i need a algorithm to perform arithmetic operations on large numbers that are way above range of float double int or any other data type for that matter

6952456
ant	maven
here s how the maven ant task works

6952458

i made use of absolute layout and gave required paddings in portrait and landscape modes by specifying all dimensions in pixels i am using layout-land folder for landscape xmls

6952458
portrait	landscape
i want to be able to develop in such a way that in any phone with any screen size in any view mode portrait or landscape my page should align itself accordingly and all should be seen

6952493
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome are more lenient here

6952539
width	height
use relative layout and don t specify height width instead use fill_parent or wrap_content which ever is appropriate.you can show your code for more clarity

6952543
free	malloc
also it seems you were leaking memory you malloc d but never free d and your myarray wasn t released

6952546
implements	extends
but when i create a class that extends activity and implements sensorlistener it doesn t work

6952570
width	height
resolution in pixel width x height

6952572

6952759
ubuntu	debian
on ubuntu and i assume debian that would be

6952777
mousemove	mousedown
can i get cursor position at mousedown event event without using mousemove event continuously thus waisting resources

6952804
ssl	spdy
update if you are living on the edge turn on the spdy to boost the ssl connection

6952820
udp	tcp
like that used for tcp udp communication

6952828
int	boolean
call onlayout boolean changed int left int top int right int bottom

6952853
hide	show
then inherit all your other views from that base class and you ll still have the button label to show hide or update as necessary

6952870
tostring	string.format
you can override the tostring method so that string10 can be used in string.format and friends you could even define a widening implicit conversion to system.string so that you can use string10 with apis that expect a system.string

6952914
ubuntu	debian
debian and ubuntu systems have bin sh linked to the dash executable

6952948
visualvm	yourkit
if you want to reduce how much garbage you produce i suggest you profile your application with something like visualvm or yourkit

6953019
loops	if-statement
and get it out of the two while loops right at the beginning of the if-statement

6953060
pop-up	dialog
i have a pop-up dialog cdialog that handles wm_ctlcolor message to color itself

6953060
pop-up	dialog
one idea is to put the controls as the children of an intermediate dialog that is the child of the original pop-up dialog

6953064
ddms	adb	ddms	adt
android has the 100 linux file system.the adb tool shows the correct file structure its the ddms adt in particular which is not showing all the directories due to some reasons probably security reasons

6953088
put	get	screens	tablet
here is the thing as you might know admob has a function where u put banner to show banner ads and ad_banner for tablet banners what i want to do is take a screens size of a device so that i could throw it in my if statement and then put the right banner for right device i hope i was clear enough.so anyone can tell me how can i get the screens size of device

6953133
google-chrome	firefox
other rules on the page work fine and firefox google-chrome show the correct layout

6953170
children	parent
it can be a textview or a more complex layout and that both for parent and children

6953203
for-loop	arrays
i m trying to do a preg_match on an arrays of strings using a for-loop but it s only returning the filtered result for the final item in the arrays

6953205
mouse	keyboard
i would like to know if there is a keyboard shortcut that would move between spring config and its classes icon on editor outline with mouse click

6953212
typedef	struct
by prefixing it with typedef you are changing the way the declaration works and defining instead the type name instead of an instance of the struct

6953266
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine on google-chrome but does not on firefox 3.6.18

6953274
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i m working on an app that has a uitabbarcontroller at the bottom and uinavigationcontroller at the top of the screen

6953274

how can i hide uinavigationcontroller uitabbarcontroller with a little fade animation just when i want to view the photo in full screen

6953281
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this works on google-chrome firefox and safari

6953285
put	get
i know this will get a lot of traditional answers but i would also like to put forward something completely original we tried and succeeded doing ourselves for more efficient localisation of silverlight using attached properties instead of binding

6953287
draggable	droppable
so any new draggable elements react with the droppable one

6953291
uiview	subviews
i changed it to a uiview and then added uiscrollview as its subviews

6953315
maven	pom.xml
this pom.xml would have a snapshot dependency on the maven artifacts created in the 2nd step

6953326
width	height
by give the width and height of target object but the target object in design was applied by glow effect so my question can we get the all view of bitmapdata from a displayobject

6953336
for-loop	arrays
range based for-loop is created as the c++ counterpart for foreach in java that allows easy iteration of arrays elements

6953338
client-side	server-side
now it s unlikely that you ll find a public smtp server that lets you do this and if you really don t have access to anything server-side whatsoever no webserver no control over any smtp server then you ll need to rely on the client-side mailto links instead

6953373
portrait	landscape
the layout from portrait and landscape are totally difference so it can t be solve by using uiautoresizingmask

6953383
hive	hdfs
in hive there s bucketed map join but the distribution of the files representing the tables to datanode is the responsibility of hdfs it s not done according to hive clustered by key

6953383
hive	hdfs
so suppose i have 2 tables clustered by the same key and i join by that key - can hive get a guarantee from hdfs that matching buckets will sit on the same node

6953389
filtering	grouping
if you really wanted to do filtering first then grouping then you are looking at some sort of two pass transform

6953421
google-chrome	firefox
works fine in firefox google-chrome but in ie i m getting

6953442
udp	tcp
for example udp protocol doesn t guarantee delivery and tcp does

6953471
pdfsharp	migradoc
is there anything wrong in my code for generating pdf at run time using migradoc and pdfsharp libraries

6953512
postgresql	mysql
this works fine with sqllite and mysql but gives an error on my new postgresql database

6953514
automator	alfred
to alt-down with fastscripts alfred or some other fast method that avoids the overhead of automator

6953536
cart	oscommerce
however i downloaded a few online cart oscommerce zen shoip and open cart and none of them seems to need at install to configure a process handling the lost customers

6953553
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
i am doing a lot of xpath with normal modern browser firefox google-chrome opera safari... but i m looking for a javascript library which allow ie to support document.evaluate method

6953581
mouseup	mousedown
as an aside i think you should be handling mouseup rather than mousedown since in windows buttons are clicked when you release the mouse button rather than when you press it

6953614
setinterval	settimeout
mozilla is working on a different way of implementing setinterval and settimeout called requestanimationframe perhaps it could help you solve your problem or atleast hope for future updates that will take care of the problem

6953619
postgresql	mysql
postgresql is actually following the sql standard here whilst sqlite and mysql break from the standard

6953627
getter	setter
belongs_to realm creates among other things methods called realm and used as getter and setter

6953639
explode	implode
i think the explode and implode functions would do the trick better for you they split a string into an array and back

6953644
postgresql	mysql
have at look at this question - converting mysql select to postgresql

6953681
user-controls	tabcontrol
create new user-controls name it for example tabcontrolwithoutheader and change inherited user-controls to tabcontrol and add some code

6953704
min	max
you need to tell if it needs to select min max average sum or something else

6953740
put	get
i tried put the onclick in the but onclick has never get fired

6953804
mouse	keyboard
not too sure however i found that pressing pressing ctrl+shift+caps lock+tab all at once seems to get rid of this and enables the mouse and keyboard again

6953846
gentoo	ubuntu
it seems the latest version of gentoo doesnot need the ubuntu patch

6953902
superclass	subclassing
in this case think about having an intermediate subclassing between your original superclass and your app-specific subclassing one that encapsulates the core functionality and offers a formal protocol to interface with it

6953905
multiplying	add
adjust this result by multiplying with 18.2065 and dividing by 18.0 or using integer arithmetic multiplying by 182065 add 90000 and divide by 180000

6953905
division	multiplication
if you choose the calculation with integer route make sure you are using 64-bit multiplication and division

6953929
equals	gethashcode
in tests we found that in calls to the tolookup extension only gethashcode is used despite providing the implementation for equals

6953950
put	get
i know this will get a lot of traditional answers but i would also like to put forward something completely original we tried and succeeded doing ourselves for more efficient localisation of silverlight using attached properties instead of binding

6953978
width	height
the purpose of using a percentage here for me was in using one gradient to support large and small containers with size appropriate stripes while also auto sizing to either height or width whichever is more appropriate for the specific element

6954046
lme4	nlme
have a look at lmlist from the lme4 or nlme package

6954094
postgresql	mysql
mysql and postgresql both have coalesce function so you can do something like

6954105
filtering	grouping
we use a company called mailchimp for sending out subscriber mails and i questioned them on how to avoid spam filtering especially in the context of essentially an advert out to a large grouping it can be very difficult to avoid them here is their advice and there is lots of it

6954111
put	get
but if i put the class difinition to the rails-plugins i get next error message

6954120
internationalization	transliteration	internationalization	translation	translation	transliteration
although ext gettext and ext intl are both related to i18 internationalization gettext deals with translation while intl deals with internationalizing things like number and date display sorting orders and transliteration

6954151
filtering	grouping
we use a company called mailchimp for sending out subscriber mails and i questioned them on how to avoid spam filtering especially in the context of essentially an advert out to a large grouping it can be very difficult to avoid them here is their advice and there is lots of it

6954166
ant	maven
i do this all of the time admittedly using maven not ant but the same principle applies

6954199
folder	directory
most command line programs eg the launcher in this case have problems with spaces in files folder names including the program files directory

6954210
post	get
edit i just remembered an interesting blog post about opencv in ruby from a couple of month ago this should get you up to speed with the lib

6954314
put	get
i modified put and get functions and change parameter when create semaphore in main

6954325
google-chrome	firefox
i have no problem with firefox and google-chrome but just with ie

6954334
versioning	upgrade
i have just upgrade to the latest versioning 3.1.0 rc where i hoped this would be fixed but unfortunately it hasn t

6954385
equals	gethashcode
so long as you implement equals and gethashcode correctly -- whether in the types themselves or a custom implementation -- then there won t be any problems

6954385
equals	gethashcode
the problem with your example code is that you re not overriding equals and gethashcode at all

6954385
equals	gethashcode
override equals and gethashcode correctly or set up an to do so and everything will start working as you expect

6954396
portrait	landscape
when my app is in landscape and the user taps the ad the interface is forced to rotate to portrait mode

6954397
min	max
min unknown5 celsius max shift

6954512
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
if you extend an arrays instance like this make sure you only traverse over its elements with a for-loop not with a for...in loops you should always use for for arrays anyway

6954524
hash	salt
you should store only a salt hash and your editusermodel should have two string properties for password and password confirmation which are not the fields in your table

6954531
post	get
if it is third party web site you are trying to use then you can use httpurlconnection to make get post

6954571
hex	binary
how do i break up the lparam variable look at bit values printing it out in binary hex decimal

6954642
int	chars
you ll need the correct value but you should be able to refer to it by its int value chars 146

6954661
mouseup	mousedown
i have tried click mousedown mouseup etc

6954674
button	checkbox
when the button is clicked inside flash control it causes redirection or may be postback to the same page but the values typed the user in textbox and checkbox are no longer available

6954714
post	put	post	get	put	get
another way is to have an iframe which points to a https page that can make all kinds get post put etc of ajax calls to the server over https same domain as iframe is on https too

6954722
hide	show
i have a page configured to hide a fileupload control so when you click a button it show the file upload windows and after you choose the file it automatically submits it to the server

6954729
onchange	onkeydown
update here s an alternative using a custom validator that will allow you to enable the submit button on change when the textbox s text is valid - remember this is onchange not onkeydown up so the user must change focus tab off of the textbox before the validator will fire

6954743
wordpress	expressionengine
i have recently migrated my site from expressionengine to wordpress and i m getting a lot of 404 s from the old ee paginated pages

6954775
qapplication	qobject
the native c++ programming is based on raii while qt uses tree objects model mechanism that each qobject should has a parent except for some root objects like the singleton of qapplication and by this way qt manages objects and resources

6954780
superclass	subclassing
in your case if you want the superclass to have and the subclassing to have then i d expect that to work

6954780
superclass	subclassing
the superclass s annotation will be ignored because the annotation machinery will see the subclassing s annotation first and stop looking

6954803
x86	64bit
i know that there s no 64bit version of it and that i need to compile it against x86

6954819
versioning	upgrade
upgrade to the very latest versioning 15.01 which appears to have fixed this bug

6954825
versioning	upgrade
you can either upgrade the php versioning on your server or you replace the function call with something similar like

6954827
uilabel	uitextview
i am facing a problem placing a large text into multiple uitextview uilabel

6954827
uilabel	uitextview
assume three boxes are uitextview or uilabel

6954827
uilabel	nsstring	uilabel	uitextview
text will get from server as a complete one nsstring now challenge is to place the text in the boxes uitextview uilabel

6954850
try-catch	exception-handling
note that there is no exception-handling for this condition or application is not crashing without any try-catch

6954851
width	height
you can easily calculate the x and y coordinates of the vertices of a rectangle in 2d space given the center width and height by subtracting adding half the width height from the x y position of the center point

6954853
int	chars
i opened the file in binary mode read the data as chars and did a casting into int so i get the ascii codes

6954902
pull	push	versioning	upgrade
if you can upgrade check an early versioning of netbeans7.1 you would get a more complete git support including push pull operations

6954913
int	chars
i think you might have to use unsigned chars and unsigned int to get correct results

6954954
post	get
the editurl would get the input data from the and should post back the id of the new generated row

6954973
implements	extends
enums can not extends but they can implements so if you had multiple month types for different calendars you could do this to keep strong typing

6954997
onresume	onpause
a better approach would be registering a locationlistener in onresume and unregistering it in onpause through locationmanager.requestlocattionupdates and locationmanager.removeupdates respectfully

6955076
rss	feed
i have seen many deals website which does t provide api and rss feed but still this aggregators scraps data out of them

6955090
cgsize	cgrect
as said in use tex.contentsize as a cgsize or make a cgrect by cgrectmake 0 0 tex.contentsize.width tex.contentsize.height

6955105
client-side	server-side
just because the server-side language is javascript doesnt mean you have control over client-side events

6955147
rss	feed
if the site doesn t provide any api or rss feed it s still possible to extract data from it the old-school way by querying the pages where the info is and extracting the data from the returned html

6955147
lxml	beautifulsoup
in python this could be done using urllib2 or requests for querying pages and lxml or beautifulsoup to extract the data from the html

6955250
free	malloc
see i m using multiple time malloc free

6955250
free	malloc
all malloc are free

6955281
qnetworkrequest	qnetworkreply
even though checking the qnetworkreply in the finished slot with bool fromcache reply- attribute qnetworkrequest sourceisfromcacheattribute .tobool returned false

6955291
client-side	server-side
with linq - sql the metadata assigned is taken into consideration for both client-side as well as server-side validation

6955352
many-to-many	one-to-many
from there on it should be a simple case of determining if any 1-to-1 one-to-many and many-to-many relations exist between them

6955367
free	malloc
you could wrap malloc and free and count some basic statistics by yourself

6955389
express	node.js
try to look at node.js web middleware frameworks such as connect or express

6955397
hide	show	mouseleave	mouseenter
the menu show hide on mouseenter mouseleave with a toggle button to remove this functionality should a user find it annoying

6955538
chown	chmod
also check for chown and chmod

6955558
portrait	landscape
for different landscape and portrait design use view controllers methods such as

6955623
pop-up	dialog
if for example you pop-up a progress dialog with an animated gif in it when the user click a submit button the gif will freeze if you use the normal behaviour

6955644
textile	asciidoc
i have tried asciidoc no forumlae except for the latex filter but the output is extremely bad with latex output and textile markdown

6955675
for-loop	arrays
i make an application using apis..in that i have to send arrays of image to php api at a time..i don t want to use for-loop to call url again and again

6955700
width	height
i interpred this to mean that for example the width will be 5 8th of the width of the working area unless this results in the dialog which is taller than the height of the working area in which case it will use a wider width

6955734
firefox	safari
both the ways seems to work fine with ie firefox and safari browsers

6955783
int	chars
to get a consistent and correct result you can cast the value to unsigned chars before assigning to the int

6955838
subtract	add
i need to extract the time part of the value in to a separate variable and then add subtract time from it

6955866
width	height
set the contentsize of the scroll view to cgsizemake total width of buttons height of one button and enablescrolling to yes

6955886
width	height
i have pictures of constant width 100px but with variable height could be 200px 130px .

6955894
hide	show
then when an a is clicked read the id take the index off the end and show hide the textbox with the same index

6955921
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i m targetting ie 7+ firefox 3.6+ google-chrome and safari 4+

so you will have post - handling of data error - serializable of modelstate - redirect to get method to display the form - deserialization of tempdata back to modelstate - profit

django	web2py
both django and web2py are very good frameworks in my opinion

6960666
django	web2py
that being said having not used frameworks i would say to with web2py unless you need certain modules that only exist in the django world

6960666
django	web2py
i don t think there is anything that web2py can do that django can t except db migrations -- but i think you can make django do them with some 3rd party code or vice versa

6960666
django	web2py
django favors a explicit is better than implicit development methodology which requires to you import various modules and doesn t have all the magic of web2py

6960666
django	web2py
i m not saying this is in contrast to django but rather that web2py is very strong on this point

6960666
django	web2py
i also prefer web2py s templating language to django s as it allows pure python and does not require one to learn a separate templating language at all

6960666
internationalization	localization
i think both frameworks have decent internationalization localization features

6960666
django	web2py
django vs web2py for a beginner developer

6960799
hash-collision	key
the hashcode method on the other hand is used to optimize lookups but cannot be relied on to compare equality of two key as there is the possibility of hash-collision

6960799
hash-collision	key
in the event of hash-collision among key a single bucket will store two or more values for two different key and the bucket must be traversed sequentially to find the value matching the key which is the worst case

6960822
filesystems	ntfs
but it should give you some idea about the relative efficiencies of filesystems ntfs vs database mssql

6960845
google-chrome	firefox
in dev mode i can successfully open the app in firefox and google-chrome

google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in ie and firefox but not in google-chrome

i m building an app that breaks html into pages epub html actually and i need to know the position height and width of each block of text on the page so i can know whether to put it on this page or the next page

6961080

6961105
button	checkbox
for select boxes checkbox and radio button the event is fired immediately when the user makes a selection with the mouse but for the other element types the event is deferred until the element loses focus

6961128
folder	directory
you need to put the config file for ion auth into the main application s config folder not in the ion auth directory

6961129
width	height
thus it has an absolute width and height that can be retrieved by javascript

6961131
opera	firefox
domattrmodified works in ie9 opera firefox and not regrettably in all others as dr.molle suggests

6961131
google-chrome	safari
everything else - must resort to setinterval loop that checks if value changed this includes webkit browsers google-chrome and safari since they still don t have domattrmodified support so - you ll have to resort to loop check for those browsers

6961138
width	height
and added a sudo-hard coded height and width for the container as a variable

6961147

what setting do i put to make sure the entire transaction started by the mdb and any transactions called from it get rolled back and retry occurs

6961387

anyways the code for ie firefox and safari work fine but i have tried everything that i could think of with opera and it just will not see markers as an object

6961387
opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari
as you can see there are no errors reported in ie safari and firefox but opera is a different ball game

6961387
firefox	safari
some warnings in safari for the svgs returned by google and some css warnings in firefox but 0 errors

6961431

also since the error mentions the class domainobject which i assume is your global superclass i would try to make it implement serializable or isserializable too in addition to its subclassing

6961473
disk	ram
upgrade hardware faster disk faster cpu more ram

6961476
opera	firefox
then using a browser-based keybind in my case with opera although examples for firefox uzbl acrobat and conkeror are provided as well i was able to capture the following

6961512

i tend to lean towards the first option since coldfusion willi prepare the statement and execute it immediately as opposed to store the value locally and then having coldfusion prepare the sql statement

6961526
textarea	textbox
what is the correct value for the disabled attribute for a textbox or textarea

put	get
when i put both the .php and the .pem onto my android phone in the same folder and tried to run it with the same wifi connection i get the following error message

first off you ought to use a post request instead of a get because it s clear from your code that this request is supposed to change state on the server

6961642
width	height
do you mean the width height

6961661
button	checkbox
but it happens rather often that i click a button realize that i forget to check a checkbox and so i click it but to no avail

6961688
django	web2py
plus moving from a php mvc framework to web2py or even django would make things easier

6961691
mdpi	hdpi
following the 3 4 6 scale ratio rule it seems that if i have a button resource that s 100px wide for the mdpi density i should make another button for the ldpi density that s 75px and one for the hdpi density that s 150px

6961699
button	checkbox
when you open the dialog the checkbox do not take effect until you hit an update button if you click cancel or just close the window the changes you made get reverted and the dialog is set to its former state

the setter and getter have to remain as class methods and i do not want to have to call test.set_spam

it works as i d expect in firefox google-chrome ie8 ie9 but ie7 gives me undefined

6962650
width	height
in your situation it might be easiest to create a div with 100 width and height then set the snap selector using css selectors to that div then specifying a grid to snap to.

6962689
phong	shading
the shading model used by mma the so-called phong shading determines the pixel intensities based on a simple relationship between local surface orientation light source direction s camera direction and diffuse and specular properties of the surface

6962725
google-chrome	firefox
tested under firefox google-chrome and ie6 with extjs 3.4

6962748

i understand that different browsers are likely to have different ceiling values but what is a good rule of thumb for the maximum render-able css height width in a given browser

6962749
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
fyi the code above works in ie firefox google-chrome and safari on the internal network

6962816

6962841
width	height
this method returns the width and height of the string constrained to

6962888
free	malloc
2 provide your own malloc and free to make linker happy then repeat step 1

6962888
free	malloc
in the worst case if number of calls to malloc free is limited you can roll out your own version which will give the callers some preallocated memory - but hopefully this will not be neccessary

6962954
submit	submission
when your edit user form is submission it will automatically submit phone fields too

6962966
chown	chmod	chown	chgrp	chgrp	chmod
so i did chown chmod and chgrp to set these to be available to jenkins

6962990
children	parent
i was going down the path of adding a protected field to the parent class and making the event handlers virtual then when loading children set the parent field to reference the child s contained datagrid and override the event handlers as shells that just pass through to the base

6963008
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome firefox ie definitely can get the value though google-chrome will only tell you the filename with c fakepath prepended

6963013
xuggle	vlcj
apart from that you might want to give xuggle a try - it works on a much lower level than vlcj but this should give you much more control over what s happening and unlike jmf it s a good actively maintained project.

6963106
min	max
i ve tried various combinations of group by min date max date etc

6963172
google-chrome	safari
the html output uses to bold the word which is somewhat unfortunate it s in safari google-chrome but nonetheless does the job

6963208
slideup	slidedown
i d advice you to look specifically at the slideup and slidedown effects although special consideration must be taken about how the library modifies particular css values of the elements you wish to animate and how it affects the rest of the html

6963297
havok	physx
windows only at this point in time so physx havok are possibilities for the simulation but i would prefer a managed solution

so the issue here is that earlier the ajax request for the flag functionality on blogs message board portlets was post and after this update it changed to get

6963383
post	get
please help to us to understand what triggered this change from post to get and how to change is back to post

6963413
macports	homebrew
you can also use a separate package manager like homebrew or macports to install libraries and dependencies for gems which need to be compiled

6963458
versioning	upgrade
if you have a current software maintenance contract for your matlab it may well be that the easy thing to do is just upgrade to the next versioning of matlab since r2011a is out now unless there is some compelling reason why you must develop on r2010b

6963462
screens	tablet
i m trying to find a way to support both phone screens small normal large and tablet screens xlarge with one app on the android market

why does firefox and google-chrome replace the lf character with cr+lf during post

6963490
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the cycle plugin executes this well in firefox but in safari and google-chrome upon initially loading the page i do not observe the slideshow and only see a single image

6963498
groupbox	panel
now put this whole panel inside a groupbox

6963498
mousemove	mousedown	mousemove	mouseup	mouseup	mousedown
i think i have to handle the mousedown mouseup mousemove on the panel to set the autoscrollposition so that when someone touches the panel and drags it does it s scroll magic

6963507
pop-up	dialog
java applets if signed and set up properly can get access to the local filesystem if the user clicks allow on the pop-up dialog box

6963507
pop-up	dialog
flash and silverlight being built by intelligent beings do not allow you access to the local filesystem -- and if they did they would also have a dialog pop-up asking if the user trusts the web app

6963532
nsmenu	nspopupbutton
does nspopupbutton or nsmenu handle that somehow

6963538
ostream	istream
at this line on istream ostream

6963582
google-chrome	firefox
the more interesting question therefore is why it is that firefox and google-chrome

6963587
portrait	landscape
i use an if statement to detect when the orientation of a device changes and when it does a new view is displayed one portrait the other landscape

6963587
portrait	landscape
the only problem is if i rotate from portrait to landscape and the landscape view shows it has not rotated all of the way

6963596
visualvm	jstat
when i start jstat then visualvm sees a local jstat but when i double click on it it just seems to monitor that jstat process and not any other java process

6963603
lisp	scheme
this guy reckons that adding fexprs to lisp dramatically simplifies the implementation of the language in scheme

6963639
cos	sin
can someone explain how sin e cos ine can be used to get the end projection coordinates x y of a rotating object

6963647
hash	md5
the best way is to get some hash md5 and compare it

6963649
getter	setter
now firstly i don t see why a regular moose hash trait couldn t accept array refs for both the setter and getter

6963661
post	put
i m able to read the website with the code i put at the end of this post

6963673
zsh	tcsh
also i think csh tcsh may have such a feature natively and if tcsh has it then zsh will have it too and may have it anyway

6963678
x86	64bit
microsoft visual c++ 2010 redistributable package x86 probably what you need for 32-bit and 64bit os

6963700
int	chars
this code works nicely in linux32 where memset accepts 32-bit int s as second argument initializing element but it s not so for linux64 where and iirc in other platforms where memset accepts chars as its second argument

6963792
int	boolean
in this exercise we will represent sets as functions from int to boolean

6963796
ostream	istream
i think you should not alloc and init the istream and ostream variables

6963817
implements	extends
i m implements a semi-duplicate rails pipeline by refactoring an existing ruby class say a which extends activerecord to have a module say m with common functionality then to be mixed into two similar ar classes now shallow wrappers

6963817
class-method	eigenclass
hence we moved some of the original class-method of a into a s eigenclass defining them as

6963853
width	margin
i have a listbox with 20 items.if orientation is portait the margin of the grid must be 140 25 5 0 and width of stackpanel inside 320

6963853
width	margin
if orientation is landscape margin must be 350 25 5 0 and width of stackpanel is 450.how i can change it dinamically such as conversation view in wp7

6963898
uiview	subviews
i d venture to guess that it s an extension of uiimageview or even a uiview container that adds a subviews containing the check mark when it detects a tap

6963931
children	parent
sometimes i process a parent tag that contains children that i want to prevent from being processed in a later recursion

6963931
children	parent
i then tried this which works in that it removes the parent and its children but doesn t result in any subsequent siblings of the parent from being skipped affected as well

6964005
post	get
you can t redirect using existing post or files data only get the url query string

6964013
int	chars
4 bytes for int and 1 byte for a chars

6964054
width	margin
because left and right column width is 160 px they have a left and right margin of 10-10px thats extra 20 px

6964099
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
for this you have a few options - for pre-implemented methods you could try the java serializable objectoutputstream objectinputstream or the xmlencoder xmldecoder

6964099
decoder	encoder
you might also look into other xml or json libraries or even writing your own encoder decoder if the events are simple enough

6964103
int	boolean
somehow we ve got to produce a boolean when all we have to work with are sets a b of type and int equality

6964103
int	boolean
from these primitives the only way to get a boolean value is to start with int values

6964134
fadein	hide
jquery functions such as hide or fadein or other transformation functions take an optional callback parameter to accomplish this

6964140
post	get
i have some post here with the trivial line of code to get it

6964150
hide	show
is provided here - show hide tab bar

6964202

pdo prepare returns a pdostatement object which has the execute method

6964213

viewdidappear	viewwillappear
viewwillappear and viewdidappear will be called

6964238
google-chrome	firefox

6964275
vim	emacs
i want to draw stuff either on emacs or vim or even in the terminal directly

6964284
button	checkbox
the idea is simple since normal input fields including radio button checkbox textareas etc can only be styled to a small degree they have to be hidden and their visual appearance replaced with similar working new fully customizable constructs

6964290
post	get
in my controller action method for the post i can get the values of the dropdowns like this

6964310
range	min	range	max	min	max
you could try using a lookup table to get rid of the calculation of s since min and max can only range from 0 to 255

6964317
hide	show
you could use a js library such as jquery to hide show elements on a page

6964325
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
note this works for firefox google-chrome and safari but not ie

6964339
apache	lighttpd
this only happens in lighttpd not apache or anything else

6964339
post	get
the code actually runs but i don t get the response back in ajax or via a regular post

6964343
portrait	landscape
when i change the attribute to landscape the pages will be landscape just from second page and the first page is always portrait

6964344

if you can t change the packaging type of the static project from jar to war you may want to use something like embedded-resources

6966909
metaclass	subclassing
one difference is that by defining a metaclass __call__ method you are demanding that it gets called before any of the class s or subclassing s __new__ methods get an opportunity to be called

6966909
metaclass	subclassing
in contrast if you define foo.__new__ without a metaclass you allow subclassing to override foo.__new__

6966913
getter	setter
i know if we use synthesize compiler create the getter and setter on base of our property define in the hadder file..but if we want to create our own getter and setter what will we do

6966913
getter	setter
if we create our own getter and setter that perform faster or synthesize getter and setter preform faster and why

6966924
post	get
so instead i tried to use wmi code taken from another post on here but here i get an privilege not held error when trying to call invokemethod

6966927

maven	pom.xml
i got this part figured out that i need to add gwt-dev.jar to maven pom.xml file but now when i run my test i get this error

6966942

xslt	xquery
normally you just need a transformation from the documents into another form for this many languages provide an interface to xslt and xquery

it was working with getelementbyid but why all of a sudden it does not work with getelementsbytagname

6967335
width	height
note that you might want to add width and height values too but not height to the #content of course

6967401
getter	setter
the best way is to use synthesize which will create a getter and a setter to with respect to the properties you wrote in your property nonatomic retain not threadsafe but fast getter and setter and a retaining and also releasing setter

6967403
setinterval	settimeout
the settimeout setinterval callback is executed in a different context than your object and when it s executed the this keyword does not refer to your object

6967403
setinterval	settimeout
the right way to pass variables to a cabback functin for settimeout setinterval is something like

6967436
opera	firefox
the differences are on all browsers firefox ie opera

6967476
button	checkbox
you must notice that when a custom listview contains focusable elements such as button or checkbox the method onlistitemclick may not work i think it s the expected behaviour

6967480
int	chars
if the string does not contain any of the chars . e or e and the numeric value fits into int type limits as defined by php_int_max the string will be evaluated as an int

6967489

i noticed that if i prepare a multi-insert statement and execute it into mysql via pdo and then request the last_insert_id i get the first id of the multiple inserted rows not the last one

6967539
superclass	subclassing
and superclass has three subclassing is there any way within mymethod i can get the class name of the subclassing which was passed in

6967548
superclass	subclassing
whatever you want to do in mymethod consider having a method for it in superclass provide a meaningful default implementation or make it abstract to force subclassing to implement the method and call this method on s in your method

6967585
int	boolean
with the boolean on the left implicitly converted to an int

6967611

6967647
int	chars
where all names with even number of chars get 2 null chars to make it even and then the next two bytes store a short int

6967675
int	boolean
with primitive types such as boolean and int the actual value is passed to the panel and not a reference and so changing these values in the panel wont affect the rest of the program

6967675
int	boolean
another solution would be to encapsulate all the int and boolean types in a object but i don t really want to do this as it would mean a lot of rewriting of code in the main program

6967704
put	get
you will then need to use a for-loop to get the html of all the images or put an id on the image and specify it only in the jquery selector

6967710
google-chrome	firefox
i like firebug for firefox or ctrl-shift-i in google-chrome

6967714

6967730

6967767
yourkit	jprofiler
jprofiler is my favorite but yourkit is good as well

6967774
webrat	cucumber
as you can see webrat is not so updated anymore so yes you might be better off with integration testing with cucumber + capybara

6967804
int	boolean
with primitive types such as boolean and int the actual value

6967869
int	chars
since int is normally wider than chars truncates the value of int being assigned

6967875
phpmyadmin	heidisql
i would recommend you scrap phpmyadmin for heidisql though

6967951
width	height
x 32 y 32 width -32 height -32

6967951
width	height
this will make the rectangle x 0 y 0 width 32 height 32

6967954
hash	salt
the server stores salt password hash which will be different from sha1 password

6967965
memcpy	strcpy
this may be because of a careless memcpy strcpy overwriting the stack of newclient

6967965
free	malloc
on another note generally it is recommended that both malloc and free are done in the same thread

6968024
button	checkbox
your best bet is to wrap your checkbox input tag in span obtain a reference to that span and replace the innerhtml with a new button element with important attributes copied over

6968300
fadein	fadeout
what you need to use is the fadein and fadeout callback property

6968304
fadein	fadeout	fadein	hide	hide	fadeout
the easiest way to do this is to hide the currently showing gallery rather than fadeout and then fadein the newly selected gallery

6968315
google-chrome	firefox
between google-chrome that returns and firefox that returns

6968370
google-chrome	firefox
this is the same in firefox and in google-chrome

here i create two variables one for the screen height and the other for the width

6969504

so go back to your principal class game1.cs and in the update methode update the value of theses variables with the screen height and screen width like this

6969705
int	chars
then suppose you had 64 chars fields and 64 int fields if you put the chars fields first then all fields of both types can be addressed using the best instructions whereas if you put the int fields first then the chars fields that aren t 4-aligned will just have to be accessed differently perhaps by loading a constant into a register rather than with an immediate value because they re outside the 256-byte limit

inherited	subclassing
my first intuition is that since in the first piece of code we are assigning a foo reference to bar then it means the change will also apply to foo while on the second code it probably inherited from foo and therefore the change on bar s subclassing attribute won

6970245
simplecursoradapter	spinner
but i am also using a custom simplecursoradapter to populate the spinner and because of that i also need to query the _id column

6970264
inherited	properties
creates a new object that inherited from foo and since it s a different object when you assign the properties

6970899

stdout	stderr
basically when the main program forks it should create new pipe s that will become the child process stdout and stderr

6971178
stdout	stderr
then the main program will need to read from its end of all the new pipes and potentially buffer the information so that the main process can send the data from children to its own stdout stderr in a specific order - all of the first child s output then all of the second child s output then all of the next child s output etc

6971178
switching	screens
the other alternative is to have a currently selected child which can become a lot more complex especially if there s an end-user who needs to be able to see the output of the selected child as that d mean implementing some way of switching between currently being displayed children - when the user selects a different child clear the screens and display that child s backlog

6973456

it works as expected in anything but ie 8 but why would you want to make every properties inherited

6973456
inherited	properties
is it ok to use inherited value for all non-inherited css properties

6973456
inherited	properties
you can do so for a specific properties if you really want an element to inherited that style from its parent but it doesn t make sense for most designs in general to do it for every single properties unless your design is specifically about outlining every single rectangle with a thick red border

6973456
inherited	properties
if the spec lists inherited as a valid value for that properties whether it s non-inherited or not which means it isn t inherited by default then it s technically supposed to work

it does everything on ieee-754 double and reduces the result modulo 2 32 before bitwise operations which in most cases simulates int arithmetic

6973843
multiplying	multiplication
however this does not work for multiplication the true result of a multiplying say 0x10000001 0x0fffffff will be too long for the mantissa of a double so the low-order bits will be lost if the specification is followed to the letter

however the generated avm2 bytecode just contains a plain mul instruction with no direct indication that it is supposed to produce an integer result rather than a floating-point one

in regards to python optimization in addition to using pypy for pretty impressive speed-ups with zero change to your code you could use pypy s translation toolchain to compile an rpython-compliant version or cpython to build an extension module both of which are faster than the c version in my testing with the cpython module nearly twice as fast

width and height of a square cannot be changed independently from one another and that wouldn t be meaningful in the first place

6976423
width	height
the problem with this approach is that while the invariant correctly states width and height don t have to be equal but they can be it is ineffectual 1 because it is a tautology and 2 because it is less restrictive than the invariant in the derived class square

6976423
width	height
this will forbid the derived class square from simply updating height to width whenever width is changed and vice versa it won t stop me per se from deriving a square class from rectangle

client-side	server-side
you re using a server-side relative path notation with the character which means nothing client-side

6976510

if you want to go down this path then you are far better off either defining a custom abstract-class that all of your containers will subclass that can provide the binding logic to the class behind it

6976648
ubuntu	debian
edit just as an alternative if you can get access to another machine running the same version architecture of ubuntu debian you might be able to download the numpy source tarball compile with python setup.py build and then just copy everything in directory_where_you_extracted_the_tarball build numpy lib.os-arch-pythonversion on my system it is lib.linux-x86_64-2.6 to a directory of your choice on the target machine

6977421
width	height
since the closures defined by getwidth and getheight include the width and height parameters the parameters are still usable from the methods

6977421
width	height
therefore width and height are now private to rectangle and accessible only via the provided accessor methods

6985836
union	distinct
just union will perform another distinct on the result which is slower

6985836
union	distinct
but it is important to know that some operations slow down the query like using or in a join which you do using distinct when it s not needed and using union where you can use union all

versioning	upgrade
please upgrade to 0.8.3 out today and verify it s still present in that versioning then you can file a ticket at

6985935
int	chars
you can assign a chars variable to an int one because the compiler applies a broadening conversion

6985935
int	chars
the basis being that an int is larger than a chars and as such there is no chance of loss of information in the conversion

6985935
int	chars
if you tried to assign your int to your chars though you would notice the compiler rejects your code until you put in a specific typecast

6985935
superclass	subclassing
note that at no time can you convert objects that aren t related to each other by superclass subclassing hierarchy

6985935
int	chars
for primitive arrays there is no broadening conversion done on the array elements even in cases where you think that it might make sense ie chars to int or byte to chars etc

6985935
int	double
you can not cast a double to an int or vice-versa they are completely different classes from the point of view of the compiler as different as string and float would be for example

http-get	http-post
what is the difference between a http-get and http-post and why is http-post weaker in terms of security

6986282
int	double
it seems that you cannot use a double which is a floating point type as a representation of an address in memory which is inherently an int value

put	get
i tried to put together a data explorer query to find out but couldn t get it to work

6986493
uilabel	nsstring
the code snippet you show is correct anyway my guess is that you have very possibly a memory problem that makes your uilabel instance to be released at some point before layoutsubviews is executed then that memory is reused by an nsstring so you get the error there

6986529
post	get
the point is that if i do a normal get or by using a childaction inside a view i have those two set when getcontrollertype is called but if i do a post ajax call with contenttype application json

6986608
sudo	chgrp
the very best way would probably be to chgrp usr local to some special group and sudo to a special user in that group that can write to that directory but not do other random sudo stuff

6986622
width	height
for your scenario i would probably consider a solution where the handler takes in height width parameters resizes the image and stores it for reuse

6986635
width	height
afterwards the scaled down height will be available in and the scaled down width will be available in

6986655
width	height
i need to get a navigation to expand the width and then expand the height and then reversed for the reverse animation

the script then just iterates through a separate list of objects and makes them children of this parent object

6988490
children	parent
the created children even inherit certain things from the parent object

6988490

so i created additional textview in list_item.xml and made it invisible by setting its width and height to 0px

6988645
width	height
i ve created a simple view that displays buttons with the same width and height and they match the screen width

6988753

6989073
getter	setter
that will create a getter method avar a setter method setavar and an instance variable named _thevariablename which you can use for memory management purposes

6989073
getter	setter
however i don t know if dynamic will do the same and if implementing your own setter and getter i think you need the declaration.

6989081
des	aes
its security depends on the actual encryption algorithm used des triple-des aes etc. on the size of its key and on the block chaining type that you choose

6989133

post	get
i implemented type converters to convert object ids submitted in post get request to business objects.type converters look up entities in the database by ids and rebuild business from those

6989184

i need to add the gdata_calendar.php for the new site into the cron jobs and it is working now

6989215
superclass	subclassing
i guess in other words i am trying to extend a superclass that then propagates to subclassing

6989306
width	column-count
each column gets a fixed width and the column-count defaults to auto which means that the browser decides how many columns there are

6989320
jobs	cron
why not use a mechanism similar to apache cron jobs

6989407
post	get
if you wanted to do something fast and simple you can use the jquery get or post call to acheive the disired result

6989407
post	get
the get and the post both have a call-back function which can be used to accept the result of loading your php page and then you can determine how to display it

6989554
google-chrome	firefox
the way i have it set up works fine in google-chrome and firefox but fails in ie

6989555
public	protected
the alternative would be to break encapsulation -- how would you make a proper equals method for example that didn t require access to another instance s fields without making those fields protected or even public or requiring getters for data that should only be available inside the class

6989577
google-chrome	firefox
cleared the browser cache and tried both google-chrome and firefox

6989614
vim	geany	vim	emacs	vim	notepad++	geany	notepad++
i would actually just recommend a lightweight editor such as notepad++ or vim emacs but it seems that your project may have grown too big for this so geany would be my choice

6989635
bluetooth	usb
i would suggest going bluetooth but if usb is not fast enough for you guess that s not an option either

6989646
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome this fires other events in jquery in ie you

maven can t be compared with ant as in maven vs ant maven is more than a build script than ant is

6989690
maven	cargo
there are many things that can be achieved using maven through plugins such as maven cargo plugin which simplifies deployment to application servers

6989697
min	max
i did not want to use if statements because min and max functions are available

6989697
min	max	minimum	max
but it takes some mental energy to process that logic applying min to maximum and max to minimum .

6989723
put	get
i want get this data and put into table or update the table with these data

6989769
powerpc	i386

6989847
jgit	egit
i use eclipse indigo and windows 7 and plugin egit jgit for eclipse

6989848
hide	show
edit might have been a width change rather than a hide show

6989880
width	height
edit also you are adding the listview above the tablelayout called details which has its height and width set to fill_parent so you may not see the listview if the tablelayout is taking up the whole screen

6989893
children	parent
as a general case how do we set up two models so multiple associations between them stay separate and so the parent model can access each set of children independently

6989902
int	boolean
i have a variable that can either be boolean false or an int including 0

6989973
getter	setter
best practice in java and c# has long been to use getter setter or properties to access fields

6989990
min	max
write it like this and let the min and max value of the updown control handle it for you

6990086
width	height
to go with the technique of screen width height this is from mozilla docs

6990092
getter	setter
back to your question since jit there is not great improvement in using public fields as opposed to getter setter and since ides have automatic getter and setter generation there is no real programmer overhead in using getter and setter

6990092
getter	setter
in years of java programming i ve used public fields only a couple of times and always ended up converting them to getter setter pairs

6990151
hide	show

i personally use stl with custom memory allocator that again use my own memory manager so that i can keep track of the memory used by the stl containers strings i use

6998515
allocator	stl
this was a great resource to get me started with custom memory allocator for stl

6998515
allocator	stl
i also remember that ogre3d has some custom allocator for the stl containers which could be a great example to get you started

it s less secure than if you just use crypt the way it was designed with the password as the first argument and the salt as the second

6999637
crypt	md5	crypt	salt	salt	md5
if your system uses an md5 crypt then you ve just limited the salt space to 12 characters so you re truncating the space of users passwords to twelve characters

6999637
crypt	salt
worse still my system requires me to use a prefix on the salt in order to specify my crypt or else i get old school crypt meaning you have two characters for the salt

6999637
crypt	salt
plus there s no point in even running crypt at this point you might as well just store their two character password since the salt is prefixed to the ciphertext so that subsequent calls to crypt can pass the same salt

6999637
crypt	salt
what you want to do is the industry standard use a strong crypt pass the password as the first argument and random salt data in as the second argument and make sure that you re passing the maximum allowable number of bytes in for the salt

7001814
installation	upgrade
well assuming this is a new installation and not an upgrade i am guessing that your permalink structure is messed up

7001823
webclient	webrequest	webclient	httpwebrequest
httpwebrequest doesn t support socks proxies so after a long research i ve determined that the best way to add socks support for webrequest and webclient without reinventing the wheel like sockshttpwebrequest does was to create a temporary http proxy which forwards any incoming request to the socks proxy

i would like to know what is the best way to do what iphone calculator does as far as switching view from portrait to landscape

7002102
portrait	landscape
to me it looks that the portrait ui is in a view that goes directly with resizing into a subview on the right side of the landscape view

7002102
portrait	landscape
if this is a reasonable assumption of what is going on i would like to know how to rotate the portrait xib file to become the right side of a subview in the landscape and furthermore add more stuff to the left side subview of landscape ui

7002107
width	height
each element of the list array is a reference to a hash with keys width and height

i also can t see a way around multiple inherited if i wanted to create a different subclassing for each schema

7002198
hide	show
the thing is if the user already logged in clicks on the home button it will show homeview and i need to hide the login button and show a exit button

7002230

i do not want to send post get request only do the validation

7002246
portrait	landscape
you can have two different layout xmls one for portrait and one for landscape

7002251
wordpress	joomla
the wordpress codex gives some plugins that could help you importing from joomla to wordpress

7002267
maven	pom.xml
in order to convert a maven project to an eclipse project your project must first be a maven project which requires a pom.xml to exist

7002271
button	right-align
you can subclass button to introduce a new dependency property for the right-align text you will be stuck with the content property though you could create two new properties and throw an exception if content is set though

7002339
mouse	keyboard
another idea would be to change the lufa installation on the arduino reconfiguring it to one of the many other modes supported by the lufa project so that it looks like something an unmodified honeycomb tablet already knows how to talk to such as a mass storage drive or a keyboard or a mouse etc

7002359
post	get
the other methods post load and get are just shorthand ways of invoking the ajax method so it s a matter of style convention

7002380
tabcontrol	tabitem
i m not positive if the ribbon tabs are the same as a tabcontrol tabs but a tabcontrol destorys it s tabitem when they re not visible

7002402

7002402
maven	m2e
maybe redeploy by eclipse not maven m2e

7002445
folder	directory
in iis i enabled the project as an application and set this new project folder as a virtual directory in all the projects that will be using it and enabled each virtual directory as an application

7002476
post	get
if i had to give a small analogy of get post and ajax its like you would be able to buy yourself a completed car with a friendly interface pedals steering wheel etc. so you don t have to do it all yourself

7002478
width	height
width or height cannot exceed gl_max_texture_size

7002541
post	get
analogy updated to compare an all-in-one tool vs multiple specialized tools which more accurately reflects the comparison of ajax vs get post and load

7002580
x86	64bit
if it s set to x86 that might cause that error if your system is 64bit

7002689
margin	height
oh also - you might want to just give the content div a margin bottom of the height of the footer that should put the footer always at the bottom it s getting cut off for me in mac safari and also allow enough of a gap beneath the content if it goes beneath the footer

7002730
caliburn.micro	mef
i have a silverlight client that uses caliburn.micro and a mef container with a loadcatalog class to keep everything loosely coupled in an mvvm way

7002813
pop-up	dialog
do you want to have the listview pop-up as a dialog box or a new activity

7002813
pop-up	dialog
if it is a pop-up dialog instead of creating a new intent in the onclick view view you would have to inflate the listview layout from another layout xml file create the adapter then set the listview to that adapter

7002830
post	get
is it possible your browser is converting the post to a get request

7002832

from eclipse you can export the offending library in the android project and it ll get put on the classpath of the test project

7003021
direct3d	directdraw	direct3d	gdi	gdi	directdraw
more specifically a java2d rendering pipeline seems to connect cross-platform java code to native graphics libraries opengl x11 direct3d directdraw gdi that may support hardware acceleration

7003021
direct3d	directdraw	direct3d	gdi	gdi	directdraw
by default when java2d is used on a windows system both this direct3d pipeline and a directdraw gdi pipeline are enabled by default i assume they are each being used for different things

7003021
direct3d	directdraw	direct3d	gdi	gdi	directdraw
i think this disables direct3d but not directdraw which can be disabled with and then all operations will be performed with gdi but this doesn t noticeably improve initialization time

7003032
strsplit	substr
my guess is this is a tab-delimited file with a known constant number of columns in which case you could use strsplit to separate the substr

7003056
sorting	grouping	sorting	filtering	filtering	grouping
i currently have both sorting and filtering working but the grouping settings is giving me trouble

7003058
pull	push

nsurlrequest	nsmutableurlrequest
you should be able to intercept the nsurlrequest cast it to a nsmutableurlrequest then change the url as follows

7003223

make a settings folder in the same directory as manage.py

7003244
ssl	https
my site doesn t have ssl yet but the authorize.net makes a secure https post so i use the dpm method to accept payments

7003250
dbcontext	objectcontext
you must either include foreign keys to your entities so they will be tracked as normal values or you must convert your dbcontext to objectcontext and use more powerful and more cumbersome objectstatemanager where you can get instances of objectstateentry for both entities and relations

7003250
dbcontext	objectcontext
to convert dbcontext to objectcontext use

7003269
express	node.js
is there anyway i can setup express in node.js so it can more than one static folder

7003278
int	chars
i have a piece of shared memory that contains a chars string and an int between two processes

7003301
hash	salt
if the two hash are the same then no salt was used and you probably have a simple hash of the password

7003301
hash	md5
if not then try the md5 hash of simple combinations of the username and password

7003301
put	get
if it gets to that it might be easier to just put a network sniffer onto your network where it hits the old system so you can read your users passwords before they get hashed

7003329
uninstall	downgrade
in order to downgrade from crystal reports â œ11â to â œ10â i had uninstall all related crystal report products removed the projectâ s references

7003343
jcheckbox	jradiobutton
i wonder if you code would be better with a toggle type of button such as a jtogglebutton or one of its children jradiobutton or jcheckbox

7003344
post	get
there is a ubiquitous com object called msxml2.xmlhttp that can do get and post requests and return you the results

7003356
elementtree	beautifulsoup
you could try to use elementtree if your source is valid xml otherwise look for beautifulsoup

7003379
sysv	systemd
on some sysv systemd eagain

7003405
getter	setter
in order to ensure that the type of the variables is correct i wrap most of the attributes in my classes via getter setter

7003405
getter	setter
i was wondering if it s a good idea to put do that permission checking in the getter setter well.

7003405
getter	setter
also i ve read that properties should ideally be kept simple and that is not a great practice start loading the getter setter with code that can cause a lot of side effects some people say that is difficult to track errors when the code just reads myduck.age 512

7003411
implements	extends
all i really know is that i should create a class that extends delegatingreverseengineeringstrategy and implements tabletometaattribute to add the base to the name of my base classes

7003441
hash	salt
also the salt is stored next to the password hash

7003441
hash	salt
therefore it appears someone would need to get my table with hash s and if they did they could also get the salt and the rest of my code and do what they wanted with my site in general

7003469
ubuntu	linux
i ve moved suse linux code to ubuntu and windows with simple recompiles

7003469
gentoo	ubuntu
it started on an old version of slackware 32-bit got moved to gentoo 32 and 64-bit and ubuntu 32 and 64-bit

7003476
hash	salt
most attacks involve generating hash for common passwords so for reasonably complicated passwords it becomes harder especially with salt some people use usernames as salt others use randomly generated numbers

7003476
hash	salt
you should also never store the actual password on the server you only store the hash and maybe the salt if you don t already know it

7003486
inherited	properties
if you read a properties from an object that does not have that properties javascript will search the objects prototype chain that is all the objects that inherited from each other for that properties and returns it if found

7003486
inherited	properties
if an oject has a properties itself it s prototype chain will not be searched so you can override an objects inherited properties by setting the porperty on the objects self

7003509
put	get
before i put boolean it actually went to second activity but i couldn t get data so well

i m writing in a language similar to visual basic but without most of the object oriented stuff like classes and inheritance and the drawing capabilities are drawline and drawrect and that is it but it can scale and rotate a completed bitmap object so when i fill the polygon it will be one dot at a time in a for-loop or a while loops however i can convert the bitmap to a byte arrays if that makes any difference might be faster

free	malloc
the interesting thing about malloc and free is that they don t actually change the memory they give you -- they just change how it s thought of

7007214
free	malloc	free	calloc	calloc	malloc
the os often zeroes out unused memory in the background to make calls to calloc faster but free only tells the operating system i m done with this memory do whatever you need to with it. the os typically updates some housekeeping data to indicate that the block of memory is no longer owned by a process so that a later call to malloc can use it if it s needed

on second thoughts an origin a height a width and a normal vector won t really cut it since you don t have a sense of up as you do in 2d

7007270

thinking about it reveals that the width and the height in 2d are actually vectors two except that their direction is implied width is the length of a vector in x direction height is the length of a vector in y direction

7007270
width	height
the normal vector is not necessary anymore since it is can be calculated by the vectorial product of width x height

i need to know how to access google-chrome pdf rendering capability from javascript in google-chrome but also firefox etc now i start with google-chrome

7008709

7008938
redmine	trac
but redmine has some serious drawbacks over trac

7008938
ubuntu	debian
you cannot use debian ubuntu package system for production use

7008938
redmine	trac
administration is not easy considering making a backup in trac this is a one-liner in redmine you have to backup configuration attached files and database content all separately

7008938
bazaar	git	bazaar	trac	bazaar	perforce
version control system i think installing a plugin is not that hard and for almost every vcs there is a plugin for trac git perforce mercurial darcs monotone subversion bazaar

7008938
bibtex	latex	redmine	trac
plugins i would argue trac and trac-hacks have much more plugins than redmine so integration of doxygen jenkins latex bibtex etc

7008938
redmine	trac
redmine s installation process is not easy but trac installation became also more complex these days so manual database creation etc

7008938
redmine	trac
this happend to me more than a dozen times for redmine but also sometimes for trac

7009251
hash	md5
in java you are doing a double md5 hash

7009256
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
padding margin and borders are not counted in the height and width so 100 height or width on an element with 10px padding on each side will actually take up 100 plus 20 pixels

7009256
box-sizing	border-box
the way around this is to use the css box-sizing border-box

inherited	subclassing
since the initialiser of the subclassing is inherited from mapping while the update method is overridden this will cause an error when run

7009450
memcpy	memset
some compilers are putting implicitly the built-in memset or memcpy for such things

7009475
children	parent
i want to create a function that deletes all the children of the parent without selecting them all first

7009508
int	chars
the error has to do with mixing unsigned int of 8 bits with chars that are signed if you use just chars

7009566
memset	memcmp	memcpy	memmove	memcpy	memset	memcpy	memcmp	memmove	memset	memmove	memcmp
the compiler may generate calls to memcmp memset memcpy and memmove

google-chrome	firefox
this is getting fired if i am working with ie but not with google-chrome or firefox 4 but working fine in firefox 3.6.3

7009615

the net effect is that the data in modelstate will override anything you put into the model that is passed to the view in your post action

7009658
folder	directory
i know you mentioned you set the permission to 777 but is that for the uploads directory or the entire folder that the application is in

7009713
folder	directory
i tried specifying different folder within directory directorymatch etc directives but couldn t get it working

7009721
for-loop	loops
edit shift doesn t work in a for-loop because all the lines within the parens are interpreted at the same time for all iterations but you can roll your own loops

7009728
coalesce	isnull
interestingly this is one of the few places where you can t use coalesce instead of isnull

7009748

you should create this array before passing it to max and min

7010004
ubuntu	debian
i ve created some applications using pygtk and thought they had been ok until i executed them in an environment with accessibility enabled gnome on ubuntu and openbox on debian

7010010
width	height
1 sometimes it dosn t trigger sometimes before and some times after the browser has changes width + height

7010015
google-chrome	firefox
actually neither should return true and indeed they don t in firefox or google-chrome untested in other browsers

7010032
hide	show
and hook the click events to show hide the lists

7010037
apache	nginx
how can i configure an apache or nginx server to send etag headers using an algorithm of my choosing not involving inode mtime or size

7010097
min	max
you should thus transform the args array of string s into an array of int s and pass this new array of int s to your min and max methods

7010185
int	chars
restrict chars and allow only int in textbox using javascript

7010217
awt	swing
don t mix swing jscrollpane and awt canvas

7010230
width	height
am assuming that the images are of same height and width .

7010268
button	checkbox
for example the checked property of a checkbox or radio button does not correspond to any attribute

7010321
width	height
1 img2- height img2- width calculate as constant before loop

7010333
hide	show
now the issue is when i click touch on the checkbox the errormsg show for a while and then it also hide it immediately since target is not the errormsg

7010370
hide	show
for multiple lists eack with it s own show hide merge those 2 spans and put a control after each list like so

7010376
equals	gethashcode
edit the equals and gethashcode methods is overriden

7010395
getter	setter
however you could write a wrapper class with getter setter methods to do what you need which could be called from arbitrary threads inside a dispatch block

7010398
google-chrome	safari
intel mac os x 10_6_7 applewebkit 535.1 khtml like gecko google-chrome 13.0.782.107 safari 535.1

7010411
post	get
i m making the assumption that you re trying to get that url thumbnail image that certain blog post and google provide

7010444
equals	gethashcode
it s related to the equals and gethashcode

7010444
equals	gethashcode
missing overrides of equals and gethashcode is one of multiple thing which can cause this

7010451
firefox	safari
i have set up this code - and it s working fine on firefox and ie - but it s not working at all in safari - does anyone have any ideas why this isn t working

7010459

7010515
addclass	removeclass
is there any way i could store the post ids in variables and then pass that variables to the jquery addclass removeclass function

7010532
jsf	jspx
if upgrading to jsf 2.1 where jspx is been supported is not an option then you need to rename your .jspx files to .xhtml and remove the now superfluous xmlns jsp taglib declaration

7010537
getter	setter
ef only wraps it and wrapper properties still call base setter and getter

7010543
put	get
whereas i can see the benefit of removing exception handling code where it s just been put in thoughtlessly i would consider carefully what benefit you get by pushing responsibility for handling an exception of this kind higher up in the call chain

7010562
getter	setter
objective c is somewhat similar to c# in that it provides you with easy ways to generate getter s and setter for your class properties

7010562
getter	setter
those synthesize keywords in your implementation file create getter and setter methods for you for your properties

7010562
getter	setter
your first synthesize looks good it will create a getter and setter for simpleproperty backed by the instance variable of the same name

7010562
getter	setter
it will create a getter and setter for propertywithunderscoreivar backed by the instance variable _propertywithunderscoreivar which you never declared

7010584
opencv	emgucv
i want to develop a people counting system using opencv or emgucv

7010585

7010610
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
it works perfectly in google-chrome opera ie8 ie9 only firefox is a problem

7010613
getter	setter
in order to access the getter setter methods you should use self or any instance

7010633
equals	gethashcode
the problem was the equals and gethashcode methods were not implimented for the class

7010642
rss	feed
i want to create a service that would listen to few rss feed and parse new feed to json for further use

7010652
jar	war
as user474249 commented you could use the maven archetype plugin to generate a folder structure based on your project type jar war etc

7010704
inherited	properties
if you loop over it like that for..in you ll get all properties which are directly on the object and inherited via the prototype chain

7010707
inherited	properties
using a for...in construct will also iterate all properties including all properties inherited through the prototype chain which is why you get all the properties of the object alerted as well as the set of matched li elements

7010714
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome there s exactly the same issue while in firefox the kerning is correct for printing too

7010750
int	double
i pretty much always use the int double etc.parse methods when i m certain it s a number

7010786

first i would find all the dates in your range that have one or mor associated tasks and put themn in a dictionary in order to be able to get them knowing the date then i would create temptask

7010961
rss	feed
the only way to observe rss feed changes is to poll the feed by requesting it over a set interval of time

7011011
ienumerable	ienumerator
ienumerable or ienumerator

7011033
intersect	contains
compilation error is no definition found for intersect contains

the admin app is imported to the collected directory within an admin folder however my app static data gets imported directly into the main directory thus overwriting other apps if duplicate files are found

7011058

you do not need to set its width or height nor should you set it grid.row or column

7011098
teamcity	partcover
teamcity 6.5.3 must support partcover 4.0.11129

7011128

now on calling the modal popup from the jsp i am specifying its width and height but i want that the end popup should have a height just sufficient to hold the table the table height may differ if more rows may get fetched

7011148
uiview	subviews
to allow for flexible layouts i wanted to create a subclass uiview that overrides layoutsubviews to layout all of its subviews under each other automagically and would continue to do this every time one of its subviews got resized

7011148
uiview	subviews
however the only way that i can think of to let the superview know that it should call layoutsubviews is by overriding that method in each of its subviews something that i would like to try and avoid i want people to be able to add arbitrary uiview to the superview and have this taken care of

7011162
superclass	subclassing
define abstract superclass class absatractstate put there code of methods that common for all states and all classes that represents real states must been subclassing from it

7011175
for-loop	arrays
in php you can just do a for-loop over since it will return an arrays of the fields

7011180
button	checkbox
a button similar to a checkbox except that only one item in a group can be selected

7011206
disk	ram
i have plenty of ram and am reasonably sure the page faults are not disk io related

7011229
width	height	portrait	landscape
because the width and height of the webview is not the same in portrait and landscape mode i use a percent to represent the user scroll position

7011277
ienumerable	icollection
basically you are asking the following if the type i tried to resolve isn t found return another type that can be converted to it if you try to resolve ienumerable return a type that is registered for icollection

post	get
if i refresh the page it then renders correctly so i ve worked around this temporarily by doing a redirecttoaction to force an get to the view instead of just returning the view from the post but would like to know what s going wrong and how i can fix this properly

7011443
post	get
an example of this is implementing the post redirect get pattern

7011485
spaces	delimiter
hey and now where is the part about single spaces delimiter

7011519
openmpi	mpich
but i installed mpich 2 and not openmpi

7011629
width	height
1 sometimes it dosn t trigger sometimes before and some times after the browser has changes width + height

7011672
implements	extends
you extends org.eclipse.core.runtime.jobs.job and implements run to define a job

7011681
post	get
which means that viewstate alone will not help any time you get the page - not post - it will have a new viewstate

7011682
hide	show
try to show the element and hide it after you get the height

7011695
getter	setter
best practice in java and c# has long been to use getter setter or properties to access fields

7011695
getter	setter
i think that is the first problem the idea that if you have a getter you must also have a setter

7011731
button	checkbox
it s pretty rare to have a toggle button with a null value here but more common on some of the subclasses like checkbox

7011743
oledb	openrowset
openrowset can be used to access remote data from oledb data sources

7011743
oledb	openrowset
openrowset and opendatasource should be used only to reference oledb

7011762
getter	setter
and create getter and setter for the same variable and where ever you are creating object just say store .getinstance .setobject yourobject

7011793
mouseover	mouseout
1st if i pass fast with the mouse over the image some times the image state with mouseover image don t detect the mouseout event

folder	directory
given a list of file names the program should scan the directory and copy the files in the directory to a destination directory maintaining the folder structre

7011821
range	min	range	max	min	max
if you get the min and max iid s you have a range you can check from

7011821
min	max
update this should return two values min max

7011843
put	get
i added this to the controller in an action that handles put requests instead of get requests update method

7011862
put	get
you must then process the tagged output and put names and roles in a list instead of printing but you get the picture

7011963
getter	setter
if you would use for inheritance some kind of global variable but that wouldn t be inheritance that would be a default value you could also think about using a boolean flag which will be checked in the getter to find out if the backing store or the default should be used and it will set always to the opposite of its initial state within the setter

7011975
for-loop	loops
i didnt put the for-loop b c i know that loops works b c i got the correct number of rows

7011976

7012187
mouse	keyboard
javascript is used for interactivity which means it needs to respond to various things mouse clicks keyboard input timers ajax callbacks in a non-linear fashion as they happen

7012244
setinterval	settimeout
now with your particular example setinterval works that way by design like settimeout

7012259

mysql and sqlite for that matter do not require you to specify every column in the group by clause that are not wrapped in aggregate-functions ie min max count sum etc

7012272
folder	directory
i also read in other places it could be due to an empty folder in the additional include directory but it is not the case for me

7012369
inherited	properties

jstl	trinidad
i have uploaded archived eclipse project here i am using jsf 2.0 and trinidad 2.0 jstl 1.2

7012489
hide	show
i would suggest simplifying it in the click function to simply hide everything and then show the one you do want

7012570
children	parent
the intent is to update only the properties on parent without loading children

7012615
daemons	launchd
daemons failed to launchd server on ip_address using port 0

7012659
getter	setter
keep it all in a convenient place with a convenient setter getter at the top-level object the controller that becomes the xib s file s owner and you should be able to say

7012698

in my program i add some framelayouts dynamically over a relativelayout and over these framelayouts i add some imageview and textview

7012987
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome it is appearing higher than the original in firefox

7013017
post	get
to get a click to download csv function you could write a servlet jsp proxy which would take a post from your page with the csv text from the plugin above as part of the form and simply copy it back out with the correct headers to make it appear as an attachment

7013045
width	height
but that also creates some height width problems

7013226
for-loop	loops
i assume that the infinite for-loop is at the end of your main processing loops

7013226
for-loop	loops
in truth the fact that you ve wrapped your conditional in a for-loop is the reason that break isn t behaving like you want -- you re break ing out of the infinite loops but not your main processing loops

we use salt so that brute force and rainbow table based attacks are less effective and we make salt unique for each password so that two users using same passwords have different hash

7013496
hash	hmac	hash	md5	hmac	md5
you use hmac key so that only people that know this key can verify authenticity of hash content as contrasted to php.net downloads where everyone can check md5 of downloaded file and to make it more difficult to spoof the message that produces same hash you need to know the key to know what hash to target

post	get
my guess is you would be better off handing over the data you want to see in the web forms via http post or get

7013515
int	double
yet another reason why your code cannot work double can only represent int exactly up to about 2 52 - after that i++ will have no effect and the for-loop will never terminate

7013970

7014391
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops

adding a hover flag as suggested in the answers works almost great but a small bug using this solution is visible when fast mouseenter mouseleave during the animation

7014870

if you didn t create a uinavigationcontroller to manage the contents of the current tab of your uitabbarcontroller then you have nothing to push a new view controller onto

7014872
clientaccesspolicy.xml	crossdomain.xml
the crossdomain.xml can also be used but microsoft put it in there because of flash clientaccesspolicy.xml is preferred as silverlight only supports a subset of crossdomain.xml

if you re using google-chrome or safari the network tab of the developer tools might indicate that the jquery ui file isn t being loaded

7015097
width	height
imagine a custom view where the height required for the content depends on the width of the view similar to a multi-line textview

7015097
width	height
obviously this only applies if the height isn t fixed by the layout parameters. the catch is that for a given width it s rather expensive to compute the content height in these custom views

7015097
width	height
they all assume that whenever the height is calculated the corresponding width is recorded

7015119

disk	ram
most database servers will work in ram then have the data persisted to disk in a threaded fashion write to ram return response then write to disk

7015336
postgresql	mysql
the write to disk part takes a lot longer than with regular database server mysql postgresql etc. causing long response times when executing multiple queries in a short delay

7015646
width	height
unfortunately the textbox does not seem to be able to have a stretching height and stretching width to his parent size

7015654
google-chrome	firefox
anyway if i change the padding on instead of it seems to fix it in both firefox and google-chrome

7015712
width	height
both of these questions say that to bind a stretching textbox to container width height and not grow with user input you should user a placeholder border and bind to its actual height width

7015712
width	height
also adding an additional element to bind width height to seems a bit hacky

7015737
int	double
what you re doing is interpreting type-punning a double object as if it were an int object and then shifting the resulting int value

7015737
int	double
even if double and int happen to be the same size this is very unlikely to do anything useful

7016815
width	height	children	parent

7016818
google-chrome	firefox

7016992
ienumerable	icollection
however the simplest thing to do to protect the array s encapsulation is to expose only an ienumerable or icollection and the methods to mutate the internal array

int	double
you probably should not be using floating point to take the square root of an int especially long double which is poorly supported and might have an approximate not accurate sqrtl on some systems

7017022
accessor	properties
as for it being a bad practice that largely stems from the reason they describe that even if you only provide a get accessor on your properties a user can still modify the contents of the array and thereby mutate the state of your class without your class having a way of validating the changes -- and worst of all this consequence of the design is not very obvious unless you already have a deep enough knowledge of c# array semantics

then disable closing the pop-up via the x in the corner forcing the user to click either cancel or ok to finish close the dialog

7019434
getter	setter
i suggest to create a single class with mutable attribute add getter and setter and do not use setter without necessity

7019467
google-chrome	firefox
in this case you should implement your own 3ds loader on javascript and make it run on both firefox and google-chrome although the buffers trick isn t useful on google-chrome afaik

7019497
post	get
typing php curl post into the search box will get you the code

7019515
int	chars
are based on the original unicode specification which defined chars as fixed-width 16-bit entities. therefore casting chars to int will always give you a utf-16 value if the chars actually contains a chars from that charset

7019515
int	chars
the docs go on to discuss how the supplementary utf-16 chars can only be represented by an int since chars doesn t have enough space to hold them and if you re operating at this level it might be important to get familiar with those semantics

7019543
post	get
im working with blogger and i need to get the last images from latest post using the json feed api in which you set the feed mode to json-in-script

7019572
button	checkbox
this applies to checkbox radio button spin boxes drop-down menus etc

7019613
int	chars
use int # chr to get the chars

7019618
ant	maven	inherited	properties
do you just inherited a wad of properties from ant that have the version numbers in them or is there a more formal mechanism a la maven

7019630
google-chrome	firefox
i have a javascript issue where something doesn t work in google-chrome but works in firefox

7019630
google-chrome	firefox
i know that google-chrome has a javascript timeline but does firefox have something like that as well

7019643
getter	setter
so i m trying to figure out the best most elegant with the least amount of code way to allow overriding specific functions of a property just the getter just the setter etc. in python

7019643
inherited	properties
however if i want to inherited from a class that defines properties in this manner and then say override the foo setter function it seems tricky

7019643
getter	setter
basically atimestwo inherits the getter function from a but overrides the setter function

7019648
maven	m2e	maven	pom.xml	m2e	pom.xml

i have successfully used mingw to build 32-bit and 64-bit binaries from c source for windows machines on the linux machine with the following packages on ubuntu

7019665
put	get
you put placeholders in the layer style which get populated by the features attributes

7019691
spaces	delimiter
iirc the streams use spaces as a default delimiter and you will have to specify that is another delimiter

7019706
width	height
you should put the trigger on slide event of the slider and inside you can set the width and height of the scalablediv

7019729
int	chars
the chars data type is typically represented as a 16 bit machine int though it may or may not be machine word aligned depending on the specific context.

7019729
decoder	encoder
if you did this and you were able to register the corresponding charset encoder and decoder before launching the compiler then a literal that looks like c viewing the input as ascii or utf-8 would actually have the value 67 in the compiler program rather than 99

7019754
post	get
so now am i supposed to edit this post after i get new answers

7019754
bufferedreader	filewriter	bufferedreader	bufferedwriter	filewriter	bufferedwriter
i mean why not declare filewriter filereader bufferedreader and bufferedwriter

7019803
getter	setter
please no answers regarding the use of setter getter

7019809
opera	firefox
in addition firefox and opera require that style fit the css property name such as font-size where ie needs the name in javscript syntax fontsize due to interpreting the hypen in the css syntax as a minus sign

7019820
x86	64bit
this code worked perfectly well when i was on x86 but the jump to 64bit is screwing everything up

7019868
inherited	properties
should really include a hasownproperty test otherwise it will copy inherited enumerable properties also

7019878
int	chars
returns you the underlying ascii code of ascii chars instead of the literal int what you want

7019879
xslt	xquery
if you want to combine data lists with document templates a template for an insurance policy with place-holders for the name of the insured and the amount of coverage then using xml for both your data and your template can enable use of languages like xslt or xquery to combine them

7019884
bufferedreader	filewriter	bufferedreader	bufferedwriter	filewriter	bufferedwriter
why not declare filewriter filereader bufferedreader and bufferedwriter at the top of the class as they did for the other variables

7019884
bufferedreader	filewriter	bufferedreader	bufferedwriter	filewriter	bufferedwriter
okay i assume you understand that the variables are not actually called filewriter filereader bufferedreader and bufferedwriter but rather this is the variable type

7019884
filewriter	bufferedwriter
clearly filewriter and bufferedwriter are to do with output in some way

7019911
width	height
the middle portion of the screen should be a single image that occupies the entire width of the screen spanning across columns and of height 2 cells

7019947
width	height
but forcing a height and width didn t help either

7019972
for-loop	loops
use a for-loop to loops through the list of abbreviations you have and then use the replace method mentioned above to swap out the abbreviation for the tag you need

7019974

how would i post an array like this and get it to look identical in php

i ve read several other stackoverflow post and web entries explaining the problem and the most common answer has been to put it on a live server as chrome doesn t accept ajax functions locally

width	height
the problem here is that the width and height of the imagebutton are fixed and the image is not told to scale

melt	reshape
the reshape function in the stats package can also be used to do this but the syntax is difficult and i haven t used it once since learning cast and melt from the reshape package

7020253
post	get
it s reasonable to get a certain tweet with the person who post this tweet or retweet somewhat

7020270
post	get
there s also request.post and there are aliases query_parameters for get and request_parameters for post for both in actiondispatch request

7020276
width	height
and then getwidth and getheight should be multiplied by this scale to get the exact width and height of the device that s using your app

7020303

superclass	subclassing
if you think your superclass is fine look into your subclassing check your ivars and properties and synthesize section in the .m file

7020528
width	height
depending on the size of the image i add either a height or a width attribute

7020528
width	height
if the max desired width is 100 and the max desired height is 100 image is 100x200 i add an height attribute to the img tag of 100

7020531
getter	setter
and then subclasses can override a single setter getter like this

7020531

of course at the point that you re overriding getter setter and deleter you can probably just redefine the property for c3

notice that the graph has perfect layout--nodes of the same degree are on the same level along a vertical axis children are rendered below parent and natural symmetry is preserved when possible a parent node is positioned between and above its two child nodes

since these methods don t accept percentage values you need to calculate the parent container s width and height in pixels

ready	each
after each chunk of the file was ready it would then call synchronize and get the main thread to add the contents of the string list to the edit control and then clear the string list

what i would do in your situation with such a short release cycle is have those two collaborators share their local repositories with each other completely skipping the central repository until it has been tested and is ready to push to production

if you didn t specify anything the application will work in both landscape and portrait modes

the easiest way is probably to redirect printf statements to the system log based on the viewing stdout and stderr section of the official adb reference manual

7021755

just be aware that since the data is buffered before transferring from the emulator or device you should definitely fflush the stdout buffer eg

7022032
int	double
it is not possible to convert a variable from int to double it is possible to convert a value from int to double

7022032
int	double
the problem with this approach is that you absolutely must keep track of whether you are currently storing int or double in your unions

7022032

bad things will happen if you store an int and then try to access it as a double

flash manages to handle everything nicely it just turns out that you should watch out when using mouseevent.click because if you swap the image object during a reload after you have done a mousedown but before a mouseup flash won t dispatch the click event as you haven t caused a mousedown and mouseup on the same object

7024420
uiview	caanimation
i know apple recommends blocks instead of the old uiview animation methods uiview beginanimations etc but what about caanimation

1 there is not much difference in terms of memory expenses between uiview s animation blocks and calayers s caanimation nor in terms of the objects themselves

7024688
uiview	caanimation
2 there are limitations to the type of animations you can achieve with uiview s animation so you might be forced to use caanimation anyway

7024688
uiview	caanimation
3 for those types of simpler animations that uiview can handle it is usually a simpler api to use than that of caanimation

7024724

7024853
apache	lighttpd
lighttpd passes non-static contents to apache using the configuration

7024853
apache	lighttpd
static files are being served by lighttpd while everything else is served by apache

7024853
apache	lighttpd
this means apache will serve the cache html files and not lighttpd

7024904

potentially you could have many many features for each country that were not ready for release and controller by a toggle

7025110

7025607
postgresql	mysql
the following article describes how to implement the timestamp behavior of mysql with postgresql

7025630
fileinputstream	fileoutputstream
also check your code for uses of fileinputstream fileoutputstream inputstreamreader and outputstreamwriter all of which ptentially rely on the platform default encoding the first two exclusively which makes them pretty useless

7025748
width	height
set image as div background and set height and width to 100 for that div

7025757

the common way people think it should be done is to salt and hash it

7026051
onchange	onkeydown
you need to make use of javascript to capture the events like onchange or onkeydown etc refer dojo api and handle the same in the javascript.if there is a better solution please do let me know

7026076
versioning	upgrade
if there were an upper limit you wouldn t be able to count on it remaining unchanged across even minor versioning upgrade

7026092
sqlcommandbuilder	sqldataadapter
there are a number of things that can affect how the sqldataadapter ultimately handles versioning but my guess is that you either have a timestamp on the table or there is a sqlcommandbuilder that is generating the sqlcommand through the getupdatecommand method which ultimately checks all the values in the row in the database against the previous values in the row that you updated the datarow stores the previous version of the row for comparison

7026103
width	height
or do you simply wish to show the image inside a div or td which needs to be of a certain width height

7026255
set	bag
a more standard approach is to set the collection-type property on the bag mapping to a custom type - an implementation of iusercollectiontype which you can choose to make a base class that mycollection derives from

7026316
width	height
if you select the right handle which will be near the bottom if you use rotate 77deg moving it left will shrink the width of the element which will appear similar to the height due to the rotation.

7026316
width	height
to adjust the element size relative to its center you will most probably have to update the code that resizes the element by vectoring the mouse movements to adjust the width height

7026365

7026434
cakephp	lithium
i believe cakephp 2.0 models will still return arrays i assume for backwards-compatibility though you may want to look at the lithium framework - which started life intending to be cakephp 3.0 supporting only php 5.3+ - or another of the php 5+ frameworks out there

7026528

7026738
mousemove	keydown

7026844
stdout	stderr
since you redirected stderr to stdout it s possible some kind of error cropped up and you don t know about it because you re not reading from the stream

7026847
children	parent
then it s just a simple matter of sorting first by the parent option then by whether a line is a parent to make sure that the parent always shows up before its children and then by the sub-items

7026855
filtering	grouping
the filtering should be composed by users using logical or and operators and grouping using brackets

7026957

rpm	yum
when i install the generated rpm with yum after downloading it and asked me the confirmation to processed i get this line and it stuck there forever

they don t even have to uninstaller just clean appdata

7029288
hide	show
if you re allowing the users to edit can you find some way to hide the rows you don t want show rather than trying to remove them

7029306

you can use datetime function for date comparision addition subtraction range lookup etc without the need to use from_unixtime function - it will make it easier to write queries that can use indexes

7029329
getter	setter
for what it should contains i d say probably a constructor that take parameters like these and then setter and getter for these values

7029340
google-chrome	safari
this code-snippet works in every browser fx google-chrome ie7-9 but not in the latest safari which tells me that i don t have permission to view the page that is it redirects to the correct page somedomain.org with the correct protocol but does not process the authentication data

so an image in portrait mode might have cords 20 5 and on landscape mode that image will have totally different coordinates

7029661
portrait	landscape
so is there a way that i can set the iboutlets have specific cords on landscape and specific cords on portrait with xcode

7029661
portrait	landscape
i have to store the cgpoints in an array with the cords of iboutlets in landscape and portrait mode and then if the device enters landsape mode set it s center equal to the array elemets

7029679
folder	directory
both git and mercurial use a single directory at the root of your project to store their data so you will never corrupt a working copy by moving folder and files around

7029716
range	minimum
i m trying to find the maximum and minimum number so i can find out what the range is

7029723
hide	show
you can use a navigation controller even for the root level then show hide the navigation bar as necessary when you push or pop items on the navigation stack

7029724
folder	directory
change the current directory to the local working folder i don t know of another way to select the current workspace

7029741
icomparable	compareto
customclass implements icomparable as there is custom sort logic in the compareto method

7029749
mouseup	mousedown
i can detect mousedown and mouseup events but not sure how to do it what i want

7029760
hide	show
so you just need to hide show the editing icons by calling this method

7029762
dbcontext	objectcontext
ef generates a class that derives from objectcontext objectset not dbcontext dbset

7029798
folder	directory
your problem is that inside folder directory you can have two directory a and b then the reading retrieve a and b as file names while is_dir receive a full path filename or a relative filename you have two options

7029835
for-loop	arrays
this is done using a for-loop but the arrays you will end up with you can just pass to .apply

7029848
udp	tcp
all robots listen to it with udp sensors and all running guis connect to it via tcp

7029851
mousemove	mousedown	mousemove	mouseup	mouseup	mousedown
note that you ll also want to check for mousemove events in between the mouseup mousedown in case the latter two events happen to occur at the same location

7029852
folder	directory
i want to modify that to access the parent directory of thisdir and then create the extracted items folder

7029865
post	get
but that will be a get not a post

7029882
width	height
also often times it s useful to have the dimensions of the bounding box so multimeasuretext returns both the width and the height

7029912
min	max
that said you ll still want to map the strings into floats before calling max or min because otherwise you will be comparing the strings as strings rather than floats

7029918
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	webkit	gecko
that fiddle provides the standard css for it and the engine-specific properties for webkit safari google-chrome and gecko firefox

7029922

if you can get this into a failing test and post it to either the moose mailing list or #moose on irc.perl.org i m sure someone can help sort out what is going on

7029974
portrait	landscape
i ve tried adding in the couple lines in the appdelegate but when it runs the table in the root view doesn t show up and it no longer properly switches between portrait and landscape views

7029979
nsdata	nsstream
then nsmutableurlrequest can accept an nsstream for the body instead of an nsdata so you should create an nsinputstream to read from your file back from disk and upload it

7029984
daemons	launchd	daemons	systemd
i tested with a launchd daemons that would call nslog test every minute and with a systemd sleep idle time of 1 minute and the systemd never went to sleep

7029992
google-chrome	firefox
on firefox when i close the window the video stops but not in google-chrome or internet explorer

7030007
min	max
i do think this is a particularly nice application to jump into as seemingly simple expressions sums max min of random variables can lead to nightmarish consideration of cases well-suited to the patience of a computer

7030051
hide	show
so i decided to hide the variadic functionality in a macro that swig will never trip over show in a simplified example below

7030081
width	height
i ve tried setting canvas width and height

7030081
width	height
none which are taller or wider than the main floor canvas width height

7030093
hide	show
you could easily get the desired result with a few and then using show hide based on category

7030133
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
if your home page is just a uiviewcontroller you can present a uinavigationcontroller modally which will allow you to navigate through to different areas

7030183
google-chrome	firefox
i want to write script and iframe elements in the opened window which works fine in firefox and google-chrome but not in ie

7030191
udp	tcp
right now they communicate using udp datagram sockets since a missed packet only means a skipped frame and tcp sockets are too slow

7030191
udp	tcp
i just don t want things to get too messy with opening a bunch of different ports and using udp and tcp sockets at the same time but if that s they only way to do it that s okay

7030192
floating-point	fractions
convert the datetime value to be rounded to a decimal floating-point value representing the whole and fractions number of timespan units

7030202
put	get
but if i do it the other way around i will get whatever i put in #field

7030214
mouse	keyboard
basically i d just like to launch an app which intercepts all the keyboard mouse events and disables anything from happening so the screen seems frozen

7030214
mouse	keyboard
i m thinking maybe there s a winapi where i can catch the events mouse move click keyboard click and then mark the event as handled

7030233
int	boolean
method post location as string test as int 0 reset as boolean 1 as status

7030233

7030293
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
it shows nicely in ff3 ie7 ie8 and recent versions of safari google-chrome and opera

7030307
width	height
.logo is an a which is an inline element and won t accept width and height

7030310
width	height
i don t think you can set a width or height for an anchor because it is an inline element

7030317
fadein	fadeout
working on my home page where i m cycling through some images using jquery s fadein and fadeout methods

7030317
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this behavior only happens in safari and google-chrome not in firefox and ie

7030318
imperative	declarative
xml is declarative not imperative

7030318
imperative	declarative
instead i ve now decided that declarative syntax of view engines razor is much easier to work with than imperative languages

7030320
memcached	apc
if your project size warrants it you d be better off using something like memcached or apc cache to store the cached values for a given period of time

7030336
public	protected
create a private protected or public member in your mdicontainer window

7030336
children	parent
this is useful for parent to child but it should be implemented in different way for parent to many children with synchronization

7030340
width	height
if its because your height and width are being ignored in your .logo class that would be because you need to display block .logo in order for your to respect them

7030345
move	drag
happens when you drag a marker and the shadow move for example

7030360
many-to-one	one-to-many
i have two entities customer and order.a customer having mulitple orders.i trying to bidirectional one to many and many to one.so which collection object can i choose bag map etc.so what basis can i chose collection object using one-to-many and many-to-one bi directional relation ship

7030392
bitconverter	binaryreader
you can write a private constructor that takes in the byte array and uses a binaryreader or the bitconverter class to read from the byte array you d have to wrap it in a memorystream for binaryreader or to simply convert sections of the byte array to the values you need bitconverter

7030392
bitconverter	binaryreader
at that point you might as well use the binaryreader bitconverter as it will be faster than the marshal class

7030393
width	height
i m running a small application which has an 70 width and 90 height value as the rest of the screen is menus

7030394
japplet	jcomponent
i tried extends japplet jframe jcomponent for the section class but it didn t seem to help

7030550
portrait	landscape
one that describes the portrait orientation and one that describes the landscape orientation

7030551
post	get
how can i improve dealing with forms that get their data either from the database initially or from post after some kind of submission is being done

7030558
width	height
don t constrain both width and height then

7030558
width	height
but if you tell your browser to resize your image to height 60 it will automatically make the width 60 to keep the image s proportions and it won t be distorted

7030561
ssid	captivenetwork
captivenetwork provides the ssid of the connected network but not much else

7030572
superclass	subclassing
when subclassing the guideline is that the designated initializer has to call its superclass designated initializer

7030572
superclass	subclassing
another guideline is that the subclassing needs to override the superclass designated initializer to call the new designated initializer

7030572
super	self
designated initializers are chained to each other through messages to super while other initialization methods are chained to designated initializers through messages to self

7030593
udp	tcp
it would be less complex to open tcp sockets on each end and roll your own file transfer protocol on top of it than to implement reliable transfer on top of udp

7030611
post	get
but when dumping it out after the form post i get this value

7030617
mdpi	hdpi
here i explain for ldpi device header you have to do for all you device hdpi mdpi etc

7030617
mdpi	hdpi
i shown header for ldpi device similarly you need to create for mdpi and hdpi device

7030618
iboutlet	ibaction
xcode doesn t automatically delete the iboutlet or ibaction if you hook up objects and get rid of the objects or ibaction

7030643
width	height
in addition to controlling the position of your form the form.move method will allow you to set its size by assigning your values in twips where 1440 twips inch to the width and height parameters

7030652
ggplot2	lattice
and iirc it is relatively easy to add grid grobs to lattice or ggplot2 plots objects for this sort of arbitrary notation annotation etc

7030652
ggplot2	lattice
what doesn t make too much sense is extending ggplot2 or lattice along the lines you are thinking

7030652
ggplot2	lattice
what would be very useful would be if the data processing guts of ggplot2 or lattice were available for others to write actual plotting code on top of

7030652
ggplot2	lattice
ggplot2 in particular and lattice are quite difficult codes to get into to read understand

7030652
ggplot2	lattice
edit the point i was intending to get across was that the interfaces provided by packages like ggplot2 and lattice are necessarily high-level

7030733
pop-up	dialog
statement in my program windows will pop-up a dialog saying dummyservice.exe has stopped working

7030733

7030825
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
the crazy thing is that i have tested this code with ie safari on mac and windows google-chrome and opera and all return data

7030863
google-chrome	firefox
here is my working example on jsfiddle its working on almost every browser i tested it on ie9 firefox google-chrome except ie8 its acting weird class change buttons mavis or test1 only works if you click twice on it

7030885
chunked	transfer-encoding
because its large and will eventually be dynamically generated i decided to use chunked transfer-encoding

7030892

so i am curious to know if there is anything need to be done before one deploy standard spring war on virgo like creating a manifest-inf folder parallel to web-inf folder and adding manifest.mf file in it

7030918
post	get
this post explains how you can get the items of a template based listbox

7030931
content-length	content-type
in particular the host and content-length headers are not optional and the content-type header is usually needed to tell the server how to interpret the body

7030990
google-chrome	safari
it works fine in safari and google-chrome with no errors in console

7031126
clang	llvm
i have a number of projects built using cmake and i d like to be able to easily switch between using gcc or clang llvm to compile them

7031202

is there a way for them to be grouped together without a server so that 1 peer can send a udp tcp message directly to another

7031210
valgrind	callgrind	perf	callgrind
i m used to valgrind callgrind which is of course a totally different approach to the sampling based method of perf

7031233
google-chrome	safari
support for border-radius on images in google-chrome safari or rather webkit seems to be a bit buggy

7031233
google-chrome	safari
you may want to report the bug you re seeing to the webkit google-chrome safari projects

7031233
google-chrome	safari
this would have a few drawbacks as it s only a fix for google-chrome safari example jsfiddle

7031261
udp	tcp
no easy way with tcp but with udp you have multicast

7031278
google-chrome	firefox
it works wonderfully in firefox and in google-chrome but a lot of it won t work in internet explorer

7031278

this war file which is part of an ear is exploded in the target directly and i need to copy a file version.properties to the web-inf classes folder of this exploded war directory target mywebapp-1.3.2.war

7031339
getter	setter
if the number of element in the array is fixed i would only provide a getter for the array and leave off the setter

7031343
shadowing	named
the use of the shadowing named in the inner scopes is thus on average closer to their declaration and less ambiguous

7031343
shadowing	named
allowing shadowing also allows to keep using descriptive named that are sufficiently to the point even if they are the same as al already used named instead of inventing other weird named â like prefixing them with my local or worse _ or single-letter namesâ

7031358
operands	decrement
the prefix decrement increases the value of its operands before it has been evaluated

7031432
folder	directory
in a comment the op asked how come java snakegame doesn t work within the snake2 folder but java snake2 snakegame works in the parent directory

7031453
gridview	rowdatabound
you can use gridview s events such as rowdatabound or rowediting

7031528

no except that you could use a getter and setter like this which delegates the setting of a variable so that you can check whether it is to set at one time

7033083

stdout	stderr
i was thinking that if it is possible to write to a 3rd output stream that i could use it for specific status events from the grid that the controlling script can report on meanwhile stdout and stderr can remain redirected to log files for debugging should something go wrong

so as you loop through each checkbox you can use this in conjunction with the append to append the button to each checkbox

7034040

width	height
let s say i have a logo with the dimensions 150px in width by 40px in height and i want to contain it at the top of a 820px wide container

7035067
width	margin
so far this has been fine for me as it gets the job done however i still believe that the container with the width set to 100 is overhead unneeded and that there s a better way to be able to use the margin property properly on content below the logo without it messing up because no container above it has the width of 100

7035078
min	max
windows.h defines macros named min and max like so

7035093

free	calloc
we play it safe here checking that the pointer address is valid before freeing with free because we ll allocate with calloc -- these are c level memory allocation functions that persist across calls in to c unlike r_alloc and clearing the pointer to signal that it has already been finalized

7035178
width	height
making a ui object invisible or reducing its size in width height to 0 will simply mean the gpu won t have to process it in the same way regardless of whether it is on screen or off

children	parent
in other places i want to know about the specific types - in the implementation of my example ialpha ibeta interfaces i want the children to be typed the same as their parent

7035844
integer	unsigned
size_t is a typedef for an unsigned integer type

7035844
integer	unsigned
i suppose in c# you could use a 64-bit unsigned integer type

if that doesn t work and apache still doesn t have access to usr local bin directory make a apache folder there and give full access to apache on that folder and link convert to that folder

7035943
int	boolean
boolean floats int longs and strings

7035954
public	protected
unfortunately it isn t public or protected so you can t simply derive from it and override the close method removing the check for whether the folder is open

7035976
min	max
i looked at the documentation and there doesn t seem to be a way to achieve that with the combination of connection lifetime max pool size and min pool size

7035986
ubuntu	linux
i am new to linux ubuntu and python django

7036008
hash	salt
since i m ideally taking a salt hash of the password before i store it in the database it s going to have a fixed length due to the hash function and so limiting the password length doesn t reduce the database size whatsoever

7036009
hash	salt
you should store a salt cryptographic hash of the user s password which can have a limited size in the database and check the tendered password by hashing it and comparing it with the stored hash

7036029
sorting	filtering
it should not be about tasks like restructuring the dom to be a certain way sorting and filtering through data and so on - unless there is a compelling reason

7036030
hide	show
if the mouse hover on the tab2 li then cdmore li hide and the ebmore li show

7036036
jtable	jprogressbar
i have added multiple jprogressbar to tablecolumn of jtable

7036050
put	get
so for example you can go to www.gamespot.com get list like the one below and put them in your database

7036141
int	double
so if you declare two overloaded versions of fun1 in the base class say fun1 void and fun1 int and then declare another version of fun1 in the derived class say fun1 double the function in the derived class will hide both fun1 functions inherited from the base class

7036149
for-loop	arrays
you should iterate an arrays with this type of for-loop

7036177
accessor	properties
i have tried several method to remove the dummy properties of the get and set accessor like type.deletefield but it seems doesn t work

7036177
accessor	properties
therefore i want to ask if there is any method to treat the data sending to server to remove the properties of get and set accessor

7036220
int	boolean
well you would need an implementation that can handle at least a subset of the initialization boolean and arithmetic functions on very large int

7036269
put	get
you are supposed to put the address on the get method

7036296
subtract	add

7036334
int	chars
set_test.cpp in function â int main int chars â

7036336
tabs	tabpanel
the goal is to create an app which has a tabpanel containing four tabs one of them should be a map the others are a nestedlist and two panels working like a charm

7036366
subtract	add
inheritance would mean that calc.h can modify the implementation of add and subtract which it can t since it only contains declarations

7036379
post	get
basically make sure that you re using post as opposed to get in your requests

7036388
children	parent
what you are referring to is merely the semantic setup of your tabs which acts just like parent and children elements

7036414
post	get
so unless something has changed post is 2006 it appears you ll need to use it s dll to get the text

you need to make a new datatemp for each iteration of the for-loop otherwise you are just passing the same object into the arrays each time and modifying it s values

7036618
post	get
the moment you submit the form the browser will initiate a post method and your post version of action would get called

7036666

if you want it inside the image view it should have origin x 0 y 0 and the same width and height as your imageview

7036668
inherited	properties
in the following code i am trying to implement inherited and polymorphism properties my question is obj1.hello3 1param 2param obj1.hello3 11param are these statements not correct what would be the correct way of doing this

7036726
int	chars
it will also match a chars constant like 007 which is octal but not as error-prone as an octal int constant

7036748
gridview	onclientclick
either way i lose getting onclientclick events for my gridview

jsf	wicket	jsf	seam	wicket	seam
so i don t think seam s extremely useful for ejb s unless you wanna mix ejb with web technologies like jsf wicket etc -- in this case you benefit from the unified component model of seam

7036837
jsf	seam
you will have seam s di and resource management mechanisms that abstracts differences between ejb s servlet s jsf s aproaches to that

7037167
width	height
but on ie all version the inner div s width becomes a percentage of the immediate outer div and not that of the browser window while the height appears to be determined based on the content of the inner div

7037213
put	get
it should be easy enough to get this done - once you have it locally and have configured your local app to use that database as it s development datasource it s a simple case of heroku db push to put it onto heroku - and it will convert it on the way up for you so it doesn t entirely matter what db you run it in locally

7037247
width	height
excuse me but i don t understand why you use percentage for every parameter also width and height inside another div.

7037253
children	parent
note that if you add some properties to a parent bean then they will be automatically applied to all the children convenient way to extract common properties

7037555
sorting	filtering
you don t need to use viewdata to provide data to the telerik grid and one of the huge bonuses of using their grid is that if you have an data source it will automagically provide paging sorting filtering functionality straight out of the box

7037565
int	double
we also know that the range of a double approximately 2 1024 - - 2 1024 is greater than that of an int 2 31-1 - -2 31

7037601
int	chars
depending on the language the types might differ chars short int int some proposed short tall grande

7037601
int	chars
in some cases it will be exactly defined in java or c# an int is exactly 32bits and a long is 64bits while in others like c c++ only the relationships among the types are defined long is not smaller than int which in turn is not smaller than short then chars ...

7037608
int	double
in case of primitives memory comes into play.if you are going to store double into int as in your example double takes more memory as compare to integer.so there is chance of data lose.so compiler throw error.if you cast yourself then you know what you are doing so compiler let that do

7037725
width	height
it assumes that a width and height will be specified

7037725
width	height
an alternative would be to be to use the sizechanged event of the usercontrol to assign values of width and height directly

7037745
int	double
you need the d after 60 to make 60 a double otherwise it s an int and your result would therefore be an int too making hours a whole number double

7037750
int	double
it s that or generated code be it the fact that you can fit less 64-bit int in a sse register or round a double to a 64-bit int is slower

7037835
awt	swing
others are file handles native gui objects swing or awt windows and sockets

problem is platform-specific and occurres only on gentoo linux with gcc 4.5.5 compiler with poco libraries

7037950
width	height
it involves setting the width and height to a very large number to see how far the window resizes then remembering this size as the maximum then setting the width and height to a small number and doing the same again

7037950
width	height
after all this i just reset the width and height to their original values

7037951

casting	autoboxing
the simplest solution i can think of is this excuse the casting and autoboxing unboxing

7038017
division	modulo
you can use the modulo to find the remainder after a division and then if the remainder is equal to zero the it s a multiple

7038017
multiplying	modulo
if the numbers your using could be to 2dp the modulo should still work if not multiplying both by 100 first then carry out the above check

7038300
viewdidload	viewwillappear
uitableview is a subclass of uiscrollview so you can just set the contentoffset of your tableview in viewdidload or viewwillappear

7038301
width	height
what you could do is find the src of the background image then use javascript s built in width height functions to get its dimensions

7038365
textarea	textbox
i would to make it flexible by allowing user enter a string into a textbox textarea and my app can then translate it for the user

7038366

firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the problem is that javascript makes the img without a trailing slash in safari 5.0.5 in firefox 4.0.1 in ie8 and in google-chrome 13 -- so everywhere near as i can tell as in html5 it is optional

7043136
int	chars
a chars is a 1byte int

7043138
jdom	dom4j
if you want to generate an xml document you have many choices dom jdom dom4j jaxb or even plain string concatenation although i would not recommend it except if all you need to do is generating such a small document with only one dynamic attribute

7043164
google-chrome	firefox
i was doing this by using the session variable but i came to realize that this works badly on firefox and google-chrome and i abandoned that idea and decided to pass the values by query string

7043168
mdpi	hdpi
you still have to provide the icon in three different sizes to accommodate the ldpi mdpi and hdpi resolution

7043168

7043349
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the html5 data block-based way shown here works in firefox in opera in webkit-based browsers such as google-chrome and safari and in ie9 while ie s xml data islands work only in ie

7043361
google-chrome	safari
the problem is that a div tag has the style overflow auto which apparently is not implemented well with webkit which is used by safari and google-chrome see emanuele greco s answer

7043370
cpu	hyperthreading
single core just means one cpu operation at a time assuming there s no hyperthreading - not one overall operation at a time

7043378

read differences between a while loops and a for-loop in php

7043500
post	put
as you can notice the method was a correct post not a put

7043506
jtable	jeditorpane
another approach is to display jeditorpane in the cell but is also problematic because jtable only uses the jcomponent returned by cell renderer to draw i don t think the object will be sent any events

7043509
width	height
i m trying to calculate a proportional height while excluding a static height element from a width that gets passed in via a request defaults to 560

7043598
rss	feed
i noticed that the rss tag allows for xml name spaces so does this mean i can create an rss feed with tags other than the tags defined within the rss spec

7043630
width	height
the width and height parameters from gldrawtextfoes are in pixels

7043630
width	height
therefore instead of using 64 pixels for the width and height parameters you should use variables that scales the width and height globally and if needed select a part of the texture using texture cropping

7043633
gridview	detailsview
master-detail with the gridview detailsview and modalpopup controls

7043633
formview	detailsview
otherwise if you want to do it your way to open the editable record in new page you can add detailsview formview in your new page and show the record in an editable form

7043635
nullreferenceexception	invalidoperationexception
i understand that catching an invalidoperationexception thrown by the nullable class is trickier than catching a nullreferenceexception but i think it is a serious flaw

7043638
rss	feed
i figured out that iscroll doesn t play nice with our rss feed reader zrssfeed for jquery

7043656
stdout	stderr
the buffering logic for stdout and stderr is buried within libc and to change it you need to fool the application to think it s writing to a terminal

7043661
aggregate-functions	sum
alternately this may work if you add appropriate scope statements to your aggregate-functions such as first sum fields

7043705
post	get

i d like to not hardcode a screen width height based on the current orientation

7043736
width	height
is there a way that i can check the screen width and height that will correctly reflect orientation changes

7043738

i get how you set up the basic party info to put all the appropriate information in the isa and gs fields but how do i set up a third party us them1 and them2

7044100
for-loop	arrays
now gathering up the triples into sub-arrays is easy enough to do with a for-loop but i m curious-- is there a functional way to gather up groups of arrays elements in f#

in what ways does rabbitmq differ from activemq

7044157
activemq	rabbitmq
what does rabbitmq do better or worse than activemq

7044180
membase	couchbase
then about 6 months ago the companies membase and couchone merged to form couchbase

7044180
membase	couchbase
directly after the merger couchbase continued to provide membase server but now also provided couchbase single server

7044180
couchbase	couchdb
couchbase single server is essentially couchdb with geocouch packaged in by default along with many major performance improvements

7044180
membase	couchbase
couchbase server is the combination of couchbase single server and membase

7044180
couchbase	couchdb
basically what couchbase did was replace sqlite with couchdb as the persistence engine

7044180
couchbase	couchdb
couchsync is basically what couchbase is calling couchdb replication

7044180
couchbase	couchdb
it is very simple to setup in both couchbase server couchbase single server and in couchdb

7044180
membase	couchdb
since membase doesn t provide any of the couchdb support it doesn t actually fit into this diagram and therfore doesn t support couchsync

7044180
couchbase	couchdb	membase	couchbase	membase	couchdb
you will actually want to look at the developer preview of couchbase server since this product has both membase and couchdb features

7044180
couchbase	couchdb
couchbase the company no longer supports couchbase single server which is it s version of couchdb

7044183
google-chrome	safari
please use google-chrome or safari

7044217
google-chrome	firefox
but only in firefox not in google-chrome or ie

7044220
int	chars
fgetc returns an int not a chars

7044220
int	chars
the value is either the next chars read from the file represented as an unsigned chars and then converted to int so typically in the range 0..255 or the value eof which is typically -1

7044236
google-chrome	safari
the url which points to the user coopthink which works in most browsers including google-chrome and safari on ios is

7044240
jtable	jeditorpane
another approach is to display jeditorpane in the cell but is also problematic because jtable only uses the jcomponent returned by cell renderer to draw i don t think the object will be sent any events

7044251
avassetwriter	avassetexportsession
then use avassetexportsession or avassetwriter to write the result to a new file

7044280
vb.net	vb6
now i m working on a desktop application.an upgrade from vb6 sybase to vb.net sql server

7044282
std	ostream	ostream	istream
as i have already said if i remove either std istream or std ostream from the implementations list i can compile and run the tests without any warning i am using the -wall flag

7044300
maven	m2e
another option is to use maven m2e to manage your dependencies

7044317
inherited	properties
i think you might be able to get away with not using it if all you want is .text but the ctype gives you access to all of the textbox s properties not just it s inherited properties and also you might need to do checkboxes or other controls at some point where you pretty much have to ctype in order to get to .ischecked etc

7044324
int	chars
your my_char should be int because that s what fgetc returns using a chars will mean that you ll never find your eof condition

7044324
int	chars
the eof value is an int that is not a valid chars that s how you can detect the end of a file while reading it one byte at a time and from the fine manual

7044324
int	chars
if the int value returned by fgetc is stored into a variable of type chars and then compared against the int constant eof the comparison may never succeed because sign-extension of a variable of type chars on widening to int is implementation-defined

7044371
textview	simplecursoradapter
simplecursoradapter is just that - a simple way to bind fields from a db to a textview of some sort

7044388
width	height
additionally specifying the exact width and height of the child a is redundant

7044437
post	get
from the sender and no i want to get the data in post

7044444
salt	md5
i want to use md5 encryption with a salt

7044463
hash	salt
some even regenerate hash with new salt upon each successful login of given user although commenters below argue this is not the best idea see comments

7044472
dbcontext	objectcontext
how does one enable the ability to see the full exception using an odata wcf service like you would using a local objectcontext dbcontext

7044498
hash	salt
to answer your original question the salt is stored alongside the hash password in the database

7044498
hash	salt
the salt is not meant to be secret if the hash password is discovered

7044507
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it was developed using firefox for testing and works as expected in firefox safari and google-chrome

7044521
width	height
i m not sure why exactly as pg1 s width and height are set by op1 s but there is probably a very valid reason

7044570
gridview	sqldatasource
my gridview uses as sqldatasource

7044574
subtract	add
today while i was trying to write a code to just add subtract the two 2 2 matrices in which i used switch statement i got an error case bypass initialization of local variable in function main

7044594
hash	salt
okay so salt are used for both one-way hash and encryption

7044594
hash	salt
the salt is a random string or set of bits properly that is cryptographically combined with the user s input to produce a more secure hash

7044594
hash	salt
for example if the string to be hash is still kiwi and our salt is 5m3d a simple salt mechanism might concatenate the two into kiwi5m3d

7044594
hash	salt
you will have to save the salt somewhere because it s the only way to know what s been hash or encrypted

7044594
hash	salt
in the case of a hash you compare the user s original hash against the salt hash of their input

7044610
antialiasing	transparent
for antialiasing images it just looks like the image is surrounded by 0.5px transparent line and then black border around that

7044627
distance	polygons
well the distance to these two points is very large while in fact you are very close to the polygons

7044629
fileoutputstream	objectoutputstream
if you are using the objectoutputstream for serialization and wrapping it around a fileoutputstream then the objects will go into that file

7044642
sage	maxima
i downloaded and installed sage because i needed an ode solver.i think that maxima is relatively restricted in that part as it doesn t seem to solve almost basic odes.i appreciate all the effort that s been put into that project but i really could use a stronger solver.are there any other free alternatives

7044646
google-chrome	firefox
it happens in firefox and also google-chrome

7044667
getter	setter
the author may choose to use structures because he doesn t want to bother the reader about oop principles and best practices he doesn t want you to say hey why he defined this field public and not private with setter and getter

7044689
nhibernate	automapper
i downloaded the source code i compiled myself and it s working now with the automapper in fluent nhibernate maybe can work for you meanwhile the people of system.data.sqlite relase a new version

7044697
draggable	droppable
if a user has a draggable move around the layout and change the position of the droppable

7044697
draggable	droppable
i have a sortable with a cloned helper that still fires the receive callback on my droppable even though it should only work with draggable receive callback works

7044707
yslow	pagespeed
you can use the gtmetrix tool yslow or google s pagespeed to see how all of these impact it but this gtmetrix tool is generally awesome and combines features for you as well as doing some auto-generations that give you the improved versions of css files etc

7044736
hide	show
hide and show them

7044797
post	put
lock the file briefly create a copy of the database file and upload it via put post to my server via an api

7044862
codeigniter	kohana
check out uhoh written by dan horrigan a port of kohana s error handling system for codeigniter

7044906
hash	salt
in my experience a salt sha1 hash is pleanty secure for 99 of web application situations

7044908
csv	tsv
surround your cell values with double quotes it will allow you to import the data in a tsv or csv format without having to worry about the carriage returns being interpreted as a new row

7044908
csv	tsv
you could also use the fputcsv function from php to export a tsv or csv file that excel can read

7044976
width	height
is your texture a power of 2 for both height and width

7044997
ant	maven
i could do this in about 5 minutes with ant and i havn t eliminated the possibility of simply writing a shell script to do it but i would like to give maven a chance first

7045005
getter	setter
however you can write custom getter and setter to use nsinteger properties

7045091
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome i get a ton of alerts saying attribute found but in ie i get nothing

7045125
mouseup	mousedown
to prevent this i only perform the logic once on the first mousedown trigger the logic s simple enough that i don t care if two invocations happen to race but you might then ignore any other mousedown triggers until a mouseup occurs

7045163
post	get
that s because querystring is for get requests not post

7045183
mouse	keyboard
the other qt virtual keyboard implementations that i ve seen don t need their keyboard buttons to gain focus since they are touch or mouse operated

7045215
springboard	backgrounding
i m not sure why it was looking like it was graphics related and involving the springboard process but as soon as i added a sleep 1 at the end of the loop the cpu usage no longer rose when the app was placed in the backgrounding

7045215
springboard	backgrounding
there is still a quick spike of cpu for the second or so after it s placed in the backgrounding and springboard spikes as well but just for a second then cpu usage drops back to the same as when the app is running

7045219
int	chars
i am padding int for barcodes with leading zeros so they have same number of chars for example

7045224
simpleadapter	simplecursoradapter
both simpleadapter and simplecursoradapter have an inner class named viewbinder with method setviewvalue

7045236
int	chars
int main int argc chars argv

7045237
ant	maven
if you choose to use ant do it but maven is not the right tool for this job

7045237
ant	maven
if you really need this done by maven though there is a maven ant plugin which lets you run ant tasks in maven and you could bind this to your deploy step

7045266
width	height
when you set the width and height properties of the textblock control it will first horizontally increase in size to accommodate as much text as it can before wrapping the text if the textwrapping property is set to wrap

7045367
width	height
if you want to draw a texture with pixel accuracy 1 1 texel to pixel then you need to provide a width and height to the vertex positions that is equal to the texture s size not the screen size

7045373
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
i think if you want to do this with a uinavigationbar that does not work in conjunction with a uinavigationcontroller you need to create a custom view for the button that is shaped like the back button

7045406
put	get
in my sql database the table.field corresponding to those workings is job.phase so when i put in my report details the field job.phase i get 3 rows for that job

7045449
sqldatasource	objectdatasource
use the approach in this article except with objectdatasource instead of sqldatasource

7045477
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
i do the same in one of my app s and i use the viewwillappear and viewdidappear to accomplish this

7045489
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
there are only 3 browsers that support websockets right now though google-chrome firefox and safari

7045498
post	get
i cannot get the parameters of my post because in ie it sends a get the firsttime then on subsequent calls it sends post and everything works fine

7045524
put	get
it s going to get some serious attention in the future but right now i need to put a band-aid on it

7045565
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
viewwillappear and viewdidappear will be called each time that view will did show on the screen so this is where you d want to refresh your view or data

7045652
cos	sin
return sin 2 t cos p

7045775
aggregate-functions	sum
it might make more sense to use an aggregate-functions for orderdetail.quantity -- in other words set orderdetail.original_quantity on create then calculate orderdetail.quantity as orderdetail.original_quantity minus the sum of the relevant purchase detail quantities

7045820
folder	directory
i made a console game using visual c# 2008 express the entire game only uses stuff from the system namespace no fancy third party libraries and all it requires is 2 folder in the root directory for storing xml files that it creates

a great synopsis of and example of php using thrift at introduction to rest thrift and avro which is part of the excellent online version of hbase the definitive guide by lars geroge

7045979
jobs	cron
if so is there a way to further prevent this apart from adding the address to some whitelists or setting up domain keys or unix cron jobs

7045984
google-chrome	safari
i ve managed to duplicate these symptoms on only google-chrome win safari win and safari mac

7045984
opera	firefox
i have validated the html and the same page tests fine in ie9 win firefox win and opera win

7045984
google-chrome	firefox
css google-chrome issue at footer cross browsers ie firefox google-chrome

7046021
jobs	cron
setting up domain keys or unix cron jobs

7046028
jobs	cron
this is similar to the nix cron jobs approach you know of except that it is executed at run time - you create say one thread for every 5 addresses you are sending and then all the threads send out 5 mails one after the other

7046036
hide	show
showintaskbar exclusively decides show hide effect in this case thanks to pinowthebird for nudging me to take a re-look

now my question is whether i should use nginx purely or i should continue using apache with nginx

7046160
apache	nginx

the only things you should do when supporting multitasking is saving the state of your app when it enters the backgrounding and reload it when it becomes active

7046218
backgrounding	multitasking
the only thing that would crash your app that is unique to multitasking would be trying to run code in the backgrounding for longer than the allotted amount of time which is 10 minutes. otherwise it sounds like you have got other problems with your code

7046264
projectile	angle
then from there take the rotation angle of the tank to determine which angle the projectile should go after it s been fired

7046318
apache	nginx
you could still use the rewrite rules from apache with slight modifications i took this from nginx primer

7046318
apache	nginx
i would also research any apache modules that your relying on and ensure that the nginx equivalents include the same functionality

7046318
apache	nginx
in the end if your goal is better performance then the migration from apache to nginx should be worth it

7046349
serializable	deserialization
an alternative is to use a delimiter and escaping but requires more code and is slower both on serializable and deserialization however the result can be kept human readable

7046427
std	ostream
you might want to give your classes void myclass serialize std ostream and void myclass deserialize std ifstream and call those

7046428
activemq	rabbitmq
rabbitmq is an amqp broker while activemq is a jms one

7046428

7046886
google-chrome	firefox
i m trying to convert a google-chrome extension to firefox using addon sdk jetpack

7046907
width	height
changing the width and height doesn t mean much memory wise since the same image file is being loaded

7046955
mouseup	mousedown
i ll give you an example and let you decide assume you have a path drawn from a beginning point p m mousedown to an endpoint mouseup p n

7046955

on a tablet this is a waste of space and you often want to display several activities worth of content on a single screens

7047131
disk	ram
yes it is exposed in ram and unless the operating system supports protection of memory against paging and the application uses that feature the private key can be paged to disk in the clear. development tools and active attacks can look for it in memory

7047132
jar	manifest.mf
you just add the jar files into the main jar and then announce the libraries on your manifest.mf file

7047158
width	height
edit creating and appending an iframe and simply setting its height and width to 100 works but isn t the goal here

7047315
post	get
then your php page will be better equipped to handle either get or post

7047340
filtering	grouping
i thought that if server mode lets you do filtering and grouping on the database there should definitely be a way to do it without paging support

7047354
int	chars
there are a couple of ways you can do this but they all pretty much rely on converting an int to a string reversing the order of the chars inserting a delimiter between every third chars and reversing the order once more

7047413
scheme	racket
it has a sophisticated type system designed to match the idioms of racket scheme code and it interoperates with untyped modules by protecting typed functions with dynamic software contracts also implemented via macros

now if this data could be shown i also want to move the rows horizontal and also vertical a via code and b via drag drop

7047657
width	height
i don t know about what griffin said is true or not but what i would do is take the bitmapdata and draw it into another bitmapdata object with the final height and width to what you want then use matrix to scale in the original image while you draw to the new bitmap

7047666
innodb	myisam
if you want to be sure that the db won t get messed up use transaction innodb or lock myisam

7047671

this uses apc s cache but you could work similarly with memcached redis etc

7047738
punctuation	words
b words boundary space punctuation etc

7047741
hash	salt
in phpass they seem to go through great lengths to produce a salt that is as truly random as possible to be used for the hash reading from dev urandom

7047741
hash	salt
isn t the point simply to make sure that the salt used for the hash are different from each other rather than random

7047750
qmodelindex	qabstractitemmodel
qmodelindex is not a model in the sense of model view controller mvc but an adress of an object in a qabstractitemmodel which is the datastructure under all of qt s itemview objects including your tree

7048010
swt	swing
are you using swing or swt

7048013
hash	md5
to get the md5 hash of a file at .

7048018
hash	md5
use sha1 instead of md5 since many version control system like git use sha1 hash itself to identify uniqueness of file

7048028
hash	md5
with that in mind two entirely different files will produce the exact same md5 hash same problem with the other hash although you can have much less collisions by using a better hash method than md5

7048033
width	height	actualheight	actualwidth
you can place the usercontrol in a grid which binds its width height to the fixedpage actualwidth actualheight to achieve centering

7048038
put	get
if i put in a wait time after catching the socketexception and before resuming the loop it will typically recover but eventually i ll get the error again

children	parent
mouseenter will allow children to trigger their parent s mouseenter event

7048110
width	height
so i am trying to assure the image does not bypass the width of 600px and height of 410px but i do not wish for the image to be maxing out this dimensions and look weird it has to be displayed as it would be but just in smaller scale

7048119

hide	show
if you are disconcerted by watching images start off big then shrinking hide the image by default and then show it after resizing

7048158
firefox	safari
this method works but only safari will auto start my slideshow now and firefox needs interaction to trigger a start

7048158
firefox	safari
however i did find that switching the var to true at the start and switching around the order of the mouseovers it then auto starts fine in firefox and not in safari

7048161
width	height
giving the div 100 height and width will make it take up the entire of the window

versioning	upgrade
prior to this i had upgrade their versioning of windward reports in a separate branch and they want to make sure that the processed files contracts forms etc

7048355
serializable	deserialization
would it be fair to say that you need serializable to and deserialization from a custom format

7048356
put	get
to get it to work you need to copy the dtd you want the server local machine edit it appropriately and put it in a publically accessible place

7048365
inline	inlining
in practice i have managed this by using compiler specific force_no_inline type hints for cases i don t want inlining and a separate force_inline copy or macro in the rare case this fails of the function for when i want it inline

7048378
rss	feed
rss feed display

7048397

filesystems	fat
the exact message out of disk utility is unable to attach image floppy.img. no mountable filesystems even though i just formatted the disk with a fat 16 filesystems

7048533
put	get
however i must have some fundamental misunderstanding about how string outputs work because for the life of me i cannot get this to output correctly no matter where i put the tab the newline or whether i use an endl in my code

7048557
allocator	stl
so basically what is being stated is that if there were actual private data-members that had to be managed especially in light of the requirement for a stl allocator to allow rebinding that could greatly complicate the implementation of a generic allocator depending on what those per-instance data-members represented

7048606
textmate	notepad++
there is also an online textmate to notepad++ theme converter

7048608
int	double

7048624
folder	directory
okay so what i did was deleted everything from my server and uploaded the application and system folder to my public_html www root directory

7048632
put	get
now i ve heard when you get into obscenely large datasets doing things in a distributed enviornment does not help anymore because the transmission time overwhelms the counting time and in your case of word counting everything has to be put back together anyway so then you have to use some very sophisticated techniques that i suspect you can find in research papers

7048645
apache	nginx
run something like nginx as the reverse proxy and have both apache and node on non-80 ports -

7049206
union	distinct
the union operator will throw out duplicate rows between the two result sets much like select distinct does for a single result set

7049206
aggregate-functions	sum
to eliminate null rows from the query which are the result of aggregate-functions like sum over empty data sets just do something like this

another way could be to create the md5 hash of the binary and then append it to the executable

7053720
hash	md5
if you store the 128 bit md5 hash in a raw format base 256 instead of base 16 you only need 16 byte

7053758
google-chrome	firefox
this works great in google-chrome and firefox but am having no luck in any version of ie

7053782
uiview	calayer
uiview geometry updates apply immediately to their calayer even in an animation block

7053802
hash	md5
this will work as the md5 string will be stored in the data segment keeping the validity of the precalculated hash of any other memory segment valid

7053843
istream	getline
if it were me i would copy using std getline or istream rdbuf

7053853
maven	pom.xml
to use it from maven just include the following dependency in the pom.xml file

7053867
put	get
even if you prefer killing the thread over unloading the appdomain i d still put each contestant into an appdomain to get the isolation

7053873
vim	emacs
â the safe commands include anything listed in etc shells plus screen tmux emacs vi vim nano pico and top

7053948
ubuntu	debian
on debian ubuntu this can be done as follows

7053964
width	height
i got it to display a full height but i m having trouble with the width it keeps either not working at all or generating a inline width of 500px on each list item which i m not sure where it is pulling it from

7054021
post	get
generally browsers only support get and post verbs

7054021
post	get
links by default result in a get verb and form submissions in post

7054021
post	get
in conjunction with the first column if you use messages_path with http get it would match first route and if you use it with post it will match second route

7054036
width	height
i have x y top left width height and rotation in degrees and i need to fast calculate minx miny maxx maxy of that rectangle

7054038
ubuntu	debian
the package would have been libxrender-dev for ubuntu debian systems

7054038
rpm	yum
for rpm systems the package is called xrender and you install it with yum

7054081
versioning	upgrade
the solution would be to upgrade to the latest versioning if you haven t already

7054096
post	get
i have a select element that does a post using jquery on a change event i was trying to post it to a snippet and get the results back however it seems that if the snippet is called directly from javascript there will be no notion of the object and i can t access the db using pdo my code is as follows

7054108
postgresql	mysql
h2 has a very good feature for test purpose.it has sql support which runs compatibility sql for ibm db2 apache derby hsqldb ms sql server mysql oracle and postgresql

7054158
implements	extends
you extends from a new class implements its methods which specify what data you want to be indexed by zend lucene

7054182
addslashes	htmlspecialchars
from there i use a variety of methods from htmlspecialchars to addslashes

7054225
updatepanel	scriptmanager
the scriptmanager is meant to be used with async postbacks which is why it works with the updatepanel

7054225
updatepanel	scriptmanager
so if you re going to be posting back from an updatepanel be sure to use the scriptmanager instead of clientscript

7054227
width	height
â containâ scale the image while preserving its intrinsic aspect ratio if any to the largest size such that both its width and its height can fit inside the background positioning area

7054250
post	get
then by hitting this link 4 hello-world-love-you it will send to another file called post.php the id as 4 hello-world-love-you and by using then i can get the real id of the post back which is 4 and do anything i want that is exactly i m thinking about

7054305
ubuntu	linux
i have been running django and rails on my ubuntu linux system for a while and i recently had to install xampp lampp because i have to do some local php development

7054322
hash	md5
while in general md5 hash values cannot be used in injection attacks it s worth pointing out that raw md5 hash values can be exploited

7054322
hash	md5
raw md5 hash are hash generated with

7054325
innodb	myisam
would there be any difference between using innodb and myisam storage engines for this

7054331
innodb	myisam
and there will be no significant difference between myisam and innodb in this case

7054332
post	get
if you have an index on user field of post table you will get decent query speeds also

7054347
width	height
you need an explicit height and width on your control - background images don t cause the div to grow to fit them

7054354
public	protected
there are no guarantees about the order of members in different protected private public regions

7054361
width	height
if you want to avoid displaying the webbrowser you may be able to just instantiate it in code behind instead and failing that try just giving it a height and width of 0

7054376
google-chrome	safari
safari and google-chrome have developer tools but the console is lacking

7054376
google-chrome	safari
without having to place a breakpoint is the script is it possible to see the response within safari or google-chrome s developer tools

7054416
subtract	add
you can watch the front door to an auditorium and add the people that come in and subtract those the leave but what if some sneak in the back door

7054426
inherited	properties
for the inherited properties

7054463
put	get
well your program actually does nothing so if you were to optimize it put the -o2 back into the cops environment variable you would get this

7054469
nsdatecomponents	nscalendar
since you get the nsdatecomponents with an nscalendar you can use settimezone on the calendar to get the components month day hour etc. for the time zone you re interested in

7054471
post	get
the single ssl_read will grab an entire get or post request

7054479
geocoding	geocode
performing 100 geocode each time your page is loaded will take tens of seconds so i suggest geocoding in advance

7054479
geocoding	geocode
if the addresses are always the same or rarely change you can geocode them in advance using the geocoding and temporarily store the resulting lat lngs on your server as long as they are only ever displayed on a maps api map

7054520
drawrect	layoutsubviews
if there are a bunch of calls to things like glgenframebuffers that are triggered as a result of layoutsubviews drawrect or some other method that isn t called directly by the relevant init then that proves it

7054521
submit	submission
no one is submission a form with their email clicking submit and triggering an e-mail it s just a daily email to all users that for simplicities sake we ll say should contain the receiving user s email address

7054535
gentoo	linux
jnlp-bin-1.2 is needed when installing netbeans on gentoo linux and for license problems i have to download it manually

7054543
uiview	uiwindow
it adds a fullscreen uiview to the uiwindow to intercept touches

7054543
portrait	landscape
i need to use it in a landscape ipad app but the view of my popover controller is still displayed portrait rather than landscape

7054545
post	get
also in your case you should not pass the textarea contents via get but rather via post as described in the jquery documentation

7054552
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
i ve made a for-loop to loops through an arrays of all the contacts people but it only seems to work once

7054570
hide	show
controller hide the popover and then show it again at the end of the

7054570
uiviewcontroller	uipopovercontroller
so the uipopovercontroller isn t rotating the popover view that it maintains like a uiviewcontroller would

7054570
uiviewcontroller	uipopovercontroller
this makes sense considering that uipopovercontroller inherits from nsobject and therefore doesn t inherit the uiviewcontroller s code that handles the rotation

7054570
uiview	uiwindow
when you add your fullscreen uiview to the uiwindow the uiview exists within the uiwindow coordinate space

7054570
uiviewcontroller	uipopovercontroller
your custom uipopovercontroller could manage the rotation but it would be easier to get this for free using a uiviewcontroller subclass if possible

7054579
fadein	fadeout
you could just add a keyup handler and check the if the s value has transitioned from none to some or some to none and then apply a fadein or fadeout to the button

7054583
stdout	stderr
gui apps don t have a stdin stdout or stderr assigned automatically

7054598
margin	text-align
i have applied the text-align and margin using inline styles while i was building the page

7054692
int	double
and varargs functions can only take built-in types pointers to anything int double

7054741
realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc	calloc	malloc
tracking dynamically-allocated memory the memory allocation functions malloc calloc and realloc and the c++ new operator return pointer values

7054761
stdout	stderr
this would output a sorted foo.txt to stderr the number of lines in rot13 d foo.txt to out.txt and the number of non-duplicate lines of rot13 d foo.txt to stdout

7054829
children	parent
it creates a parent with two children saves them and then loads them and prints out the graph

7054841
persistent	transient
basically the unsaved-value on the id of the object determines if it s transient or persistent

7054848
nsoperationqueue	nsinvocationoperation
nsinvocationoperation nsoperationqueue for easy clean threading code

7054861
mouseover	mouseout
you are both fading in and fading out the same element upon each mouseover and mouseout

7054869
width	height
although ie 8 doesn t recognise the updated width and height of the images you can mimic the new sizes by setting their margins

7054874
onmouseover	mouseout
if you pass only one function it will call it onmouseover as well as mouseout event

7054922
width	height
the first box on the paper is 5â in width by 2â in height starting at â œ new rectanglef 60.0f 200.0f 560.0f 200.0f â

7054925
superclass	subclassing
if the subclassing does not add any ivars to the superclass you can actually get away with the following

7054932
client-side	server-side
from my limited experience and research this has more to do with client-side java bridge rather then server-side

7054974
typedef	struct
assuming that map.c is not including iohelper.c it only sees the typedef but not the declaration of struct filevalues

7055005
post	get
i was wondering what level of post format customization embedded ads i could get with wordpress

7055041
int	boolean
the first two are int the other is a boolean

7055041
width	height
you could make the above query into a stored procedure that takes rectangle width and height parameters and then call it with those sizes until you find a match

7055047
equals	gethashcode
and while you re defining your own operator do remember to go ahead and define and override equals and gethashcode

7055089
for-loop	loops
if your going to be incrementing a counter during your loops i would suggest using a classic for-loop as opposed to a foreach

7055122
debian	linux
the nokia n900 comes with maemo 5 linux and can easily run a full debian linux for arm

7055184
innodb	myisam
but the problem is i have to use myisam table type itself and not innodb

7055197
mouseup	mousedown
everyone s right that chrome doesn t capture the resize event and that chrome doesn t capture the mousedown so you need to set the init state and then handle changes through mouseup

7055208
children	parent
every node in a dom tree is fully aware of its parent and children

7055232
mouseup	mousedown
the mouseeventargs with coordinates receive only mouseup and mousedown

7055232
mouseup	mousedown
mouseclick can t recive you cordinates because click consists from mouseup and mousedown and it both can have different coordinates

7055239
mouseup	mousedown
chrome doesn t capture the resize event and that chrome doesn t capture the mousedown so you need to set the init state and then handle changes through mouseup

7055257
prepare	execute
in my insert function i would like to build a prepare pdo insert statement and execute it

7055266
innodb	myisam
have two tables ti and tm i for innodb and m for myisam

7055332
getter	setter
how can implement this getter and setter

7055356
readonly	temporary
i have a datagridview i want to enable inline editing i can make that by setting the value of readonly to false but the editing is temporary when i close the form and re-open it the changes are missed

7055370
google-chrome	firefox
support for rgba isn t universal - firefox and google-chrome support it but ie 8 and below don t so remember to specify a fallback colour

7055388
post	get
post redirect get causes two lifecycle scenarios

7055400
width	text-align
if you don t put a width on the paragraph it will not work because it will assume 100 and your image will be aligned left unless of course you use text-align center

7055429
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
communications are packet-based and the concept of packets is implemented using a set of classes and objectinputstream objectoutputstream wrapper for socket streams

7055431
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
newer browsers google-chrome firefox safari etc have that capability built in

7055439
awt	swing
a problem arose however because the background thread was reading a card by poll ing the list that was serving as the data model for a swing component and raising lots of awt array index out of range exceptions

7055466
free	malloc
also it is preferable to use new and delete instead of malloc and free

7055477
sqldatasource	linqdatasource
in case of sqldatasource there should be insert update delete commands specified for linqdatasource there should be allowupdate allowinsert allowdelete

7055494
int	chars	int	double	int	boolean
btw why doesn t null.asinstanceof int null.asinstanceof double null.asinstanceof boolean null.asinstanceof chars throw nullpointerexception

7055520
client-side	server-side
replace sleep in php with places the delay client-side instead of server-side

7055522
ienumerable	iqueryable
your result variable is not an ienumerable - it is an iqueryable

7055530
width	height
i guess you use this css attribute so that it match the width and height that you ve specified

7055533
int	double
random is a double so if you want a int multiply it by 1 000 000 000 then drop the figures after the decimal place

7055558
width	height
to render an bitmap image to a different size scale you simple use an image element and set its width height as desired

7055571
versioning	upgrade
i am using grails 1.4.0.m1 and i am trying to upgrade the versioning of gpars to use with my app

7055628
struts-tags	taglib
taglib uri struts-tags prefix s

7055632
iboutlet	ibaction
you can make your ui elements created in ib interact with your code by means of iboutlet and ibaction

7055637
width	height
this works fine the problem is that i can no longer use the width and height attributes in the html img tag they will have no effect

7055649
sql-insert	sql-delete	sql-insert	sql-update	sql-delete	sql-update
list of possible elements expected loader sql-insert sql-update sql-delete sql-delete-all filter in namespace urn nhibernate-mapping-2.2 .

7055654
put	get
there is no particular solution for this problem.i will suggest that you should put code on which is in inside onclicklistener in the begining of textchangedlistener so that the code that u want to get execute first will execute first then the code that you want to get execute last will execute last.hope this will help you

7055662
post	get
so if i search help me or help me i get the post however if i search me help i don t

7055662
post	get
i want to search me help and still get the post

7055662
post	get
or if a post s title is help me please and i search help please i ll still get the post.

7055662
post	get
so how do i get the query searching me help to get the post help me

7055679
ubuntu	linux
i am new in ubuntu and linux and have simple-lamer question

7055698
post	get
now how should i make the sql query to get all post that have tags with

7055698
post	get
is it possible to query only the two tables post and tags and get the correct result

7055719
mouse	keyboard
they are custom panels that i use mouse keyboard listeners on and use my own graphics to paint over them

7055726
rss	feed
how can i show rss feed with images using jquery

7055875
addition	multiplication
all classes addition expression multiplication are defined and declared

7055897
spaces	delimiter
in scanf spaces and n is delimiter for the character i p

7055903
int	chars
the printf n d a will print a newline chars n and the int value 1000 which makes a total of 5 chars

7055940
try-catch	exception-handling
since does not throw exception-handling one of the try-catch blocks are completely unnecessary

7055949
super	abstract
the pattern is that of an abstract method and it works here because ruby is using inheritance on the class side as well so class methods may use super as well

7055966
gitolite	gitosis
note this answer is for gitolite as that s what i started using instead of gitosis as per the first comment to my question

7055997
google-chrome	firefox
tested in ie7+ firefox 5.0 and google-chrome

7056024
implements	extends
the metallookandfeel extends basiclookandfeel which extends lookandfeel and implements serializable so there s no point in adding serializable again

7056036
iboutlet	ibaction
hope this helps to clear things up a bit on iboutlet and ibaction

7056068
folder	directory
your templates folder either needs to be in an app that has been listed in installed_apps or in a directory that has been listed in template_dirs - in your settings.py file

7056083
getter	setter
that is for a val x a getter method named x is generated and a setter named is generated

7056153
antivirus	mcafee
now i need to know how to unblock the firewall of my mcafee antivirus such that the error of connection refusal is not present

7056157
installation	upgrade
it seems like there is in fact not enough memory for this amount of gems i am using but again this seems very weird - it works perfectly fine on snow leopard and even at my company on mac mini with lion - the only difference is that the mini is upgrade snow leopard - lion whilst on my imac its a clean lion installation

7056169
codeigniter	cakephp
i tried codeigniter cakephp early stages and zend

7056196
ant	maven
i would not worry about compiling and running the project either but if you really want you can setup ant or maven to do it

7056220
maven	m2e
once you have sorted out building your project with maven and adopted the m2e plugin to get maven to work with eclipse you may want to check out the maven assembly plugin with which you will be able to produce a zip file that packs together your project with all its dependencies and possibly a launch script that takes care of setting your classpath without invoking your project s startup class

7056222
post	get
better late than never but i think you re after the iwsdlexportextension behaviour which allows you to modify the wsdl generated by wcf when the service is hosted - here is a good blog post on how to get started when implementing this interface

7056224
fadein	hide
will i have to change that into a class add another one that hide the links and reapply the the class when the fadein starts or is there an easier method

7056230
maven	pom.xml
also with maven you need to provide only pom.xml file containing definition of dependencies and project build configuration

7056230
maven	pom.xml
maven takes care about all of these things following your configuration defined in pom.xml file

7056234
maven	m2e
i ve installed maven and the m2e eclipse plugin

7056240
pull	push
to be able to push to another hg repository you have to pull git changes into your hg repo then push

7056278
mouse	keyboard
see how to simulate mouse and keyboard events in code

7056291
gif	png
that includes jpeg png and gif

7056301
put	get
if it s correct try put again before flash and see what you get

7056325
rss	feed
this is the way that you would redirect say an rss feed to an atom feed or something where you may have multiple input formats but only one output format

7056361
hide	show
i want to show different keyboardtypes when user clicks on specific uitextfields i can do that but then i lose the ability to hide the keyboard while pressing the done button

7056400
fadein	fadeout
how can i reuse fadein fadeout animation variables to acheive the same goal

7056428
width	height
these find the width and height of the body element so unless you ve done something strange to the body element then this should work

7056431
for-loop	loops
in theory the while loops is quicker because the for-loop looks up the length attribute of foo every time though loops but in real-world use it s going to make an immeasurably small difference

7056435
for-loop	while-loop
it would be more meaningful to compare the above while-loop with the following for-loop

7056441
for-loop	loops
for your for-loop you can store the length before loops and work on that value instead of retrieving it every time

7056449
integer	unsigned
you should use a signed integer by removing the unsigned modifier

7056468
integer	unsigned
since the integer is unsigned the compiler will optimize this to an infinite loop

7056480
integer	unsigned
i will tell you an elegant way to do what you want to do with an unsigned integer

7056519
maven	pom.xml
with maven there s no logic in the pom.xml

7056541
implements	extends
make your class extends activity and not listactivity implements onitemclicklistener.

7056609
actionscript	mxml
but the problem i am facing is when i am trying to import one of the .mxml component in my actionscript of main file of mxml application then i am not able to do so .can some one help me in importing one mxml file into other mxml file

7056631
integer	unsigned
by defining the i as unsigned int you have made it a always non-negative integer therefore all the possible values i can have are all positive integers in its range and 0

7056674
config	ini
this seems like the cleanest solution to me as then all config data are stored in the one place regardless of their source being an ini file or the db

7056713
maya	blender
if you just want to show pre-rendered 3d images in your game why not create them using a real 3d graphics tool such as 3d studio max or maya or a free one such as blender

7056758
submit	submission
i am using the submit button onclick method for form submission

7056841
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
as of today the library supports firefox 3.0+ safari 3.0+ google-chrome 5.0+ opera 9.5+ and internet explorer 6.0+

7056844
subtract	add
so the rule for predicting keys forwards is to subtract the sum of all the smallest keys dealt with so far and then add the largest key value as many times as is required to bring the value into range

7056844
subtract	add
similarly the rule for deducing keys backwards will be to subtract the sum of all the smallest keys dealt with so far and then to add the largest key value as many times as is required to bring the value into range

7056844
subtract	add
i think that looking up values by order index 1st value 2nd value 3rd value is the same principle - keep track of a value to add or subtract that accounts for the total rotation so far and add or subtract the total number of items in the map to bring things back into range

7056849
hide	show
i have seen this done with a flag on the table to indicate whether to show or hide the record in case you are worried about showing the intervening layer when it is just a dummy record

7056859
hide	show
with oleg help i have been able to code a reconfigpermissions function that show hide default add edit and delete buttons

7056874
jboss	weblogic	jboss	glassfish	glassfish	weblogic
jax-rs is a standard that makes it easy to create a restful service that can be deployed to any java application server glassfish weblogic websphere jboss etc

7056896
super	self
i found a way to call super for self if there were a super

7057000
folder	directory
like an idiot this is what i was doing wrong 1 passed permission in as a string and not an integer 2 was including the file name in the mkdir so therefore the file name was within the folder but was set as a directory 3 did not include the file name in the fopen

7057116
int	double
and since converting from double to int cuts off everything after the decimal point you get 72

7057128
post	get
i m guessing that in order to get this to work you will first have to send that post request in order to get the select will all of the options

7057154
innodb	myisam
i don t want to use myisam because innodb is more advanced

7057155
folder	directory
i have a directory in my folder

7057166
put	get
this seems very wasteful because i could have dozens of concrete classes implementing myordered and they would all get a copy of the same code when in fact it would be enough to just put it directly in the base class myordered

7057166
implements	extends
in that case it is still not implements in an abstract scala class that extends the trait but it cannot be implements in a java class that extends the abstract scala class because it is flagged as final

7057175
ia-32	x86
take for example the instruction that tells an x86 ia-32 processor

7057269
onresume	onpause
however lock mode works with the onresume onpause couple

7057296
ienumerable	iqueryable
what about ienumerable or iqueryable

7057296
ienumerable	iqueryable
how can we know which one is ienumerable and which one is iqueryable

7057318
ienumerable	iqueryable
as for whether it s ienumerable or iqueryable - that depends on the type of database.casetables

7057322
hash	salt
don t hash your salt like that

7057322
crypt	salt
crypt s blowfish hashing takes a 22-character base64-encoded string using characters . 0-9a-za-z for a salt which amounts to 128 bits of entropy

7057322
hash	salt
the sha-512 hash you re using to create your salt has 512 bits of entropy

7057368
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
for instance run this one on google-chrome or a recent version of firefox or opera

7057368
google-chrome	firefox
you said for instance that a reverse loop is faster in google-chrome but a forward loop is faster in firefox

7057368
google-chrome	firefox
as google-chrome s v8 is dramatically faster than firefox s spidermonkey at the moment these things are constantly in flux pick the forward loop as it s faster on the slower engine

7057428
multiplying	add
my color class has methods for simple blend effects such as add multiplying etc

7057510
sorting	filtering
sometimes it can be simpler to use a flat file for data storage csv json but a proper database can provide better performance on filtering sorting and joining data

7057518
post	get
also i had to add copy app.config â œ targetpath .configâ to post build events and finally i get a test.exe.config file but still the programm doesn t run on a windows xp sp3 with the net framework 4 and the visual c++ 2010 redistributable.

versioning	upgrade
i currently have ruby versioning 1.8.2 in my machine and i would like to upgrade it to 1.9.2

7057547
opera	google-chrome
this test case seems to work in opera 11.5 ie9 ff5 google-chrome 13

7057555
post	get
now i extract the code and make a post request to get the oauth token and if i get the token i make a request for the contacts

7057555
post	get
so it seems that the get request is not being made moreover i am not able to see the post request being made in firebug but surely its being made because i get the access token as the response

7057555
post	get
i also dont see the get request in firebug which i make after post request whats wrong

7057555
post	get
because i still dont understand why i am unable to see those get and post requests in firebug s net tab

vala	genie
one item missing from jacindas list you might want to know about vala genie is a compiler targetting c with the gobject library implementing objects written by gnome

7057569
vala	genie
vala is a c#-like syntax and genie a python-like syntax but for the rest they are the same system

7057620
width	height
i want to create a simple program that will convert a pdf to a jpg with the longest height or width set to a specific pixel amount and a 1px border applied

7057688
versioning	upgrade
if you upgrade to 2.0.0.m1 the dependency is gone and you can use whatever versioning of gpars you like

7057714
width	height
is it possible to draw a circle using -webkit-border-radius in css3 whilst constraining the width and height to specific variables such as height 100px and width 100px so when text is added inside the circle the text wraps instead of forcing the size of the circle to change

7057758
versioning	upgrade
it depends on what ubuntu versioning you are running you can get the ruby packages with this link searchon names suite all section all to get the latest ruby 1.9.2-p290 installed you have to upgrade your ubuntu to oneiric if you don t like to upgrade your system maybe you have to install ruby with rvm as fl00r answered

7057838
hide	show
updated in the comment you asked me how to hide or to show the buttons in the navigator bar dynamically

7057838
hide	show
the code just call or to hide show the add button

7057899
folder	directory
i intend to copy the compiled .o files into my project s lib or include directory but should the .hh and .cc files be left in the src folder or placed elsewhere to ease the cleaning process

7057935
atomikos	bitronix
there are many implementations of this api basically each java ee server has its own implementation and there are other ones like jotm bitronix atomikos for example

7057955
richfaces	tomahawk	versioning	upgrade
i have just upgrade an app previously running on richfaces 3and jsf 1.2 to jsf2 and richfaces 4 the app was also using tomahawk for the spread radio buttons so we also upgrade to the jsf2 versioning for tomahawk i am getting the error below when i try to load a page

7057958
width	margin
in general you ll want to be conservative with setting width 100 on elements as with the standard box model that 100 does not include padding margin border on the element and will often push it outside the bounding box of its parent

7057966
accessor	properties	accessor	ivar
modern 64-bit runtimes will generate an ivar for accessor properties so you don t even need to create the ivar

7057966
getter	setter
for every property there are two methods unless the property is declared readonly in which case there is only one there is the getter which returns the same type as the ivar and is of the same name as the ivar as well as the setter which is not declared with a readonly ivar

7057977
pull	push
i read it uses xerces by default which is what type - push or pull

7057995
super	implements
if you implements this method but are building your application for ios 2.x your dealloc method should release each object but should also set the reference to that object to nil before calling super

7058121
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
i ve been doing some testing on this it seems fonts from google are cached fine on google-chrome and opera only firefox has problems

7058127
post	put
now the der1 object pointer is put inside an event object and the event is post into a queue

7058153
innodb	myisam
strictly speaking mysql has only partial acid-compliance for tables other than those with the non-default storage engines innodb bdb and cluster and myisam does not support user-instigated transactions

7058165
children	parent
-s change the way the process time is calculated by summing all exited children to their parent process

7058176
integer	unsigned
this works as intended as long as null is represented as 0 and pointer comparison is compiled as an unsigned integer comparison

7058179
metaclass	subclassing
one thing i ve found metaclass useful for is to invoke a function whenever a subclassing is created

7058179
metaclass	subclassing
i codified this into a metaclass which looks for an __initsubclass__ attribute whenever a subclassing is created all parent classes which define that method are invoked with __initsubclass__ cls subcls

7058193
postgresql	mysql
we have a legacy schema file which has the following column names would like to understand if any of them would cause an issue if we port our application to h2 mysql postgresql or oracle

7058194
folder	directory
but you have to inform your kowmanager s index.php that the system folder is not located in the same directory

7058299
ffmpeg	avisynth
with ffmpeg overlaying images using the command line by far the most powerful and elegant way to do this is with a tool called avisynth

7058299
ffmpeg	avisynth
all videos on this ecard site are created with ffmpeg and avisynth

7058353
portrait	landscape
my pcture are full blade but i always get a kind of black borders both in portrait or landscape orientation

7058358
shoes	fxruby
i know that cross platform guis can be built in ruby using various tools like shoes and fxruby but do these types of tools have platform specific access to the level that i need

7058386
portrait	landscape
each subclassed view controller contains a device-specific xib with each xib containing portrait and landscape uiviews which are switched upon orientation change i followed for this

7058387
int	chars
just do a notice that i ve explicitly instantiated the int version but passed the chars parameters

7058424
pull	push
the original repo commiter owner will have to add your mynewrepoongithub as his remote and pull your changes and merge them and push them the original repo

7058444
put	get
2 if you put a static global in a .h file and include it then you will not get any error because for every different translation unit there will be a different copy for that static global variable

7058445
onresume	onpause
you could use the lifecycle events like oncreate onresume onpause etc to track loading unloading of details

7058454
content-length	content-type
are any http headers retrievable such as content-type or content-length

7058455
for-loop	loops
the while loops should encompase the for-loop - it doesn t

7058460
fgets	fread
start with standard c i o with fopen and fread fscanf fgets and so forth

7058462
viewdidload	dealloc
note that in the dealloc there s no need to set the variables to nil but it won t hurt doing so so we can use same method for both viewdidload and dealloc

7058517
uidatepicker	uipickerview
it seems uidatepicker is not customizable via a delegate like uipickerview

7058519
post	get
makholm a browser sends a trace request of course generally speaking browsers just use get and post then a web server responses the request

7058537
imageview	imageswitcher
i have tried using a baseadapter to update the textswitcher in a similar manner to how the imageswitcher updates the images in the imageview but i am running into a wall here

7058542
put	get
essentially i m trying to get my makefile located in the codeblocks directory to compile the files contained within src and have the object files put into the obj directory

7058564
children	parent
can you dock a child window control in c++ win32 api like are there ws_ styles or something or do you always have to listen for the wm_size message on the parent window and manually re-layout fill all the children

7058570
ssl	https
what s wrong with ssl https

7058586
valgrind	callgrind
the valgrind suite has a tool called callgrind that will tell you what is calling what

7058619
pull	push
so once a push is made to the remote repo a pull has to be made on web server to get the most recent commits which in your case includes deletion of the file test.html

7058627
crypt	hash	crypt	salt	hash	salt
i am creating a hash using crypt with the password and the salt

7058627
crypt	hash
the problem is that the hash that is the result of the crypt algorithm is different

7058670
int	chars
the implicit instantiation just means the compiler can figure out the int and chars from the types of the arguments

7058671
int	boolean
you can store those checkboxes variables as tiny int or boolean in the database or you can store them in a single column text data type as json format like this beer 0 wine 1 .and that s in case of increasing those options in the future and also you can use json_ encode json_decode to convert array to json format in php

7058672
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
for instance on my macbook pro with all the latest browsers safari firefox google-chrome this doesn t work

7058674
stdout	stderr
these file descriptors could also have been inherited from your parent process as usually happens for the first three file descriptors 0 stdin 1 stdout 2 stderr

7058674
integer	unsigned
the second parameter is a pointer to a buffer and the third parameter is the buffer s size as an unsigned integer

7058674
x86	64bit
be careful that it is completely different on 64bit x86 be sure you are assembling in 32-bit mode and linking a 32-bit executable

7058730
ssl	https
if you want to use https you must pay your hosting provider for buying and installing certificate for you or you must have plan which offers ssl or shared ssl directly

7058735
hash	salt
so i d guess the hash from your server is falling back to des since it contains only the first 2 characters of your salt

7058784
calloc	malloc
if you use malloc and calloc to make a linked list of structs there s no special reason to move over to an nsarray

7058829
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it works perfectly in ie firefox and safari - but in google-chrome the background image will only rotate once and no further images are rotated unless i refresh the browser via f5

7058829
setinterval	settimeout
i ve been pounding my brain on this one for the rotation function i ve switched between settimeout setinterval and for image-preloading good measure i ve swapped between window .load function document .ready function but nothing seems to do the trick - i always have to refresh chrome in order for more than one image rotation to occur

7058840
gif	png
post images photo content type is not one of image jpg image jpeg image png image gif which is perfectly fine

7058856
interpolation	splines
at the start i used simple techniques like polynomial and splines interpolation however even with a little noise the result still failed to appear sufficiently human-like

7058887
width	height
i like that i don t need to supply tablelayout with any fixed width or height values however i have had to use strange work-arounds like an empty between two buttons to create a fake 3rd column stuff like that

7058887
width	height
for instance if you have a ldpi device will it display your ui differently as it has less width and height pixels

7058902
int	chars
1. it is weird for the statement above because i remember besides signed int signed chars is also one type of variable exist in c so that s mean the value from -128 to 127 can be used.but why still the book mention -1 does not contradict to any chars use for keyboard input

7058903
listview	gridview
thats impossible with a asp gridview but you can easily achieve this using an asp listview

7058916
screens	hdpi	screens	mdpi	mdpi	hdpi
if you set views distances and sizes with dp those distances in dp will be treated as pixels on an mdpi screens and they will be scaled so your layouts fill the space equally on ldpi and hdpi screens

7058924
int	chars
however getchar returns int and if it s in range 0 to 255 it is a chars but if it returns -1 then it s eof

7058928
int	chars
getchar returns an int which contains either a plain unsigned chars or eof so there is no problem

7058969
hide	show
i ve used jqery function showonlyone thechosenone to show and hide the part of the page that show and is hidden

7059005
google-chrome	firefox
here is a websockets protocol test report listing conformance of google-chrome 14 and firefox 7 8 to specific features of the latest protocol spec

7059017
equals	gethashcode
as a side note you may want to rethink your design and implement your equals and gethashcode using business key

7059032
google-chrome	safari
i tried your script in ie8 safari and google-chrome

7059060
min	max
aggregate functions ie count min max avg etc only work on column references but some accept table

7059082
portrait	landscape
why does xcode says that the selected uiview is in landscape mode if in fact it is on portrait mode

7059096
filesystems	fat
i ve just got to know that some filesystems such as fat store filenames as upper-case regardless of the case used to create them

7059141
put	get
perform an implementation-dependent sequence of calls to the get put and delete internal methods of obj

7059153
listctrl	textctrl
now the user types h into the textctrl and the listctrl is narrowed down to hello and hi

7059168
pascal	delphi
as an example have a look at the so called qtpas wrapper that wraps qt for use in free pascal delphi

7059174
post	get
i can post a full example if you do not get it right just say when

7059186
icomparer	iequalitycomparer
sortedset makes you implement icomparer in the same way that i implemented iequalitycomparer above

7059202
google-chrome	firefox
it displays correctly through google-chrome but in firefox the third right column wraps around to the bottom

7059212
google-chrome	firefox
websockets has sufficient momentum that browser vendors will improve support google-chrome 14 and firefox 7 8 support the latest protocol draft and that a broad range of client and server frameworks will support it

7059281
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it s compatible with firefox 3.7 or higher google-chrome and safari 4 or higher and ie9 or higher

7059298
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome 14 and firefox 7 8 support the latest

7059337
put	get
in an attempt to get back the time you put into xml commenting your custom js to pay off fully

7059363
hide	show
one way to do this is to show a control with the default value in it...then then the user enters the control hide it and show the actual password control at that point

7059384
int	chars
when you read a chars the value is read as an unsigned chars and converted from there to int â 7.19.7.1 2

7059384
int	chars
chars converted to an int and advances the associated file position indicator for the

7059384
fgetc	fread	getchar	fgetc
this particular quote is for fgetc -- getc getchar and fread are all required to read data as if by calling fgetc

7059384
int	chars
this does implicitly at least sort of assume that chars has a smaller range than int so the conversion to int allows at least one value to be represented that couldn t have come from the file

7059384
int	chars
elsewhere the standard denies that as a requirement but i think that denial is unrealistic -- i m pretty sure an implementation with chars and int the same size would break vast amounts of code

7059403
min	max
in firmware have out of bounds min max values for each field year must be at least 2005 and no larger than 2030

7059469
backgrounding	multitasking
i can assure you that google latitude only updates the user s location when it s being run and visible or when it is running as a backgrounding process when multitasking is available

7059488
portrait	landscape
xcode only says its landscape or portrait as a simulated metric hence the title of the group in the inspector

7059488
width	height	portrait	landscape
to solve this problem simply change the width and height of the uiview in landscape make it 1004 x 768 and in portrait do the same 1024 x 748

7059488
portrait	landscape
as you mentioned the reason for this is that your main view was in landscape and when adding new uiviews xcode just assumes they are portrait so the size is portrait and mode is landscape

7059492
put	get
everything is an object and you could for example put in anything or get out anything

7059494
geocoding	geocode
moreover the callback that you specify in the above call is called asynchronously by the geocode when it finished the geocoding

7059529
base-class	derived-class
it s because one needs to define something that is not done in the base-class __init__ and the only possibility to obtain that is to put its execution in a derived-class __init__ function

7059529
inherited	base-class
when the aim is to keep the initialization performed by the base-class that is pure inherited nothing special is needed one must just avoid to define an __init__ function in the derived class

7059529
base-class	derived-class
when the aim is to replace the initialization performed by the base-class __init__ must be defined in the derived-class

7059529
base-class	derived-class
when the aim is to add processes to the initialization performed by the base-class a derived-class __init__ must be defined comprising an explicit call to the base-class __init__

7059534
inherited	subclassing	touchesbegan	touchesended
if you must use uilabel then you need to subclassing it and intercept the touchesbegan touchesended methods inherited from uiresponder to detect uicontroleventtouchupinside yourself

7059590
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the sluggish performance is only happening to me in firefox its fine in safari and google-chrome and i tried disabling all add-ons so dont think its anything like that affecting things

7059607
getter	setter
if you work with an ide then it will create getter and setter for you so in my opinion there is no real excuse for not keeping access to instance variables restricted

7059657
onresume	onpause
one broadcast receiver needs to be registered in onresume and unregistered in onpause

7059661
versioning	upgrade
as an option you can try to upgrade to latest versioning of nhibernate - 3.2

7059720
min	max
e 1 2â mâ v â² + mâ g â max h 0 + 1 2â k â min h 0 â²

7059743
post	get
just encode the bytes with base64encoder and pass it as just another post parameter and use base64decoder to get the original contents back

7059774
multiplying	add
i can t figure out how to get those numbers i need to do basic math like add multiplying etc into a new textview that updates simultaneously

7059786
g++	gcc
i suppose one might argue that the trailing blanks could be deleted in phase 1 but i m not convinced that that s a valid argument -- and i don t know whether the gcc authors have actually made that argument. in any case g++ 4.5.2 and sun cc version 5.5 disagree with each other

7059795
udp	tcp
i tried the following code to find out maximum segment size in tcp and udp sockets

7059852
udp	tcp
tcp has segments udp has datagrams

7059852
udp	tcp
check the return value of getsockopt udp doesn t have tcp segments so it should definitely return with an error

7059861
typedef	struct
the usual things to put in them are declarations of enums typedef struct and function prototypes so various c files can compile without having to have knowledge of the actual function or actual memory a struct basically is definition of how memory is laid out

7059872
mouseover	mouseout
the issue in this gallery is that if you mouseover mouseout fast during the animation

7059909
disk	ram
some outlying disk fetches can give you a large average when most requests for example those from ram that don t need disk fetches are actually quite speedy

7059926
sudo	passwd
in addition consider that once you authenticate with sudo you don t need to provide a passwd again for the next five minutes

7059926
sudo	passwd
the -n option to sudo prevents it from prompting for a passwd the command runs or sudo quits with an error

7059926
sudo	passwd
you could use -n in combination with the -a option which causes sudo to run a separate program whose only job is to collect and output a passwd

7059940
int	chars
if string had a method such as setcharat int index chars value then it would be mutable

7059949
free	malloc
malloc and frieds must pair with free

7059973
memcpy	memset
if you want to overwrite the first element of the array with the last one and zero out the memory of the last element which is not used anymore you can use memcpy and memset

7059973
memcpy	strcpy
instead of overwriting the first element with the last using memcpy it can also be done with strcpy and assignment of the priority like in your remove

7059976
union	distinct
from 6.7.2.3 tags 4 two declarations of structure union or enumerated types which are in different scopes or use different tags declare distinct types

7059976
union	distinct
each declaration of a structure union or enumerated type which does not include a tag declares a distinct type.

7059978
stdout	stderr
if you do call it the server is going to have problems because it closes stdout and stderr but your code then tries to write to the now closed files

7059997
google-chrome	firefox
i ve tested it in google-chrome and firefox

7060005
clang	llvm
below is the output for a method compile using the latest llvm clang build

7060020
rel	attr
the code .twitter_popup attr rel might give you some diff results than expectd because class name is used as a selector

7060033
width	height
i have a spritebatch that is set to draw to a rendertarget2d that is 500px larger in both height and width

7060033
width	height
however whenever i call the spritebatch.draw method using a point outside of the physical screen width height it will not draw the object

7060071

7060144
firefox	safari
when i am accessing the file in safari firefox after i have logged in it s working correctly

7060187
tolower	toupper
you could either use the -uppercasestring and -lowercasestring methods on substrings or use the toupper and tolower functions on characters

7060255
hash	md5
the md5 hash acc

7060259
portrait	landscape
may need to create different datasets landscape images mostly sharp in focus with large depth of field portrait images could be large areas deliberately out of focus and soft along with low noise and noisy images

could someone assist me with the perfect template for using sql profiling to debugging stored procs

7060299
put	get
but if i put the following code in console i get an empty string back

7060310
teamcity	partcover
2 make sure you register the partcover dll using regsvr32 you can t use per-user registration if using a service account to run teamcity

7060355
yslow	pagespeed
so i ran google s pagespeed and yslow on my site and one of their recommendations is to specify cache validators ie headers such as etag or last-modified...the question is...the files that they recommend doing so on are images....so how exactly am i supposed to add those headers onto images

7060372
google-chrome	firefox
the problem is i do not have any problems with firefox safarai google-chrome or even older versions of ie the problem happens only in ie 9.0 btw if i switch to compatibility mode in ie 9.0 it works fine

7060389
src	attr
2 setting some data-id attr then ajax-requesting the src from the server

7060393

it works fine i get among other things the http method get|post but what i can t find is the actual get and post data

7060423
rss	feed
i have an iphone app that uses a native rss feed reader and i wanted to make a button on it that would take you out of the app and bring you to the full story in safari but i dont know how to code it

7060429
for-loop	arrays	memcpy	memmove
you would have to work either with memcpy or memmove or with a for-loop over the arrays elements

7060472
integer	unsigned
however when you give this data to open webgl you told webgl to interpret the bytes as normalized unsigned integer values

7060496
mongoid	mongomapper
i have used mongomapper for awhile but decided to migrate to mongoid

7060508
google-chrome	firefox
for people having this problem with asp.net change the doctype to html5 and content-type to application xhtml+xml i tried it on ie9 firefox 3.6 and google-chrome 13

7060561
subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition	division	multiplication	division	subtraction	division	addition	addition	multiplication
my addition subtraction multiplication and division operators are correct

7060640
gradle	ivy
the only problem i faced with gradle is lack of native support for reusing ivy.xml and ivysettings.xml despite the fact that gradle actually uses ivy as its dependency engine

7060645
hash	md5
refer here - how to calculate md5 hash of a file using javascript

7060647
getter	setter
for example on a getter and setter method

7060656
awt	swing
you would do that with awt but not with swing

7060664
range	minimum
it has additional options some of which are related to minimum and maximum slide range size

7060664
range	minimum
setting minimum and maximum range size

7060664
range	minimum
upper range boundary minimum allowed value

7060664
range	max
automatic range sliding when reaching maximum range size dragged handle drags the other handle along to keep max range size

7060667
apache	nginx
this is from this stackexchange answer for nginx similar techniques exist in apache

7060680
viewdidload	viewdidappear	switching	screens
i have a tab bar controller one tab screens contains a web view loading a request say google.com when it is loading ie before the didload delegate method call of webview if i switching to another tab and then go back the spinner is still running but the page is never loaded i guess viewdidload is only called once so should i put the loading code in viewdidappear or is there anyway to solve this

7060681
move	drag
a tip to help you drag the code every time select text then click + hold do not move mouse until mouse pointer changes from i to pointer

7060706
mp3	ogg
why don t you reencode the wma file to mp3 or ogg preferentially

7060706
mp3	ogg
so the best thing to do is to reencode the files to ogg or mp3

7060723
min	max
there is no upper limit to 3d min or max distance since the values are in your own units except of course for the limitations of a float

7060723
min	max
yes you can change these values at runtime and keep in mind that min distance is when the sound starts attenuating and max distance is where it stops attenuating

7060723
min	max
you can set the min and max at runtime with fmod ex via channel or sound set3dminmaxdistance and you can set it via the event system with event setpropertybyindex and use fmod_eventproperty_3d_mindistance or fmod_eventproperty_3d_maxdistance

7061678
vraptor	struts
obviously this is reinventing the wheel as all web mvc frameworks in java like struts springmvc vraptor and play implement this pattern and give this functionality for free to you so you could also think about switching to a framework instead of staying with pure servlets and building your own homegrown web framework

public	protected
i m not sure what kind of asset files you are utilizing and how you might be protecting them now or even what you mean by reachable so it s hard to give input on that and it s also not clear if those assets are in the main app or the admin app but you could also use apache config or similar to alias the admin directory to a common app with common public web files or if you did use the yii bootstrap to load a common protected directory you could have separate public web files for each admin app -- but non-php served files would need some kind of access filter

gitolite	gitosis
there are chapters about gitolite and gitosis as well

7070098
sorting	filtering
one of the screens of this application needs to have a grid spreadsheet area that allows presentation of many rows of data filtering sorting and updating of multiple rows of information

7070121
datalist	repeater
this second example article discusses only the datalist repeater and datagrid controls but i figure since i am using the itemplate interface here it should be the same thing

7070135
folder	directory
if you re not certain how to do this in practice say in flash builder you can work under one project directory with two flex applications project - properties - flex applications or have two separate projects containing only the top-level mxml file with the source folder containing the remainder of the application in the build path project - properties - flex build path - source path

7070157
post	get
to pass only the id through post get and get the needed data from

7070167
daemons	systemd
a more stable approach would be to take advantage of process control and spin off daemons for each connection from your parent script or implement a cache systemd that stores all data on the disk database so that you can detect a change in module version and instantly reboot the server

7070178
pull	push
i have two computers and i want both of them to be able to pull push from the same repo on github as well as deploy to the same app on heroku

7070225
hide	show
i am trying to add an animation to my app that will hide or show a menu on single tap

7070239
getter	setter
on top of this you would get the added benefit that you could prevent people from accessing the arrays at invalid indices since you could define getter and setter that would check the index

7070245
portrait	landscape
edited to add that after some additional testing i found this is only a problem if the device is in portrait orientation not in landscape

7070257
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
supports ie 5+ firefox 2+ safari 4+ google-chrome opera 10.5+ iphone 2+ android 2+ and provides a consistent api to handle storage cross-browser

7070268
getter	setter
in other words if you use dot notation either on self or on some other object you access the property and in fact call either the getter or setter methods depending on the direction of assignment

7070268
getter	setter
you can also write your own setter and getter and then you ll also have to take care of memory management where it applies

7070269
put	get
if you can put some restrictions on what hello.mk can do you might be able to get this into one pass

i don t know somethig about awt combobox there is only choice and awt componets silently d i e d sometime in last milenium for todays gui is required swing jcomponents

7070429
awt	swing
edit for clear mind and enjoy from programing don t mixing awt components and with swing jcomponents in other hands sure that possible from jdk1.6_012 more here and here but for nice and correct output to the gui you have to needed lots of skills about java gui

7070453
screens	tablet
also it may be due to a different resolution in the emulator instead of the screens looking a mobile phone screens it had looked like a tablet screens

7070457
google-chrome	firefox
this works properly in google-chrome firefox and even ie8

7070497
put	get
the other answer says to put the logic as close to the db as possible which imo is a horrid idea although in this case i see nothing wrong with what you re doing but just remember that the database is already doing a lot of work to just get you the data if you re going to be doing a lot of logic on the database it s going to make it just that much slower

7070499
portrait	landscape
it works fine in portrait mode but when the user goes into landscape mode it doesn t work

7070500
post	get
and i get what i want domain.com 14 in place of domain.com post 14

7070507
maven	m2e
both approaches should be supported by both maven and the wtp addon for the m2e plugin but these things are evolving right now and you d better do some experiments before committing to this route

7070549
entities	entitymanager
entities as a rule of thumb should not know about the entitymanager directly or via some intermediary object

7070584
hide	show
this show the code that hide slides the photograph thumbails away etc when the button is clicked

7070584
hide	show
the large images are loaded into the #slideshow div which show and hide easily however i can t seem to hide the thumbs div

7070596
width	height
i am trying to make a preloader with jquery.can somebody please tell me how early we can get the width and height of an image so i can place the preloader.gif at the middle of the actual image with absolute positioning

in other word i want to call a function as soon as image width and height are set.how to do it

7070611
maven	pom.xml
when building with maven it may be necessary to indicate what resources should be included in the pom.xml

7070614
post	get
if you get stuck while coding post the code and i can help you with it

7070639
width	height
however if you know the exact width and height of your image you should set them with the and attributes in html or the width and height properties of css

7070644
entities	entitymanager
i am trying to find a way to ensure that any entities used as model objects are always attached to the current entitymanager before wicket tries to render any components

7070665
jdk1.6	jdk1.4
we are in the process of upgrading our j2ee application from jdk1.4 to jdk1.6 along with moving to a different application server

7070685
width	height
if you want to get the actual pixel coordinate you have to calculate that from the views width height and the image ones

7070686
setinterval	settimeout
this is achieved through either settimeout or setinterval which enqueues a function to be called at a later time while allowing other code to execute in between

7070692
width	height
if you do not want to make it block then width and height makes no sense

7070698
getter	setter
i ve also gone down the route of passing interim objects around and even accessing getter setter after creating the view controller

7070755
integer	unsigned
i know i can convert the ascii digits to binary coded decimal simply by removing the 4 msbs but how do i convert that do an unsigned integer using vhdl

7070801

i am confused on how to go about selecting an http framework web.py cherrypy etc

7070857
client-side	server-side
you have to understand what php and javascript actually are a server-side and client-side language

7070864
opera	firefox
one problem for example is that firefox at least 3.6 and iirc also some version of opera has some rounding error when scaling so when you scale the parent-element holding the text and scale the text by the inverse of that scale then the letter-spacing will be slightly different compared to without any scale

7070893
post	get
so basically my desired class would post data to a page without reading the response and instead get the url of the page after the redirect

7070902
pop-up	dialog
that way you keep the functionality together and ensure the redirect happens when the dialog pop-up

7070907
bottle	flask
i d recommend bottle or flask both of which are very minimal and impose no constraints on you whatsoever

7070919
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
both uinavigationcontroller and uitabbarcontroller are controllers of controllers they manage multiple uiviewcontroller

7070919
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
each tab controls either a uiviewcontroller or a uinavigationcontroller which in turn manages uiviewcontroller

7070919
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
so you add uiviewcontroller or uinavigationcontroller to your tab bar items

7070919
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
you cannot add a uinavigationcontroller to your uiviewcontroller but rather the other way round

7070922

7071165
subtract	add
you still need some mechanism to check for a total of 100 and add subtract percentages from certain values if need be

7071167
implements	extends
what i mean is that i want to allow any type of vertex structure that implements a certain interface extends a certain class. in order to do this i would need to convert that object into byte

7071170
put	get
put this together before i realised the question was for mysql but the principal should be the same this will get you the record for each personid with the most recent activedate from person table

7071171
bash	zsh
in bash and i m guessing zsh that would be

7071207
versioning	upgrade
if you are using this versioning or if it s possible for you to upgrade you can reapply your styles on the pagercomplete event

7071251
serializable	deserialization
the serializable doesn t put just the floats to the output stream it also puts some information about the vertex class so the jvm knows which class should be instantiated when the deserialization occurs

7071255
ubuntu	debian
i have been trying to set up a crontab list on a debian ubuntu server but have not been able to get it to work

7071270

in each file i actually named the class after the namespace in the namespace mymathlib.addition is a static class addition and in mymathlib.subtraction there is a static class subtraction

7071380
northwind	adventureworks
for other databases i ve tested on like adventureworks or northwind that do have true fks in the database when i generate the model from the database i see that the edmx includes association and associationset sections in the ssdl

7071400
disk	ram
new considering that the objects are less than 1gb it may be easier to just copy the entire set to a ram disk and then access through that

7071400
disk	ram
just remember to copy from the ram disk if anything is saved or wrap save to save objects in two places

7071466
libevent	epoll
both libevent and libev has the functionality but i can t figure out how to do this using epoll

7071468
screens	tablet
i think you shouldn t check for tablet or else but base your app on screens size and sdk version

7071516
mousemove	keydown
you want to monitor events like mousemove keypress keydown and or click at the document level

7071557
mousemove	keydown
come up with a list of all the events you d consider to be activity from the user click mousemove keydown etc.

7071595
inherited	properties
he could be talking about the getvalue that comes when you inherited dependencyobject but the syntax still doesn t work it expects you to pass dependencyproperty as a parameter but i m using regular clr properties with onpropertychanged myproperty being invoked on the setter

7071613
sorting	filtering
so you have multiple items signing up for the same event one event handler to maintain and the ability to preserver that handling should your list be changed through filtering sorting etc

7071661
google-chrome	firefox
good day sir you can check wether your images are preloaded by using firebug in firefox or the developer console in google-chrome

the users can only add rectangles width height x y color text image and probably some form elements textarea button combo-box etc.

7071795
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
if you re using uitabbarcontroller or uinavigationcontroller you ll probably not want to clean up the first view controller as you launch the second one

7071802
folder	directory
the fo command line parameter is typically a folder that the compiler dumps the obj files into - there is only one passed so all of the cpp files for a given directory can only be passed to cl.exe at a time

7071803
min	max
if you have access to command line you could try to generate patches from each branch or trunk with svn diff by specifying the min and max revisions containing the specific features you need to move

7071832
explode	substr
i ve looked through explode preg_split and similar things but i don t understand how to split a larger string by space whilst keeping intact substr that are in quotation marks

7071853
versioning	upgrade
2 i have no idea about how good or bad the upgrade path is from vb3 to newer versioning of vb

7071853
vb.net	vb6
if you don t get an answer here the real long time vb classic not vb.net experts hang out in that said the vb6 ide works well in windows 7 once you know about one particular install trick which requires creating a 0 byte msjava.dll file in the windows directory

7071886
children	parent
i have a parent entity appartment with a list of room s as children

7071888
versioning	upgrade
the serialization is small wicked fast extendable and easily upgrade versioning over versioning

7071891
maven	m2e
when you do that all your dependencies are handled by maven m2e so your .classpath becomes very minimal

7071891
maven	pom.xml
in term of project architecture you want one eclipse project per maven pom.xml

i was going to migrate my game from glut to sdl

7071971
glut	sdl
it s working perfectly in glut but i wanted to use some sdl features

7072001
fflush	gets
pretty sure the avcapturemoviefileoutput appends to the file and does not use a in memory buffer maybe it does but it fflush it to the file before it gets too large ...some evidence of this can be seen in the moviefragmentinterval property here

7072019
firefox	safari
please note this works fine in firefox and safari

7072035
post	put
i must say that i read a lot of misguiding post elsewhere about various strategies for getting around .irbrc before this question and the post by rogerdpack put the issue to rest

7072065
google-chrome	firefox
my current solution works perfectly fine in firefox but google-chrome and ie are not working and it isn t giving any error messages

7072075
width	text-align
setting the left and right margins to auto for instance won t work for a div that doesn t have a defined width and setting text-align to be center won t work as expected for a div whose width has been constrained

7072076
google-chrome	firefox
check if the fonts are at all accessible by the browser in firefox using the firebug plugin or developer tools in google-chrome f12 and ctrl+shift+j respectively

7072145
cucumber	autotest
i ve been able to get rspec cucumber and autotest to work against my rails 3.1 mountable engine

7072149
post	get
but to be clear the only thing in this post you need to do to get rid of your error is to change setupget to setup

7072187
width	height
i want a progress bar that i can specify the width the height and that has a percentage in the middle of it

7072197
children	parent
a cheap code-wise way to do that would be to insert the view into a parent view with autoresizing set to center it set the parent to clip its children and then animate the parent s frame

7072198
hide	show
currently i just use a repeater and hide show appropriate fields

7072214
filtering	grouping

put	get
i can get the current location coordinate via wifi cell tower ip address but don t know how to put it into still image to mark the current location

7072412
codeigniter	yii
yii is the only php framework i d touch with a very long pole maybe codeigniter as well granted but i find yii cooler and less of a hurdle to use and to work through

7072444
children	parent
the childnodes depending on the browser used will return the text nodes as well as the tags that are children of the parent node

7072451
integer	unsigned
when you assign it to -1 this value actually rolls back to the highest possible value for an unsigned 32-bit integer as you found

7072456
folder	directory
when a build task is added to the queue once it is successful it not only adds a build folder into the drop folder location but it also adds a folder called builds with build files in it based on the build agent s working directory

7072469
vb.net	vb6
i want to upgrade an activex control from vb6 to vb.net

7072476
text-align	height
we will define height for it paint it s background and set text-align center

7072483
google-chrome	firefox
it s important that this application works in ie firefox and google-chrome when run as a local file

7072544
mouseup	mousedown
add a mousedown handler to your image which sets a trigger function after two seconds and a mouseup function which clears the timeout function

7072550

udp	tcp
first try tcp instead of udp

7072668
folder	directory
the default directory is set to a location within this folder during the execution of the build

7072671

the problem is that .chzn-container-active .chzn-choices .search-choice aka the project item branding web development etc.. has a height of 31px including padding margin and border while it s container is only 30px in height

7072691
uitextfield	uitoolbar
there s no name for it really you will have to create a uitoolbar adding the 2 uibuttons and a uitextfield

7072693
oncreate	onstart
i want to have this activity started off the main activity during the latter s oncreate or onstart depending on some conditions that are checked first

7072695
getter	setter
my mapping class has setter getter for the blob object as

7072705
width	height
after creating a bitmap from the blob i calculate the scaling factor and then calculate the new width and height

7072720
innodb	myisam
an example of when this would be used as cited by the manual is when using mysql s myisam table type instead of innodb

7072726
google-chrome	firefox
it seems to be sized pretty small by default and scrolls in google-chrome firefox win.

7072799
udp	mtu	mtu	pppoe
to be precise utorrent assumes an mtu of 1500 - 20 bytes of ip header - 8 bytes of udp -header - 24 bytes of potential gre header - 8 bytes for potential pppoe header - 2 bytes for potential mppe header

7072829
width	height
please be aware that padding adds to height width so you will have to adjust them abstract from current value number of px you use for padding for example in my example width 335 - 50 and height 154 - 80

7072847
ubuntu	debian
this web management console is highly recommended if you are using 2.51 but impossible if you are stuck with the default 1.72 that debian and ubuntu saddle you with

7072875
crossover	mutation
an ea simulates a population which evolves by survival of the fittest crossover and mutation

7072892
maven	pom.xml
create a separate maven project inspired from the following pom.xml

7072892

assuming there is a toinstall 4.6 directory relative to your pom.xml and that a jar called proguard.jar is in there calling this plugin will copy the jar from your local directory to your maven local repository

7072910
inherited	properties	inherited	subclassing
if a number of your nsmanagedobject subclassing need the clientname properties you can implement it in a common abstract nsmanagedobject subclassing and make your concrete subclassing inherited from that

7072923
getter	setter
you should use getter and setter to keep track of your variable assignments regardless of scope

7072930
colorbox	thickbox
some lightboxes colorbox dom window facybox thickbox support loading html pages into an iframe rather than just images

7072955
dbcontext	objectcontext
in your case you re using ef 4.1 with the dbcontext but this would also apply with different methods to ef 4.0 with the objectcontext

7073047
filtering	grouping
i also tried putting the grouping under the header files filtering and under the project root but no go

7073069
autoresizingmask	sizetofit
there are some view resizing methods like sizetofit and autoresizingmask but they won t help you in your case here

7073073
nsurl	nsstring
this will return an array of file nsurl objects rather than an array of nsstring s

7073093
implements	extends
what would be a solution do i need to do a extends person instead of implements

7073105
width	height
some browsers will return the literal style width and height as it was written in the css- pehaps as a pecentage or an em multiple while others translate all style dimensions to pixels

7073107
mouseover	mouseout
it works fine because by the time the mouseout function is called the tooltip has been added to the dom already by the mouseover

7073123

7073137
serializable	deserialization
i have searched the web for quit a while for a binary serializable deserialization framework that i can use in android

7073137
serializable	deserialization
msgpack s better at that since it doesn t require you to do any definitions and thus doesn t generate a lot of code for you to use its serializable deserialization functionalities and it s fast the bad thing is that it depends on some classes that exist only on j2se and some other open sources projects i don t really like to get involved too much code that are not directly needed in my small android project.

7073137
serializable	deserialization
my question is is there a fast and small binary serializable deserialization framework that i can use in android

7073220
folder	directory
how could i modify this script to continue to force https except in specified directory like api folder

i want this image to rotate along with the device it is a textured background so i just want to rotate it 90â or 0â depending on whether the physical device is in portrait or landscape

7073345

i was writing a web app for android which can be used in both landscape portrait mode

7073350
ready	each
inside each of those foreach container you now have your package ready to do something and that something is a data flow task

7073391
put	get
also on my machine it did not work from the file stored locally - i had to put this on a local web server to get it working

7073403
fadein	fadeout
fadeto usage is because when you stop the animation during fadein fadeout the opacity will not reset to 100 and your image will become invisible over the time

7073404
pop-up	dialog
you can use the modal pop-up dialog that comes with the ajax toolkit or you could use something like the jquery ui dialog

7073432
aggregate-functions	sum
where only works for columns or expressions if you want to filter with an aggregate-functions like sum you have to use having

7073432
filtering	grouping
this query doesn t really make sense without a valid grouping by but you get the point use having to filtering with an aggregate function

7073445
stdout	stderr
it will output errors on stderr and the code on stdout so you can pipe it easily to another file

7073446
disk	ram
if your application does not fit into this model perhaps most requests are actually cpu bound or generally work in ram but only a few requests do disk io for file uploads then you will need to do some custom tuning anyhow for instance you might need to refactor your service into an asynchronous framework so that you can efficiently handle thousands to hundreds of thousands of concurrent but slow requests or just balance different kinds of requests across different application servers

7073456
repo	egit
i have cloned a project from a git repo into eclipse helios using the egit plugin

7073478
padding	overlapping
update if you still want to go the overlapping route first make sure you are using a compiler directive to pack your struct so that there is no padding added

7073479
vim	emacs
and i say this as a current user of vim and former user of emacs

7073511
filtering	grouping
it will result in filtering the records on your date range and then grouping it by each day where there is data

7073537
implements	modifiers
similarly if the base class method is abstract we need to implements the method in derive class but is override modifiers is mandatory

i can t upgrade my python versioning though

7073707
min	max
if min min back one increment and max max back on increment

7073729
int	boolean
c++ unlike c# lets you treat an int value as if it were a boolean value ad-hoc where any int 0 is false and any int other than 0 is true

7073757
min	max
you also probably don t want to be parsing your csv twice once for min once for max but i don t know for sure without seeing what csv_parse is

7073806
gif	png
my application also needs to produce a snapshot image of the selected style swatches as a jpeg gif or png

7073806
gif	png
produce a flattened snapshot of all the layers as a jpeg gif or png file

7073878

i recently discovered activesupport defines class_inheritable_accessor which does what the class-instance variables do with the advantage that objects are not shared across inherited and you can have a default value for the variable when subclassing

7073904
folder	directory
you can simply create another zf project in a different directory and copy the xml file into the the folder where it s missing

if dpkg is installed it s probably ubuntu debian based

7073930
opensuse	centos
if rpm is installed it s probably redhat centos or opensuse based

7073940
goto	break
it is the equivalent of a goto but is more restrictive in that labels may be used only in break or continue statements

7073950
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
you shouldn t modify a uiviewcontroller to be a uinavigationcontroller

7073950
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
even though a uinavigationcontroller is a subclass of uiviewcontroller its job is to manage other view controllers not views

7073950
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
in ib you should create a uinavigationcontroller and then set the existing uiviewcontroller as the root controller of the new uinavigationcontroller

7073955

that code has the bottom right corner of the view curl up revealing a uinavigationcontroller s view embedded in the second tab of the uitabbarcontroller and makes the tab bar reappear

7074210
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
in the viewwillappear and viewdidappear methods but then the animation runs by animating the view over an image of itself so it curls back down but as it s curling you can see that the view beneath it is the same view

you can set the controlbox property of the form to false then u can easily remove all buttons min max close buttons and even you can set title and image to it where as using formborderstyle it will completely remove title bar which will not help your problem

7074520

with vlas you no longer need to worry about using malloc free or the infamous alloca available on some implementations which was another way of doing stack-based allocations the a standing for automatic for arbitrarily-located variable-sized allocations

if you want the ability to resize you re still going to have to use the standard memory allocation functions like malloc and realloc

post	get	implements	extends
but google uses post method to send your variables and takes care of serialization for you what you are trying to do is send it via get method which is as far as i know not implements by google remoteserviceservlet .so i would say no its not possible unless you extends these services to work with get methods yourself but i don t know if that is possible

7076251
instances	transient
i thought adding the cascade property would fix that but now when i try to save forecast #1 for example i get an exception saying object references an unsaved transient instances - save the transient instances before flushing with type forecast entity 1

7076251
persistent	transient
what i think is happening is that it tries to save the forecase and by doing so it also tries to persistent all the forecastcost cost objects linked to it but the forecastcost object also has a link back to the forecast entity that we are saving but is not yet saved thus transient and so it errors out

7076256

note that in your example this will not match anything as your selector will select div elements that are direct children of another div and the elements in your example have no parent div

my question is why is it allowed to have double literals which can t be represented in a double while int literals that can t be represented are disallowed

7076653

rss	feed
or better how to add css to rss while using django provided feed framework

7084638
pull	push
my question is it possible to have a private github with only one private collaborator and have the collaborators push pull from the another git repo - and thus all the github one does is mirror that git repo thus i don t have to setup multiple private collaborator accounts

7084686
post	get
which seems to post the document although i need to get it to call my imageupload function from the php once i ve pressed the submit

7084706
min	max
i have tried max and min and they do not do what i want

7084719
submit	submission
i m trying to submit an extjs form the standard way but the form is always submission to the same page am not sure why although the url config option is correctly set

7084726

google-chrome	safari
given mvc application refuses to work properly in google-chrome safari browsers - i receive

7084826
google-chrome	safari
so what s wrong with my ajax form with html5 attributes from google-chrome safari s point of view

7084826
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
obviously requests in google-chrome safari and ie firefox differ for some unknown reason

7084846
put	get
and inside callbackmethod put your logic while using operation.response.responsetext to get the new data from server

7084857
int	chars
the program gives runtime error because vararg automatically promotes chars to int and i should have used int in this case

7084876
post	put
edit 2 since this has gotten to be a pretty long post i ll put this up here

7084877
spaces	delimiter
spaces at the end of a delimiter identifier are insignificant truncated

7084947
mp3	ogg	mp3	flac	flac	ogg
it supports flac mp3 ogg and mp4 files

7084976
mate	robotlegs
i don t want to start a holy war here but one of the reasons behind the creation of the second generation frameworks mate swiz robotlegs parsely was because of the absurd amount of difficulty in getting started with ria application architecture

7084990
google-chrome	safari
why do safari and google-chrome ignore min-width css property

7084990
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
example this works in ie and firefox but not in safari and google-chrome

7085002
unsigned	short
you can use any standard type with va_arg except char signed char unsigned char short unsigned short _bool and float

7085002
floating-point	integer
it s possible that an implementation defines additional nonstandard types that also have integer conversion rank lower than int or likewise nonstandard small floating-point types but you would not need to be aware of these unless you intend to use them so for practical purposes the list i gave is complete

7085061
min	max
try to write a fold to multiply the elements of a list then another one to find extreme values max min

7085079
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
firefox ie9 vs google-chrome opera browsers

7085081
jobs	cron
i also thought of cron jobs and indeed they have been recommended for similar situations on this and other forums but since this is not a recurring event but rather a one time event to take place at an arbitrary point in time i did not know that a cron job is what i want either

7085093
int	chars
while using va_arg the chars is promoted to unsigned int

7085093
int	chars
c chars va_arg ap int

7085104
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome and safari simply do not support the min-width property on table elements

7085104
google-chrome	safari
so it would seem that google-chrome and safari are the ones not conforming to the standard

7085106
fadein	fadeout
edit to add is there possibly a way in lieu of a true clipping mask to use one of jcarousel s callbacks to perform fadeout on an image as it moves out of the carousel s focus and then fadein as an image moves into focus

7085116
children	parent
i need a solution where i have one master list array that has a number of sequentially ordered linked children each one representing a sub-segment of the parent list

7085122
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
i have developed an application that uses uinavigationcontroller to handle multiple instances of the same uiviewcontroller and it is working great

7085206
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
tested on win7 in ie8 ie9 opera 11.50 safari 5.0.5 firefox 5.0 google-chrome 12.0

7085223
getter	setter
readwrite means that both a getter and a setter exist

7085231
des	aes
triple des or aes are much better options

7085234
getter	setter
atomic vs nonatomic primarily ensures that complete values are returned from synthesized getter and that complete values are written by synthesized setter atomic is default.

7085234
accessor	properties
readwrite vs readonly determines whether a synthesized properties has a synthesized accessor or not readwrite has a setter and is the default readonly does not

7085270
comparator	comparable
i m looking for best practice for the definition of the comparator method in the case where the class implements comparable

7085279
google-chrome	firefox
i am using the visualization library the charts works fine in firefox google-chrome however when i test in ie7 i am getting a different font showing up on the chart

7085279
svg	vml
also i am using the new corepackage in google charts so it utilizes both vml and svg when needed so it does render in ie

7085309
viewdidload	viewwillappear
however in a nutshell you have viewdidload and viewwillappear and their opposites methods that serve to alleviate your fears

7085320
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
ie9 firefox use a different technique to render text than google-chrome opera do

7085404
google-chrome	firefox
while i was writing i tested the page locally on google-chrome and firefox and the font size seemed to follow what i specified in the css file

7085437
jobs	cron
use cron jobs -- depend on yout cp you can follow the instruction and call your php program at the specific times

7085439
jobs	cron
as pete says you can manage cron jobs from within php

7085470
post	get
i believe your code will perform an post whereas you need a get to transfer your variables through querystring

7085473
xna	spritebatch
i have a very subtle problem with xna specifically the spritebatch

7085494
portrait	landscape
to get a different view for landscape as opposed to portrait you would place your layout xml file in both of the following resource folders

7085513
portrait	landscape
the layout from layout-land is displayed when device is landscape and layout from plain layout folder is shown when device is in portrait

7085574
pop-up	dialog
unfortunately on mac and debian i get a modal dialog that pop-up and tells me that the page load failed

7085593
hide	show
then hide the panorama and show the pivot

7085612
hide	show
here s where i m usure after it sees that none are checked checked i want to have a div show up hide show i guess somwhere and disappear if any of the boxes are checked

7085627
for-loop	arrays
i m looking to quickly hopefully without a for-loop generate a numpy arrays of the form

7085656
awt	swing
there are solutions available to use awt or swing on android

7085657
folder	directory
so i need to get the current folder that is in and delete the folder only if there are no other files folder within that directory after deleting the actual file as i am doing already ofcourse

7085728
.htaccess	httpd.conf
the configuration in httpd.conf not .htaccess looks like this

7085731
mouse	keyboard
however one major issue of hosting child windows from an external process is that if the external process hangs while responding to a user keyboard or mouse input the main application also freezes

7085741
client-side	server-side
the idea is that my ajax json objects can use the same template files to render stuff client-side like java is doing it server-side

7085763
system.configuration	system.web
have you added a reference to system.web and system.configuration in the broken project s

7085781
getter	setter
i looked in the debugger whenever i change the property by using it s setter then the getter gets called in turn so the longlistselector reads the new template but doesn t apply it

7085786
winpcap	wireshark
it might be a good idea to see how both wireshark and winpcap does it

7085803
width	height
and i need to append px to the end of the width and height

7085816
for-loop	arrays
i was initially using a for-loop to go through just the vid_id arrays but now since i added the page element i am not quite sure how to handle it

7085818
accessor	properties
it creates an object as usual plus it returns a function handle that acts as a read-only accessor to a closure variable synced with the original object properties using a postset events listener

7085838
xmlhttprequest	jqxhr
an ajax success callback is really an event handler for the xmlhttprequest object that does the work so in this case this refers to the xmlhttprequest object well actually a jqxhr object

7085858
children	parent
mouseleave on the other hand will only fire once the cursor is no longer over either the parent div or any of it s children

7085883
pull	push
mercurial will push pull all branches by default while git will push pull only the current branch

7085902
jar	manifest.mf
if it has and there is at least a manifest.mf with the right format in it it is a jar file

7085917
inherited	properties
in addition what if some the properties contain inherited and none

7085930
portrait	landscape
this may be a easy question but for some reason i can not seem to figure out how to get a page to automatically resize when changing from landscape to portrait in a flex mobile app

7085930
portrait	landscape	switching	screens
i have a page that displays a menu to collect customer information i have it laid out how i would like it for portrait but if i switching to landscape the formatting causes information to be left off of the screens

7085941
google-chrome	safari
but in google-chrome and mobile safari this problem seems not existed and the audio player can play from the first audio to the last audio continuously

7085945
post	get
is there some way that i can get the previous next links to recognize which post i m at on the page and calculate which would be the appropriate div to scroll to

7085945
hide	show
the elements hide and show at the correct times and the links work if a different javascript action is put in place in the onclick field of the anchor

7085947
setinterval	settimeout
the settimeout function and setinterval as well must be told what to do after the delay

7085970
pull	push
in git you have to pull push all the branches one by one

7085970
pull	push
you can specify each time which branch you want to pull push on git push origin master means you want to push your branch master on the one at origin which is often the default server

7085972
width	height
to #right manually set the height and width and then make #reflection #shadow and #iphone all position absolute

7086007
width	height	oncreate	onstart
i ve tried several different layouts and i ve tried setting the position of the imageview in my oncreate onstart onresume etc. but the width and height of all of my views are will 0 by 0

7086030
post	put
i put a post on forrst.com as i ve recently implemented something similiar in one of my projects

7086054
move	drag
i am using devex gridview with c# what i want is when i drag column to change its order other column should to be move next or before my move column i used mouse up event and column position changed event i get a stack over flow exception

7086065
hide	show
hide the grid and show the message

7086085
daemon	cron	jobs	cron
crontab files are stored where the lists of jobs and other instructions to the cron daemon are kept

7086085
unix	aix
for day of the week field 5 both 0 and 7 are considered sunday though some versions of unix such as aix do not list 7 as acceptable in the man page

7086085
jobs	cron
vixie cron supports an extended time expression syntax where you can say 5 35 to run jobs at five past the hour and five past half

7086085
daemon	cron
will list the cron daemon if it s running

7086085
jobs	cron
you can also check syslog to see a list of recently executed cron jobs

7086085
daemon	cron
if your command is not writing output to a file the cron daemon will attempt to deliver any output by mail

7086085
jobs	cron
graphical programs x11 apps java programs ssh and sudo are notoriously problematic to run as cron jobs

7086085
jobs	cron	sudo	passwd
if ssh or sudo asks for a passwd it will fail in cron since the jobs run in the background with no user to interact with them

7086085
sudo	passwd	sudoers	passwd
for sudo this means adding entries to sudoers to allow running a command without passwd and without requiring a tty

7086112
portrait	landscape
i have a page with an image and couple textboxes in a grid encapsulated in scrollviwer that supports both portrait and landscape orientation

7086112
portrait	landscape
i think it has to do something with a fact that in portrait mode without sip you can see all elements and in landscape you have to scroll down to see some textboxes

7086119
getter	setter
when you declare the type of a property you re declaring both the return type of the getter and the argument type of the setter

7086135
width	height
the button s height width or if the button s

7086138
antialiasing	transparent
if you make a big rectangle over the bounds of the view that is entirely transparent the line will draw with antialiasing

7086194
inherited	subclassing
the method i would want to use is handlekeyset which is protected therefore not visible.to get around this issue the only solution i can think of is to create a subclassing of resourcebundle and implement getkeys such that it returns only the keys of the current bundle and excludes the keys of the parent.the part where i start to doubt this solution is probably due to my confused understanding of inherited

7086208
pop-up	dialog
i have a button which on clicking pop-up a dialog box which then displays the selected ids

7086228
google-chrome	firefox
you can easily see if you can reproduce the capybara error in-browser by clearing all your cookies as i m sure you know or by just switching to a new incognito window in google-chrome firefox which is a nice quick way to get a clean session

7086289
processors	hyperthreading
on new processors which support hyperthreading it is used as a hint to the processors that you are executing a spinloop to increase performance

7086293
margin	text-align
just for sure add text-align center to your #container and then add margin 20px auto

7086323
put	get
the code you put into either of those methods will get run on the main ui thread

7086344
atomic	compare-and-swap
this will involve leveraging platform-specific functions such as win32 s atomic compare-and-swap or cell s cache line reservation opcodes

7086357
expander	togglebutton
probably overkill for you but if you really need this functionality to be reusable you could create your own custom control where you add four dependency properties togglebuttondownstyle togglebuttonupstyle togglebuttonleftstyle and togglebuttonrightstyle and copy the default style for expander into the default style for your custom control but change the staticresource for togglebutton style to a templatebinding

7086380
superclass	subclassing
every method needed for subclassing in the superclass seems a bit

7086381
chown	chmod
then you can chown chmod your files appropriately say you have your binaries in opt antoniod and data in var antoniod-data

7086444
glut	qglwidget	glut	glfw	glfw	qglwidget
qglwidget takes care of opengl context creation and management just like glut or glfw do

7086448
post	get
on the server side i take the post data and base64 decode it to get the username and password information again

7086467
apache	nginx
we are running over nginx with apache proxies and replicated mysql dbs

7086478
google-chrome	firefox
appears to be fastest tested in google-chrome 13 firefox 5 results from google-chrome

7086503
implements	extends
public class phyiscsactivity extends basegameactivity implements iaccelerometerlistener ionscenetouchlistener

7086537
for-loop	loops
in the second for-loop every time you iterate through loops a new instance of aclass is going to be instantiated and allocated on the heap

7086577
range	minimum
the minimum value overall in the range

7086577
range	min	range	max	min	max
the max and min values of a single-element range are just that element

7086577
range	min	range	max	min	max
the max and min values of a multiple element range can be found by splitting the input in half finding the max and min values of each half then taking their respective max and min

7086597
put	get	subtract	add
it d be great for this script to get the src attribute of the thumb you click on remove the last four characters to get rid of .jpg then add on _lg.jpg to display the correct large image put the new above the placeholder div and then subtract 500px from the margin-top so it slides up to show the new image

7086608
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i had to use the formdata object available in firefox 4+ safari 5+ and google-chrome and of course the filereader object

7086617
x86	64bit
probably when the platform is x86 the common language runtime applies x86 emulation in 64bit machines and apparently messed up in the comparison operator

7086621
express	node.js
the res object in express is a subclass of node.js s http.serverresponse read the http.js source

7086621
express	node.js
comprehensive list of node.js express response methods and when they must be called

7086633
opera	google-chrome
i m drawing video on canvas and it works in opera mozilla and google-chrome but in ie9 canvas is blank but video is playing

7086642
int	chars
remember to cast them to chars such that you get append chars rather than append int

7086655
boost	stl
i might use the stl to define a map between a boost thread id and an instance of the logger class

7086667
rss	feed
got a partial answer from searching in this thread viewing raw rss feed

7086667
rss	feed
i use chrome most of the time and all i want is to be able to view a raw rss feed in the browser that is well formatted and easy to read so i can do some parsing for a project i m working on

7086669
int	double
it would probably make sense to write a wrapper for streams that can read double int singles etc

7086670
google-chrome	safari
basic maths tells me that 33 + 33 + 34 100 however in google-chrome desktop and safari iphone 4 ios5 i get some left over container div background colour

7086699
google-chrome	firefox
you can debug this quite easily in google-chrome or firefox by using a script terminal

7086699
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox you could install firebug or in google-chrome just press crtl+shift+j

7086714
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i ve tested the solution in ie 5.5-9 google-chrome firefox opera and safari

7086742
msg	eml
i have a struts-action and when that action is called i would like to create and return a simple eml or msg file that can be opened in outlook

7086742
msg	eml
is there any free api s out there that can help me construct a well-formed eml msg file with an attachment

7086746
ssl	https
my problem is in the last part to secure the connection i think the best way to do it is to use ssl https am i wrong

7086758
rss	feed
if you use firefox or ie they will detect rss feed and format it in a much more friendly way

7086769
google-chrome	safari
i really don t know why but when i try to display an iframe into google-chrome and safari it don t work

7086784
int	chars
but since chars wchar_t and int are all integral types and since values of any integral type can be assigned to an object of another integral type as long as the value is in range of the target type any of the following will work

7086787
post	get
but this will be post construction and you will not get any constructor injection

7086788
interpolation	splines
using double type i made cubic splines interpolation algorithm

7086796
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
i am testing my website which works fine with iron firefox and opera now using internet explorer 9 and google-chrome

7086797
subclipse	rabbitvcs
svn clients subclipse rabbitvcs

7086797
subclipse	rabbitvcs
i ve experienced this behavior with both subclipse and rabbitvcs

7086809
ssl	https
i think the best way to do it is to use ssl https am i wrong

7086830
vim	gedit	vim	emacs	emacs	gedit
you can use your favourite plain text editor for this for example notepad gedit vim emacs depending on the system you re using

7086883
ubuntu	debian
on any debian based system such as ubuntu you can use the excellent deb package metadata to do this for you

7086905
post	get
to check the value of a radio button in php it needs to have a name attribute which was sent in a form either by a get or post

7086949
uisegmentedcontrol	uiswitch
the behavior you are trying to achieve is better represented with a single uisegmentedcontrol for more than one option and a uiswitch for a yes|no option

7086968
equals	tostring
also the tostring maintenance could become an issue as it needs to change at the same rate as the equals method

7086971
jobs	cron
whenever s github wiki has a page for this output redirection aka logging your cron jobs

7086981
post	get
in order to determine is to submit a form as a post or get and query the value with the superglobals _post _get _request

7087046
post	get
i made a post about how to get the bounds of a display object even with tranparent areas here on my blog

7087050
post	get
the cookie is sent back with every http get or post to the server made from the domain path the cookie is set to until it expires

7087114
width	height
it is important to note that it only occurs in opera and as part of the css3 spec it is stated that box-shadow does not at height or width

7087148
g++	gcc
this system has a separate step for the linking of libraries and object files into the final executable but it insists on using gcc for this step instead of g++ because the program source files all have a .c extension so the result is a profusion of undefined symbols

7087148
g++	gcc
if the command line is manually pasted at a prompt and g++ is substituted for gcc then everything works fine

7087148
g++	gcc
there is a well-known to this build system make variable that allows flags to be passed to the linking step and it would be nice if there were some incantation that could be added to this variable that would force gcc to act like g++ since both are just driver programs

7087158
put	get
we now need to put that file on an s3 bucket to get it into our cdn

7087217
apache	nginx
i know the pagespeed module for apache can make the page visit faster so i wonder whether there is an equivalent for nginx

7087225
for-loop	loops
i thought since you had got that far with the code that you would be able to get it into a function if you re still working on this it might help to think of writing a for-loop to loops over your subjects and do the calculations required for that subject

7087227
g++	gcc
considering such a terrible build system write a wrapper around gcc that exec s gcc or g++ dependent upon the arguments

7087239
post	get
use the second parameter to which is the data querystring for get form values for post

7087278
post	get
ideally a step by step get one post as text kind of tutorial would be ideal and then i can dive into the docs and find the modules i need and so on

7087302
postgresql	mysql
i don t know of a way to do that with mysql but i mainly use postgresql so it might be possible and i just don t know

7087328
folder	directory
is it possible to change the location path directory folder of a specific database

7087331
shim	polyfills
so here we re collecting all the shim fallbacks and polyfills

7087331
shim	polyfills
and what is the difference between shim fallbacks and polyfills

7087348
folder	directory
if it has been created used in osx leopard i get the 3 files unzipped but not in the folder zipfile rather in the same directory as the zip file

7087364
folder	directory
had a similar issue and it turned out to be the _svn folder in the vendor gems directory

7087370
shim	polyfills
here s a comprehensive list of polyfills and shim

7087371
submit	submission
as your button would normally submit your form but it appears not to be submission your client side javascript code in dostuff is probably returning false

7087385
stdio	gets
my guess is that this is something very low level and the ruby interpreter does not even gets the chance to show the exception and this message is stdio related

7087395
des	aes
people have suggested to me that i use hmac shaxxx or des or aes i am unsure which i should use - do you have any suggestions

7087395
hash	hmac	des	aes
to ensure that that shared secret is always unique i will add the current date minute to the end of the secret then hash it using xxx algorithm protocol hmac aes des

7087404
division	subtract
this subtract 6 hours then rounds the hour down to either 0 1 or 2 by using integer division then expands it out again

7087546
put	get
when i try to put model in that spot i get a nullreferecne exception

7087547
google-chrome	firefox
i m testing it in google-chrome 13 firefox 6 and ie 9

7087550
put	get
you can also get your friends to install python on their windows machines and teach them how to run your programs if you re willing to put in the extra effort

7087555
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari	webkit	gecko
only problems are i currently have no way of telling between safari and google-chrome both webkit browsers and between the versions of the gecko webkit and opera browsers themselves

7087563
codeigniter	cakephp
in my experience to understand mvc frameworks i would suggest picking out one that has a lot of documentations and howtos like codeigniter or cakephp then as you code the framework would probably serve as a guideline on how you would write the page web application

7087572
screens	tablet
well simply by using a wrapper with a fixed width somewhere around the smallest resolution you want to support for example 600px should provide an interesting amount of coverage although in such cases you usually make specific styles as the only screens with 600px width tend to be tablet phones etc

7087609
folder	directory
it is usually located in bin debug yourproject.exe or bin release yourproject.exe folder under your project directory

7087612
int	double
arraylist should work fine with int or double because they are as good as other object

7087615
portrait	landscape
an alternative approach that has worked for me in the past is to use two completely different layout managers - one optimized for portrait layout the other optimized for landscape - and toggle the visibility opacity of each based on the changes to orientation

7087664
clang	llvm
you can exec the compiler or when looking towards 10.7 investigate clang and llvm which provides the compiler as a library

7087664
clang	llvm
10.7 currently uses the gcc frontend to llvm though not clang

7087668
getter	setter
i already have the getter and setter

7087668
getter	setter
however the getter and the setter do not provide me with the correctly change the positions of the players each round

7087728
httpresponse	request
i would need this to send a request to then send the httpresponse to my extension
