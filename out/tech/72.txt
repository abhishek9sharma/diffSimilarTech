either you use the ukkonen suffix tree algorithm to produce a suffix trie or you explicetly construct the suffix trie by storing suffixes much slower than ukkonens algorithm but also much simpler

border-box - include border width height and padding width height or basically the width you set includes the borders padding

10706372
google-chrome	firefox
now sometimes i think ie8 uses a different box-sizing than google-chrome firefox etc this is why sometimes you have issues

10706372
google-chrome	firefox
note if you don t have the doctype then you re in quirks mode and ie differs wildly from google-chrome firefox on the box-sizing box model - and that s your problem right there

this is the classic c-style for-loop to iterate through an arrays slightly adapted for javascript since the arrays can tell you its length while you need to keep track of that yourself in c

10706576
getter	setter
you are far better off using dead simple getter setter implementations -- synthesize ideally -- and move all change-response logic outside of the getter setter

10706576

when i send http post get the tool that i am using either a browser or java sends information about itself

10707021
getter	setter
you could make getter and setter

10707021
getter	setter
this is basically the same as a getter and setter but you can get away with one function instead of multiple functions for each member it can get messy though if not maintainted properly

10707047

10707288
onclick	onchange
to observe changes to idl attributes like htmlselectelement.value input events like onclick or onchange are probably your best bet

10707293
getter	setter
since our getter setter methods don t actually do anything .

10707293
getter	setter
however properties become very useful when the setter getter actually does something more than just assign return an attribute s value

10707322

getter	setter
if the getter setter are really as trivial as that then you shouldn t even bother with them just use an instance variable

10707336
getter	setter
if you do need a getter setter that does something interesting then you should switch to a property as mgilson described

10707338
width	height
you can put both in a wrapper with position set to relative and define a fixed width and height to it

10707338
children	parent
it s necessary to define a height because both elements have the position set to absolute it makes the elements to be removed from the normal flow of the document so the parent element in this case the wrapper won t add the height of the absolute positioned children to its own

10707338
children	parent
also note that defining the parent s position to relative will affect the position of the children as their position will be calculated in relation to the parent s position

udp	tcp
you certainly could implement the tcp algorithms on top of udp

10726333
udp	tcp
that would effectively be the same as tunneling tcp datagrams inside of udp datagrams

10726333
udp	tcp
the main reason to implement reliable transport on top of udp is to get away from tcp algorithms in favor of something more efficient

10726333
udp	tcp
so you could implement tcp algorithms on top of udp but you wouldn t want to

10727264
userprincipal	directoryentry
using that extensibility technique which is explained in the msdn article managing directory security principals in the .net framework 3.5 you should be able to also make available a custom attribute which i assume is how you store that password hint in your directoryentry on an extended userprincipal class

10727279

all that matters is that the decoder gets the same assignment of 0 s and 1 s as the encoder

int	chars
it is having trouble because it wants to implicitly convert from a generictype to an int to a chars but it also could return a string and so there is an ambiguity and both match generictype

10743208
range	max
if your range is limited to max long values of 10 12 then a problem in regards to space is that you must use longs because you only need a few bits more than an int can hold

hide	show
on the other hand you could wrap all div s with payments method in one div with id let s say paymentsmethods and then show hide it

10743233
backbone.js	javascriptmvc
the easiest way to do so is probably by using some sort of javascriptmvc type framework like backbone.js where you would have a collection of models representing each item and a view for each item that is hooked up to a particular element in the dom in your case an li and can be wired to respond to events on that element for example when you click the item that items view responds to its click event and acts accordingly

versioning	upgrade
since doxygen s parser is rather loose it is a lexical scanner not really a parser it might work as well if you do not 100 follow the grammar rules of the language but it will be a trail and error process to find out which deviations are allowed and might break if you upgrade to a future versioning of doxygen

10743283

10743806

10744069
width	height
each symbol which i ll again remind should be defined using this meta-language should be able to access its child symbols informations not others to avoid deadlocks and circular referencing for example the user may want the height and width of a symbol to be equal to the sum of the height and width of all the child s symbols or to use the same picture and so on

int	double
t can be int double float etc..

10744598
int	double
t can be int double float etc

10744598
int	double
further if you have a recent standard library implementation that implements c++11 a call to std fabs with an int type argument will automatically convert the argument to type double so there is no ambiguity

i am parsing a rss feed

viewdidload	viewdidappear
so yeah between viewdidload and viewdidappear the view gets its dimension and boundaries it s totally reliable and also documented in the viewcontroller docs

10744984
viewdidload	viewwillappear
notice also that viewdidload will be called every time the views need to be created like first time and after a low memory warning -views are usually deallocated when memory is needed- and viewwillappear will be called every time a view controller is on top of the stack and its views are about to be rendered

10744985

10745112

example a lowercase a will be reported as 65 by keydown and keyup

10745291
min	max
that said having looked at the results it looks like there should be an algorithm to determine how many weightsets there given a weightsno min and max and from there it should be fairly straightforward to fill those in with possible values

sensormgr is null when you reach onresume since you forcibly set it to null in your onpause method

10745685
onkeyup	onkeydown
but as far as forcing the user to enter 5 letters before the postback occurs you would probably need to do onkeyup and onkeydown javascript events to check if they have entered 5 characters and then you could cause the postback

10745696

if this thread is blocked in a selector then the thread s interrupt status will be set and it will return immediately from the selection operation possibly with a non-zero value just as if the selector s wakeup method were invoked

10746212
ciimage	uiimage
for what it s worth i think the error is when i convert the uiimage from the camera to a ciimage but it could be anything

10746220
hash	md5
one idea i ve heard here is to create an md5 hash column for indexing and comparison

10746233
int	boolean	int	double	int	chars
it has methods println println boolean println chars println double println float println int println long println object and println string

10746250

safari 5.1.6 on os x similar to google-chrome on linux first click expands options subsequent click on options triggers click event unlike google-chrome safari hides the select element when showing options

10746258
int	boolean
im assuming you mean t println not printin java has a println function for each datatype so you can call println on boolean int strings ect and it will select the right function

10746306
fontfamily	font-size
i used a conditional comment to target ie8 and older and set the fontfamily to inherit. padding works fine as does font-size

the idea is to allow devs to extend this class and use the protected methods within the class imadev but leave it up to the dev to expose them as public overriding the methods as they see fit

10746472
client-side	server-side
the number of repeats is set both server-side data posted by the controller may have multiple languagefromtos and client-side an add button that allows the user to add another div with its contained select s in different cases so i presume knockout s templating is a no-go as mvc needs to loop through and render each row so that it can catch them all on a normal post back

knockout.js	upshot
the short answer is that steve sanderson s demonstration of knockout.js upshot and entity framework 4.x code-first to build a single page application was while great

10747575
knockout.js	upshot
once the data is delivered through the webapi and reaches the client via upshot then frameworks like knockout.js would be able to consume the data and deliver the very high level of interactivity cutting edge web applications require

10747575
versioning	upgrade
upshot.js the renamed and upgrade versioning of ria js was supposed to take care of several of the mundane tasks listed above

10747575
knockout.js	upshot
note i am still uncertain how to access the upshot meta-data and tie it to a validation framework like jquery validation or one of the knockout.js validation plugins

10747575
children	parent
when the relationship was removed from the parent the ability to navigate a list of children was also removed

10747575

what we find is that in steve s demo is that his relationship only goes one way and it binds the child to the parent rather than the parent to the children

after click the width gets to 100px but the height is still 30px why

10747952

i can get and post successfully which is great

10748095
sorting	filtering
it supports filtering and sorting

therefore if you use that method in an abstract-class every subclass of it could be looking for the resource in a different place

10748192
button	checkbox
be warned it may have been the intention of the developers to not show radio checkbox button so your app may have approval issues because of the ui guidelines

10748272
margin	height
it collapses through hr.clear as it has no height padding border resulting in 90px of margin above hr.clear but it also applies the correct margin of 90px below the floating element

int	chars
if chars fits inside int it will be promoted to an int and the result will be as you expect

10748538
viewdidload	viewwillappear
it would seem a better place for this view setup is in the viewdidload or viewwillappear that way it will be recreated correctly if the controller needs to build the view the next time it is pushed

10748596
width	height
i am working with an image which has four color where each color perform different operation.like when i click on color red it take pixel value through bitmap and if color get matched corresponding operation performed.but now i am facing one problem like so i set bitmap height and width manually

width	height
i have a table row 2 column 19 with 37 image button and one that image.1st row has one image and 18 image button and 2nd row has 19 image button.that is why if i set height and width of this image manually different device that image takes space which i set by bitmap and other button get stretchered it shows different screen different view .so what should i have to do.can i set bitmap width and height manually

you should be able to get a file upload url with it but you ll need to post to a custom servlet if you want to actually upload files

10748650
int	double
is there some other way of parsing the location in double to int to give it to geopoint

10748662
int	double
instead of attempting to filter out the - and int before parsing it uses a parseentry parser that returns a just double if it is a float value just 0 for and nothing for int and dashes

10748783
hide	show
so basically my problem is that i need to hide whatever is passed in the parameters or show it if it already hidden

10748783
hide	show
it is sending the alerts and everything is correct however it does not hide or show the table..

10748867
width	height
i think you give fix height and width of text view

10748879
int	double
it was not zooming due to the reason i was using xvaluetype as chartvaluetype.time.when time is converted in double the int part remains the same whereas only decimal part changes.hence there was only one int point on the x axis an hence zooming was disabled

10748899
hide	show
very simple use toggle intead of show hide toggle makes element visible if it is hide and hide it if it is visible

int	double
i would like to encode a pair of int in a double

10749419
int	double
but instead i want just one double to represent the two int ie

10749419
int	double
is there a way to do this through some tricky mathematical method so that i can pass a function a double that represents 2 int

10749426
subtract	add
it is just easier to create them on the stack since when leaving a function you can adjust the frame pointer with a simple add subtract depending on the growth direction of the stack and so automatically free the used space for the next function

10749429
jobs	cron
then you have to choices you can either run cron jobs to clean out the data or you clean up the records that are not valid when another user sends a sms etc

width	height
once you resize a panel width and height are fixed

10749516
width	height
every time the layout has to be recalculated it verifies if width and height are fixed or not in order to determinate if width and height should be recalculted or not

10749516
width	height
what you can do is set width and height to undefined and call dolayout after you show new content

10749554
opera	google-chrome
you can do it for google-chrome and opera but you ll have to instruct your users because it isn t very safe yet

10749598
int	double
a double can exactly represent an int up to 53 bits

10749609
int	double
if you re lucky and an int is half a double you can store the int like this

10749609
int	double
if a double and int have the same number of bits what you want is impossible

10749634
int	double
if you are always passing two int to this one parameter then it makes no sense to pass a double

10749634
int	double
the way you are doing it leaves you no opportunity to detect the difference between a true double and two int

10749638
gridbaglayout	boxlayout
if you still want to use boderlayout on the jframe because you need some side panel or something like that you can just wrap your jpanel with the gridlayout into another jpanel with a gridbaglayout or boxlayout or something similar and then put that other jpanel into the jframe

button	checkbox
how to implement a button that gets all checkbox #39

10749717
int	double
since usually a double has 64 bits in it and each int has 32 bits you d think that you could just store the bits into the double directly

10749717
int	double
because of this stuffing two 32-bit int into a double will appear to work in most cases but if you test it with all possible input values you ll find some cases where the values unexpectedly mutated during their stay inside the double and came out as different values when you decoded them again

10749717
int	double
of course you could get around this by being careful only to set the mantissa bits of the double but that will only give you 26 bits per int so you would only be able to store int values of + - 33 554 432 or so

10749776
checkbox	dropdownlistfor

integer	unsigned
here the two operands in are signed and unsigned int which have an equal integer conversion rank

10751564
integer	unsigned
when multiplying an unsigned int and a signed int both operands are converted to unsigned int and the results is also an unsigned int due to the integer conversion rules for arithmetic expressions in both c and c++ so the result of will be uint_max - 1 in both c and c++

10753368
teamcity	nant
if you can foresee that you re only going to have a small team and a limited number of builds i would recommend teamcity with nant

10753368
teamcity	nant
teamcity s support for msbuild nant and ant based builds is excellent and it has a very nice ajax-based gui that is a joy to use and allows you to set up and configure projects from your browser

10753368
teamcity	jenkins
jenkins is open source and will handle unlimited projects like teamcity it can run on a server while sending builds to separate build agents and it has plugins for many c++ tools think static analysis unit testing and packaging

teamcity	jenkins
jenkins web interface is not quite so convenient and beauftiful as teamcity but it s widely used and has plugins for almost anything

if you look at php s crypt function you can see that the salt will be included in the hash value itself

10753526
rainbowtable	salt
it s the job of the salt to make already existing rainbowtables useless because a rainbowtable has to be built for one specific salt

10753526
rainbowtable	salt	rainbowtable	hash	hash	salt
using a different salt for every hash will prevent rainbowtable attacks because you would have to create a rainbowtable for each hash

this automatically generates accessor methods for both fields sensible tostring equals and hashcode implementations - and you also get pattern matching as an added bonus

mutators	setter
you shouldn t override property mutators setter if you re working with an nsmanagedobject subclass because those implementations are provided at runtime hence dynamic instead of synthesize

10753795
hide	show
consequently i altered the code to hide and show tabs rather than create and destroy them

i strongly believe that you do not just have to accept that when the subprocess prints anything on screen writes to stdout or stderr the pipes are broken and everything crashes

10754225
dbcontext	objectcontext
apparently your class entities is derived from dbcontext and not objectcontext

10754233

i got a backgroundimage that covers 100 width and height auto of the browsersize

10754251
int	double

10754321
int	double
convert.toint32 8.6 is the safe way to ensure your double gets rounded to the nearest int in this case 9

10754324
oncreate	onnewintent
doing so it invokes the onnewintent in the first activity instead of oncreate

10754328
prepare	execute
you could use sqlite3_exec instead which simply execute a statement without doing the prepare execute two-step

10754338

10754496
maven	m2e
just like what m2e does for maven project

10754547
stdout	stderr
furthermore because start creates a new console and new stderr and stdout you are catching the output of start not of ipconfig

10754597
put	get
in the other hand if we continue from your query then you need to get the value of lastname + firstname into a string and use string.split function to put in a string array then if the word lastname+firstname check the array 0 index for the lastname and array 1 for the firstname

to give a bit of history in the setclass function an option access was provided to create so-called privileged slots that could only be accessed through getter and setter provided with the class

10755883
getter	setter

10755883
getter	setter
it also allows me to economize heavy calculations by avoiding overhead created by getter and setter

10755883
getter	setter
they just don t provide getter and setter for slots that the average user shouldn t reach

iâ m guessing i need a doctype because the following font styling only appears how i want it in safari and google-chrome

width	height
so unless the iframe itself takes up 100 of the height and width of the screen then no i don t believe you can play the movie at fullscreen size

in the case of directx it s a bit the same microsoft has published specs for com so anybody who follows those specs can get interop with essentially any com object within reason -- a 64bit compiler probably isn t going to work with a 16-bit com object written for windows 3.1

you can do the same thing with much cleaner code with chr ord and array_map

10762706
uiview	subviews
when you zoom the web view the content view size is changing but your ego view will not get a resize message because either the content view is not a true uiview or the scroll view is blocking the resizing of it s subviews somehow just a guess on the implementation

10762829
min	max
if you view the html source do you have a td s with the classes min max and quantity

10762884
post	get
the reason you have that error is that your routes file is configured for a get not a post

10762894
equals	compareto
so when i use the compareto method nothing is assuring me that inside both objects the 2nd elements of their arrays will have a field say the name field and therefore if that were not to be true it could be comparing a name with age cause inside it only holds an array of field s that are equals type as long the key class knows

10762910
subtract	add
since you know the numbers are all positive another option is to add 0x1p23 and subtract 0x1p23

10762979

so it would seem that all you need to do is take the declared width and height from the image dictionary and apply the matrix to determine how big the image is in user space

10764558
factors	matrix
however one of the problems from your point of view is that is possible indeed common to concatenate matrix to affect the current scaling so simply looking at the matrix applied to an image won t give you the scale factors applied to that image because something else may have already scaled the ctm

10764558
width	height
then given the width and height of the image work out its dpi

as you have seen the single chars is pushed on stack as a 32bit int eax and it is taken back in eax in the same way

10764848

10768177
width	margin
you take out the width the margin s and position relative for the #box

so far i have been using md5 to hash passwords on my site no salt

10768918

10768918
hash	md5
with md5 no matter the length of the input string the hash was 32-digit

10768918
crypt	hash
does crypt return a standard length of hash too

10768955
crypt	hash
crypt can use different hash algorytms

10768955
int	chars
with md5 it returns 128 bit int with 32 chars hex representation

10768955
crypt	salt
using crypt with a salt once is safe enought

10768958
accessor	properties	accessor	ivar
or you may have a properties declared instead like in which would achieve the same effect but would use the proprety accessor setsomeotherarray or you could still use to set the ivar directly assuming you synthesized it

10768958
uilabel	nsstring
when setting an nsstring property of a framework object say the text property of a uilabel for example it is always copied if anyone knows of a counter-example please comment or edit

shadowing	named
the fact that one is in a tighter scope is only relevant if they have the same named -- the normal rules of shadowing apply

i want to make an edit page when the user go to a question i have a question website he will have a choice to edit that question and when the user click to edit question i want to get all the information about that question from database and put it in an edit page i did that and it works good with all information but i have a problems and it is

folder	directory
the problem i am having is because zf-basic-project was written to be in its own subdomain it refers to things like css via absolute paths css default.css and now that it is a folder within the demos subdomain as far as the browser knows this is actually at zf-basic-project css default.css and therefore i tried to make the rewrite in the directory say zf-basic-project css is actually css which is the code

the trick is to set a custom width and height if necessary

10769231
extjs	sproutcore	ember.js	backbone.js	ember.js	sproutcore	ember.js	batman.js
stativus can be used in any javascript framework backbone.js ember.js sproutcore batman.js extjs sencha etc.

10769368
uiview	subviews
now in the viewdidload method i am adding a subviews to the uiview i put in interface builder like this

10769373

10769382
folder	directory
what i need this script to do however is it needs to search recurssively in all folder for .mkv files and then run the ffmpeg command and save the output to the same directory

10769383
folder	directory
if it s a local page there should be a directory somewhere in your rails app where the files are stored - perhaps there s a static folder or something similar

10769384

you should return the children where enable true and join their parent

10769390

iprincipal	iidentity
it sounds like you miss the fact that the instance of iprincipal iidentity is recreated upon every request

unfortunately i cannot tell you when the stable versioning of node will upgrade beyond that

10769409
google-chrome	firefox

any subclassing of an abstract-class must either implement all of the abstract methods in the superclass or be itself declared abstract

10769731
hide	show
now i want to change show hide so that it is show by default and hidden when clicked

10769763

change the hide to show in dom ready

10769774
hide	show
if you want it to show by default and then hide when clicked.

10769829
width	height
and this the output is value of width and height but don t calculate value of x and y and make out of range in the output screen

10769842
inherited	subclassing
if i subclassing them both to a custom uiviewcontroller the masterviewcontroller will lose its uitableviewcontroller inherited

10769859

this is technically o n because a 32-bit int has a fixed range and can be binary searched in 32 passes max

10769860
opera	safari
it appears on opera safari etc

10769881
qgraphicsview	qgraphicsscene
so i switched to qgraphicsscene qgraphicsview that seems much simpler to use with animations

10769881
qgraphicsview	qmainwindow
at the moment i have a qmainwindow with a qgraphicsview widget that takes all the area

10769918
hide	show
it works fine itself but i need to hide and show it only from a fancybox button and from an esc button

as a django newbie i have some exprience with other python webframework like turbogears and bottle but exploring django i m trying to auto create the admin management for my app model

10769989
listview	gridview
we were not able to do it with listview but we found some example with gridview that looked exactly as we need then we spent some time using gridview and did put the image in the front of the text

10770039
x86	mips
you can compare mips and x86 compiles and look at the assembly language differences at

10770046

i will post the full code of the class below to show as well as the logcat i get when it the application crashes

10770077
bash	tcsh
you should be in a bash tcsh etc

3 reloading parent with all children

10770200
awt	swing
the setvisible method of a component should always be invoked on the edt just like any other modification you make to an swing awt component

10770207
int	double
however when dealing with pods such as double int etc the story is quite different

10770214
ostringstream	std
right now the best you can do is use a std ostringstream

10770233
post	get
this happens both with get and post methods

10770234
put	get
you will have to do your query to get the array but i put in an example so you can see how to use the result

10770259
puts	gets
what is happening is that a and b are interchangeable in the formulas so there are two matches and thus puts gets outputted twice

10770260
int	double
even in 32bit architectures you should pass int and double by value

10770287
post	get
default value is get post

10770308
hide	show
alternatively you could hide the element by default and show it with javascript when the appropriate conditions are met

10770319
debian	mint
there are no nice packages on my mint debian i had to install libpcre3-dev ocaml libcairo-dev libgtk-3-dev and libgimp2.0-dev dependencies first but it should be worth an intsall

10770358
google-chrome	firefox
this is probably due to different cache mechanisms in google-chrome and firefox

10770362
nhibernate	queryover
in nhibernate 3.0 and newer queryover is a strongly-typed wrapper for criteria one of nhibernate s oldest query interfaces inherited from java hibernate

10770370
post	put
i recommend to not put fees and prices into the form and read it out off the post request

10770381
awt	swing
you are right setvisible for any awt swing container starting edt non safe way

10770382
comparator	comparable
if you can a good way to sort by first a then b is to implement comparable in your someobj class and make a comparator method that compares on both a and b

10770435
for-loop	arrays
basic idea is that i want to print out the arrays using a for-loop in the printloop func

10770442
submit	submission
ebay sanitise the input that you place into your listing quite heavily and they would not allow you for example to put html that submit to an external form submission script

10770454
button	checkbox
the problem is whenever the screen size changes when the user rotates the device the checkbox and the button disappear from the screen

10770467
viewdidload	viewdidappear
since you re saying the notification is received after the view is displayed once my suspicion is that you are registering for notifications in a method that isn t run until the view is displayed viewdidload viewdidappear etc.

10770483
httpconnection	downloading
i found some examples here on how to downloading a file but most of them seem to be using httpconnection

10770487
onfocus	onblur
you can use the window object s onblur and onfocus event handlers to find out what the visitor is doing at the browser level

10770494
qgraphicsview	qgraphicsitem
the qgraphicsview has no directly connection to the qgraphicsitem objects inside of the scene

10770494
qgraphicsscene	qwidget
if you really need this kind of normal qwidget behavior in a qgraphicsscene with layouts then you should be looking at qgraphicswidgets which do support layouts

10770539
textview	imageview
but to give a better insight into what i m doing i m trying to create a class that will affect the alpha of an object imageview or a textview for instance

10770564

i get different results from your post of the ascii numbers

10770628
hide	show
i ve got a select that on change gets the id value and im tring to hide all and show th ones that with the same id value

10770643
post	put
my solutions in these cases inevitably end up overriding the object s to_xml method since the create post or update put should internally call the object s to_xml to serialize your data into xml

10770645
google-chrome	firefox
the space is visible in both google-chrome and firefox so its not a browser issue it seems

10770698
minimum	max
this is correct based on a minimum value in the data of 2008-04-01 and a max date of 2012-05-01

10770741
entity-relationship	diagram
here i have seen entity-relationship diagram that there is no auto increment id key is available but in data dictionary i saw id .in entity-relationship diagram which attribute is used as primary key is used as unique key in data dictionary and auto increment id is used as primary key which one is not in the entity-relationship diagram.why this happen

10770741
entity-relationship	diagram
can any one say why primary key id is used without showing it in the entity-relationship diagram

10770741
entity-relationship	diagram
and why entity-relationship diagram s primary key is used as unique key in the data dictionary

10770743
post	get	client-side	server-side
as we know usually client-side technology can t parse vars which are coming from http mean from post and get this job for server-side one

10770750
client-side	server-side
maybe you re assuming that a change in a variable client-side would be reflected but it won t unless you re-execute that server-side code refresh the page

entity-relationship	diagram
but the real primary key from the entity-relationship diagram would be a valid key so why not inform the db off this by flagging it as unique

10770799
superclass	subclassing
i don t see the reason why you would want to do that but i would advise you to do as follows in your subclassing declare a separate nsmutablearray property let s call it nicestmutablearrayever and override the getter for your superclass nsarray property to return the mutablearray instance

10770814
width	height
in order to achieve the result you want in a flexible way you should only use float left on the elements make sure all elements have a well defined width this is important and preferably a height as well but it s not that important

10770851
addclass	removeclass
this allows the usage of the addclass removeclass toggleclass methods for manipulation as well as hasclass for checking

10770852
superclass	subclassing
the subclassing s designated initializer would call the superclass s designated initializer passing in the nsmutablearray to use

10770860
mp3	wav
when i try to convert the file from mp3 to wav with lame it gives me an error

10770890
x86	64bit
apparently i had it compiling to x86 i m on a 64bit machine and vs didn t like that

10770904
express	node.js
i have nodejs plugin installed in intellij but i could not find a way to create a node.js express project as what can be done with webstorm

10770906
post	get
also post and get have different meanings it s not just about how good it looks

10770926
entity-relationship	diagram
i have read and seen that many-to-many relationships in an entity-relationship diagram can be shown by adding another table which includes the primary key of both tables as reference keys

10770929
switching	screens
my guess is that this user independent logon screens that comes up directly after booting when multiple accounts are available or when clicking switching user on the lock screens runs in session 0 while user 1 runs in session 1 user 2 in session 2 and so on

10770932
post	put	post	get	put	get
http requests are mapped based on two attributes the requested url and the http verb get post put etc

10770934
minimization	fminsearch
why is fminsearch not working in this minimization case

10770937
x86	64bit
apparently i had it compiling to x86 i m on a 64bit machine and vs didn t like that

10770972
innodb	myisam
2 it s probably better to use innodb on the table you write to frequently as it supports row level locking as opposed to table level locking provided by myisam

10770994
hide	show
yes you can hide and show different parts of the dom via javascript

10771001
google-chrome	firefox
it works perfectly fine in google-chrome but i ran a test in firefox as the assessors will be using that and it fails to work at all

10771003
fossil	git
like git veracity fossil including a week of trying to install a

10771011
put	get
anyone has any ideas how i can get resizable to put the handles at the edge of the image regardless how big or small the image is instead of placing them at the edges of the full sized image

10771031
hide	show
when a user clicks on the link for a product we hide page 1 and show page 2

10771031
client-side	server-side
in summary this type of manipulation can be done completely on the client-side without any php or server-side code simply using html javascript and css as pointed out by marcel

10771084
children	parent
another option for design time is putting all wanted textboxes in a panel which will be their parent and then iterating over the panel s children controls and cast them to textbox

10771092
super	extends
i know that will work but i was under the impression that there was a way to just call super on the class i m extends from and have it do whatever it would normally do in its constructor

10771094
post	put
put simply the resources keyword specifies that you have an object like a user article post comment etc that you want to have create read update and delete actions on

10771102
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
when you save instances of classes using objectoutputstream change the classes or their names and then attempt to reload them using objectinputstream you are liable to run into trouble with saved instances not matching the new versions of the classes

10771109
superclass	subclassing
you can just call super -- also fyi in your particular example you don t even have to write a constructor in the subclassing it will implicitly call the superclass default constructor

10771110
superclass	subclassing
the parameterless constructor of the superclass is called automatically from the subclassing

10771111
superclass	subclassing
by default subclassing s default contructor will call superclass s default contructor so you can just write

10771119
superclass	subclassing
the superclass no argument constructor is automatically called when a subclassing constructor is called

10771131
put	get
it makes sense that these enhancements put more load on the browser but are there any ways to get around it to make firefox render it just as smoothly as ie

10771190
int	chars
rather than working with string s you can cast int to chars and make use of it directly

10771208
hash	md5
there is no way to convert an md5 hash into another kind of hash

10771208
hash	md5
once you have the new hash you can delete the old md5 hash

10771263
width	height
if you want to match any width height values

10771280
range	minimum
the standard specifies minimum range not the precise range itself

10771339
width	height
the stride will always be of the full bitmap but the scan0 property will be different according to the start point of the lock rectangle as well as the height and width of the bitmapdata

10771339
width	height
so it is basically really just locking the whole bitmap but giving you a pointer to the top-left pixel of the rectangle in the bitmap and setting the scan s width and height appropriately

10771413
portrait	landscape
meaning there is no portrait landscape etc.

10771425
rational-numbers	zero	rational-numbers	fractions
hence my question why aren t rational-numbers implemented and stored as fractions with zero loss of information

10771449
rational-numbers	fractions
the struct you describe only handles rational-numbers those that can be expressed as fractions

10771462
express	node.js
i m programming in node.js using the express framework

10771469
int	chars
if you want to minimize the calls to the random generator you can produce 5 chars from each random int

10771473
subtract	add	multiplying	add	multiplying	subtract
to implement the basic float operations you basically need to be able to add subtract multiplying and divide integers and do some bit shifting

10771527
rational-numbers	zero	rational-numbers	fractions
hence my question why aren t rational-numbers implemented and stored as fractions with zero loss of information

10771532
jmenubar	jmenuitem
you need to add the jmenu and jmenuitem to the jmenubar

10771539
cos	sin
this may seem hard to believe but think about common transcendental functions sin cos log

10771541
iboutlet	ibaction
create an iboutlet not ibaction for both the buttons

10771559
accessor	properties
i would initialize the properties to null make it private with an accessor method and have the accessor do the real initialization the first time it s called

10771570
.htaccess	httpd.conf
enable mod_rewrite and .htaccess through httpd.conf and then put this code in your .htaccess under document_root directory

10771571
post	get
this post happens asynchronously so you don t get a page refresh unless you do something specific in the success section

10771571
post	get
of course you don t have to be doing a post either it could be a get

10771587
mouse	keyboard
if you want ui changes for any type of focus whether via mouse keyboard or programmatically then you should not use focus visual styles and should instead use setters and triggers in styles or templates that are working from the value of general focus properties such as isfocused or isfocuswithin

10771626
put	get
the compiler doesn t care it all gets compiled into a single dll and the folder is irrelevant although by default it does get put into a namespace with controllers

10771672
installation	upgrade
are you asking how to upgrade a 32 bit os installation to 64 bit

10771678
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the following is confirmed to work in ie8 safari 5.1.7 google-chrome 19 firefox 3.6 12

10771686
vsto	add-in
i have created the same button using vsto 3.0 for an outlook 2003 add-in and the same code creates a button that is at the top of the context menu above the open button

10771686
vsto	add-in
i am suspecting the problem is that the itemcontextmenudisplay event is being fired before the other built-in controls are added to the context menu whereas the outlook 2003 add-in button is being created in a method that is fired by the explorer.commandbars.onupdate event which doesn t exist in the vsto 4.0 explorer object

10771702
put	get
you will want to put this in a window.onload or onclick or some other function to make it work but you get idea

10771721
put	get
just put a number input edittext in your xml layout and when it s time to get the input grab the input

10771767
outputstream	inputstream
would be inputstream outputstream usage and you would use nio

10771787
ubuntu	linux
i have installed bottle on my ubuntu linux server using

10771857
bash	zsh
in bash or zsh to read a whole file into a variable without invoking cat

10771857
bash	zsh
invoking cat in bash or zsh to slurp a file would be considered a useless use of cat

10771858
ostringstream	std
the benefit and beauty of std ostringstream and std string is that you don t have to know the size of output in advance which means you don t have to use magic number such as 10 in array declaration

10771869
folder	directory
you need to create a blank wav file in the root directory not the www folder

10771891
facebook	fbconnect
i am using fbconnect in my project for integration of facebook.but now i saw in all apps when the user tap the facebook button it goes directly to the facebook app in the device to open for login.i think this is done with urlschema to communicate the app to app in a device.but how can we o this in case of facebook

10771928
facebook	fbconnect
also the fbconnect code see git github.com facebook facebook-ios-sdk.git has a sample directory with a hackbook xcode project

10771928
facebook	fbconnect
here is the facebook ios tutorial which uses fbconnect

10771951
vb.net	vb6
i remember the old vb6 way if you want to invoke a html element s click event in vb.net code

10771958
ubuntu	linux
i want to change to ubuntu but i can t find a clear answer on if the latest qt sdk for linux will allow me to develop for symbian like it does on windows

10771959
stdout	stderr
why do both stdout and stderr end up printing to both outputs simultaneously

10772006
hide	show
sure i could use jwindow but then i would have to worry about emulating the show hide behaviour of a jpopupmenu using focus etc

10772028
int	boolean
table having boolean column boolean should only accept value 0 or 1 but it is accepting int value as well as string value

10772028
int	boolean
here strip_status boolean column accepting string and int value

10772042
int	boolean	int	chars
you can put arbitrary length strings into int columns floating point numbers in boolean columns or dates in chars columns

10772098
sorting	filtering
i also see the problem that the page reloads when clicking on a sorting filtering such as view all kitchen and miscellaneous which is what you want to prevent

10772098
shadowbox	lightbox
i made a downloadable demo using both quicksand and shadowbox a lightbox alternative here which might interest you since your webpage is linking the filtered icon results to a lightbox alternative named lytebox

10772118
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	webkit	gecko
there s a few swing-based browser widgets floating around which embed a gecko firefox or webkit google-chrome safari renderer and would thus be able to take advantage of proper javascript interpreters but they re all buggy expensive or unmaintained

10772118
swt	swing
eclipse s swt project includes a browser widget that appears to be actively maintained but has a dependence on the swt libraries and would be somewhat more difficult to use in a swing application though it may be possible

10772118
awt	swing	swt	swing
swt is an entirely different ui toolkit from awt swing which you re currently using and in order to take advantage of its browser widget you d have to find a way to embed it in a swing app or use only the swt toolkit

10772154
ivar	subclassing
vistedbyhumans is not actually an ivar but a global variable of your subclassing planet

10772157
width	height
hi i m working on an application that will be loading images and i m looking to scale each image to it s largest possible size for instance if the image is a landscape image if width is larger than height i would like to stretch the width to fill the width of the phone and scale height to keep it s aspect ratio

10772157
width	height
if the height is larger than the width a portrait image the image should be scaled to fit the height of the phone and width should then adjust to keep the aspect ratio i ve had a bit of trouble getting this to work here s what i ve done so far though any help would be greatly appreciated

10772160
width	font-size
because how much width a character or set of characters will take will depend upon the font-size

10772161
post	get
send a http request get post ... to the web server

10772184
hide	show
if yes it hide the close button + the box and show the open button

10772217
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
one tip for debugging this kind of problem is to always start from looking at the console log in web inspector if you are using google-chrome safari or firebug if you are using firefox

10772218
put	get
a single script would get insanely large then i divide by class or put the unittests into a separate file

10772237
google-chrome	safari
if you were using a browser other than safari or google-chrome that might explain any erratic behaviour

10772330
int	boolean
boolean expression automatically cast to int either 0 false or 1 true so you can also do it like this

10772363
folder	directory
the folder would then be created in the default working directory of the program which is the same folder where the executable resides

10772363
folder	directory
you can change this working directory using the setcurrentdirectory function before creating the folder and file

10772373
for-loop	loops
the continue makes it go to the next repeat of the for-loop instead of trying to execute the rest of the current loops - that seems like the right thing to do since the rest of the current loops depends on place lat lng

10772381
width	height
also make sure to update the width and height to match the new screen as well

10772391
width	height
however you have to give a width or height for this to work when the img-src is not found

10772396
google-chrome	firefox
my food menu works perfectly in firefox and ie but not at all on google-chrome

10772400
post	get
after your users authorize your app consumer you can see the realtime api docs on how to get it working and process the post done by foursquare

10772432
mouse	keyboard
a button triggers an action event when it s pressed and released using the mouse and not when it s clicked or when it s pressed using the keyboard space bar mnemonic keyboard shortcut etc.

10772460
width	height
increase either the height or the width to their maximum depending on which is already greater

10772533
next	except
itself puts things in next line always..and you don t have anything in except

10772543
google-chrome	firefox
this works perfectly in every internet explorer version i have but in google-chrome and in firefox both of the spans are displayed

10772553
google-chrome	firefox
this works perfectly in every internet explorer version i have but in google-chrome and in firefox both of the spans are displayed

10772569
scatter	graphing
i d like to achieve the same effect on my own scatter graphing although i m using circles rather than paths so it may not be possible

10772582
google-chrome	firefox
though browsers have had awful bugs in implementations of object in the past year this simple technique seems to work on modern versions of ie firefox google-chrome

10772608
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the second issue is that after a few clicks firefox displays a slow script error google-chrome displays a kill page error and safari simply crashes

10772654
width	height
for get display width height

10772657
mp3	ogg	mp3	wav	wav	ogg
is there any solution for converting wav to ogg or mp3 by using pure php

10772677
filewriter	bufferedwriter
you don t need a scanner and a filewriter and a bufferedwriter for this

10772683
jar	war
to give you another point of view and to be constructive i would go with embedding your jar into a war application and you get some things for free the most important i think is that you gain a managed application lifecycle so with a standard web application context listener you can start and stop your program in a managed way

10772693
put	get
then if i put them in a class project add the generated code compile and use this on for the reference parameter i still get code generated for these types

10772700
bluetooth	usb
i am using a usb bluetooth dongle in a winxp sp3 environment

10772700
spp	dongle
with the same bluetooth dongle this spp service may appear when i am using a certain bluetooth stack and may disappear when i am using another bluetooth stack.

10772718
glut	glfw
get rid of glut and use something better like glfw

10772751
mouseup	mouseleave
what it should do is it repeat the code until mouseup or mouseleave

10772761
setinterval	clearinterval	setinterval	settimeout	clearinterval	settimeout
solution use setinterval and clearinterval instead of timeout because settimeout only executes the closure function once or settimeout in your closure function

10772778
width	height
calculate the maximum size and set the canvas width and height properties

10772785
width	height
now regarding your bounds normally we set to the width and height of the current webpage but this is always from the developer to know exactly what he wants from the animation sometimes we could simply want a strip-a-like size.

10772848
pull	push
if i need to make changes to it i do them in one of the projects then i cd src company sharedbundle commit to it and push it and pull from all projects that use it when i need the changes

10772856
pywikipedia	mediawiki
pywikipedia is a python bot framework for automatically editing mediawiki wikis like wikipedia

10772857
pywikipedia	mediawiki
pywikipedia is a python package for using bots to automatically edit mediawiki wikis such as wikipedia

10772859
google-chrome	safari
is it only in google-chrome or is it the same in safari ie

10772888
hide	show
from a conceptual point of view i don t like to hide show controls on the screen

10772888
hide	show
sometimes if you have a very cluttered form is better to separate the two functionality inside a tabcontrol or separate windows or as you have already done with this groupbox hide show functionality

10772900
free	malloc
but when you find you must use malloc then you would need to free it

10772900
free	malloc
typically parameter ivar local variable you would declare the enum by value but like int you may occasionally need to use malloc + free

10772920
notepad++	textwrangler
the regexp that you can run in various texteditors such as textwrangler mac or notepad++ pc

10772932
onmousedown	onmouseup
you have to manage yourself click and double click detection using the onmousedown and onmouseup

10772932
onmousedown	onmouseup
a click is a onmouseup following a onmousedown with almost no move between both

10772932
move	drag
if you do manually the drag drop that is without using the not so compatible html5 new feature you ll have tohook onmousemove so that you can display the dragged object during move and it helps detecting move between down and up

10772973
hide	show
i am using acl to grant resources to roles in the system the allowed actions is excuted and denied actions are routed to custom page i want to show and hide menu elements at run time using resources at acl and also i want to show and hide anchors buttons in views

10772987
free	malloc
cardtype type malloc sizeof cardtype - allocates memory on heap mention a pointer because of explicit alloction you are responsible of freeing memory using free type

10773030
post	get
is it possible to post something on a users friends wall without having to get all the friends first so you can get the friend id

10773035
google-chrome	firefox
all of the sudden at least so it seems both google-chrome and firefox behave very strangely when it comes to viewing the source code of a web page

10773052
rss	feed
but if i ask it to open a url like similar to the one i need it to open feed www.ocatacore.com rss news.xml it opens up safari as soon as the view that contains the uiwebview is loaded

10773062
crypt	salt
using characters outside of this range in the salt will cause crypt to return a zero-length string

10773062
hash	salt
you don t need to split the salt from the hash password

10773091
hide	show
yeah honestly i m very disappointed that facebook still didn t do anything to make the button configuration easier show hide count change size etc.

10773101
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
tested on firefox 12 google-chrome 19 safari 5 and opera 10

10773191
pull	push
no ftp as being done directly only push and pull has been used

10773229
xlib	xcb
to provide similar functionality graphics sound input you d need to code directly against the windows api on windows cocoa on mac os x and on unix directly against the posix api and x11 using xcb xlib or the raw x11 protocol

10773236
setinterval	settimeout
i read about settimeout delay ajaxsetup setinterval up to now no success

10773245
spaces	delimiter
you can use strtok to tokenize the string and use white spaces char as your delimiter

10773248
super	implements
so when cglib is not there by default you have all the methods coming from implements interfaces but you will miss proxying of the methods that come from super classes in the hierarchy and that s why you get an exception on this

10773322
hide	show
i need hide the video and show image back after video finished play

10773360
cos	sin
in particular note use of cdef everywhere turning on cdivision and import of sin and cos from the standard library

10773369
expander	grid
traditional approach would be to have grid with header and add column expander which shows grid with detail and model detail has setmasterfield idheader _get header_id

10773466
ember.js	backbone.js
with the excitement around the web for backbone.js ember.js etc i m really interested in learning to use one or some of them but i cannot work out how as a front-end developer i would start building a site with them integrating them into my workflow

10773477
many-to-many	one-to-many
i am currently working on a very big project which involves many-to-many and one-to-many relationships.

10773518
cvs	svn
i ve been using cvs svn and hg for years

10773539
int	boolean
use bitmap.createscaledbitmap bitmap src int dstwidth int dstheight boolean filter

10773577
screens	tablet
however when i test it at higher resolutions on my tablet or emulating a 720p display the text takes up a very small portion of the top center part of the screens

10773579
hash	md5
thus it has a different md5 hash

10773588
spaces	delimiter
operator reads words delimiter by spaces when used with a string parameter

10773617
min	max
note min and max must be inclusive

10773669
int	double
have you considered getting a random double and then casting back to int

10773681
mouse	keyboard
but since the selection is usually made using mouse and keyboard events we can listen to them and check if a selection is made

10773708
min	max
the problem you have is that max - min overflows and gives you a negative value

10773721
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the issue is that in firefox and after window resizing in google-chrome and probably in other browsers i have not tested yet ie safari and opera are not installed on the laptop i am currently working on the offset of the cannon image #cannon is set wrong and i don t know why

10773726
getter	setter
then i used setter and getter as you can see above

10773736
freebsd	linux
the tool is believed to support linux freebsd macos x and windows cygwin environments

10773753
getter	setter
the jettycomponent in camel has getter setter where you can configure this in java code

10773796
children	parent
parent contains many children in an orderedset

10773796
children	parent
if i was programming in another language i might use events having the parent listening for events from each of its children however given that target-action is limited to view components all objective c offers me is use of a global nsnotificationcenter

10773807
opera	firefox
go into the preview print mode for opera firefox available

10773807
opera	firefox
use the available tools like firebug firefox or dragonfly opera to inspect the dom and the current styles

10773814
rss	feed
the only way that you could tell a website had changed without accessing the content is for the website to notify you itself through an api or rss feed or similar mechanism

10773853
mouseup	mousedown
you start moving on mousedown and stop moving on mouseup

10773875
superclass	subclassing
the weird constant definition exists because every observing context should be unique so that you don t tread on superclass or subclassing observation contexts

10773886
debian	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	linux
if you don t able type on your ubuntu you may download and install completely mysql server 5.5 package from here select platform debian linux

10773889
google-chrome	firefox
as a compliment to joseph the dreamer s answer i have ran some quick checks in firefox google-chrome

10773897
google-chrome	firefox
when i deploy it to heroku it is fine with google-chrome and firefox

10773992
getter	setter
one more thing to add is i am only referring to properties here since only they have getter and setter

10773993
getter	setter
is it to do with getter setter methods

10773998
getter	setter
the dot syntax is a special case used by property setter and getter

10773998
getter	setter
if you declare a property using the property keyword and then synthesize the setter and getter or declare the setter and getter to be generated independently using dynamic you can access the setter and getter using dot syntax

10773998
getter	setter
in that statement readwrite means i want a getter and a setter and assign means i want the value to be assigned to myint instead of retained or copied

10774022
versioning	upgrade
not sure which versioning of octave is using it but you need an upgrade

10774024
folder	directory
each and every git-repository has a hidden folder called .git in its top-most directory

10774058
udp	tcp
that provides both udp and tcp support

10774058
udp	tcp
reliable udp turns out to be tcp

10774058
udp	tcp
you can write your own custom ack logic on top of udp but generally it is better to go with tcp for stuff that needs to reach server and udp for everything else

10774058
udp	tcp
in jetserver the same session uses both udp and tcp to communicate

10776252
libstdc++	libc++
if i m not mistaken llvm s libc++ does but gcc s libstdc++ does not. since this is a quality of implementation issue that s often outside the control of your own code the main thing you can do here to minimize the impact is be aware of the possibility that automatic objects allocate dynamic memory and avoid creating more than you need for example by using pointers or references when possible

in your code any given draggabletoolbarview instance has two properties to connect to delegates one called toolbarviewdelegate which it inherited from its superclass and one called draggabletoolbarviewdelegate which is defined in draggabletoolbarview itself

10777549
superclass	subclassing	ivar	subclassing
this is allowed as long as the name of the backing ivar in the subclassing is different than that of the superclass

10777549

now you can send setdelegate to a draggabletoolbarview and it will use the same delegate for the dragging methods and the show hide methods

bottle	flask
i have never used flask or bottle or the other microframeworks but i would keep in mind where your project will be in the future

10777923
bottle	flask
i d totally go with flask unless one dependency bottle is better than three flask jinja2 and werkzeug

10777923
flask	web.py
i d suggest to avoid web.py it works but is full of magic and is inelegant compared to flask or bottle.

10777938

10778037
width	height
second i did note that the content adds up to 430 and yet you have your background image set at 477px e..g background images bg_content.jpg width 903px height 477px - that might be the cause

express	everyauth
it s for sns-auth-process using everyauth and the project is based on express

10778149

if you need to persist it between jvm instances you may want to allocate a range store the max of that range in a database or other transactional store and make sure to request a new range when you get close to the max in the atomiclong plus appropriate locking to ensure you don t go past that range

10778235
width	height
the outer container fits perfectly with percentages for width and height

10778260

rvm	bundler
given my trivial rvm config will the new ruby option in bundler s dsl mean i no longer need to specify a .rvmrc file at all

10778304

mp4	h.264	mp4	webm	h.264	webm

10778804
comparator	comparable
natural ordering means that the elements must implement comparable so that they can be compared without the use of a comparator

10778804
comparator	comparable
the tricky part about giving the caller a choice between comparable elements and a comparator is that you can t do compile time checking to make sure they fulfilled at least one of these requirements

10778804
comparator	comparable
treeset s contract is essentially to throw a classcastexception if you try to insert an element that isn t a comparable if you didn t provide the treeset with a comparator when you created it

10778819
comparator	comparable
both comparable and comparator work by following the same principle but the first one as the name states is attached to a data class so that it is its natural comparator

google-chrome	firefox
we ve already got this kinda-sorta working with html5 indexeddb but google-chrome is stupidly slow with large amounts of data 10 min to load and current versions of firefox have a lovely bug that randomly and irretrievably trashes the entire db so this is plan b -- plus we d really like to have a user-specifiable file that they can then backup mail around etc

10779214

i have searched for clearinterval to stop the setinterval .

10785427
width	margin
problem is with width margin that i have placed for div blocks

10785447
linefeed	delimiter
if the line terminators are always one or the other i d suggest setting up 2 file connection managers one with the crlf row delimiter and the other with the linefeed row delimiter

10785537
setinterval	clearinterval	setinterval	settimeout	clearinterval	settimeout
another way of looking at it is using settimeout instead of setinterval and clearinterval

10785539
google-chrome	firefox
this fiddle return the correct value of 5 5 in both ie and firefox but in google-chrome it returns 5.5

10785539
google-chrome	firefox
which means that the client sets the culture both google-chrome and firefox reports sv-se so the globalize culture loaded is sv-se like in the fiddle above

10785541
entity-relationship	diagram
seen this many times in textbooks where entity-relationship diagram are explained by example and the key is often missing if it s not needed to explain whatever.

10785570
keydown	keyup	keydown	mouseup	keyup	mouseup
i tired keyup focusout keydown and mouseup events but doesn t seem to work as expected

10785571
textview	imageview
i think other view like textview imageview put in relativelayout and this relativelayout put in scrollview.and complete the tag of scrollview .now you should add listview below scrollview

10785579
implements	extends
make your sensors implements extends the interface classes

10785588
inherited	subclassing
the pointcut picks out all method executions for public methods returning void and having no arguments that are either declared in or inherited by middle even if those methods are overridden in a subclassing of middle

10785649
innodb	myisam
just remember that you need to use the innodb storage engine the default myisam storage engine doesn t support foreign keys

10785741
pop-up	dialog
the dialog box doesn t pop-up

10785789
ubuntu	linux
i want my shift lock button to act like escape in linux ubuntu for in vim

fancybox	colorbox
and all the colorbox fancybox other light box alternatives

10785843
opera	firefox
i tried in ie firefox and opera

10785847
width	height
add overflow auto or overflow scroll and a width height to your div s css this will give you a scroll bar that will wrap the text and look like a textarea well without a border

10785872
google-chrome	firefox
the code is working fine in firefox google-chrome but gives the object doesn t support this property or method on ie8 in the line this .get 0 .pausevideo

10786087
put	get
if i put them in select clause or group by clause i dont just get the latest record but the other records as well

10786091
width	height
you need to set a height and width for your .logo

10786115
width	height
i am sure it is not about accessing the element from css bcs when i set the width or height or any other thing in the css it is working

10786192
postgresql	mysql
as for the cdr you can have it as a csv or sqlite file or a relational database like mysql postgresql etc by using the cdr_odbc module

10786250
onresume	onpause
prepare it in onresume and release it in onpause

10786270
128bit	64bit
ideally i would like to specify the hash size 64bit 128bit etc.... but this is not a requirement

10786271
implements	extends
a good reason for a private method would be one that implements something inherent to that object that even an extends class should not change factual reason in addition to encapsulation

10786282
int	chars
my problem is that i don t know how to convert int value to chars array

10786334
hash	salt
use a collision resistant hash function with some static salt along with the internal id reference

10786370
children	parent
once i get the stuff i don t what all of this parent with children but i can t remove both

10786375
stdout	stderr
takes stderr file handle 2 and redirects to stdout file handle 1

10786377
prepare	execute
prepare method will be called before your execute method.i suggest you to go through the working of prepare method and how actually it is being called by the stack

10786397
stdout	stderr
redirects stderr to stdout

10786435
draggable	droppable
once you ve put in jquery you can just use the jquery ui library and use the draggable and droppable interfaces

10786448
ready	each
first on dom ready let s store the initial indices to data of each element

10786454
width	height
i also don t want to give coordinate as a hard coded value but want to calculate using screen width height cause i want to run same application on torch i torch ii model of blackberry

10786475
google-chrome	firefox
i m trying to write a greasemonkey script that will work on either google-chrome and firefox

10786496
auto-generate	edmx
.designer.cs files are auto-generate and should never be modified because every save to edmx even after moving some entity in diagram or t4 template if you use it will trigger recreation

10786528
filesystems	fat
we all know that android doesn t support any filesystems for sd cards except fat

10786560
src	attr
you can also applies the jquery attr function to change the src and alt of that div

10786574
google-chrome	firefox
with firefox it seems to be working with a window.refresh...but not working in google-chrome safari...etc

10786576
width	height
since these cells don t have any content and only serve to visually represent days when the rooms are booked it seems rather pointless for them to have width larger then height

10786577
width	height
your height of scrol view is 250 and width also 250

10786582
rbac	acl
you could probably use an rbac for this but it would take a lot of roles to do it and some customizations and you d end up creating an acl anyways

10786597
solaris	aix
i want to port our application which works on windows linux solaris aix etc. but i have a lot of problem with locale

10786652
min	max
if all you want are linearly distributed bins from min to max then it is quite easy to write

10786671
hide	show
so the page has an apropriate javascript to show hide this

10786674
folder	directory
while iterating through aces i found that for aces with inherit flags applied to is folder subfolders directory

10786676
cpu	hyperthreading
i have 2 physical cpu each one is quad core and hyperthreading is enabled

10786685
queue	fifo
a job queue is a queue that is a fifo fifo collection of tasks to be carried out at an unspecified time in the future

10786710
pop-up	dialog
this may sound ridiculous but a certain website sets content-disposition to attachment for images and i don t want the â save asâ dialog to pop-up every time

10786728
min	max
then i m setting max and min and using line height as the variable

10786735
google-chrome	firefox
it does block however when i request delay from within 2 google-chrome tabs or firefox and it executes sequentially causing the 2nd request to take 10 secs

10786783
hide	show
how can show and hide image

10786813
distance	polygons
but the condition was that the side of the polygons was 1 and not the distance between centre and vertices so we must scale

10786868
inherited	properties
due to properties value inherited all instances of links inherited the style that you have created because you did not use x key attribute

10786874
post	get
or if you are trying to pass values from javascript to php you will need to make use of http request variables post get or xhr.

10786876
width	height
but as the width of the div gets smaller i need the height to adjust as well

10786941
put	get
you need to get out the and if you already put your code inside those tags

10787010
put	get
i have to put somehwere otherwise i get this error

10787020
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
while a non-fixed width 100 takes all the container s width the height of an element when not set to a fixed size will stretch to accomodate any in-flow content including padding margin borders...

10787045
hash	md5
another way you can do it if you don t want to keep track of timestamps although that is the best method is to keep track of md5 hash or sha1 or whatever is least resource heavy

10787059
sorting	grouping
you will most likely have to grouping by category_name as well as sorting

10787065
portrait	landscape
the solution below will save 2 styles portrait rotated by 90 if original in landscape and vice versa

10787073
children	parent
you may have to tinker with the kind of join you use i know what should should nt have children but it will give you all the children categories with their parent sorted the way you ve asked

10787117
hash	salt
precomputation is pretty easy computing a table for id s 1-100 with all sorts of salt is actually a promising strategy since the attacker knows that it s sequential database ids that were hash here

10787206
folder	directory
so i just had to move the image folder into src so it will automatically make a copy of this directory into bin

10787246
switching	screens
if its the case each time you switching between the two screens all the changes you ve made on the character are reverted back in flash everytime a movieclip is instanciated or readed from a new keyframe its like it was a new movieclip used

10787246
switching	screens
or even a global _root variable even if its really ugly and re-apply that color to your character each time you switching between different screens

10787262
post	get
somehow they are able to redirect the user to a different page with some sort of get variable in the url which is what i understand to be the advantage of using get over post

10787298
min	max
then the tuning problem become one of max min size on the pool what the idle time is to prune the pool and what the behavior is fail vs block when the pool is maxed

10787316
equals	gethashcode
this method requires that you override the equals and the gethashcode methods for the car type

10787316
equals	gethashcode
that way my equals method simply checks for id equality and my gethashcode method returns base.gethashcode

10787350
equals	gethashcode
if they are you should potentially just use the default implementation of equals gethashcode which uses reference identity for equality

10787369
setinterval	clearinterval
first the setinterval clearinterval functions use a number variable to work

10787369
setinterval	clearinterval
setinterval returns a number variable and clearinterval takes that number in parameter to remove the previous started interval

10787373
vsto	add-in
seen a quite a few examples of calling vsto functions from vba using automation add-in com interop etc but not the other way round

10787373
vsto	add-in
i have an excel application vsto add-in that is only designed to work with only the one excel workbook

10787387
google-chrome	firefox
this is working like a charm on firefox and google-chrome but doesn t work on internet explorer 8

10787400
getter	setter
there s no difference until you decide to rename the generated getter setter methods and the message is likely to become invalid

10787400
accessor	properties
for the public instance variables you can skip the accessor methods both properties and method styles and use the structure dereference operator

10787422
google-chrome	safari
i suspect it would also be a problem in google-chrome safari and most if not all other browsers as well as i see what appears to be a special case for ie in the yui button click handler

10787422
submit	submission
finally since yui is submission the form on click yet another solution should be just to catch the form s submit event and check if the event target is your button do what you need to do then let the submit go or stop it as needed

10787462
post	get
the http protocol defines get type requests as being idempotent while post may have side effects

10787462
post	get
in pain english that means that get is used for viewing something without changing it while post is used for changing something

10787462
post	get
for example a search page should use get while a form that changes your password should use post

10787495
equals	gethashcode
instead of implementing equals and gethashcode just use removeall

10787495
equals	gethashcode
implementing equals and gethashcode in the way you describe strikes me as extremely dodgey - if your equals implementation returns true then your gethashcode method needs to return the same value so that those two objects will be placed in the same bucket in a hashtable

10787495
equals	gethashcode
implementing equals and gethashcode isn t entirely trivial and is probably something i d generally avoid doing if there are alternatives

10787522
post	put	post	get	put	get
i am developing an api that stores user request get put post delete

10787570
ant	maven
there are soo many advantages to using ant or maven

10787570
ant	maven
maven is more or less an update concept of ant

10787570
jar	war
so if your manager was to ask you to copy two hundred directories but ignore jar war and ear files within those directories and once copied

10787570
ant	maven
so that in mind ant or maven will accomplish and prepare all this on the fly with less overhead for your application to use

10787570
ant	maven
the size of the code in ant or maven will be 1 4 compare to java

10787571
post	get
if you re using forms based auth you can either fabricate the cookie for it or do a post and simulate the user logging in to get the cookie

10787600
implements	extends
and forces all extends classes to implements their own method render

10787624
children	parent
register the delegate for the parent and all children but that seems to be what you want to avoid...

10787624
children	parent
setontouchlistener still exists in m4a you can use it on the parent and all children same effect as option 1

10787634
for-loop	loops
i d argue that a for-loop is the wrong type of loops here it doesn t correctly express the intent of loops and would definitely suggest to me that you re not going to mess with the counter

10787655
std	ostream
warning friend declaration â std ostream operator std ostream const nvector â declares a non-template function -wnon-template-friend

10787655
std	ostream
error â std ostream nvector operator std ostream const nvector â must take exactly one argument

10787667
getter	setter
how can i correctly emulate property . setter getter deleter

10787685
equals	gethashcode
why is it important to override gethashcode when equals method is overridden

10787685
equals	gethashcode
nhibernate reasons for overriding equals and gethashcode

10787702
udp	tcp
i m writing a network library that utilises both tcp and udp simultaneously to transfer serialized objects over the internet

10787708
hide	show
add a function that will show or hide those products when a slide event occurs

10787726
google-chrome	firefox
firefox 11 and google-chrome 19.0.1084.52

10787766
noexcept	throw
based on what i have read so far the last-minute addition of noexcept seems to address some important issues that arise when move constructors throw

10787782
margin	height
how can i get the full height border padding margin of an element div in javascript

10787784
width	height
i ve written a couple test methods one that returns an int one a simple custom window object with width height members and successfully called both from the c++ app

10787813
stdout	stderr
another approach if you can t edit the source code of the to be executed class is to use runtime#exec to execute the class programmatically using the java command the usual way like as you would execute it in command prompt and then capture its stdout and stderr

10787827
google-chrome	firefox
i have a javascript that works fine in ie9 and firefox but not in google-chrome

10787919
opensuse	debian	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	opensuse
by far the most popular are deb ubuntu debian and rpm fedora mandriva opensuse but there are also systems that distribute tgz files

10787937
profiling	instrumentation
instrumentation which is included in xcode ide already provides a good suite of profiling and performance tools

10787962
post	put
this is the post which sends the input as soon enter is pressed it s placed in the body not in the header couldn t figure out how to put it in the header -- vbulletin template

10788010
recv	epoll
then instead of blocking on a recv send or an accept call you block on either a poll epoll or select call - then handle that event for that connection as much as you are able to

10788035
fiddler	charles
it looks like you want wireshark or fiddler or maybe even charles

10788052
folder	directory
i should also note that i ended up copying the glm folder to my include directory reciding in my mingw folder

10788059
next	except
disable include in next previous navigation for all annotations except occurrences

10788071
width	margin
so my guess is a margin of -200px which is as you say the negative equivalent of the width of the #left element itself causes it to float all the way up and to the right rather than to the left and to hug the edge of the #center element which itself is also floated

10788084
post	get
this method allows a full control over the requests made by the navigator filter and access to the request data headers get and post values etc.

10788084
post	get
you could log the requests analyze the requests and their post get fields etc

10788101
noexcept	throw
noexcept is primarily used to allow you to detect at compile-time if a function can throw an exception

10788205
google-chrome	firefox
this works perfectly on ie and firefox but on google-chrome it refuses to submit anything

10788241
width	height
to find your minimum width and height in density-independent pixels dp use

10788241
width	height
should use 72 dp for a height of one cell 294 dp and for a width of

10788263
versioning	upgrade
the solution should not modify the core since this would add many problems with upgrade and maybe future magento versioning

10788282
hide	show
i think it s better to do this with css classes rather than a load of hide show methods

10788380
width	height
the margin-left and margin-top should be negative one half of the width and height of the box respectively

10788446
entity-relationship	diagram
i am trying to create an entity-relationship diagram by reverse engineering a mysql database using a .sql file

10788447
setinterval	settimeout
you need to use settimeout or setinterval to trigger an action at some time in the future

10788457
google-chrome	firefox
i have an answer form google-chrome in firefox is the same

10788457
postgresql	mysql
in mysql this data was added to the db but the form is still on primary screen in web browser on postgresql nothing happend but the form is still on primary screen in web browser

10788461
noexcept	throw
if a function marked noexcept does throw then std terminate is called

10788461
noexcept	throw
allowing the specification of noexcept when calling functions that may theoretically throw but are not expected to for the given arguments

10788488
weblogic	oc4j
on weblogic and oc4j i get back a plain text stream listing the files within the folder

10788512
post	get
when i edit a post for the first time the title and details completely get wiped

10788517
draggable	droppable
this is using jquery s capabilities via draggable and droppable elements

10788538
post	put
put another way can websites cause the browser to post arbitrary content to third-party domains

10788563
postgresql	mysql
is there a way to create a trigger or automatic function in mysql postgresql or oracle that would be able to process billing on a daily basis without using anything external to the database to trigger it besides system date

10788601
ubuntu	linux
i am developing for the arduino uno on linux ubuntu 10.04 lts

10788619
profiler	visualvm
also using the profiler included in visualvm might hint at stuff that is consuming lots of cpu or memory

10788623
groupbox	panel
what i want is to pass a groupbox and a panel into the continuewith method so i can add search results to the panel

10788624
post	get
is it possible to get or make the server think it s received a post request

10788628
width	height
i made a table in my page with height of 50px and width 100 and one row in that table in which i inserted three tds first one of width 100px and third one of 50 px

10788628
google-chrome	firefox
i when directly wrote it s width 100 in style tag for this td it was fine with google-chrome but not with firefox and when i wrote auto it was fine with firefox but not with google-chrome

10788630
width	height
well it looks like it tries to maintain the aspect ratio height width

10788654
submit	submission
many email providers like google yahoo and hotmail will show ugly warnings about submission data to 3rd parties when you attempt to submit a form inside an email

10788698
getter	setter
it is the combination of a getter and a setter for some type a which has a field of type b so memberlens above would be a lens data int

10788698
getter	setter
well let s first make two simple functions that extract the getter and setter from a lens

10788698
getter	setter
what all of the lens packages do is essentially to wrap this concept of lenses - the grouping of a setter and a getter into a neat package that makes them easy to use

10788714
put	get
given the new entry is get the site1.com part using the function below i got it here and put the result inside the like

10788723
post	get
this so post describes 75 of what i m trying to solve and i think i could finish off my understanding if i could just get the answer s code to run on my localhost apache2 mysql5.1 phpmyadmin

10788724
stdout	stderr
unfortunately the windows implementation of qprocess is hard-coded to check once every 100 milliseconds for stdout stderr from the external process

10788731
switching	screens
if the mpmovieplayerviewcontroller switching to fullscreen then rotating the screens then exit fullscreen the views are not well arranged they should be automatically

nsstatusbar	nsstatusitem
the nsstatusbar class defines an object that manages a collection of nsstatusitem objects displayed within the system-wide menu bar

10788892
post	get
that said its pretty easy to setup flash to communicate with remote scripts as it has the ability to post get data through requests

10788901
int	chars
i guess the genre_id production_id and approved are int columns and not chars so it s no use to have quotes around numbers like 25

10788921
width	height
i tried opening it up with a hex editor and am trying to figure out its image height and width and its offset to the pixelarray

10788921
width	height
qn2 anyone knows how i can figure out which byte represent the height and width of the image

10789030
noexcept	throw
the compiler will try to figure this stuff out but it usually can t the function in question might be in another object file not visible to the compiler or transitively use some function which is not visible or when it does there is some trivial exception which might be throw that you re not even aware of so it can t implicitly label it as noexcept allocating memory might throw bad_alloc for example

10789070
post	get
you ve changed the queryset for the field for a get request but not for a post

10789070
post	get
either change it at the beginning of the view so it happens for both post and get or even better do it in the form s __init__ method

10789091
setcontentview	findviewbyid
findviewbyid only returns views in the xml passed to the current activity s setcontentview typically this is your main.xml for your first activity

10789157
chromebug	add-on
chromebug has been long abandoned venkman doesn t work add-on authors are a little bit stranded there

10789170
int	boolean
it d be easy if i could use this boolean in a sort clause by mapping the distance to the query listing_location and multiplying it with the int representing the boolean true 1 false 0

10789220
hide	show
is there a way i can hide and show the subcategories select boxes instead of disabling them

10789251
range	minimum
disregard the other things inside the string minimum maximum and range but for this line

10789262

well i had kept the middle td blank with specified height and width and was always working but did not work this time

10789265
dictionary	map
i loop my annotation dictionary but it show on map pin image from first dictionary on all my pins

10789284
qfilesystemmodel	qdir
how do you do to sort a qfilesystemmodel with qdir dirsfirst like in qdirmodel

10789306
hide	show
the start ensures its always visible when mouseovered the link is cancel which means it will stop execution if you mouse out too early and if you do mouseout it will then hide the image and remove the oncomplete event so that if you show it once more it stays visible when it comes into view

10789333
int	double
first convert.int32 double does not truncate the value taking the int part and excluding the decimal part

10789333
int	double
exception or something when i try to convert double to int

10789396
int	double
you could try to add some value to the double to make sure it s bigger or smaller than an int can be

10789396
int	double
double - int will work if the variable is in between the int-borders

10789423
int	double
i think you have a double and you want to convert it to int if itâ s an int and otherwise throw

10789452
width	height
now due to the limited functionality i kept the window size fixed having maximized as false and well defined height and width of 250x200 pixels

10789454
jar	manifest.mf
jar is never a black box --- it is basically a zip file so you can unpack it add your own main class that calculates parameters change main-class attribute in manifest.mf and you are done

10789455
pexpect	subprocess
i ported the same script to windows and changed pexpect to winpexpect and used the coresponding winspawn to start the subprocess but it stalls out at the first prompt

10789470

put	get
i have it set up now so that this blocked call happens on a private dispatch queue and when i do get data i put a block back on the main queue

10789650
min	max
i have defined the min max length with min max of the repeating decimal because otherwise 009009009 would match in the first test case as well

10789651
findwindow	setparent
otherwise c.exe will have to use findwindow ex or enumwindows to manually find the hwnd handles of a.exe and b.exe and then call setparent on them

10789689
getter	setter
which only has a getter it doesn t have a setter

10789709
getter	setter
for example i will need to read and write to a textfield in the view so should i provide a getter setter for this

10789716
jasmine	sinon
my jasmine sinon approach to this is not really accurate due i m not testing that the method is returning the new collection i hope someone can come with a better implementation

10789721
maven	pom.xml
2 the same for maven pom.xml s can i somehow automatically update the pom.xml s when i change version numbers

10789737
put	get
retrieval operations including get generally do not block so may overlap with update operations including put and remove

10789813
post	get
you will need some php to get the data from the database or at least ajax code calling to external scripts that pull post from the mysql database

10789836
unsigned	short
dealing with the notion of an unsigned byte like this is normally done by expanding the byte into a short or int with the higher order bits all set to zero and then performing arithmetic or displaying your values

10789867
division	modulo
among other reasons to keep the following very useful relationship between the sibling operators of division and modulo

10789878

ssl	https
however it does not prevent the user from manually attempting to access the subdomain using the https the ssl that i have does not cover subdomains and shows trust error when used for sub-domains

10790036
jobs	cron
you could set up staggered cron jobs on your 5 machines so it runs every 2.5 hours on each of your 5 machines

10790056
width	height
likewise avoid the scaling of the .inner divs by 200 in the width and height you shouldn t have to do that they should be the same size as the .hexagon div and the immediate children that you have classed as .before and .after

10790091
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
works in opera and firefox but not in google-chrome

10790125
screens	hdpi
but then after testing it on a hdpi screens i found it did not work so well

10790125
width	height
obviously after reading how to support multiple screens i am suppose to use dp to get the correct width and height to work with

10790125
screens	hdpi
i understand mathematically why this is happening but feel like there could be a better formula that would work for both ldpi and hdpi screens rather than just ldpi

10790137
google-chrome	firefox
i m designing a 2-column html5 interface backwards compatibility is not important all users will be using latest google-chrome firefox with a sidebar on the left and a main content area on the right

tax	shipping
is there a way to charge sales tax on shipping freight in dynamics crm 2011 with the orders entity

10790152

by default crm charges tax only on the amount and considers the freight as tax-exempt however many regions such as canada require that tax is charged on the shipping freight amount

10790214
submit	submission
when form is valid you submit the data via javascript and maybe you process it before submission it

10790234
post	put
so each client would send messages to the application web server via a http put post and only receive messages via it s own pubnub subscription channel

10790240
folder	directory
if i need to build a blog i simply create a blog folder in the same directory as my skeleton app with it s controllers models and etc

10790293
inherited	properties
you could of course redefine all your child object s arrayiterator inherited methods to handle your special properties naming case on get or set but this would seem redundant and unproductive as opposed to just looping over setting anyway in your constructor

10790297
ppl	tbb
my project doesn t use intel tbb but uses the microsoft concurrency runtime parallel paterns library ppl technology

10790330
integer	unsigned
to answer your first questionâ how many bytes are required to represent a nonnegative integer using an unsigned representationâ consider the following functions i wrote in common lisp

10790341
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
as for compatibility should work on ie9+ google-chrome opera 11.52+ firefox 4+

10790377
rvm	bundler
will allow bundler to work with any ruby loaded by rvm but by default will use 1.9.3 from

10790399
equals	gethashcode
implement the gethashcode method whenever you implement the equals method

10790399
equals	gethashcode
this keeps equals and gethashcode synchronized

10790420
equals	gethashcode
if you override equals and gethashcode you wouldn t even need to override the operators and that s a cleaner approach

10790432
post	put
also next time when you post make sure to put the full error log

10790439
hex	binary
im not having problems with the protocol im having problems with basic binary hex math magic

10790445
put	get
i m sure there s a much cleaner way but you could just use cbind to get the pairs of interest three times then use rbind to put them together

10790484
width	height
please help me create div or table cells with exactly the same size in height and width

10790503
post	get
i use curl in my example but you should be able to get it using any sort of post request

10790552
fast-forward	merge
fast-forward means it didn t merge

10790578
post	get
using httpfox firefox addon i get exact same post data but result renders fine in firefox

10790610
udp	tcp
you can try to send your data less often and switch to udp which is non-ordered and unreliable but faster than tcp

10790614
int	chars
i ve seen other formats for referencing int or chars but i ve never seen this

10790641
width	height
it doesn t appear to be currently possible to easily change the way tinymce adds width and height tags to the img element

10790654
google-chrome	firefox
one final comment is that i do see this in multiple browsers tried google-chrome and firefox so far

10790675
post	get
in reality the data sent with the request is either get or post variables like you work with normally

10790711
linefeed	delimiter
the problem i have is that single line commands are delimiter with a linefeed but the data section consists of any number lines terminated with a . on its own line

10790728

are there multiple children ids per parent id

10790820
int	double
i have loaded this data in a different vector that can contains int or double

10790834
profiling	debugging
one potential reason is to make debugging and profiling easier with tco the parent stack frame disappears which makes stack traces harder to make sense of.

10790856
explode	implode
one easy way though not necessarily the most efficient is to make an array by splitting on the spaces remove the last one and then stick the rest back together into a string via explode array_pop implode

10790872
shadowbox	lightbox
i created a quicksand demo with shadowbox a lightbox alternative based on the original demo

10790888
min	max
i hightmap mesh is genearated from an image with a very simple algortihm the naive way is generate a flat plane that has the same number of vertecies accross and down then interpolating between the min and max y values of a boundary using the intensity component of the image i m not quite sure what you think the shading language has to do with that though

10790950
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	safari
what i already have is a skeleton which works in opera safari and google-chrome

10790952
hide	show
but it will show all recipients in the url is there any away i can hide those recipients string to be displayed in url and can access it in request

10790959
accessor	properties
i ve never used custom accessor methods but this seems like a clean way to set it up so i don t have to set up each properties in my viewdidload or elsewhere and don t have to worry about it being nil

10790963
restrict	shared
if i have restrict to shared my birthday on privacy setting no app would be able to grab my birthday even if they ask for it

10790978
uiview	calayer
if you put an nslog into your uiview s -drawrect method then override its default layer class with your own custom calayer that does its own drawing your uiview s -drawrect would no longer be called

10790990
getter	setter
but when i try to create the getter and setter for the entity factura .

10791009
google-chrome	firefox
on a desktop browser google-chrome firefox at least you ll see the boxes populating from top left to bottom right in the same order as on the source code and on a mobile device iphone ipad at least you ll see the exact opposite occurring

10791020
accessor	ivar
only access your ivar through the accessor

10791020
accessor	properties
declaring the variable as dynamic in the 4th point will signal to anyone that looks at your code that you ve likely written a custom accessor for that properties

10791080
interpreted-language	compiled-language
compiled-language have a rigidity to them while interpreted-language have a flexibility

10791115
lua	scheme
python scheme guile and lua are easily available to add as a scripting language to a c application

firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i m getting this rendering issue on firefox safari and google-chrome

10791238
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i ve tested the site on the latest versions of google-chrome firefox and safari

10791248
profiler	gprof
another way to achieve that is to write a real profiler but such a tool already exists gprof and write a parser for it

10791287
inherited	properties
enums are primitive types and cannot inherited from other enums as inherited is a properties of objects

10791319
blogspot	blogger
i want to add copy to clipboard and open a new tab to blogger blogspot

10791341
folder	directory
since the path to the file folder is replicated in the jar the -c option changes directory before including the file

10791346
isometric	draw
checks the map the goal is to draw an isometric map a table like and displays it

10791412
google-chrome	safari
currently webkit browsers will support it like google-chrome and safari

10791430
equals	gethashcode
you should make them proper value types by overriding equals and gethashcode

10791450
textview	imageview
in particular i have a gridview that i have inflated with a layout that has an imageview a textview and a hidden textview visibility set to gone

concave	convex
subdividing a concave polygon into a set of convex polygons

10791470
concave	convex
in my comment above i suggested recursively subdividing the concave polygon in order to obtain a set of convex polygons instead

10791470
concave	vertex
if not at least 1 vertex behind the edge the polygon is concave

10791470
concave	convex
so the root node obb would contain the entire concave polygon and leaf nodes only convex sub-polygons

10791549
datamapper	activerecord
after all i can sure find posts about whether datamapper is superior to activerecord

10791551
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and firefox load it perfectly but ie9 doesn t show it at all

10791579
int	double
use a double for the sum otherwise you are doing an int division and you won t get any decimals

10791599
serializable	deserialization
it s not even clear that v8 offers any kind of binary serializable deserialization of json structures

10791599
serializable	deserialization
this serializable and deserialization has a cost and it might not even be much faster than parsing the json text representation

10791601
profiling	debugging
question how do i properly set debugging and ndebug in xcode for the archiving and profiling builds such that my conditional code inclusion preprocessor macros don t break

10791616
hide	show
for my needs i found it easier to use an absolute positioned header hide it before scroll and show it when finish scroll i need the same code to support ios4 and android

10791616
hide	show
for my purposes i hide the header on a touchstart event and show it again on touchend or scroll event plus some timers to improve responsiveness reduce flickering

10791618
ethernet	wireless
interfacing such an application with delphi is pretty easy usually these days i would interface using tcp ip over either wired ethernet or wireless wifi

10791629
portrait	landscape
...that since the procedure happens only the first time a webpage is rendered that once the device is turned from portrait to landscape the inflation algorithm will grow the text based off the width change of the screen being wider even when set at 100

10791629
portrait	landscape
perhaps this is because 100 is in relation to the width difference of portrait to landscape

10791653
ampl	mathprog
fixed number of variables in a problem is a common assumption in solvers and algebraic modelling languages including ampl mathprog

10791674
mouse	keyboard
includes different animation directions depending on the way you navigate using scroll mouse or keyboard navigation keys

10791679
uiview	subviews
uiview s -addsubview retains the subviews

10791682
post	get
in this approach your clients send messages via typical get or post http requests which are handled by web2py controllers or other framework and receive messages from the web2py controllers calling comet_messaging.comet_send which sends a post request to the tornado instance which then blasts it out to its list of listeners

10791730
for-loop	arrays
you could try writing out the code for a dot product with all of the static typing of the counter input numpy arrays etc with wraparound and boundscheck set to false import the clib version of the sqrt function and then try to leverage the parallel for-loop prange to make use of openmp

10791733
rss	feed
i have done this before by extracting data from rss feed but for this application i am trying to use data from a webpage

10791751
post	put
the post are in a div that is set to automatically put the post on the next line when they overflow so the only issue is placing the post in the div in the right order

10791785
selecteditem	selectedindex
i think you are looking for the selecteditem property or possibly the selectedindex property and the items property

10791795
width	height
however i didn t manage to change the height and the width of the popup in this manner

10791799
entities	entitymanager
please note that in the 1st case all entities are created at the beginning of application one can also use builder pattern to create instance of entitymanager class - this will clearly abstract creation logic from usage

10791806
dictionary	map
a source map is like a dictionary containing a mapping of the raw names with the compressed names

10791806
google-chrome	firefox
source maps are supported in google-chrome and firefox dev tools but not enabled by default

10791808
getter	setter
org.achartengine.simpleseriesrenderer changed the class i added an and a boolean multiplecolorsenabled with its getter and setter

10791817
button	checkbox
the reason i am dealing with raw framework elements is that i could be adding radio button or checkbox or anything that extends frameworkelement to the grid

10791820
width	height
additionally your width and height property values are missing a unit of measurement

10791831
uiview	calayer
i was a bit surprised at first that uiview s drawing is helped by calayer but calayer s delegate is actually uiview

10791835
daemons	systemd
for programs that do not have terminals it doesn t make sense to hang up their terminal so the signal wouldn t be sent to daemons except by systemd administrator action.

10791835
daemons	systemd
you can do anything on this signal but systemd administrators expect daemons to re-read configuration files on this signal -- doing something else may be confusing and annoying.

10791880
post	get
if the action is destructive use post otherwise use get

10791882
put	get
keep in mind that the further offscreen you put the button the faster it will have to move to get onto the screen in the time allotted in the setanimationduration

10791922
bottle	cherrypy
change bottle to run using cherrypy

10791950
neo4j	datomic
you can build a versioning system into to neo4j that timestamps each entry and use a last-write wins algorithm and there are other database systems like datomic that have this built in

10791966
youtube	vimeo
for the embedded things i have been using auto_html with great success vimeo youtube images and even added soundcloud myself

10791979
subtract	add
for instance if you have a number in the range 0 1 and want to force rounding it to 4 bits of precision you would add and then subtract 0x1p49

10791981
width	height
will scale the image to it s largest size so that both it s width and height fit inside the area

10791981
width	height
will stretch the image to area s width and height

10792033
put	get
since you already have your data in json i would just put it into a hiddenfieldvalue and use a json deserializer on the c# side to get it back to a poco

10792057
width	height
the attribute and or any css declaration will always have precedence over the width and height html attributes

10792078
ubuntu	linux
i m dual booting windows 7 and ubuntu 12.04 linux

10792134
profiling	debugging
or should i just use 3 different appids so i can debugging all versions of the app and just keep a distribution profiling for the prod version of the app

10792139
min	max
with this in mind is there a way to use min or max operators within the objective function of a linear program

10792152
post	get
back to your investigation fixing attempts the request.getcharacterencoding isn t been used to decode get query strings as that s beyond the control of the servlet api it s only been used to decode post request bodies

10792204
post	get
so i cannot get it to create post or upload photos or whatever else all my apps were built to do

10792219
width	height
actually you ll have to change the x y width and height values as you want to animate and when it s completed i set the main view - myview - hidden

10792227
pwd	chdir
i ve tried chdir but that wasn t working so i moved on to trying to change the environmental variable pwd

10792227
folder	directory
hopefully the command would be cd user username folder and my pathenv variable would be pwd user username folder which would maybe change the directory

10792295
qthread	qobject
you must implement all the threaded code that interacts with the model via events not by reimplementing qthread run but within a qobject

10792295
qthread	qobject
qthread s default implementation of run will spin an event loop to keep your qobject executing if there are any events signals or timers ready for it

10792315
hash	salt
i have a class that encrypts a password with a salt hash

10792321
multiplication	exponent
after argument conversion via multiplication by log2 e exponentation by the fractional part is handled using a minimax polynomial of degree 2 while exponentation by the integral part of the argument is performed by direct manipulation of the exponent part of the ieee-754 single-precision number

10792321
floating-point	integer
the volatile union faciliates re-interpretation of a bit pattern as either an integer or a single-precision floating-point number needed for the exponent manipulation

10792379
width	height
what is done here is to set the wrapper element to display as a table occupying the entire width and height of its parent #parent

10792379
margin	height
the negative margin is the height that the #popup_interstitial_pro_head_text occupies

10792399

i would appreciate if somebody can let me know how to control just the height of the text so that i can elongate the text without affecting the width

10792513
multiplying	add
for each computation we add a bitmask table lookup and double-precision multiplying

10792528

i tested with a breakpoint and queryclose does fire when you click the red x in the upper right corner of the vb6 form like the formclosing event is supposed to do in vb.net forms

10792742
vb6	vba
this code was originally vba vb6 which i put through artinsoft s visual basic upgrade companion vbuc

10792832
union	distinct
union will give you distinct values by default

10792874
children	parent
which is conflicting with children s float property floating behavior is decided by it s parent width

10792874
children	parent
so you have to change either of the parent s width or children s floating

10792881
versioning	upgrade
intially we were using the versioning 8.403 dll which had the same behaviour what i required but we have now upgrade to 10.104 dll s and hence assuming the change in behaviour

width	height
thus settings in the real style sheet of a page override such attributes wins the height and width attributes

10793213
button	checkbox
when i click a checkbox and hit another button i am able to retrieve the selected row tags and push them into an array

10793218

nsurl	nsstring	nsurl	nsfilemanager
for example nsfilemanager has a method fileexistsatpath which takes a nsstring as the only argument but there is no equivalent that takes a nsurl as the argument

10793662

to remove a file though there is a method that takes a nsstring and an equivalent method that takes a nsurl

by default click event will check both mousedown and mouseup event to be fired before it fires the callback

10796652
mouseup	mousedown
the problem is that you click on the text your current target is the text now it means mousedown event is already fired inside the text area and it s waiting for mouseup event to be fired in order to complete a click event

10797822
yacc	bison
the precedence of operators can also be directly derived from ruby s parse.y if you are familiar with bison yacc

10797826

it s obvious you can t do something like this to suppress a wm_keyup message when a you process the keydown event a keypress message is already sent to your control but the keyup message won t fire until the user release the key

10798123
keydown	keyup
a solution would be to use a boolean flag suppresskeyup set it to true at keydown and check it and resetting it in keyup but you ll have to check it thoroughly and see what happens when the user misbehaves like pressing two keys

10798127
bufferedoutputstream	bufferedinputstream
bufferedinputstream and bufferedoutputstream typically rely on system.arraycopy for their implementations

10798506
getter	setter
both programs are independent first lets say getter in java and second setter in c++.

10798529
hash	md5
the problem is that potentially two different bytearrays could hash down to the same md5

10798547
integer	fractions
a variable with implicit type which is assigned an integer value will be an integer so it won t have a fractions part

10798580
put	get
if you are retaining your fragment instance you should be able to get away with just using ordinary setters to put stuff in data members

10798612
hash	md5
it may happen that two md5 hash collides are the same

10798641
alarmmanager	timertask
yes you can use alarmmanager class or timertask class for such purpose

10798995
getter	setter
it s the getter setter method names that are important for properties not the name of the field

10798995
getter	setter
you should correct this for all getter and setter you have.

10799006
rss	feed
i m trying to implement a console library that reads data from composite c1 global datatype called rss feed and then foreach rss feed the application must retrieve rss entries from the link attribute and insert all entries into a global datatype called rssitem

10799034
getter	setter
property - create the declaration of your getter and setter

10799034
getter	setter
synthesize - provide the definition of getter and setter based upon the parameters which are passed inside property

10799036
ati	nvidia
target only newer opengl versions and drop support for anything below would be a viable option since most of the videocards by ati nvidia and even intel support some version of opengl 2.0+ which is roughly equivalent to the gl es 2.0

10799051
maven	cargo
is probably maven cargo plugin

10799059

10799101
mef	prism
that there s also prism mef unity reactiveui - this is becoming too much

10799102
getter	setter
so you have to make public accessor methods getter and setter

10799102
getter	setter
and in the implementation you just write synthesize to make the compiler include the automatically created getter and setter at that position

10799144
width	height
actually it is best to set the width 240 and height 180 in your img to reduce page load time to tell the browser of the exact dimensions of your image s

10799214
getter	setter
and think of how much work is required to code an accessor - 4 lines for getter and 2 for a setter

10799241
width	height
just a tip use sp for textsize and dp for height and width of controls

10799252
public	protected
if you only want callers within the class or a subclass to be able to call it then make it protected - otherwise make it public

10799306
post	put	post	get	put	get
rest doesn t mean a great deal more then you use http verbs get post put delete etc properly

10799347

10799469
uiview	subviews
i have a uiview and i have multiple uiimageview s as its subviews

10799479
getter	setter
property and synthesize are two objective c keyword that allow you to easily create your properties and therefore avoid to write by hand getter and setter methods of the property

10799479
getter	setter
the property define the property itself should be placed in the header file and can get some attributes as for example strong nonatomic retain assign copy the synthesize should be placed into the implementation file and tell the compiler to generate the body of getter and setter method

10799491
post	put	post	get	put	get
url just tells where the resource is located and you can invoke get post put delete etc on this url to invoke the resource

10799492
sorting	filtering
the problem is that standard restfull api don t any standard interface for sorting paging and filtering of the data

10799492
sorting	filtering
after that i hope it will be clear my recommendation to extend the current standard restfull api with additional methods which have additional parameters and which provide sorting paging and filtering functionality

10799492
sorting	filtering
moreover because of the same reasons it has sense to implement sorting and even filtering of the data

10799492
sorting	filtering
i want to emphasize that restfull service gives you no standard interface for sorting paging and filtering of the data

10799492
sorting	filtering
it s page rows which specify the page number and the page size which will be asked from the service sidx and sord parameters which specify the sorting column and the sorting direction and _search and filtering the last is in the format which allows to support filtering

10799492
sorting	filtering
you will have to extend the interface with additional parameters used for paging sorting and filtering or you will be not able to create performant and user friendly web gui

10799511
post	get
when i post data from first into servlet i want to get the www.example.com but not first.jsp

10801414
uiview	calayer
note both the blue uiview s and the red calayer s frame are set in the overridden setframe method of the container view but results would have been the same if i had set the blue uiview s autoresizingmask property to uiview flexible left and top margins

10801414
uiview	calayer
on to the question is there a way to synchronize the two frame changes so that the red calayer and the blue uiview both move with the same animation duration and easing curve sticking to each other as if they were one view

10801414
uiview	calayer
of course the required visual result of the two squares sticking together could be achieved in any number of ways for example by having both layers become either calayer s or uiview s but the project that the real issue is in has a very legit cause for the one to be a calayer and the other to be a uiview

hide	show
i have a layer with a lot of symbols and i would like to hide and show that entire layer with all his elements

10801594
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in google-chrome firefox and ie9 and pretty much also ie7

10801632
tinyint	boolean
how can i force cakephp 2.x to retrieve tinyint database column not as boolean but as tinyint

10801673
udp	tcp
i m assuming i need to use udp because tcp is mostly server-client and anyone can be a server or a client here and i don t need packet control

10801681
post	get
if i change the url i get an error so this url is definitely responding to http post

10801699
hide	show
i have this code to show hide some content

10801706
children	parent
i have a table with an association to itself so that any children menus are mapped to any parent menus within the same table but i am having an issue inserting the first parent

10801725
implements	extends
my solution was to write a custom soaprequestfilter that implements a javax.servlet.filter and a new class that extends httpservletrequestwrapper

10801725
implements	extends
since httpservletrequestwrapper implements the httpservletrequest interface extends the wrapper allows you to copy the httprequest and act on the stream without consuming the object and causing issues downstream

10801725
httpresponse	request	outputstream	inputstream
if the request needed to be redirected i created a new httpurlconnection to the old soap webservice and set the inputstream from that response to the outputstream of the httpresponse

10801731
int	boolean
but as you said after trying several things i simply change the type in oracle from boolean to int leaving the java code still as setboolean 3 true and everything works

10801731
int	boolean
hence you save time as compared to setboolean and int where you go from boolean to bit to int

10801731
prepare	execute
just prepare and execute

10801750
do.call	lapply
i m learning r recently and confused by two function lapply and do.call

10801802
put	get
to do things like put and get

10801823
jobs	cron
i don t have much experience with cron but i have found the crontab file i am using parallels power panel on a vpn and it already had jobs to run-parts cron.hourly daily weekly and monthly

10801823
folder	directory
even if i tell it to look for a folder which i know doesn t exist like cron.myfakefolder i don t get a not a directory etc cron.myfakefolder email

10801846
do.call	lapply
lapply is similar to map do.call is not

10801846
do.call	lapply
lapply applies a function to all elements of a list do.call calls a function where all the function arguments are in a list

10801846
do.call	lapply
so for a n element list lapply has n function calls and do.call has just one function call

10801846
do.call	lapply
so do.call is quite different from lapply

10801853
put	get
this is to avoid too many jni calls this method does 2 jni calls while the former makes one per put get

10801863
for-loop	arrays
apart from iterables also arrays which don t implement the iterable interface can be used in the enhanced for-loop

10801883
mapply	lapply
lapply is a special case of mapply

10801902
do.call	lapply
lapply applies a function over a list do.call calls a function with a list of arguments

10801910
hide	show
i have to display images dynamically and show hide depends on state of checkboxes using style and datatrigger

10801927
superclass	subclassing
i m currently refactoring some ugly code and splitting a large and overcomplicated class a into superclass a with subclassing b and c

10801951
accelerometer	gyroscope
i am using this device and have successfully implemented an quite well working orientation estimation based on a fusion of magnetometer accelerometer and gyroscope data based on this implementation

10801979
migrate	upgrade
once i migrate the databases over and ran the upgrade tasks in tfs i was able to do some small build edits to make my build work with 2012 and i did not encounter this issue a second time

10801980
expression-blend	silverlight
i m trying to create a poker chip like the one here products_id 379 using expression-blend 4 for a wp7.1 silverlight 4 app

10802004
nsurl	nsstring	nsurl	nsdata	nsstring	nsdata
from there you can save a reference nsurl or nsstring to the image s path in your app s document directory and you can load it from there using something like uiimage aimage uiimage imagewithdata nsdata datwithcontentsofurl pathurl

10802056
client-side	server-side
the server uses reflection to call the appropriate method in the server-side object and client uses javascript s call method to call the appropriate function in the client-side object

10802056
serializable	deserialization
the library uses jackson to take care of the serializable deserialization of various java types to from json

10802082
width	height
this mapactivity - width and height must be 0 question suggests the problem is the zoomin method is in the oncreate method

10802082
put	get
but i get same error when i put it in the onresume method

10802082
width	height
mapview has definitely positive values for width and height

10802082
width	height
work because it returns 0 for width and height

10802118
inherited	properties	inherited	subclassing
definitely put them in subclassing b the only reason you should put the methods in the class they both inherited from is if both will use the method or there s a likely hood that in the near future another class will be added and will use the methods properties fields or in your case variables

10802157
cout	cin
however if i remove the second pair of cout cin statements the program works fine

10802167
width	height
the width and height properties in myimage class were too small for the image to show

10802187
width	height
the width and height are still getting set in css but the src is now set within the javascript

10802187
width	height
you re setting it as a background with a fixed width and height

10802187
width	height
background image scaling isn t widely supported so it may be easier to add an image to the div with a specified height and width

10802213
wordpress	joomla
there are a ton of plugins for wordpress or joomla that set this up for you including subscriptions and individual items through paypal

10802227
parallel.for	begininvoke
using begininvoke the progress bar update is delayed to the end of the parallel.for loop

10802236
post	get
what you should really do is get the signed_request on first page load from post and add it to the url of your app as

10802250
addclass	removeclass
instead of addclass myimage you used removeclass myimage

10802265
integer	unsigned
you can use the shift operator to convert the number to an unsigned integer before converting to binary

10802280
maven	pom.xml
given i have an otherwise blank module containing multiple jars which each need to be inserted with an install install-file how should i do this in my pom.xml to be fully conformant with the normal maven build

10802280
versioning	upgrade
this is a temporary solution until we have an opportunity to upgrade to a newer versioning of the dependencies

10802331
min	max
also important to notice the min max and tickinterval have no effect since we use ticks

10802342
post	put
also post what you ve tried and what the results were both to give further information and to make it obvious that you ve put some work into it.

10802369
post	get
this would be useful if you use get instead of post

10802440
mouseup	mousedown
so i think the correct implementation would be to capture the mouseup mousedown events hold the state in a variable ismousedown and check this variable in the hover function

10802456
oncreate	onstart
oncreate - onstart - onserviceconnected

10802464
post	get
after searching for how to post large files using python i came across this and i wrote a program based on that but when i run it i get the following error message

10802476
int	double	int	chars

10802488
post	get
if i want to give access to guest on edit get and edit post to admin user i cannot do it via fluent security as it identifies both the methods as one

10802498
post	get
to get the post a user promoted you can do

10802554
google-chrome	safari
in google-chrome and safari if the browser is not able to connect to a local

10802555
min	max
of 20 of each item and a max of 60 of each item so apple 25 peach 25 pear 25 and orange 25 works perfectly but not apple 0 peach 0 pear 50 and orange 50 because we set a min of 25

10802555
range	max
but is there a way i could modify this formula or use something else that would tell me how many results to expect if i have something like 40 items with a range of 2-5 or something something that factors in the max value as well

10802582
width	height
it gets called if the mapview is attached to the window and therfore has width height

10802590
stringbuilder	bufferedreader
but basically using stringbuilder you are appending one line at a time the string data from the bufferedreader into the stringbuilder which you can use to get the final string once the entire buffer has been read

10802636
bluetooth	usb
you d have to handle the communication usb or bluetooth maybe

10802640
screens	tablet
i added preference-headers to my app so that the preference screens would not look broken on honeycomb and tablet sized ics

10802655
filtering	grouping
for my first table i opened the grouping properties of the row within the table and under filtering i made the following

10802677
portrait	landscape
my problem is that whenver i load an image from a file as a bitmap and create a scaled down thumbnail the images always gets horizontal instead of maintaining portrait or landscape

10802681
gif	png
in chrome 21 it doesn t work with the file extensions mentioned but if i change the filter to image files jpg png gif it filters the choose file dialog correctly

10802689
versioning	upgrade
if i decide to upgrade to a newer versioning of jquery i just change my dll and it s changed everywhere

10802702
width	height
but as you can see it always seems like you have to give the width and height properties i already checked the documentation but it s always short and not that s detailed and i tried giving null parameters or empty parameters but it doesn t work.

10802720
rss	feed
currently i am using this code to pull a rss feed from yahoo weather but i would like to style it the way i want but i am not sure how

10802737
put	get
i m trying to put together what i thought would be a simple ignore filter but can t seem to get it working

10802755
getter	setter
it would appear that the xraywrapper used by greasemonkey to wrap around dom elements is quite an imperfect wrapper since it doesn t really support the innerhtml getter setter

10802776
monticello	gemstone
the preferred mechanism for transferring code to gemstone using gemtools is to use monticello packages

10802814
centos	linux
i ve read amazon linux is based on fedora centos so could this works

10802830
post	get
this should give you the desired result tho at the expense of the action now being a get rather than a post

10802838
serializable	deserialization
this process is known as serializable deserialization

10802847
post	get
if you send it like form data post insted query string parameter get for form submission

10802851
std	ostream
later you could add your own proxy-object with overloaded stream operators which i think is still easier than writing your own stream derived from std ostream

10802859
hide	show
i can t be able to use startactivityforresult because if i use this method the tabhost hide and i want to tabbar is show in whole application

10802880
rsa	dsa
if you want to use keypair generator use an algorithm like rsa or dsa in the getinstance method like this

10802908
x86	mips
i realize that i can run spim or mars as mips simulators on my intel amd x86 processors it just seemed like fun to try to run it natively

10802924
tax	shipping
so my issue is when a customer uses the get a quote feature for their shipping and tax after they choose their country state zip - and when the get a quote button is pressed it then redirects them to the home page index of the site

10802933
super	extends
i was actually trying to extends the arrayblockingqueue and add some some state and overrided add and i promptly got the java.lang.nullpointerexception when i invoked super capacity fair col constructor

10802953
onclick	onchange
on your you will need to use onclick or onchange depending on how you want it to look and feel which will call a function that takes in the selected option

10802966
for-loop	loops
i find the behavior of jslint not good but i agree that declaration of variables inside of for-loop is bad because it will be read by most persons as code with local loops variables which is incorrect

10803031
spaces	delimiter
i have data below with three different delimiter the first has a spaces to the number the second 3 spaces to the number and the final column a spaces and then a tab to the number and i want to be able to generate a list containing sequential values from each column

10803042
subtract	add
but we have subtract the distributions where two buckets contain more than upperlimit items twice we must correct that and add

10803096
min	max
you could use a smart choice of max and min width like this

10803096
portrait	landscape
the value can be either landscape horizontal orientation or portrait vertical orientation

10803152
typedef	struct
i have tried to make the typedef of myproc before the struct typedef but got too a compilation error

10803171
post	put	post	get	put	get
how can i implement a basic rest api with get post put delete methods in snap

10803215
put	get
use the cximage library on codeproject.com to save your image to disk--assuming you know how to get a hbitmap or cbitmap of the image you want to save put into word

10803238
post	get
problem is i ve set up a test case in exactly the way they want but only get is working cannot post to my website

10803293
getter	setter
however it you can split getter and setter into separate interfaces it would be possible to use c# template co-variance feature

10803322
width	height
basically i want to use link blocks of specific width and height and position within the popup image creating a link within a link

10803322

10803533
post	get
that sounds odd you may have to post some code to get more help

10803534
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome has a setting to add css rule to the value within the h4 tag which increases the height value of the element as follows

10803557

however when they try to put more than one calling of the function per page they get this error in the error_log

10803693
appkit	nscell
some of the nscell subclasses in the appkit framework do this and fail to document that they have done so with the result that youâ ll ponder for hours why it is that -starttrackingat inview never gets called

10803735
post	get
firstly i realise my question may be relatively similar to some other post however i tried implementing code from other post but just couldn t get it to work the way i wanted

10803750
folder	directory
you should be using the temp folder instead of attempting to write directly to your webapp s deployment directory

10803751
width	height
this assigns a minimum dimension to the body equal to the width + margins and height + margins of the absolute element

10803751
width	margin
the inline-block element will account for the margin of its inner elements to determine its own width which then allows the right margin to work

10803751
width	height
solution does not work on the #wrapper being position absolute is because it makes the body have a zero width and height since the absolute positioning takes that element out of flow and there is nothing left inside body to give it dimension

10803802
implements	extends
you may be passing a class that extends thread to execute when you should be passing a class that implements runnable

10803855
rss	feed
i am working on an asp.net page that contains an xml reader that reads from a wordpress rss feed formats the posts and pastes it on the secure site

10803866
folder	directory
when i go to click on them in the datagrid the link is directed to the application root directory and not to the proper folder

10803881
git-rebase	undo
so if your git-rebase is wrong you can undo it by pointing the branch to where it used to be with

10803885
sorting	filtering
to provide filtering sorting etc you could use interfaces then you could access the window datacontext and execute commands in it

10803885
tabcontrol	tabitem
if you need them all open at once you could create usercontrols instead of windows and show them at tabitem inside a tabcontrol

10803906
implements	extends
any class which extends to baseadapter will implements 4 methods getcount getitem getitemid getview

10803918

add this in activity oncreate before setcontentview

10804095

bufferedreader.read reads a single chars not an int

10804098
versioning	upgrade
upgrade to the supported versioning of activeperl 5.14

10804113
carrierwave	paperclip
i would personally recommend not using ckeditor gem if you already have an existing attachments model through paperclip or carrierwave

10804124
for-loop	arrays
you might be surprised how fast a for-loop can execute over an arrays in modern browsers

10804165
ppl	tbb
framework such as ppl or tbb or generic threading

10804183
maven	pom.xml
i just found that when using maven i needed to also modify the pom.xml to have the compiler plugin

10804185
hide	show
next code allows hide show the data container table related to the checkbox

10804185

i code this and at this moment i have a part of right side of tree in preorder first char in preorder is root i find this in inorder and i have left and right side i recurency translate to right side but i have a problem with left side of tree

10804266
inherited	properties
the moment you write to an inherited properties of an instance a new copy of the properties is created for that instance

10804266
inherited	properties
where typeb inherited the val properties from typea

10804266
inherited	properties
in both the above cases when objb1.val is written it no longer refers to the inherited properties but instead a new copy of the properties val is created for instance objb1

10804292
width	height
it will be half of the actual width or half of the actual height

10804292
width	height
you can get the value of r from blend the actual width and height will be written in parenthesis in the width and height boxes - divide it by two

10804292
actualheight	actualwidth
if there s a need for variable sizes and the view box route doesn t work - there s another way to implement it because silverlight fails when you bind to actualwidth actualheight properties - with border s that hold rectangles

10804331
getter	setter
you should create getter setter for your phone # parts and do you validation checking in the setter

10804332
ienumerable	ilist	ienumerable	iqueryable	ilist	iqueryable
i ve been using the method below without any issues nor without any performance issues so far i have tested with ilist list of t ienumerable ienumerable of t iqueryable and iqueryable of t

10804383
getter	setter
using getter and setter is a good option

10804396
equals	gethashcode
if included a gethashcode method one could define the semantics of to say that items should compare equals when examined as t s

10804396
equals	gethashcode
consequently if an implementation of does anything other than call equals within it a derived class which overrides equals and gethashcode and does not re-implement will end up with a broken implementation of that interface

10804408
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
this is different from inherited where a subclassing automatically implements the methods of its superclass and those methods can optionally be overridden on a subclassing by subclassing basis

10804408
superclass	subclassing
i suspect that you have some oop background so i won t go too much into subclassing other than to say a subclassing is very often a specialized or more specific version of the superclass

10804408
superclass	subclassing
in other words every subclassing is a kind of its superclass but every superclass is not necessarily a type of subclassing

10804414
post	put
it doesn t have replay option it just pops up a window on any request after you activate it you modify the values and then press a button to actually perform a post put

restrict	shared
a shared database for testing is never a great idea presumably you know this which is why you re asking how to restrict access to one user at a time

10804686
width	height
a don t declare explicit height or width in the svg file

10804686
width	height
according to the spec if no width and height are specified a value of 100 is assumed so your pseudocode is redundant at best

10804686
google-chrome	safari
once you ve got it working in google-chrome it will almost certainly also work in safari

ant	maven
per the documentation this parameter specifies whether a failure in the ant build leads to a failure of the maven build

10806615
ant	maven
if this value is true the maven build will proceed even if the ant build fails

10806615
ant	maven
if it is false then the maven build fails if the ant build fails.

10806615
ant	maven
i would think that the default value of true would cause the maven build to fail if the ant build failed but that isn t what the docs appear to be saying

10806644
nsstream	nsoutputstream
what i am actually trying to do is unschedule from the main thread and reschedule to a helper network thread an open nsinputstream and nsoutputstream that i am receiving from a third party framework see can an open but inactive nsstream that is scheduled on the main thread be moved to a different thread

i mean if i dragged and dropped a gridview and an sqldatasource and then i set up those controls in page designer in visual studio is it possible at some time later to retrieve the data retrieved by the sqldatasource and then store the data in a datatable

10806700

it then loops through those tags with a for-loop and for every tag it makes a new img element using createelement gives it a src attribute using the constructimageurl function and appends it to the popup page

it works perfectly fine with firefox and google-chrome

10806892
super	self
only the designated initializer calls super all others call self

10806892
super	self
notice that it calls self not super

10806892
super	implements
one initializer should be deemed your designated initializer and only this method should implements super init where init is the designated initializer of the super class which may not be init

10806895
getter	setter
the java beans specification looks for default setter methods with a void return type but it allows customization of the getter and setter methods through a java.beans.propertydescriptor

10806895
getter	setter
the simplest way to use it has been to specify the names of the getter and setter

10806895
getter	setter
another way to specify the getter and setter methods in the propertydescriptor for a custom beaninfo is to use the actual method objects

10806895
getter	setter
this code is invoked by the propertydescriptor constructor in the first example that takes the accessor method names above because initially there is no method saved in the softreference s holding the actual getter and setter

10806895
getter	setter
in the second example the read method and write method are stored in softreference objects in the propertydescriptor by the constructor and at first these will contain references to the readmethod and writemethod getter and setter method s given to the constructor

10806908
mousemove	mouseleave
im trying to unbind and bind the mousemove it unbinds when mouse is over the link but does not bind back when the mouseleave the link

10806944
hide	show
uitextview in a uitableviewcell smooth auto-resize show and hide keyboard on ipad but works on iphone

10806960
portrait	landscape
in portrait it is ok but in landscape the font size is too big

10806961
post	get
my guess is that you want other parameters in place as well which you can then use a form to send data via post or get to populate your page using those parameters

10806961
post	get
as mentioned the slug argument is not intended to populate queries and you should also be naming your get and post keys as well as option and meta keys something unique to your code so the likelihood of any naming conflicts is minimal

10806973
freemarker	velocity
4 template engines like velocity or freemarker - moves design out of java requires a lot of map operations it would be quite good but the velocity syntax and loop if abilities aren t as readable as for example those from smarty

10806991
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i tried using the event s which property equals 1 in google-chrome when left mouse button is held but seems to always equal 1 in safari and firefox even when the mouse button isn t being held

10806999
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
it could be a dropdownlistfor with autopostback true the same with asp.net checkbox and so on

10807030
google-chrome	firefox
i tried the code on firefox ie 9.0 google-chrome 18

10807050
outputstream	inputstream
how much data is available is determined by the client - the data that it writes to the socket s outputstream on its side appears as such on the inputstream of socket of the server side

10807063
width	margin
how can i force the div to fill the width of the browser without manipulating the body padding margin

10807082
stdout	stderr
i ve made slight modifications to the application to capture stdout and stderr to a log file

10807089
children	parent
this will find the parent of the span all it s siblings and any s that are children of those siblings and add .current to them

10807104
post	get
on the server-side you would get a post with the name value that you could then evaluate

10807163
starttls	smtps
smtps - error auth not accepted from server 530 must issue a starttls command first

10807167
jlist	jtable
use jtable with reduced funcionality you can use jlist too

10807192
wav	riff
if you are having to roll your own wav riff writer remember java s data types are big-endian so any multi-byte primitives you write to your file must be written in reverse byte order to match riff s little-endianess

10807194
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
if you want to send strings over a socket then an objectinputstream or objectoutputstream isn t the right stream implementation

10807194
bufferedreader	printwriter
consider using a printwriter to write strings to your stream and a bufferedreader for reading

10807260
accessor	properties
more specifically see section 7.1 accessor methods and 8.3 design patterns for simple properties

10807273
portrait	landscape
essentially it uses media queries to determine the width of the device and then using css displays either the portrait or landscape div

10807273
portrait	landscape
the portrait and landscape divs both house iframes which contain the ads for their respective orientation

10807310

the one problem i m struggling with is that vsprintf seems to be behaving differently on os x versus linux i ve tested with ubuntu 10.10 and 12.04

10807318
width	height
give it a fixed width height and wrap the scrollable content in your included file in a div that can be scrolled

10807347
post	get
check if it s post request or get request

10807347
post	get

10807365
equals	gethashcode
what you should be doing short answer you need gethashcode and equals on modeldata instead of pagedmodel since you are using pagedmodel as the collection and modeldata as the elements

10807365
ienumerable	iequatable	equals	gethashcode
instead of overriding equals object on pagedmodel you need to implement iequatable t on modeldata where t is the type parameter to the ienumerable as well as override gethashcode

10807365
union	distinct	ienumerable	iequalitycomparer
these two methods are what all ienumerable methods in .net use to determine equality for operations such as union distinct etc when using the default equality comparer you don t specify your own iequalitycomparer

10807365
equals	gethashcode
to function correctly gethashcode needs to return the same results for all objects that return true for equals t

10807365
equals	gethashcode
the reverse is not necessarily true - gethashcode can return collisions for objects that are not equals

10807387
children	parent
adding that in a parent element makes adding it in the children elements unecessary

10807398
centos	linux
i have no idea whether this matters or not like for the driver for mongodb i am using wamp server currently on a windows 7 x64 and later i plan to move it under my centos 6.2 webserver so please also consider these also might have dependencies on linux

i would definitely recommend using instrumentation to profiling what message is taking the most time so you can really break it down

cvs	rcs
given just a file you can use the rlog command part of rcs not part of cvs to get a log that will show all the commit messages

10807543
cvs	rcs
shameless self-promotion my own get-versions tool lets you grab multiple versions of a file in a single command it currently works with rcs cvs and git

10807585
int	chars
bufferedwriter.write int writes the chars value of the int not the int value

10807592
int	chars
what is confusing you is that while the method signature indicates it s writing an int it s actually expecting that int to represent an encoded chars

10807592
int	chars
the chars to be written is contained in the 16 low-order bits of the given int value

10807596
children	parent
stackpanel as the parent panel for expanders here is out of the question because it can t give all remaining space to its children

10807609
google-chrome	safari
in safari and google-chrome the change of css don t get applied until the javascript code is completed and thus user don t see the loading image when the search is being performed

10807612
google-chrome	firefox
the load event does not correctly bubble up the parent document and the event.target isn t set by firefox ie9 or google-chrome which is required to do event delegation

10807683
udp	tcp
the difference from tcp is that each read on udp socket de-queues exactly one datagram so this is a bit easier

10807692
children	parent
i am surprised by this i would like my parent class to have a method which has access to a private attribute its children are guaranteed to have

10807703
gridview	rowdatabound
as far as i can gather what egoldin is doing is filling the gridview then using the rowdatabound event he she is then taking this data returned and converting it to a table which can be used at a later stage

10807719
fast-forward	merge
in case of a fast-forward merge the history is not modified at all only the master branch points at a different commit

10807730
superclass	subclassing
the idea behind the double-underscore name mangling is to avoid conflicts with subclassing superclass - it s not meant to be used for private variables

10807796
accessor	properties
the framework also requires all persisted fields and properties to also have public get and set accessor and uses them when creating and initializing a new object instance

10807862
screens	tablet
really the only thing i did different is account for the stageorientation.unknown and prevent whatever that would do set the width to 1024 for the ipad screens might be different for other tablet devices in the main mxml file and removed the stopimmediatepropagation

10807878
pop-up	dialog
in most cases it just doesn t matter because you re either redirecting to another page or changing the current state such as with a pop-up dialog or something else

google-chrome	firefox

width	height
in a simpleadapter i got the screen width height then passed that to my relativelayout for the data row

10808003
width	height
in short i really don t want to pass the height and width at all

10808003
width	height
anyway using the workaround from simpleadapter i thought passing the height and width just like before would work but for some reason this time i m getting an error i can t figure out

10808003

here is the code that sets the width and height

10808003

the height and width are determined elsewhere and are accurate across all devices i ve tested with

i have tried in the activity to set the height width with the following

10812290
children	parent
what i want to learn is is there anyway for such a custom parent tag to know about its children

inherited	properties
the prototype properties of a function holds the object from which all instances of that function will inherited when created with the new operator

10812392
inherited	properties
so as a new test inherited that properties evaluates to true

10812392
inherited	properties
you will need to distinguish between the prototype properties of a function object and the prototype object from which an object inherited - often referenced as the internal properties

10812392
inherited	properties
therefore it inherited from the function.prototype object - where the constructor properties says that all functions are constructed by the function constructor

10812392
inherited	properties
so the famous prototype chain is not about the constructor and or prototype properties but about the prototype object from which that object inherited from

apache	nginx
this is the main idea i want to use nginx or apache webservers as a tcp processor so they manage all threads and connections and client sockets all packets received from a port lets say port 9000 will be redirected to a program made on php or python and that program will process each request storing the data in a database

10812993
apache	nginx
the big problem is also that this program needs to send data to the client or socket that is currently connecting to the nginx or apache server i ve been told that i should do something like this instead of creating my own tcp server which is too difficult and is very hard to maintain since the socket communication with huge loads could lead in memory faults or even could crash down the server

some of those solutions involved trying to launchd the ios simulator s security services daemons for example

10823489

10823490
folder	directory
to make it relative tot he project directory i copied the android.jar to a libs folder in the project right clicked and added to build path

we are using the ftdi vinculum ii vnc2 for the usb host controller and my boss would like a solution where the customer can plug in any or most bluetooth usb dongles into the usb port on our instrument and then be able to connect our instrument via bluetooth to an android phone

10823972
rfcomm	l2cap
i ve found out the usb dongle only implements the controller stack hcl sco lmp and hci and that the host my custom firmware in this case must provide the implementation of the host stack or the parts of it that we need in any case hci l2cap rfcomm at least

10823972
bluetooth	usb
either that or another solution that i am not aware of that would allow our customers to plug any usb bluetooth dongle into our instrument and be able to connect to their android phone without us having to implement the bluetooth host stack on our end.

folder	directory
try it make a folder called bob then in the same directory make a symlink called bob and point it somewhere it will probably put the symlink bob inside the directory bob.

10824161
filtering	grouping
i actually realized that in order to resolve this issue is to create a filtering to the table not just the row and make sure that the totals row is included in the table but not in a grouping

10824192
int	chars
edit i wasn t aware that assigning an int to a string was in fact legal as an int can be converted to a chars which can be assigned to a string although a string can t be initialized to a chars

10824240
width	height
in cases like this a common work around was instead of setting the offending metric ie width height to a percent layout we would typically bind it to it s immediate parent or something similar

plot	errorbar
the best i can do when plotting a single test point 1.0 3.0 0.25 0.5 0.25 0.5 is to get a plot of the test point with disembodied errorbar floating in nearby space

10824347
int	chars
so it looks like converting to int makes the storage slightly less efficient and all of my gains come form reducing the number of chars stored in each row

10824352
post	get
there appears to be an issue with where some methods called within the above extension live see the comments of the original blog post but it should get you most of the way there

10824832
gcov	lcov

the problem is that 1 and 12 are int of type int not double

10824856
unsigned	short
in line with steve s opinion that this is a bug line 757 informs renderscript to treat the index data as short unsigned 16bit but it sends it a 32 bit signed value which will be accepted due to the lack of a check and treated unsigned and then only the lower 16 bits used hence why we get something drawn when below this threshold and triangles connecting back to the first indices when we go over

10824868
folder	directory
as a last resort you could open up index.php and remove the code redirecting you the downloader folder but at this point you might be better off re-installing magento remove everything in the directory and follow the install steps again since something probably went wrong

10824872
hide	show
i ve figured out how to hide and show different content basically by setting display none

10824983
for-loop	loops
i m thinking something simple like another for-loop to read the number of copies and make it loops that many times if the user wants 3 copies loops will read this and loops 2 times through the print loops

pull	push
trusted users clone pull push the trusted repo

10827186

10827323
super	extends
the other idea i had was to use the module + extends + super decorator from this post

10827336
qfile	qtextstream
since qtextstream is buffered the pos function may have to seek the device to reconstruct a valid device position. there is a chance that if you use qfile and textstream in conjunction the text stream s internal position will be out of sync with the file s position that way this seek function used inernally by pos function may go terribly wrong

10827339
accessor	properties
this code is automatically translated by the compiler to code similar to the one you posted with this code is easier to declare properties and they are ideal if you don t want to implement custom logic inside the set or get methods you can even use a different accessor for the set method making the properties immutable

after a bit more research i found that g++ is basically gcc with a few default flags and a slightly different interpretation mechanism for file extensions there may be other differences i ve glanced over

10827353
g++	gcc
i d like to know exactly which flags can be passed to gcc to amount to the equivalent g++ call

10827353
g++	gcc
the way the tool chain is set up makes it sort of difficult to simply replace the gcc calls with g++

10827354

10837003
gridbaglayout	springlayout

rss	feed
i have created an rss feed from google alerts that i am mapping into fields

first thing you have to do is to implement comparable on the class that you want to sort and further create a comparator method

10837981
post	get
upon selecting the back button i can see that the browser is attempting to perform the original request the post not the redirected request the get

10837981
post	get
looks like the browser is treating the post and get as the same request and hence selecting the back button is re-submitting the post

10837983

how do i get it to display the title of the post proper

10838046

convert int - double carefully

10838509
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
so i m working on this site and for some reason a couple of the pages do not align correctly in firefox and opera but work just fine in google-chrome ie and safari

10838509
width	height
the basic construction is that i have a div with width height 100 within the div i have a table to separate the sections of the page

10838509
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the left and right side columns should be filling up the remainder of the width of the screen however in firefox and opera the columns have no width but in ie google-chrome and safari they fill up the remainder

10838509
google-chrome	safari
in playing with it if i remove the width parameters on the two middle cells it will line up correctly but this causes text alignment issues in google-chrome ie and safari

hid	keyboard
i have a bar code reader and rfid reader that act as a hid device and i got output from them as keyboard output and after the data is red enter key is pressed

10838570
inherited	properties
no you ll need to modify the .designer file or inherited from it and change the behavior of that properties but i guess the auto-generated properties won t be virtual so you ll need to edit it anyway

10838586
google-chrome	firefox
the styles apply in both firefox and google-chrome but not in ie

10838599
opera	firefox
for some reason a couple of the pages do not align correctly in firefox and opera

10838639

i ve read lots of post around the net but they all put the code with gaps where your supposed to fill in and where it s put is expected to be known

10838690
spaces	delimiter
they are spaces delimiter instead of comma delimiter

10838707
super	self
it looks like you already may have fixed the original error which was caused by super .__init__ x y as the error message indicates although your fix was slightly incorrect instead of super point self from the circle class you should use super circle self

10838777
maven	pom.xml
currently i am using the pom.xml below from question how can i create an executable jar with dependencies using maven

10838798
versioning	upgrade
if you re upgrading make sure you also upgrade your versioning of

10838814
width	height
i attempted to dynamically create the window of the appropriate width height by passing it in on window.open but that as well doesn t account for non-page area

10838831
concave	convex
if you need to make it work with concave shapes you ll have to make it first split the concave shape up in separate convex parts and then apply the theorem to all individual parts

10838850
min	max
i did not then need to mess w the min max pref sizes

10838885
google-chrome	safari
i ve seen this issue on lion on a macbook in safari google-chrome

rss	feed
i installed my site in another server but it delays too much due to twitter module and weather module wich of course read rss feed

10839021

if we don t salt the password you could have duplicate password hash

10839039
put	get
everything is good and dandy i have different views and they talk to the controller when they need to put changes into the model or get called upon when changes are reflected int he model

10839070
width	height
i added the control and setup the width height inserted my app id and ad unit id and published it to my phone

10839073
post	get
it took me awhile to figure out how to get the software setup and implement the above cross browser for example android below 4.0 doesn t support svg so i had to rely on .png sprites still and i wrote a javascript file that allowed for resizable sprites - similar to the stretchy sprites post - that s another advantage of icon fonts if you can get away with single color icons

10839141
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
first step open up the console in google-chrome safari or firebug firefox

10839157
implements	extends
implements is used for interfaces and extends is used to extends a class

10839157
implements	extends
and when you need to choose between implements an interface or extends a class for a particular scenario go for implements an interface

10839157
implements	extends
because a class can implements multiple interfaces but extends only one class

10839170
hash	salt	hash	md5	salt	md5
a salt adds an extra layer of security - the md5 hash can no longer be looked up in a reverse md5 database

10839170
hash	salt
so on your server hash your password with the salt before you input it to your database

10839178
implements	extends
you can only extends one class in your child class but you can implements as many interfaces as you would like

10839199
qunit	sinon
our testing stack looks like js code qunit sinon

10839220
folder	directory
so i exited eclipse created a new libs folder in the workbench package directory

10839240
svg	vml
it seems like i shouldn t have to change the doctype for different browsers and the reputation graph on stack exchange s user page appears to work the same way vml for ie8 and below svg for everyone else html5 doctype .

10839241
width	height
i don t know exactly how do you want the buttons to be placed on the screen but normally you would find out the width and height of the screen and work the real dimension from that

10839245
int	boolean
you don t need to concatenate string values nor do you need to convert the question number to a string - writeln has the magical ability to accept any number of variables and print them according to their default format strings int reals and boolean

10839257
int	chars
you re reading a chars from the stream and trying to print it as an int

10839264
hash	md5
for example the md5 hash of password123 is 482c811da5d5b4bc6d497ffa98491e38

10839278
mp3	wav
but this seems not to be because i am able to play all other formats including aiif mp3 wav .

10839297
post	get
i have just added a rest api to my existing spring + blazeds + hibernate server and everything appears to work when data is retrieved and serialised as json but when i try and post data to be de-serialised into a pojo i get the an exception

10839299
implements	extends
as mentioned by lots of people you extends a class and you can only extends from one and you implements an interface -- but your class can implements as many interfaces as you like

10839299
super	implements
ie these keywords and the rules governing their use delineate the possibilities for multiple-inheritance in java you can only have one super class but you can implements multiple interfaces

10839310
ubuntu	linux
i m on ubuntu linux if that matters

10839370
qobject	qmetaobject
not much is done there the slot is called by either directly calling qobject qt_static_metacall obtained at the time the connection was established or qobject qt_metacall if the qmetaobject connect was used to setup the connection

10839389
post	put	post	get	put	get
so what you could do with this project is specify table database names and the paths for get post put delete and what kinds of data you d want to put in and it would give you the actual url and any authentication stuff

10839408
internationalization	translation
i m using django internationalization tools to translation some strings from my application

10839410
spaces	delimiter
jquery binding can take multiple events just spaces delimiter

10839413
implements	extends
but is it possible to ensure that the dynamic type extends implements multiple types

10839413
implements	extends
so that the dog has to extends the animal -class and implements an interface

10839436
inherited	properties
an abstract class with properties can be used to represent a base class in inherited

10839462
implements	extends
of course your classes must extends happyanimal it won t work if they extends animal and implements happy directly

10839523
width	height
snap to grid will only work for your purpose in certain situations like when the connected objects are of equal height width or when the line is connected to the snapped edge

10839575
width	height
i want to have a div that is 100 width and height but with left and right margins i also want top and bottom margins but one thing at a time

10839575
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
i have been able to achieve a div that is 100 in width and height with a top and left margin but the bottom and right margins are not recognized

10839584
awt	swing
my swing awt j2d may be a bit fuzzy but the idea is that since your imagepanel is an imageobserver it can be notified asynchronously about image information

10839607
ant	maven
this may be using the google plugin for eclipse maven ant or whatever build system you use

10839611
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i guess firefox unlike google-chrome and safari isn t too picky about syntax

10839614
many-to-one	one-to-many
actually i have a project entity with a one-to-many relation on projectsworkgroups entity which have a many-to-one relation on workgroup entity

10839628
opera	google-chrome
and is it possible to develop ie extension using javascript and html as in opera and google-chrome

10839659
hide	show
you should either hide the partial block and load it after the user makes a selection or load for all values and use tabs or similar mechanism to hide show

10839694
maven-antrun-plugin	maven-wagon-plugin
instead of maven-antrun-plugin it is better to use upload goal of maven-wagon-plugin

10839699
hash	salt
the encryption key ends up being a sha1 hash of the salt

10839699
hash	salt
it should be a sha1 hash of the passphrase and salt

10839709
move	drag
here is a jsfiddle with a shape that should be move on mouse drag events

10839715
width	height
note however that domcontentloaded may fire before images and css sheets are done loading resulting in in-accurate height and width measurements

10839722
post	get
the back button re-executes the request before post accountdetails.xhtml which is not listed in your 1st screenshot but is according the 2nd screenshot apparently and logically a get accountdetails.xhtml

10839789
qthread	qobject
well a qthread is a qobject but you really should not derive from a qthread

10839789
qevent	qobject
posting qevents to qobject is faster than using signal-slot invocations because there are no copy constructors called and there s no marshalling done except directly by you upon construction of a qevent

10839789
profiling	benchmarking
only if profiling benchmarking shows that event posting is too slow you d want to look at using qsharedmemory

10839805
put	get
then you can get the data out of your bytearrayoutputstream and put it into the bytearrayinputstream as before

10839835
jar	war
all the above modules either generate jar or war files in the target directory of each module

10839835
jar	war
i need to copy all the generated jar or war files to a any directory ex base.dir

10839846
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it renders fine in firefox google-chrome opera and ie9 and badly in safari on win7 the text has various artefacts and generally looks like it s shadowed

10839933
min	max
the parameters min max are easily stored as fields

10839933
int	chars
more important if you re going to pass instances of this classes over the network or attempt marshaling them to lua python .net whatever you ll consider changing std string by chars type fixed_size or even to the int type with some enumeration

10839940
width	height
i have a jpanel which for example is 500 width and 100 height

10839989
google-chrome	safari
i would love some insight into the error i am seeing in safari and google-chrome with the following line of code

10839989
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome and safari have no issues with this code

10839993
hide	show
i m using jquery fancybox to show and hide loading animation on ajax requests

10839994
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome does indeed seem to handle value.tolocalestring in a different way from firefox however i believe this should be considered as a globalize bug

10840032
put	get
if you only have 2 action methods for your controller say 1 for get and 1 for put then you can just name both of your actions index either like i did above or like this

10840032
post	put
these new 4 routes all have the same url pattern with the exception of the post since you should post to the collection yet put to the specific id

10840042
box-sizing	border-box
as you can see the first three boxes render with content-box box-sizing the w3c standard and the fourth renders with border-box because it was explicitly set using css

10840045
required	placeholder
using jquery you will be able to easily hide remove the current label and use its content to fill the placeholder attribute that will then be used by the plugin if required

10840053
ant	maven
though it uses maven as an example it can be easily adopted to ant as it just runs a class with a main method

10840090
vim	emacs
emacs and vim seem to support llvm syntax highlighting

10840099
fadein	fadeout
alas since i also needed to supply a javascript fallback for older browsers i had to set the container height for these browsers anyway because of jquerys fadein fadeout actually setting display none

10840109
ciimage	uiimage
assigning the output ciimage to a uiimage does not cause the image to be processed and output rendered

10840161
int	chars
next the result of chr - 0 is an int which you then silently downcast to an unsigned chars

10840162
put	get
i m attempting to write a rewriterule to send all requests to my server to index.php and then put the request into a get parameter

10840175
hide	show
you can hide show each sub-report as desired

10840197
serializable	deserialization
when category is present in the corresponding xml file serializable deserialization works as expected

10840245
int	chars
another option this one is my personal favorite is the same thing that getc does return an int that either contains a chars value or is -1 to signal an error

10840245
int	chars
in the case of no error the int can safely be typecast and or stored to a chars

10840307
listview	gridview
i bind the channels to a gridview and inside my gridview i bind a listview for the programs in the tv channel

10840307
listview	gridview
the challenge appears when i want to get a reference for the first or second third etc program item in the listview which is really a gridview item

10840347
google-chrome	firefox
it works in firefox but unfortunately still is a bit jumpy not pixel perfect in google-chrome

10840349
jquery	simplemodal
jquery simplemodal two different modal contents in the same page

10840352
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
the text-indent works as expected or at least the way i expect it to in google-chrome firefox and opera - it indents the first line of the text and then performs the wrapping again to keep the padding correct

10840352
firefox	safari

prepare	execute
what you usually can do is use a prepare statement with placeholders for the variables that you execute with a list of tuples of parameters

10841063
free	malloc
personally i d continue to use malloc free explicitly instead of trying to contort my code in such a way that arc kind of sort of manages malloced memory

for-loop	loops
in c# you also don t test whether for-loop or while loops inside your method works correctly

uiview	calayer
the part that mentioned how to get a view graphics context is actually the same context obtained in calayer calayer began the display and drawincontext by using a bitmap graphics context it seems and finally calls drawrect in uiview using this bitmap context and i am not sure whether the idea that calayer is cached on the gpu actually meant this bitmap graphics context or does it mean layer.contents which is a cgimage so the caching is actually on this image not the graphics context

10842758
width	height
i think the problem here is similar to the well-known behavior where position absolute fixed div s that don t have a defined height width can often disappear

10842758
width	height
in any case you can see that defining height and width on the element with preserve-3d fixes the issue in the js fiddle

10842788

essentially i want the speed attribute set to 0 and have 3 methods accelerate decelerate and get_speed which add and subtract 5 to the speed attribute and eventually return the speed attribute so it can be printed

10842824
concave	convex
it s actually a lot easier to clip a convex polygon than a concave one so if your polygons are of a fixed shape then you might consider using a triangulation algorithm such as ear clipping or decomposition to monotone edges and then performing the clipping and area calculation on those rather than the original

10842832
post	put
i really put much time and effort into searching for the error and as soon as i post here i find it out alone thanks guys for helping me with this one

put	get
i have a modal popup extender mpe it has textboxes that are build dynamically depends on the number of input of the user for example the user input 6 then 6 textboxes will be generated in mpe now my problem is how am i going to get value of those textboxes and put it into the gridview

10843446

put	get
i want to put it into the dictionary in a nested dictionary but get a keyerror because that particular species has not been added to the dictionary

10843478
freetype	libpng
the root of the problem is that freetype and libpng are installed in non-canonical locations by xcode in usr x11 instead of usr or usr local

10843478
freetype	libpng
all of the answers already given address the problem by re-building freetype and libpng either manually or using a package manager like homebrew

10843478
freetype	libpng
you can however get matplotlib to compile by simply symlinking the existing freetype libpng headers and libraries into the usr local tree with

10843522
google-chrome	firefox
but i don t think it s a bug because it renders the same way in google-chrome firefox and i think even in internet explorer

10843583
post	get
well the server told us that it s possible to get and post a new question

10843631
width	height
i have a dynamically created 2d array content which has height of _h and width of _w in my implementation row is a first parameter and column is second makes sense in context

10843631
width	height
i wrap this int value by height or width with and obviously the remainder is always 0 r max

10843631
put	get
when i look at values of v and u they re something like -7753978124 - actually having a negative number in my context isn t supposed to happen so i have yet to look for what s causing it but anyway .iget should turn it into a normal integer and _h or _w should put it into the bounds but instead i get access violation

10843639
post	put
you can put the following in your post model

10843642
portrait	landscape
it turns out that it s not the split view controller per se or the tab bar controller for that matter that s causing the portrait landscape mixup

10843642
portrait	landscape
basically if a uiwebview is taller than it is wide the os considers it in portrait mode and if it s wider than it is tall the os considers it in landscape mode

10843642
width	height
the presence of a tab bar controller was enough to make the height 768 - 20 - 49 699 just smaller than the width 1024 - 320 - 1 gutter 703

10843644
width	height
make the span an inline-block element and then set its width and height to that of the sprite

10843651
getter	setter
with its getter and setter

10843651
post	get
and when you post the form with multiple files in your controller you can have the same modelattribute field to get the list filled with multiple files

10843657
google-chrome	firefox
but i don t think it s a bug because it renders the same way in google-chrome firefox and i think even in internet explorer

10843658
portrait	landscape
basically if it s wider than it is tall it s considered landscape and if it s taller than it is wide it s considered portrait

10843672

superclass	subclassing
access a member of the superclass that has been hidden by a member of a subclassing

10843744
superclass	subclassing
when a subclassing calls super it is calling the constructor of its immediate superclass

10843744
superclass	subclassing
the second form of super is most applicable to situations in which member names of a subclassing hide members by the same name in the superclass

10843746
pop-up	dialog
your question is not very clear but my assumption is that you are getting the toolbar search functionality instead a pop-up search dialog single or advanced search

10843746
pop-up	dialog
if yes one breaking change i noticed in recent versions of jqgrid is that you must now return true from the event handler if you want the search dialog to pop-up

10843779
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i m guessing that you got that source from the elements aka dom browser in your google-chrome or safari or firefox firebug developer tools

10843785

looks like he was only using var some months ago and recently started an effort to replace those with public private protected

10843790
for-loop	loops
however it doesn t elaborate on why it would be useful and i can t seem to find any benchmarks for the empty for-loop as opposed to the while loops

10843790
for-loop	loops
dr why should i use an empty for-loop over a while 1 loops

10843791
post	get
sorry for all the edits i couldn t get the edits to include the code and post correctly so i broke it up into chunks and added a little at a time

10843827
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
my app works perfectly in firefox and google-chrome but in ie or safari it acts very weirdly

10843842
getter	setter
sencha touch 2 does not automatically generate getter and setter for your config

10843842
getter	setter
manually create getter setter for your custom config for example you have to define something like this as a config of your view component

10843849
daemons	systemd
i would look into writing a userland daemons that runs in the systemd tray listening for http or https requests and opens the appropriate program instead

10843861
getter	setter
an interface icreaturereference would define getter and setter for all those properties

10843861
accessor	properties
a typical implementation would be a struct creaturereference with a single private field int _index and properties accessor like

10843871
organization	naming
what you have to do is download them from github search for symfony and you will find the components inside the organization repository and put them inside your project s library folder paying attention to the psr #0 naming conventions

10843882
versioning	upgrade
if so then your solution is to be sure to always increase your schema versioning number every time you change the schema and to use sqliteopenhelper.onupgrade or some other means to make sure your database is always upgrade when necessary

10843911
octal	decimal
is that of a decimal constant octal constant or hexadecimal

10843922
post	get
question is how to get user1 s connected friend and their post as well

10843998
width	margin
since the element you re setting its width to be 100 specifically is already a block-level element it will automatically take up the full width of its container by itself but by setting its width to be 100 it will not take its margin padding border into account when doing this and thus having any of those properties set to be 1 the extra width will stick out from its parent

10844004
division	logarithm
since you want to do this efficiently and these are powers of 2 you can replace division by pagesize with right-shift by the base-2 logarithm of pagesize which is 22

10844039
hash	md5
and you can make it a string and hash md5 the result

10844046
uilabel	uitextview
you could do something complicated using sizewithfont constrainedtosize to figure out the size that the various text boxes need to be at the new width to fit the text you want to put in them but probably easier would be to eliminate the uilabel uitextview s and the uiimageview and just create a uiwebview that fills the whole view and use it s loadhtmlstring baseurl to supply a html string that includes your copy and a link to your image in your bundle

10844046
portrait	landscape
typically i ll see guys who defer this sort of frame adjustments to didrotatefrominterfaceorientation rather than willrotatetointerfaceorientation because a you have the coordinates of the new orientation and because navigation controllers are different heights in landscape v portrait this can be important though maybe not in your case

10844089
onclick	onmousedown
where the onmousedown javascript will activate the onclick javascript

10844108
jboss	weblogic
i want to write monitoring and profiling tool for java application servers such as jboss weblogic etc

10844176

10844316
spaces	linefeed
the s will test for spaces tab carraige return linefeed and more

10844316
spaces	linefeed
s matches a single white spaces character including spaces tab form feed linefeed

10844559
oncreate	onstart
however i can t find anything about whether onstart will be called immediately after oncreate returns without waiting for the child activity to return or whether all lifecycle events after oncreate are suspended until the child activity returns when startactivityforresult is called from within oncreate

10844566
post	get
we could use get or post here as the data would be very minimal i think

10844568

int main int argc chars argv

10844585
mouseup	mousedown
and also checking mousedown mouseup events on same way

google-chrome	firefox
i ve tested this on google-chrome firefox and ie and all behave as expected

10849866

memcached	ncache
if you are concerned about having this initial load occur and be syncd across several servers without executing the data load multiple times you could look at a distributed cache appfabric ncache memcached depending on the overhead of making the db call

10849977
ienumerable	ienumerator	ienumerator	idisposable
when you use yield keyword compiler generates nested class which implements ienumerable ienumerator and idisposable and stores all context data

the database profiling stores each executed query which is very useful for debugging and optimisation but leads to rather fast memory exhaustion if you execute a huge numbers of queries

10850571
switching	screens
i can see the value in being able to switching resources based on screens resolution you ll obviously have to do some work to bring the vast number of resolutions down into a manageable short list and find the best fit for the current one but here you go

10850863

width	height
i need to set specific width and height of image in css with jquery but only for first image in one div

10851032
google-chrome	firefox
however browsers will try their best to read non-valid urls by treating repeat hashes as though they are escaped as you can see by checking the value of window.location.hash in ie firefox and google-chrome for

10851140
superclass	subclassing
because all those subclassing will call the superclass they will end up calling the nslog of uiview

10851140
uicontrol	uibutton
for example you need uiview for uicontrol then uicontrol for uibutton and so on

10851202
post	get
for post we can have schemalocations configuration is there something similar for get

10851217
google-chrome	firefox
works fine in google-chrome and firefox

10851231
put	get
even without thoroughly analyzing every single instruction and its use i m pretty confident to say that there aren t any unneccessary loads or stores except the ones at the beginning ok i left them uninitialized which are neccessary anyway to get them from memory into computing registers and at the end which is neccessary as in the following expression v is gonna be put out

10851235
put	get
however if your objects can be recreated each time then you just need to put enough data in the form so that when it gets posted everything can be re-data-bound to get the same values in a new object

10851264
int	boolean
so - the issue is not calling the options themselves that seems to work fine it s altering the actual output a string boolean int etc based on the needed values of the js file because as of right now it s doing diddly squat because of it

10851273
rational-numbers	integer
strictly speaking there is no such thing as integer division division by definition is an operation which produces a rational-numbers integers are a very small subset of which.

you don t need to strip the image width and height attributes

10851378
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
tested in google-chrome firefox opera ie9 and ie9 emulating ie7

10851378
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
this had the proper effect in google-chrome and ie even ie7 but not in firefox or opera

10851378
opera	firefox	width	height
however even in firefox and opera the effect was better than if the width and height attributes were left out because the width attribute still had an effect even though the height attribute didn t

10851378
opera	firefox
opera and firefox show the alt text but otherwise have essentially the same behavior as they did before

10851378
width	height
the width and height attributes do not appear to be responsible for any of these alt text woes however except in ie8 to some extent

10851390
int	double
i feel like my this method for getting the users input storing it as an int double does not work well as it is too basic and does not work in all cases

10851437
int	double
if you want to get the floating point division of two int you ll just need to remember to cast one to a double float decimal

10851487
implements	extends
unfortunately localdate is a final class so i can t easily extends it to implements the interface

10851578

10851593
textview	imageview
for the overlay item i would like to use a layout with an imageview and textview as the textview will be displaying some information

10851644
min	max
you will need a list of tracks as in your second query with their min and max values and then perform the comparisons

10851655
maven	m2e
i m using maven including maven-android-plugin for the automated build and eclipse as my ide with m2e and m2e-android to bridge the two

10851776
getter	setter
i currently use the following syntax to define a class with getter and setter

10851810
google-chrome	firefox
everything works just fine in google-chrome but in firefox once you mousedown for the second time on the image and start dragging the cursor it seems that the indicator the png image i mentioned earlier drags along and messes everything up

10851818
put	get
the logic would not be better put somewhere else and as i pointed out with string immutability it is a common paradigm to get new variations from existing ones

10851831
post	get
i ve read the post here which looks very similar but can t get it to translate to my purposes

10851874
ffmpeg	libavformat
my ffmpeg source have ff_getaddrinfo in libavformat os_support.c function that is linked to getaddrinfo which function is a pointer function but when i run the program my program called other function in libc.so not getaddrinfo dynamic library

10851899
hash	salt
as for encrypting the user s personal information just like a password we can use a custom salt + hashing algorithm that s quite simple but effective on our application to use the custom hash equivalent of the userid which is expected to be permanent static and persistent forever

10851909
udp	rtp
i need to stream rtp video the comes from udp network socket so i am thinking to use ffmpeg

10852020
nunit	mstest
i changed a test class to mstest rather than nunit but still got both the above problems when debugging with resharper

10852046
oncreate	ondestroy
a fragment can add a listener or an observer to another object in oncreate and then remove it in ondestroy thus managing the updates itself

10852054

i have images in my database and i have converted them into blob but i can t display them on a gridview or listview with other information like this price qty description image

10852088

10852340
oncreate	ondestroy
add logs in ondestroy and improve log in oncreate to show what is the value of bundle savedinstancestate

10852344
mouseleave	mouseenter
but it turned out to be pretty easy to handle with mouseenter and mouseleave events and by using a custom copy command

10852382
jobs	cron
you could run ps as a cron job and poll the system every x minutes but you would miss threads that were born and died between jobs

10852397
fadein	fadeout
i have a very simple mouseenter on tab to fadein child div thing going on but i want touch devices to be able to tap on a close link to fadeout the child

10852405
uiview	cagradientlayer
given an arbitrary uiview on ios is there a way using core graphics cagradientlayer comes to mind to apply a foreground-transparent gradient to it

10852405
uiview	subviews
i have a non-elegant fallback have my uiview clip its subviews and move a pre-rendered gradient png of the background as the parent scrollview is scrolled

10852407
many-to-one	one-to-many
user have one-to-many on workgroup and workgroup have many-to-one on user

10852418

10852423
serializable	deserialization
take a look at the jackson wiki for modules a jackson module can be used to create custom serializable deserialization

10852472
children	parent
what is an efficient way to transform this flat list into a hierachy that means filling in the appropriate children nodes for each parent node

10852509
getter	setter
however for the moment you can only change vizualisation properties see the setgetter and setsetter in every class but you cannot move an x.object since x.object._transform attribute is private and there is no getter setter for it yet

10852509
getter	setter
that s something interesting to deal with adding a pair of getter setter for x.object s transform would allow for example an user to put medical stuff modelized by a mesh or something else in the scene and place to mesure distances or see if it will fit for an operation or something like that

10852536
google-chrome	firefox
does your firefox google-chrome console show any problems

10852538
tinyint	boolean
some front ends with the use boolean option enabled will treat all tinyint 1 columns as boolean and vice versa

10852538
tinyint	boolean
boolean is just a synonym for tinyint 1 and true and false are synonyms for 1 and 0

10852549
width	height
that is it must have either a width a height or a position otherwise the gradient won t be visible

10852610
spaces	linefeed
so i d say run through all characters and remove all linefeed cr and rs instances or replace them by spaces whilst avoiding double spaces

10852620
pop-up	dialog
currently when there is an unhandled error in one of the forms in my windows forms program a dialog pop-up with lots of details which are irrelevant and confusing to the end user

you can create the file makefile.defs in which you define cflags or cxxflags and then go to project properties - c++ build properties - settings - gcc or g++ compiler - miscellaneous

10852706
width	height
replace the value of src with the page you want to load and adjust height and width to your needs

10852726
min	max
i need not only min max count etc as provided internally in fastreport but standard deviation as well

10852726
min	max
so far the nicest solution that i can come up with involves using a filter on the main table for passed so that the user can view passe failed or all and then to build a separate stats table with the same field name columns but with min max count mean stdev as individual records

10852728
x86	64bit
honestly i would recommend just targeting x86 and forgetting the 64bit version all together and letting your application run on wow64 unless your application has a compelling need to run as x64

10852728
x86	64bit
if the os is x64 deploy the 64bit version of the dll otherwise the x86 version

10852746
implements	extends
it represents a binarytree that contains objects that are comparable to any object of the same class as t or any of its supertypes object is one supertype of all classes essentially all classes that t extends and all interfaces it implements

you will have to figure out if the package is being initially installed reinstalled or upgrade so that you don t for example ask your question during an upgrade the user has presumably already answered it during the installation

10852814
curses	readline
you will have to figure out what kind of user interface is available and prompt using readline curses or another method depending on how the system is configured and what is available

10852815
jasmine	sinon
i am using jasmine 1.2.0 and sinon 1.3.4

10852852
calloc	malloc
the malloc call just reserves virtual address space but does not actually touch the physical memory this is the default behaviour unless some other version of malloc is used one that zeroes the memory like calloc does

10852870
button	checkbox
but my php script see only the checkbox values posted on the current page using the pager button of datatables.net

10852872
hide	show
when you know that all your data is downloaded just load the table hide the spinner and show the table

10852909
getter	setter
when we design a class in delphi typically we have private fields members private setter and getter methods and a public property

10852909
getter	setter
so the getter and setter methods encapsulate the instance member and the property encapsulates the getter and setter methods

10852909
getter	setter
if the properties encapsulate the getter setter private methods isn t this a violation

10852909
getter	setter
the getter and setter are the internals of the concrete class and shoudn t be exposed

10853000
google-chrome	firefox
when working with extjs in ie you need to consider that the ie s json parser is a lot stricter than that of google-chrome or firefox

10853000
google-chrome	firefox
if you get the length of such object on google-chrome firefox the value will be 5 while in ie it will be 6

10853002
viewdidload	dealloc
everything you retain in viewdidload should be released and set to nil at the latest in viewdidunload and also in dealloc

10853048

when it comes to int double boolean and other primitives that cannot have a null value when the defaultmodelbinder receives no data for them in the http request it must still construct a model instance

10853049
portrait	landscape
i have seen some discussion here on stack overflow related to using activity.onretainnonconfigurationinstance to maintain a background thread started by one instance of an activity and pass it to the next instance of the activity which results for example when the phone s orientation changes from portrait to landscape

10853075
width	height
the actual style such as current height current width or other properties cannot be accessed in css

min	max
i just had this issue and this is how i solved it although i had one min and on max provided on accident

10853129
width	height
however to have a background stretched to the height and the width of a video you ll have to use an absolutely positioned tag example

if you drag an app between two other apps there is a noticable delay before all apps rearrange to move the free space

10853228
post	get
i am trying to figure out how to get the return value to post

10853243
getter	setter
however interfaces force the use of getter setter methods

10853243
getter	setter
besides that getter and setter methods are usually private

10853243
public	protected
it is up to the class that implement the interface to define which properties and methods are visible and for who they are protected or public or published

10853278
google-chrome	firefox
my memory usage shoots through the roof in firefox but barely peaks in google-chrome

10853288

width	height
furthermore if i reload the winform it uses its current width and height to draw the shapes

10853411
width	height
so the winform will update to its current width and height during runtime all the time

httpcontext	httpmodule
ok the way that i end up dealing with this is to create a httpmodule that will pull the route pattern from the httpcontext and put into the server variables as url_pattern

10857215
client-side	server-side
i m sure there are some standard ways to deal with that and as currently there s no interaction server-side - everything s client-side - my main concern is that such a user cannot hurt the experience of another user by sharing his bad version

10857237
onclick	onfocus
on ios 4 using onclick or onfocus to trigger the 2012 ios plugin first made the regular keyboard show after which the date picker was placed on top of that

10857538
getter	setter
is it a property and is it synthesized or are you making your own setter getter

10857557
superclass	subclassing
when you create a blank subclassing the extends superclass you are creating a new class that provides the same interface with the same implementation to the parent class

10857557
superclass	subclassing
once you have this relationship established you can decide whether calling dosomething on an instance of subclassing will behave differently than the default implementation defined in superclass

10857557
inherited	properties
static properties are not inherited

10857557
superclass	subclassing
however a subclassing instance can change the static value of the superclass

10857557
superclass	subclassing
in this way a subclassing has the potential although it is the same potential any code has with the right access privileges to change the properties of superclass

10857595
installation	upgrade
i have an installation of apache maven that is separate from my netbeans.whenever i upgrade my netbeans i have to remember to copy my maven_home conf settings.xml to the netbeans_home java maven conf directory so all the repositories i use are available to my application

we have two classes - subclassing and superclass

10857850
superclass	subclassing
overriding doesn t change a methods of superclass but change them only in subclassing

10857850
public	protected
as you know your superclass can also have variables that also can be public protected private or internal

10857850
getter	setter
you cannot override them but you can do this with getter or setter however

10857850
public	protected
you can access variables that are created as public or protected by using a word super like this super.somevariable

10857850
superclass	subclassing
so everything is up to you if you want to create a different variables of the same name in superclass and subclassing just declare one as private in superclass

10857850
public	protected	superclass	subclassing
if you want to have one variable that superclass and subclassing both can access - just declare it as protected or public

in my case i was using an outdated versioning of feincms but after i upgrade it the error went away

10858161
post	get
this is the case for both get and post requests

10858183

plus i don t think it is a good idea to call a post for every key pressed it should get the post the fist time so it can fill the autocomplete object and after that it should use that object.

10858371
post	get
according to latest comments this question history and at the end you want post data to another url and get response html

10858440
innodb	myisam
the table type you use can be of importance certain types of queries seem to run faster on myisam as opposed to innodb

10858440
memcached	apc
the big caveat here is that apc generally has less memory available for storage though. default being 32mb memcached s big adavantage is that while still fast it s distributed so if you have multiple servers running they could share this data

g++	gcc
when i compile using g++ or gcc filename.cpp it always show me the error sys type.h no such a file or directory

10858592
inline	inlining
compiler implementors have dedicated quite a bit of time and resources to come up with heuristics that determine whether actual inlining should be done or not based on the size of the function the complexity and whether it can be inline at all or not a recursive function cannot be inline

10858637
versioning	upgrade
i upgrade to versioning 2.8.8 and finally i could install opencv 2.4.0

quicksort	mergesort
recursion is an extremely useful technique for designing algorithms and many recursive algorithms quicksort mergesort etc. use little stack space and are quite practical

10859540
x86	mips
here s what i have in mind-using a tool you could attach to either a mips compiled elf or a x86 and as you walk through the instructions in the executable you can see a conversion from the format of the executable in control of the debugger to the format of your choice

10859540
x86	mips
a not so good alternative that would still work would be where you could past any mips instruction into a text box and see another text box with the equivalent x86 instruction or vice versa

10862363
width	height
the code above will keep appending the width and height query strings for each click on the source button or for each postback so you might want to add some extra logic to filter out the width and height query strings before appending them to the src attribute

10864274
min	max
luckily we know that newmin â min and max â newmax

10864274
min	max
we know that a â b newmin â min and c â d max â newmax but we only know - we cannot just apply â -trans twice

10864274
min	max
again branch v l r has type bst min max and we want bst newmin newmax

10864274
min	max
we can no longer give it maxâ newmax because our subtree is bst min v rather than bst min max

fiddler	charles
the charles web proxy and i believe fiddler as well allow connections from external hosts when configured properly

10864509

when i submit the form it post to my items 6 with a put x-http-method-override header

10864560
post	put	post	get	put	get

super	self
now i understand inheritance and other fundamental oop concepts but the idea of self and super is still not clear to me

10864692
inherited	subclassing
i understand that scene2viewcontroller is a subclassing of uiviewcontroller and so scene2viewcontroller inherited all of uiviewcontroller s methods

10864692
super	self
now when i change self to super the code still executes the same way

10864692
super	self
isn t calling super the same as calling self

10864704
super	self
self and super actually both point to the same object

10864719
super	self
sending the message to super is very similar with the exception that the runtime will start looking for an implementation in super and skip self

10864733
super	self
if only the parent has the function declared then self and super act the same

10864760
inherited	subclassing
decoration is most often implemented with some form of inherited whether by using method_missing to delegate to the decoratee or by explicit subclassing of the decoratee

youâ re calling your js function without any user interaction â have you made sure itâ s not just your browserâ s pop-up blocker that keeps the dialog from coming up

10865487

i ve got a numeric application that does a lot of work with negative logs of probabilities which since probabilities range from zero to one take the values of positive doubles or negative infinity if the underlying probability was zero

10866685

google-chrome and ie9 exhibit the desired behavior when issuing a jquery.ajax request with ifmodified true and cache true while firefox 12 never revalidates which poses a serious problem

10866758
keydown	keyup
i do however note that keydown and keyup are not deprecated so using one of those might work more reliable than using keypress

10866765

my very simple test code correctly centers in google-chrome firefox but does not appear correctly in safari

10866819

as for the multiple core response i simply want to display the cpu usage percent as the task manager does even with a multiple core processors

10866896
google-chrome	firefox
this is due to an incompatibility between the firefox implementation of indexeddb which supports the latest indedexdb protocol published december 2011 and the google-chrome implementation which supports the version previous to that

10866896
google-chrome	firefox
the breaking change is how databases are created where the older google-chrome implementation uses the setversion transaction whereas the newer version firefox uses an onupgradeneeded event and callback

10866933
rss	feed
i m using the google feed api-v1 and have a few rss feed where the publisheddate is blank i.e - meaning the rss publisher is not passing an article date into their rss feed

10866988
int	chars
you can use hashmap of chars key and int value

10867026
width	height
and works very well..also this method sets the dgv client height and width programmatically

10867026
width	height
2- in checking the needs of scrollbar code part the numbers which added to width or height are depends to screen resolution..the numbers which i add is not the best but as much optimized for 1024 768 1280 800 and 1366 968 resolution..you may need to change these added numbers

junit can do it with ant and maven

10867057
spaces	delimiter
i m using scanner to scan the text file and specifiying the delimiter as spaces as follows

10867058
setinterval	settimeout
your next problem is that this isn t what you expect it to be inside the setinterval and settimeout callbacks this will probably be window when the callback is triggered

10867065
width	height
one thing you can do to achieve this in certain situations is add width 100 and height 100 to every intervening element and rely on the text extending out of its containing block if the image takes up all of the available space

10867077
pop-up	dialog
i am trying to get this dialog pop-up form to show up when this link is clicked but it does not work for me

10867204
wan	lan
for explicit directions see your wan lan admin

10867213
post	get
maybe you can use phantomjs that executes javascript to get the html generated by javascript like in this post and then clean the code with beautifulsoup the problem is that the result is not going to be dynamic html anymore

10867243
for-loop	loops
a foreach loops and a for-loop would both work fine but you might find the foreach more covenient since you wouldn t have to count the days times to check for

10867246
g++	gcc
gcc command compiles c code in order to compile c++ code you should use g++

10867253

10867257
hash	md5
the messages seem pretty clear the md5 hash of the plugins you re trying to install don t match what they are supposed to be

10867265
memcpy	strncpy
to copy at runtime the usual c method is to use the strncpy or memcpy functions

10867268
jlabel	jslider
yep a decent solution is to use a dictionary such as a and fill it with jlabel that hold imageicons of your color rectangles using an integer that corresponds with the appropriate location on the jslider

10867276
getter	setter
make getter and setter for the x y and were in business

10867276
post	get
after a month of trying to figure it out and posting little questions on here every week i decided to post the whole problem on here and see if i can get some guidance

10867294
inline	inlining
now on actual inlining the compiler can decide to inline or not any function regardless of whether the function is declared as inline provided that it sees the definition of that function the code that it will inline which is the reason why in general functions that are meant to be inline should be defined in the header either inside the class definition or marked inline outside

10867437
subtract	add
once i find this area how can i tell whether i need to add or subtract it from the base poly red vs green areas in the first diagram

scrollable	panels
if you don t want to use the the buttons to go up and down you have several other options to host picturebox control in scrollable panels or list or something else

10867509
width	height
this should give you the height and width of the table or rectangle in terms of cells

10867526
apache	nginx
if using apache verify that the server configuration allows .htaccess or if using nginx verify all configuration files are included in the configuration

10867530

the initreq object inherited ultimately from s3request which has a url properties

10867532
tcpdf	fpdf
i ve used both fpdf and tcpdf to generate multi-page invoice files

10867532
tcpdf	fpdf
i started with fpdf then switched to tcpdf when i needed to include unicode characters which fpdf didn t support at the time.

10867532
tcpdf	fpdf
as eugen suggested you can hand-roll your own headers and footers more easily than using the functions built in to either fpdf or tcpdf

10867532
put	get
i know i can safely put 20 lines of items and i know my maximum single item is 2 lines then when i get to 20 lines i start a new page

could anyone help me to improve this code or to shoot a few ideas to help me to play videos also on firefox internet explorer and safari

10867569
children	parent
the problem is that your elements inside the dropzones are of course part of the dropzone and when you enter the children you leave the parent

10867569
children	parent
you might try adding events to the children too adding your class again to the parent

10867575
onkeyup	onkeydown
there you will find onkeylongpress as well as onkeydown and onkeyup

10867575
onkeyup	onkeydown
if you are having trouble distinguishing single click from long click you will need to use onkeydown and onkeyup and check the duration of the click

10867575
onkeyup	onkeydown
esentially you will start a timer in the onkeydown and check the time in the onkeyup

10867577
intersect	contains
the problem - to me - seems that the index is for the standard pg set-based array operators not necessarily optimized for finding one element of an array but rather where one array contains another intersect with another - for me it s counter-intuitive that size-wise and speed-wise such a wide solution is correct for such a narrow problem

10867577

10869897

udp	tcp
you didn t mention if the socket was tcp or udp

10870382
post	get
or if you need to invoke the action everytime when the enduser reopens reloads the get request do the job in the post constructor or prerenderview listener method of the request view scoped backing bean instead

10870395
implements	extends
in principle the same solution could be applied to annotations though extends the annotation driver is a little more complicated because it doesn t simply read metadata by reading one file in one go and converting it to an array but makes numerous requests to the annotation reader which means implements this structure would be trickier

10870445
inherited	properties
if you have the derived entity properties in a separate table you must specify the table name for this entity table-per-type tpt inherited mapping otherwise ef will put all derived entities into the same table as the base entity by default table-per-hierarchy tph inherited mapping

on my cpu and toolchain combo 32 bit math data access is faster than 16 bit access and the display is 16 bit rgb565 so some of the framebuffer ops are a bit slower than what they could have been some of them use memcpy memmove and memset which takes care of data alignment etc..

another option would be to use something like lighttpd as the proxy and have it decide whether to pass things along to apache or to tornado but does this kind of setup make sense

10873691
sin	sqrt
in fact a bit of effort will give us the value for sin pi 12 as sqrt 2 sqrt 3 - 1 4

10873691
sin	sqrt
sin pi 4 is computed as a double but then vpa sees it as a number that is the same as a double precision version of sqrt 2 2

10873704
vim	emacs
i ve been using vim for some time and i feel that i m finally becoming somehow fluent with it but some of the feature listings videos and other stuff i ve seen particularly tim visher s vimgolf in emacs series really convinced me to give emacs a try

how should modern browsers size either type of svg image that states just their aspect ratio as per their viewbox and where the parent html document just has either but not both of width or height given

10874763

super	self
in your second example super new and self new end up calling the same method defined somewhere in the behavior hierarchy because that s the closest method definition of new in both cases

10879417
getter	setter
my reply has been when -in the future- i need to do so i will provide the getter and setter

10879417
getter	setter
the objection about incapsulation that some may raise is not really a valid one providing getter and setter breaks incapsulation in the same manner plus you have additional lines of useless code

10879417
getter	setter
bugs may also lay in getter and setter

10879417
getter	setter
thus this logic doesn t need to be in a setter getter

10879417
getter	setter
you need the getter an setter

10879417
getter	setter
i suppose that the need of getter setter is mostly cultural

10879495
width	height
you need to know the size width and height of your input pdf having the three pages stitched side-by-side into one

10879495
width	height
whose width and height are

10879495
width	height
so in order to get the width of a any single page constituting the input.pdf we need to divide being known the height 841 points 1785 by 3 595

10879548
listview	gridview
i m trying to avoid having 5 listview with individual adapters so the idea is to have gridview which will have 5 columns representing week schedule and to attach my cursoradapter to it

10879560
config	ini
it makes more sense to factor out config and use a simple ini file which uses simple key-value pairs for config parameters

10879560
versioning	upgrade
they are intelligent to not override any changed config on versioning upgrade etc

10879560
versioning	upgrade
so you do not have to worry about resetting config parameters after versioning upgrade of package

10879560
versioning	upgrade
user should not expect a config reset after versioning upgrade

10879728
width	height
i would like to avoid fixed width height of the table or any element so absolute positioning everything is not acceptable solution

10879729
width	height
you should give width height to container having background image make it display block same as the image width height e.g priser width should be 100

google-chrome	safari
in case you compiled for several browsers but then run devmode with a module only for gecko1_8 then the devmode will use the property provider found in the to determine the actual user agent being used woul dbe safari for google-chrome and will compare it with the one determined from the module hard-coded here to gecko1_8 and will then warn you that they don t match and as such that you app might dysfunction the code will use domimplmozilla for instance whereas domimplsafari should have been used in google-chrome

10880417
free	malloc
in the end i have decided not to use tcmalloc and instead optimize the application code directly this means removing the allocations from the inner loops to avoid the malloc free lock contentions

10880440

10881361
user-controls	tabcontrol
the problem with this solution is that relative-sized user-controls s hosted by the tabcontrol now gets thousaunds of pixels wider than they are supposed to because the scrollviewer does not restrict their size

google-chrome	firefox
i ve also tried giving the cell the onclick and then focussing on the cell instead of the div but this doesn t work in google-chrome does in firefox though

10884286

10884530
mouseover	mousedown
- mousedown - mouseover

10884557
hide	show
instead you are comparing the control itself with the value of show or hide

10884600
hide	show
the last column is fixed and used to hide show columns like most of applications do by clicking it and showing a popup menu

10884605
client-side	server-side
if you want to send a file over network you should use tcp protocol because it guarantees that the data received at server-side will be the same sent on the client-side

10884605
udp	tcp
i think all known programming languages support tcp and udp connections

10884655
des	aes
it uses aes instead of the deprecated and weak des used in the other suggestion

10884712

so at this point i would like eclipse to auto-create the getter method without having to do it using the source - generate getter and setter menu

10884867
getter	setter
i saw this question how do you force eclipse to prompt you to create a getter and setter when it doesn t do it automatically which seems to imply that eclipse does this but i couldn t find where to configure that

10884867
getter	setter
is there some way to configure eclipse to automatically add setter getter when adding new private variable

10884916
post	get
well first of all a search form should use get rather than post a search is an idempotent operation that doesn t modify anything at server side

10884918
getter	setter
when you move your mouse above the name of the variable you can select create getter and setter for varname in the popup menu

10884924
put	get
any ideas how to get it to show what i put in the createattribute

10884931

i am targeting the arm and the toolchain is arm-linux-gnueabi binutils version 2.22

10884945
getter	setter
if i click on the warning sign the option to generate getter and setter for the field appears

10884963
getter	setter
i use a template to create artifacts like that all at once but i don t follow the same path--i m not sure a template solution would work if a getter or setter already existed since i m not sure you can check for the presence of a method and make template decisions based on that

10885206
pull	push
a possible setup is to have repo exposed to the world to which external contributors can push to or pull from

10885206
pull	push
second never push from within acme directly to that external repo mistakes are too easily done and you don t control at what pace pull are done

10885212
post	put
the fundamental difference between the post and put requests is

10885212
post	put
i usually look at post as it should be the uri that will handle the content of my request in most cases the params as form values and thus creating a new resource and put as the uri which is the subject of my request users 1234 a resource which already exists

sorting	filtering
such a projection is the only way to get the result in a single roundtrip to the database because eager loading with include doesn t support any filtering or sorting on the included child collections

10885617

now i would like to generify this solution by implements a handlerexceptionresolver instead so i don t have to copy paste the exceptionhandler to every controller or create a common parent controller that the other controllers can extends

10885805
width	height
you can implement an algorithm go calculate the sizes of the bitmaps and release older bitmaps that would push you over an arbitrary memory amount bitamp memory is about width height 4 + object size which should be nominal

10885813
capitalization	uppercase
regarding tag capitalization a little history may help in understanding why the trend has shifted from uppercase to lowercase in html4 elements were typically written in uppercase however according to w3schools the w3c recommended they be written in lowercase although i can t find a reference

you do not need that cast at all java will convert chars to int implicitly

10886158
int	double
based on the frame pointer offsets i m guessing the structure contains 2 int s and 1 long or double

10886159

10886185
postgresql	mysql
i m in the process of moving a django v1.1 project from mysql to postgresql fun

10886217
int	chars

int	chars
it s not the int value you expect it to be but is in fact the ascii value of the chars

10886312

since it s not clear what the last numeric part of your source date string represents my example doesn t deal with it - you may need to extend the according getter and setter logic

10886809

all that synthesize does is generate the accessor setter and getter for your properties and create an instance variable with the same name

these are slightly different from amro s solution as the first reads in a 1d format number 1 chars int and returns a cell array c that can be converted using a much simpler cell2mat command

10887268

remember that warnings are sent to stderr whereas your output is going to stdout

10887317
pull	push
i would like to know whether there is ability to consume tasks from task queue push or pull queues when we want by calling a consume-like method

10887374
min	max
if you want to define den in terms of 0.1 you can do so but you need to change the corresponding equations in min and max

10887384

10887584

this code works every time with google-chrome and firefox and works about 95 of the time with ie8 required support

10887642
pull	push
i think you misunderstood how push and pull task queues works

10887642
pull	push
in both queues you add tasks to the queue but while in push queue the system will dequeue the task and assign it to the apropriate handler in pull queue you need to dequeue the task s using lease_tasks and handle the task

notice that your negative margin must be half the width of your div

10888052
width	height
try giving a fixed width to your main container and set the overflow hidden and then set the inner div with a fixed height and set the overflow-y to scroll

10888060
updatepanel	contentplaceholder
if you have a textbox that sits in a panel that sits in an updatepanel that s in a webusercontrol that s in a contentplaceholder that s in a page then all it takes is one of them not to have a proper id attribute in order keep the connection between textbox and page

10888091
getter	setter
you are not utilizing the proper getter setter methods generated by the property synthesis

10888152
getter	setter
now because of automatic setter and getter we fail to catch the error because any method the user names is valid -- even if that user made a mistake

10888152
getter	setter
it simply creates the object and passes it along to my getter setter methods

10888152
getter	setter
instead my methods foo and bar are both setter and getter

leiningen	vimclojure
this tutorial is up-to-date as of time of writing and helped me get vimclojure set up with leiningen in osx

10888340
integer	unsigned
generally speaking you don t consider redesigning your data structure so that inserts deletes do not happen in this fashion or else use a larger integer type bigint unsigned is 8 bytes so can go up to 2 64 or 10 19

10888350
width	margin
without giving fixed positioning can you try giving a margin and if you insist using fixed positioning then will you try using media query to detect the view port width and then giving a different right positioning

10888362
nfa	dfa
when we converting from nfa to dfa there may be result like the image below.

10888494
for-loop	arrays
i am trying to store the positions of the circles in an arrays and then checking that arrays each time another circle is created in the for-loop if the randomly created x and y is too close to a already created circle it should keep getting a new random x and y until it isnt too close to an already created circle

10888497
google-chrome	safari
i have tested your demo on safari 5.1.7 and google-chrome 19 and it works well

10888681
bash	zsh
after a little more digging around i found a solution to the same problem for bash that looks to work just as well for zsh

10888685
width	height
i don t know what the exact situation is as i m not familiar with the unity javascript interface you are using but i think there s a good chance that you need to specify an integer width and height for the player whereas your calculation is producing a non-integral number

10888693
cpython	ironpython
ptvs is compatible with ironpython and cpython which are python distributions where you run your code

10888693
cpython	ironpython
cpython is the traditional python distribution while ironpython is an alternate that allows you to run python over .net and allows you to user other .net libraries on your applications

safari seems to be my only exception for mac users but i m concerned that they too will follow suit with google-chrome and firefox

10888727
post	put	post	get	put	get
web browsers only support get and post so if you are building a web site there is no need for put or delete

10888819
super	extends
no built in solution mind you but they re super easy to extends and jmxmp is simple tcp socket based rather than rmi so this type of customization would be trivial

10888848
cvs	rcs
if the v contains a useful description append it to the commit message for revision 1.1 cvs2hg ignores the description - but lots of our cvs files actually came from rcs where it was easy to put the initial commit message into the description field by mistake

10888848
cvs	rcs
running cvs log on each individual v file - parsing the output and using rcs -m to change this history

10888848

10888986
hide	show
show the progress indicator before your dispatch_async and remove or hide it your main queue block where you set the image

10888999
folder	directory
this leads to a lot of folder all over the place under every directory we have an .exe in that has been localized

10889006
cvs	rcs
of course on a large commit someone might complain that there are 100+ nearly identical log messages one for each file and just like a big rcs cvs commit people will update and get something between the start of the commit and the finish but then you can tell them about the problems you have and the solution you were forced to resort to in order to get work done despite poor management and support

10889025

10889157
super	self
after fixing a bug in the constructor so that it calls super wordcountmapper self

10889158
width	height
of course you can coerce div.a and div.b s width in css and don t check for max width with jquery then you will have to determine only max height in each pair

10889174
backtracking	greedy
it works by greedy matching everything up to the start of the end-of-tag the first then backtracking to match the nearest last then capturing everything after that slash the into group 1 so that you can use it during the replacement step

10889179
getter	setter
java s coding conventions and java bean standards say that member names should start with a lower case character and provide getter setter access

10889198
post	get
the problem was in my routes file it s a rails app i was only get ing redirect and wasn t handling post which is what happens in a page tab

10889269
button	checkbox	checkbox	dropdownlistfor
a typical page may have many textbox controls radio button groups checkbox groups dropdownlistfor and images

10889296
getter	setter
the extra things those methods do depend on whether you write custom versions of them the setter and the getter or use synthesize to create them and if you use synthesize what attributes you apply in the property declaration

10889304
post	get
not ideal and not polished enough yet for a blog post but should get you started

10889317

but here you would have to convert the decimal output from filemodes to octal so that chmod understands it

10889357
google-chrome	firefox
when i pull the site up in firefox or google-chrome everything works fine

10889357

note that each sequence also descends as i m interested in combinations not permutation

10889379
put	get
i think if i can just get the very core of the recursion working and put the values of all the objects to the screen so i can trace it line by line i think i can move ahead but between the logic and the syntax i m at a stand still

10889383
qgridlayout	qwidget
how can i move the qwidget in a qgridlayout so that it can hide

10889409

somehow the post parameters don t get recognized and i get the response

10889455

or you can make some of the show and hide have a longer duration show 2000 for instance

10889478
opera	google-chrome
on google-chrome ie9 opera the code below works fine

10889489
ubuntu	linux
this works on ubuntu linux

10889504
inherited	properties
also you can take the opposite approach first create your object that inherited your methods and then extend it with the properties that are assigned in the binary.parse function

10889504
inherited	properties
if this approach works it is certainly better than my original solution above since here the resulting object inherited your methods as opposed to above where each instance contains the methods as own properties

10889507
folder	directory
finally right click on the folder you added and you should have an option that says convert to application or create virtual directory or something similar

10889519
vtk	itk
i m trying to read a nrrd file by itk and show it by vtk

10889519
vtk	itk
but i have some trouble on convert itk to vtk

put	get
you will need to setup views for each of the taxonomy - as this is a good way to get a block that you can put onto the sidebar

10889656
put	get
if you want to get fancy you can put in some kind of environment detection that suits you and import the appropriate windows osx or linux file

10889720
button	checkbox
it only removes one checkbox out of many and 2 button there are 3 button

10889721

when i use the profiling instrumentation it doesn t tell me there s any zombies leaks etc.

10889729
pop-up	dialog
this works fine but the ipad sees it as a pop-up and either blocks it or throws up a warning dialog which is not acceptable to my client

10889752
post	put	jobs	cron
other verbs put post delete are not supported by cron jobs

10889780
rss	feed
i m populating a jquery datepicker calendar with xml from an rss feed

10889784
client-side	server-side
also your the client-side validation can be loaded with the page since these rules have been pre-defined in your server-side code and you won t need all those ajax requests

10889787
udp	tftp
to send large amounts of data using udp consider using a udp-based transfer protocol such as tftp

10889793
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
each one establishes and manages a objectinputstream objectoutputstream with the other

10889802
width	height
alternatively if you just want something simple try using some easy-to-measure values like height width total number of pixels inside the contours how many strokes you cross along vertical or horizontal lines etc

10889808
mouseleave	mouseenter
move your mouseleave from mouseenter event and it will work

10889814
clang	llvm
tested both with clang version 3.1 trunk llvm trunk 155821

10889820
sorting	grouping
3 disable numerical sorting in windows explorer in the settings section of the grouping policy editor

10889844
width	height
make sure your uiwebview has the autoresizingmask set to be flexible in height and width

10889849
cpu	processors
you should make these determinations from direct empirical measurements or from the cpu s pipeline specifications rather than assumptions about what processors should predict because implementations are so different

10889867
chown	chmod
seems to work except by the fact that all the files are owned by root and i don t have permission to write on the folder neither chmod nor chown seems to be working

10889883
hide	show
so when a user changes to the standard radio button and raw radio button jquery simply show those possessing those classes and hide anything that doesn t

10889908
jboss	weblogic
env windows 7 jboss weblogic app server

10889923

10890069
net-snmp	pysnmp

the cookie s expiration date is also correct in firefox and ie9 however when i run this in google-chrome the expiration date is always set to sun 07 dec 1969 03 28 36 gmt

10890159
portrait	landscape
in this case i want to keep the same size for portrait and landscape so the app can look fine

10890200
submit	submission
if it s available then it will be processed locally and the form won t submit though submission should really be based on successful completion of the actions

10890209
post	get
i m working on a high-traffic asp.net website and around once per 30 minutes we get a post request that triggers a httpexception request timed out

10890214

to intercept all keyboard input and also mouse if you want it check out the quartz events api

10890231
requestfactory	gwt
i have simple gwt 2.4.0 requestfactory application which fails with client side exception when fire method calls

10890244
hash	salt
i have been trying to learn about hash and salt stored in a users table withing a mysql db

10890244
hash	salt
i have looked through and seen about storing the salt and hash seperately and together

10890256
hash	salt
some options are to append the salt to the hash or stored as its own field

10890256
hash	salt
then when the user goes to login you grab his password break it into the hash and the salt and use your password generation function with the salt from the password instead of a random salt to determine if it matches the password in the db

10890271
hash	salt
the point is that you want to be able to repeat the hash with the same salt so you can be very sure that the input was the same without having to store the sensitive input

10890279
ember.js	javascriptmvc
the application uses ember.js as javascriptmvc framework and i have managed to implement the basic update of collection following this stock ticker example

10890293
content-length	content-type	chunked	transfer-encoding
the headers will tell you not only what kind of stream is being sent via the content-type header but also how the data is being framed content-length transfer-encoding chunked something specific to the particular content-type etc

10890456
portrait	landscape
now what seems to be necessary is to have all the tab bar s view controllers claim to support autorotation to portrait and landscape

10890456
uiview	subviews
2 in firstviewcontroller.xib i set the main parent uiview to not autoresize subviews

10890462
innodb	myisam
note - the only restriction is you need to put the tables on the innodb engine which is slightly different from the default myisam engine checkout a summary here and a more extensive version here

10890489
opera	google-chrome
i can in opera google-chrome etc

10890565
folder	directory
this will allow you to find all the users that match joe in the directory or in a contacts folder in the user s mailbox

10890626
width	height
set the image width to 100 and leave the height undefined

10890631
dictionary	map
however you can t have a dictionary laid-out the way you want because a dictionary key can only map to one thing

10890649
xlwt	xlutils
i have made a windows application using pygtk xlrd xlwt xlutils

10890687
hash	md5
still even if some copying and padding was required beforehand each individual field could eventually be hash using md5 sha-1 or whatever and those hash values could be similarly combined so this complication doesn t really categorically rule out the approach you re interested in

10890687
hash	md5
this situation of knowing that all your keys map to distinct hash table buckets is known as perfect hashing - as per your question title - a good general-purpose hash like md5 is not a perfect hash and indeed it makes no sense to talk about perfect hashing without knowing the complete set of possible keys

10890709
post	put
in most of the cases the uri is decided by the server and hence post go for creation and put usually for update

10890709
put	get
final thing is like get both delete and put are idempotent means how many times the client send the requests serially the state of the server should be changed to same as in the first request

10890763
width	height
from here it would be a matter of scaling the grid coordinates to some t seconds in width and height and then set up a normalizing method that can feed leaflet latlng coordinates that it appears to need

10890788
move	drag
in the mousedown begin an nstimer set for an appropriate guard time not so long that people will accidentally move the pointer and not so short that you ll trigger before the user drag in order to call you back later to trigger the popover

10890824
width	height
just move the scrollable class to the parent and remove the height 100 width 100 and change the overflow-y auto to simply overflow auto

10890833
pentaho	olap
add another layer to your application by using olap multi-dimensional views of your data like pentaho and then querying that layer instead of your original data

10890861
width	margin
try upping your width to match the jquery slider above it as well as setting an auto margin to horizontally centre it

10890929
width	height
.fixed-size specifies a width but not a height

10890940
put	get
but i don t want to put table into because it will query to get data and it will take a long time to finish

10890942
migrate	upgrade
my research indicates paypal migrate their data center recently and has planned downtime for database upgrade but it seems to me they just don t have their systems under control at this time

10891012
int	chars
in the original code the variable id in the struct was an int but i changed it to a chars instead of number i wanted to use the stock ticker as the key then i started to the following errors

10891023
primefaces	richfaces
i am planning to use primefaces richfaces as jsf framework along with xhtml

10891023
jsf	seam
i was thinking of using an integration framework like seam with jsf for my ui.war but it seems overkill given that my ui.war will have just jsf and probably a framework like jersey to invoke rest interface

10891023
jsf	seam
if i was using jsf ejbs etc in one single war then using a seam framework would have been really useful

10891023
jsf	seam
but since i just have jsf in my ui.war do u think that i should use any integration seam spring framework in my ui.war and if yes which one

10891070
config	ini
the config for using the firebug+firephp profiler in an ini config file will look something like this

10891070
implements	extends
if we take a look at the zend_db_profiler_firebug it s really quite a simple piece of code it extends zend_db_profiler overriding some methods to implements the firebug+firephp logging logic

10891093
strlen	strcpy
the residual warnings about strlen are hidden by the hash_add_str macro but likely come from the same problem as the strcpy warnings did mdash

10891134
width	height
to draw pie chart you should use fillarc x y width height starting angle arc angle

10891160
submit	submission
if you call your function on the form submit instead of the button click it should solve your issue as returning false here stops the form from submission

10891188

i am trying to automate visiting a web site by using webrequest and webclient

10891203
for-loop	arrays

10891394
post	get
i try ajax get post to get the response header location and it always get null value

10891396
children	parent
any one parent guardian can have multiple children and any child can have multiple guardians

if it is so then i have to apply the permission to the app_data folder again in order to let the iis worker process create the directory again via that iis user account

10891463
rss	feed
i am looking to have rss feed which are dynamically generated that i can do but are based on user preference settings

10891463
rss	feed
so for example if a user wanted to see in their rss only pictures with certain tags their rss feed would show them

10891498

after submission the application the status it is showing at the in-app purchases is ready to submit at the column of manage in-app purchases field in the submitted application

10891502

i have the java project along with its some jar war file

10891517
ant	maven
you can also use ant or maven to start your project in bash you can run ant xxx or maven xxxx to start the jvm

10891553

while you can use the command line to build and run the java programs using javac and java commands you should consider using maven or ant or any other build manager for your project

10891575
button	checkbox
then i check the checkbox of the the 2nd task of the 1st goal rename it updated task #2 and click the update button

10891628
google-chrome	firefox
my problem is these forms are not loading in firefox but working fine in ie8 and google-chrome

10891652
junit	testng
so you can use junit or testng and add these methods to invoke selserver start and selenium server shutdown

10891670
post	get
all the handlers are there with what looks like correct post get methods

10891681
mouseleave	mouseenter
that s because your title variable is within the mouseenter function but you re using it inside mouseleave

10891731
getter	setter
i find that using a public getter and private setter along with a method to set the value with additional logic as required is a good approach

10891740
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this works fine on firefox and google-chrome but safari and opera don t like it

10891740
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome this works properly - success is called for each of my ajax responses

10891740
opera	safari
in safari and opera however success is never called only complete

10891774
google-chrome	safari
but that not work in google-chrome and safari

10891792
folder	directory
the directory are folder references and not groups

10891800
hash	md5
it maintains a loop until the value is different that means something on the folder happened thus after 10 secs when the md5 calculates the hash it should be different then the code ends

if expiration equals permanent then the button should be disabled and the checkbox checked

10898493

getter	setter
what you can t do is write a bare java class that magically is interpreted as scala getter and setter

10899079
getter	setter
the reason is that scala embeds information into the class file that it requires for its getter and setter are there zero parameter blocks or one empty parameter block--a distinction which is not preserved on the jvm or in java

10899079
getter	setter
the other alternative of course is to provide an implicit conversion from the java class to one that has a getter setter that references the real methods on the java class

10899079
getter	setter
one could argue that interpreting java-defined getter setter pairs as if they were scala ones if the classfile does not explicitly say it s from scala is a good candidate for a feature enhancement to improve java interoperability.
