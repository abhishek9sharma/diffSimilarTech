80225
verilog	vhdl
i had the pleasure of learning both vhdl and verilog and becoming productive in both within a week from what was almost a dare from such a hardware engineer despite my diploma saying electrical engineer my job title is software engineer

80281
division	multiplication
also i ve found that it is best to have macros or functions for multiplication and especially division or you quickly get unreadable code

80311
srp	principles
test driven development done right should make developers highly aware of design pitfalls like tight coupling violations of dry don t repeat yourself violations of srp single responsibility principles etc

80314
firefox	safari
it generates completely separate javascript for each major browser family ie firefox safari etc.

public	protected
edit2 maybe you can map it as a protected ilist string and convert to public ilist eaction just as i do with a simple property

80531
vb6	vba
with vba vb6 you can just declare a byte array and assign a string value to it and it will be converted for you

opera	firefox
this is not a problem in opera or firefox only internet explorer

80577
geany	kdevelop	codeblocks	kdevelop	codeblocks	anjuta	anjuta	kdevelop	anjuta	geany

80859
short	base
in short this means i can t use the trick of going through the activerecord base connection

80882

81113
qsort	bsearch
i think you should look at the c standard functions qsort and bsearch for inspiration

81145
rss	feed
you could have a look at the nuclblog project as that has the capability to generate an rss feed for the blog entries it maintains

81171
inherited	properties
if someone want to use your abstract class he will have to implement a class that inherited from it and explicitly implement the abstract methods and properties but can chose to not override the virtual methods and properties

81223
alloca	malloc
btw i would discourage the use of alloca since stack tends to be much more limited than heap use malloc instead

81224
apache	lighttpd
i don t think that s possible right now since mod_dav_svn is an apache module and afaik there is no lighttpd module available

81238

superclass	subclassing
one superclass knows how to rip apart the class hierarchy but relies on its subclassing to actually do something useful with it

81409
int	boolean
no you must be thinking of the operator which yields a boolean expression of type int in c and indeed bool in c++

81411
int	chars
since c doesn t have a real bitfield type the expression here an assignment expression usually gets the type of the bit field s base type in your example unsigned int but it is possible for a compiler to use a smaller type internally in this case probably unsigned chars because it s big enough for one bit

81435
hash	salt
you ll have to add some security to the token ttl a hash a salt

81455
octree	quadtree
however to answer your original question about octree quadtree 2 n-trees in n dimensions you start with a hyper -cube that contains the area of space that you are interested in

81497
mp3	wav
it is a little bit slow to transform mp3 files to wav and then to he-aac

81526

81527
cos	sin
calculate the size of the chord sin of cos -1 of ratio of normal length to radius of sphere

81563
bazaar	svn
ddaa.myopenid.com mentioned it in passing but i think it s worth mentioning again bazaar can read and write to remote svn repositories

81574
eruby	erb
as jordi said though it depends what context you want to run this in - if you re literally going to use templates like the one you listed eruby would probably work better but i d guess you re actually going to be passing variables to the template in which case you want erb

81622
int	chars
in particular i have tried various compilers which give me sizeof int instead of sizeof chars even if i apply this to a bitfield with only has a single bit

81644
terminate	timeout
if i run this after locking the table on the database i get the message that the timeout is hit but i don t know how to then get the mysql_query line to terminate

81654
boost	stl
the stl and boost symbols are name-mangled because of the namespaces they re in

81675

81686
folder	directory
the app itself writes some files and creates some directory to its app folder

81728
int	double
the java language always promotes arguments of arithmetic operators to int long float or double

81765
put	get
the best way of doing it natively is to get into a final variable check for null and put it back in with a 1

81779
folder	directory
in nt4 you can create that folder in your installation directory and in windows 98 and below it doesn t matter anyways due to these systems not having a permission system anyways

81784

82128
teamcity	nant
alternatively since we actually use nant to drive the build process we use jetbrains teamcity is there a way to get nant to tell me the time taken for each step

82154
width	height
i would use flash if i m trying to add sound into a webpage you can embed a flash document with no width or height so it will be invisible but still play noise

in the early days of sharepoint 2007 beta i ve come across the ability to customize the template used to emit the rss feed from lists

82215
public	protected
personally i like to make all inheritance public so as to avoid wasting time with should i make inheritance relation protected or private discussions

82304
instances	transient
loggers are not serializable so you must use transient when storing them in instances fields

82304
serializable	deserialization
if you want to restore the logger after deserialization you can store the level string indide your object which does get serializable

82379
wav	ogg
compressed wav files are always tricky - i always try and use an alternative container format in this case such as ogg or wma files

82407
accessor	properties
this feature lets you write classes that can be mapped over the top of native javascript objects to easily provide accessor methods for properties of those objects and other extended functionality

82468
perforce	cvs
in perforce p4 sync -n doesn t give output like cvs -n -q update

82480
min	max
you can use max and min widths as well as set percentages for cell sizes or hard code cell width s but dynamically growing cells work fine for 1 row it s the next row below it that won t match up

82552
instances	transient
usually logger fields are declared static but if you need it to be an instances field just declare it transient as its usually done for any non-serializable field

82573
rss	feed
after you customize the content query web part to display the fields and content you want you can set up the web part to emit a really simple syndication rss feed of that content.

82734

83497
subtraction	addition
the benefit is that you can reformat the time however you like including am pm adjustments for timezone addition subtraction etc

83516
postgresql	mysql
there s possibly a phobia of stored procedures with mysql partly due to not being overwhelmingly powerful compared to postgresql and even mssql mysqls stored procedures are greatly lacking

83519
vim	bbedit
concerning an ide i use either dreamweaver or bbedit on os x or vim

83648

83670
dateadd	datepart
use datepart and dateadd to do this

83681
button	checkbox
for every input field radio button checkbox and textinput you should have

83725
width	height
you may find it happens if you are using min- width height or max- width height

83754
bash	zsh
you can probably do all of these things in bash but my experience with zsh is that if there s something i want to do i can probably find it in zsh-lovers

83771
post	get
the idea is to get some value to limit the query at the last post that we need in this case the publishdategmt column will suffice and then limit the second query with that value instead of take

83809
srp	principles
i typically don t expose my business data entities across the wire since i like to adhere to the single responsibility principles srp

83814
firefox	safari
first i develop the site using commonly accepted css to look good in safari and firefox 3

83876
haskell	ocaml
f# stems from the ml family of languages and has a core language compatible with that of ocaml though also draws from c# and haskell

83928
stringbuilder	stringwriter
you can use a stringwriter but it s still writing into a stringbuilder

83946
google-chrome	firefox
a lot of app stylist things don t translate over to firefox well and the webcombo blows up horribly in the new google-chrome chromium browser

83952
vmware	virtualbox
also of note vmware forbids any type of benchmarking to be posted on the internet unless if they authorize the data you will not see any benchmarks that show vmware as slower than tech x the rumor mill states that you can see better performance with hyper-v xvm sun s enterprise version of virtualbox and xen

83995
invalidoperationexception	argumentexception
i ve frequently seen invalidoperationexception or argumentexception when the underlying cause is actually out of memory

84013
maven	cobertura
our team use pmd and cobertura actually our projects are maven projects and there is very simple to include plug ins for code analysis

84034
distance	polygons
what is the quickest speediest algorithim to find the the shortest distance between a red polygons and its nearest blue polygons

84034
distance	polygons
bear in mind that it is not a simple case of taking the points that make up the vertices of the polygons as values to test for distance as they may not necessarily be the closest points

84041
versioning	upgrade
update move to separate spindle or upgrade sql server versioning as gulzar aptly suggests

84122
unix	solaris
it s essentially a rewrite of the .net runtime the equivalent of the java virtual machine that works on linux solaris mac os x windows and unix

84135

computing the frã chet distance between simple polygons

84149
tapestry	struts
i ve made extensive use of jsp and the various associated frameworks jstl struts tapestry etc as well as more comprehensive frameworks not related to jsp gwt openlaszlo

84179
unix	solaris
there is one interesting initiative called mono which offers .net support on linux solaris mac os x windows and unix

84187
superclass	subclassing
one very good use case is so you can declare the logger in a superclass and use it in all subclassing the only downside is that logs from the superclass are attributed to the subclassing but it is usually easy to see that

84239
distance	polygons
for each vertex in the red polygons compute the distance to each vertex in the blue polygons and find the closest hint compare distance 2 so you don t need the sqrt

84307
quicksort	shellsort
regarding sorting usually quicksort is hard to beat in performance an optimized one that cuts off recursion if size goes below 7 items and switches to something like insertionsort maybe shellsort

84307
distance	polygons
thus i guess the question is how to quickly calculate the distance between two polygons after all you need to make this computation 50 times

84307
distance	polygons
minimum polygons distance in 2d space

84335
solaris	aix
those run-time libraries handle the memory management calls to the os in a os independent consistent syntax and those run-time libraries are responsible for making malloc and new work consistently between oses such as linux windows solaris aix etc..

84335
free	malloc
calls to malloc and free may occur in any order

84371
distance	polygons
now you can collect say the 5-10 closest polygons to the red one find the distance center to center subtract the radius sort the list and take the top 5 and then do a much more exhaustive routine

84438
distance	polygons
testing the distance between rectangles is easier than testing the distance between polygons and you can immediately eliminate any polygons that are more than nearest_rect + its_diagonal away possibly you can refine that even more

84447
collabnet	svn
if you use the svn protocol and use svnserve can be setup as a windows service that auto starts on your server it should take you 1.5-3 hours to setup depending on how much you want to read see collabnet for the windows package download

84547
imperative	declarative
i believe that techniques to declarative express side effects in an object oriented framework will allow compilers to decompose imperative statements into their functional relationships

84713
pull	push
i can t speak for anything but .net 2003 parser where i did some informal performance tests on push vs pull xslt code

translation	localization
your question could use some clarification as to exactly what aspects of translation localization you need help with

84859
rxtx	usbserial
i m using the rxtx library over usbserial on a linux distro

84940
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
just the mainline ones opera firefox ie and safari

84940
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
in my experience opera firefox and safari all behave similarly when it comes to basic stuff positioning floats divs etc and it s just ie you ll have to tweak for

postgresql	informix	postgresql	mysql
sqlinform is an automatic sql code formatter for all major databases oracle sql server db2 udb sybase informix postgresql mysql etc with many formatting options

84960
jpql	hql
i really like the ability to write my hql or jpql and view the generated sql real time

84974
union	distinct
in most cases what you really want to say is union all as it does not do duplicate elimination think select distinct between sets which can result in quite a bit of savings in terms of execution time

85010
restrict	shared
the code is riddled with classes which contain nothing more than public shared attributes variables and methods functions the result of which restrict the application from opening more than one project at a time

85021

85223
integer	fractions
in general we have the integer part before the decimal point the fractions part after the decimal point and the exponent

85223
integer	fractions	multiplying	subtract
i m thinking of multiplying the integer part with 10 n where n is the number of digits in the fractions part and then adding the fractions part to the integer part and subtract n from the exponent

85271
turbogears	cherrypy
i use cherrypy as my web server which comes bundled with turbogears and i simply run multiple instances of the cherrypy web server on different ports bound to localhost

85277
vim	emacs
in the vim and emacs terminal apps the color schemes look horrid

85372
subtract	add
you can add subtract that to from any date type and you get the right answer

85386
opera	safari
the claim in this thinkvitamin article that opera and safari webkit browsers don t cache urls with

85386
opera	safari
what may have confused the author of the thinkvitamin article is the fact that hitting enter in the address location bar in safari and opera results in different behavior for urls with query string in them

85386
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
opera and safari behave just like ie and firefox when it comes to caching embedded linked images and stylesheets and scripts in web pages - regardless of whether they have

85402
ienumerable	ienumerator
iterators aren t exactly translatable to the .net way but they are roughly replaced by ienumerable t and ienumerator t

85402
ienumerable	icollection
if you do want to control iteration or make the collection a bit more custom have your collection implement the ienumerable t and or icollection t interfaces as well

85414
vmware	virtualbox
i ve been using vmware for a while and am very happy with it but i would like to compare it with virtualbox

85414
vmware	virtualbox
how do you port a virtual machine from vmware to virtualbox and keep all the capabilities intact

85416
integer	fractions
if the number of bits in the mantissa or fractions is larger than the number of bits in your integer type then you ll possibly lose precision when someone types in a number such as

85422
vim	emacs
in addition if there are dev s using emacs or vim you probably want to add and # #

85431
folder	directory
and don t forget to give it rights to all files and folder in your virtual directory

85452
solaris	aix
i ve developed on numerous multi-platform c++ apps the largest being 1.5m lines of code and running on 7 platforms -- aix hp-ux pa-risc hp-ux itanium solaris linux windows os x

85477
vmware	virtualbox
virtualbox uses a couple of schemes for networking that are a bit different than vmware

85491
ienumerable	ilist
you are most often better of using the most general usable type in this case the ilist or even better the ienumerable interface so that you can switch the implementation conveniently at a later time

85500
updatepanel	formview
i have an updatepanel with a trigger pointed to an event on a formview control

85500
updatepanel	formview
when the updatepanel refreshes it needs values from the formview control so that on the server it can use them to query the database

85511
put	get
however if you re timing some hardware for example some algorithm you put in the gpu then time.clock will get rid of this time and time.time is the only solution left

85511
factors	mean
note whatever the method used the timing will depend on factors you cannot control when will the process switch how often ... this is worse with time.time but exists also with time.clock so you should never run one timing test only but always run a series of test and look at mean variance of the times

85532
jsf	seam
my environment is seam 2.0.1.ga jboss 4.2.2.ga and i m using jsf

85536
profiling	benchmarking
however if you re timing the execution of a block of code for benchmarking profiling purposes you should take a look at the timeit module

the mysql one was more stable than the postgresql one

85807
versioning	upgrade
it is not in my power to upgrade to a newer versioning of ie corporate bureaucracy

85817
width	margin
most of the layout problems you ll have will probably be caused by internet explorer s wrong interpretation of the box model you can avoid this by never setting a width and margin or padding at the same time

85817
width	margin
this might seem annoying but it s not just apply the padding or margin to the content which is inside your element which has a width set

85852
svnkit	subclipse
on a recent install i tried the beta drivers i have eclipse ganymede and svnkit pure java svnkit v1.2.0.4502 that you can optionally install with subclipse and they worked pretty much straight out of the box although a colleague found he had to go through a few hoops to make sure eclipse installed them and their dependancies correctly

inherited	properties
edit bitwiseplatypus is correct that unless you use the hasownproperty method you will get properties that are inherited - however i don t know why anyone familiar with object-oriented programming would expect anything less

86014
inherited	properties
now that said hasownproperty is useful for filtering but we don t need to sound a warning as if there is something dangerous in getting inherited properties

86014
inherited	properties
besides what if i design things in such a way that i use prototypes during the construction of my objects and yet have code that iterates over the properties of the object and i want all inherited properties

86029
maven	pom.xml
also find projects that are utilizing maven and look into their pom.xml configurations learn more about what is possible with maven

86030
put	get
it took some editing to remove control declarations as they get put in a generated file and conflict with the decompiled base class but nothing a few hours didn t cure

86052
inherited	properties
while svn 1.8 adds the concept of inherited properties the svn ignore properties itself is ignored in non-immediate descendant directories

86052
inherited	properties
this is similar to svn ignore except it makes use of svn 1.8 s inherited properties feature

86083
mp3	ogg
convert compressed to to raw audio data and if possible raw audio data to mp3 ogg aac .

86083
mp3	wav

86173
cpython	pypy
pypy is an experimental interpreter compiler that may one day supplant cpython but for now is more of a testbed for new ideas

86175
temp	tmp
i checked the tmp and temp environment variables and also and and they re identical

86200
temp	tmp
if iis is executing check the values in registry for tmp and temp under

86211
daemons	systemd
queue d systemd and daemons either wake periodically and copy or run as services

86212
vbscript	vb6
since the question didn t specify .net this should work in vbscript or vb6

86256
designer	design-view
when i say design-view i mean that i right+click on the file and choose view designer - this gives me access to the toolbox and tabs for designer split and code-view which is the view i primarily work in

86260
lisp	prolog
i think in addition to your mainstream language you want to have a scripting language high productivity for smaller and one-off tasks and a language with a seriously different cognitive style haskell prolog lisp etc.

86306
inherited	properties
to avoid including inherited properties in your enumeration check hasownproperty

86306
inherited	properties
edit i disagree with jasonbunting s statement that we don t need to worry about enumerating inherited properties

86306
inherited	properties
there is danger in enumerating over inherited properties that you aren t expecting because it can change the behavior of your code

86325
stdout	stderr
note the abort message will be written to stderr as opposed to puts which will write to stdout

86427
cpython	ironpython
ironpython and jython use the runtime environment for .net or java and with that comes just in time compilation and a garbage collector different from the original cpython

86427
cpython	ironpython
a downside in using jython or ironpython is that you cannot use native c modules they can be only used in cpython

86437
cvs	svn
viewvc provides a nice web interface to cvs or svn and is reasonably easy to setup

86497
jquery	scriptaculous
we can say that we re stuck with js but is it really so bad with jquery prototype scriptaculous mootools and all fantastic libraries

86499
integer	fractions
you cast the datetime into a float which represents the date as the integer portion and the time as the fractions of a day that s passed

86517
client-side	server-side
if there is a lack of seamlessness to your applications because the server-side and client-side are not communicating well then you might want to reconsider how you architect your applications

equals	gethashcode
if some other identity comparison is required you have to override both equals and gethashcode

86693
concave	convex
it works on convex and concave polygons

86693
distance	polygons
the distance between the polygons is at most r

86812
children	parent
how about root node with children but no parent node node with children and parent and leaf node with no children and parent

86812
children	parent
for example a single abstract class that can have child nodes if no children its a leaf if no parent its a root but this can change in its lifetime

86861
post	get
if you look at the comments of that post there are some ways to get around this but they re not very elegant

86865
children	parent
so you have nodes which have children and a parent and you have sectionnodes which are the roots of these special subtrees

86881
equals	gethashcode
when two object are the same the equals method returns true they must have the same value returned from gethashcode

86881
equals	gethashcode
if some other identity comparison is required you have to override both equals and gethashcode

86901
width	height
i have tried setting the rootpanel width and height to 100 and that still didn t work

86956
mouse	keyboard
think about the number of mouse keyboard clicks it takes a user to get to something

86980
width	height
however if you wrap your items in some sort of frameworkelement-derived object before adding them to the listbox you can use transformtovisual to get the relative size and use height and width to set the size of the item

87006
cvs	svn	accurev	cvs	accurev	svn
i ve used svn cvs clearcase base ucm ccc harvest but none of them can beat accurev s strengths

87042

i would look into using jax-rs java.net project jsr311 it is pretty simple to use it supports marshalling and unmarshalling objects to from xml out of the box

87214
mouse	keyboard
you ll normally only get mouse keyboard events to a window or control when it has focus

87221
post	get
so this post talked about how to actually implement url rewriting in an asp.net application to get friendly urls

87288
versioning	upgrade
can be difficult to upgrade and to keep current versioning available

87339
debian	linux
to find some best practices look how linux distro s debian write their init-scripts usually found in etc init.d

87360
public	protected
but otherwise protected should be avoided as much as possible use private by default and public when you must expose the method

87403
equals	gethashcode
just use resharper to create you equals gethashcode methods

87410
put	get
if you put your regex in parentheses you can get the length and thus the end using

87439
post	get
are you using post redirect get prg model

87457
implements	extends
the classic example is the activerecord class from rails if you try to implements something similar in php which would look like this class user extends activerecord and then try to call user find 1 the method that gets called is actually activerecord find because you haven t overloaded find in user - but without late static binding the find method in activerecord has no way of knowing which classed it got called from self within it will always point to activerecord and thus it can t fetch your user-object for you

87487
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
i often throw runtimeexception rather than try to develop an exception class for every conceivable error case - but your opinion on that will depend on where you sit on the checked vs unchecked-exception debate

87519
equals	tostring
similarly even objects with expensive equals methods have inexpensive tostring calls

87519
equals	tostring
for example the java.net.url class has an equals method which makes use of an internet connection to determine whether two urls are truly equals but it still has a simple and constant-time tostring method

87556
gmail	hotmail
maybe gmail hotmail and all others do have api s which users can use....need to look into it more i guess

87602
getter	setter
setter and getter are commonly inlined

87648
range	minimum
at least because the c++ standard only gives the minimum range of values that each numeric type is required to cover

87666
folder	directory
i have recently run into an issue where i wanted to add a folder to the directory structure of my project that would become the new root directory for the previously housed files

87709
move	drag
or you have the option of doing it straight from within windows explorer drag the files folders you want to move with the right mouse button when you drop them in their new location you ll get a menu one of the options is move in svn

87726
lxml	libxml2
my preferred python xml library is lxml which wraps libxml2

87734
min	max
the only way i can think of so far is to calculate all the points around the perimeter and find the max min x and y values

87802
passenger	webrick
running rails 2.1 either via mongrel webrick or passenger in development mode if i make changes to my views they don t update without me having to kick the server

87837
versioning	upgrade
also try the usual stuff make sure you ve upgrade to the latest versioning check out any development versioning that may contain bugfixes etc

87842
addition	multiplication
probably the most important thing to remember when performing an extended precision multiplication is that you must also perform a multiple precision addition at the same time

87849
cvs	svn	cvs	rcs
i am about to move to svn as my rcs of choice after many years using cvs and have a basic question.

87849
cvs	svn
back in my cvs days i would of used a unix symbolic link in one of the project folders but as my new svn repository won t necessarily be hosted on a unix box i can t do the same

87868
multiplying	multiplication
just do normal long multiplication as if you were multiplying a pair of 2-digit numbers except each digit is really a 32-bit integer

87868
128bit	64bit
note that we re discarding the upper 64bit of the result since a 64bit number times a 64bit number is a 128bit number

87892
ubuntu	linux
web site for linux kernel asynchronous i o support here says that sockets don t work but the aio.h manual pages on my ubuntu 8.04.1 workstation all seem to imply that it works for arbitrary file descriptors

88020
min	max
which should give you many solutions for t two of which you are interested in plug that back into 1 to get your max and min x

88031
interbase	firebird
if you use firebird or interbase there s a tool called ibdesc that does a great job

88049
hash	salt
-server never knows password only salt hash

88058
x86	64bit
even the ia64 cpus the intanium that was intended to replace x86 before amd invented x86-64 that was true 64bit and could only emulate 32 bit unlike x86-64 that can be both is one of the cpus that can be switched to big endian

88100
udp	tcp
for instance if a preference picks tcp versus udp have your conditional instantiate a tcpprovider or udpprovider which the rest of your code uses with minimal muss or fuss

88196
getter	setter
also it removes that nasty problem of having two getter and setter for the same actual data

88218
sharpmap	proj
if you re looking for a good start you can use the foundation of code supplied by the sharpmap proj and build out from there

88259
postgresql	mysql
often needed mysql postgresql for example

88320
int	boolean
seleniumserver int port boolean slowresources boolean multiwindow

88399
vim	emacs
i saw this same question for vim and it has been something that i myself wanted to know how to do for emacs

88444
post	get
why don t you post more information about the limitations of the platform you are working on and perhaps some of the clever folk here can help get your bug list down

88536
int	chars
the reason you would not use tables for non-tablular data is the same reason you don t store int as chars strings - technology works much more easily when you use it for the purpose for which it is desgined

88541
getter	setter
lets say i have a business object with getter setter for the properties on the object

88632
opera	firefox
for example even .net developers occasionally use firefox maybe even opera

88632
google-chrome	safari
safari and google-chrome are possibilities too now

88632
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
it must run reasonably in internet explorer 6 firefox 3.0 opera 9+ and safari for windows not everything has to be flawless but it can t look downright ugly either

88733
client-side	server-side
perhaps you should look at having both client-side and server-side validation

88733
client-side	server-side
the attributes can then be processed and used to automatically create both client-side and server-side validation methods to avoid the problem of duplicating business logic

88743
testng	jmockit
i m using jmockit for unit testing with testng and i m having trouble using the expectations class to mock out a method that takes a primitive type boolean as a parameter using a matcher

88783
addition	multiplication
this example will correctly do multiplication before addition

88803
width	height
try setting the width and or height of the rootpanel to 100 before adding your widget

88820
put	get
it does not get put at the end of the queue

88836
tcpdf	fpdf
fpdf tcpdf and php s included pdf libraries allow me to create an image and plop it on a pdf but the more advanced layouts and crop marks are a bit beyond me

88853
accessor	properties
adding to nescio s thoughts - i d suggest in code reviews actively hunting down expensive transparent operations in properties accessor db round tripping

88895
openmesh	cgal
as far as i understand your question it seems to me that you do not clearly see the point of libraries like cgal and openmesh

88904
gridex	janus
we re making heavy use of 3rd party controls janus gridex infralution virtualtree and .net magic docking and we do a lot of dynamic loading and rendering of content based on metadata in our database

88985
put	get
on the other hand if you don t put any validation in your app you might not have any bad data but you may have users thinking they entered stuff that doesn t get saved

89040
jobs	cron
in fact it often depends on application logic user roles and sometimes you might want to bypass validation altogether cron jobs and maintenance scripts

89073
ubuntu	linux
it appears that it s in ubuntu linux in the cutils or cdecl package and it s probably available elsewhere

89133
post	get
this post should get you started on the various options..check the post tagged with debugging

89243
stdout	stderr
the advantage of subprocess vs system is that it is more flexible you can get the stdout stderr the real status code better error handling etc...

89249
hex	binary
here is the table of all the values note that you can add up values to hide multiple drives also the value is binary type but must be entered in hexadecimal so if you add up a few drives get ready for a little hex math

89387
merb	ruby-on-rails
is there a port of facebooker the facebook plugin for ruby-on-rails to merb

89418
folder	directory
assume i have an images folder directory under the root of my application

89424
alloca	malloc
or if the input vectors are small enough but not constant size just use alloca instead of malloc

89454
sorting	filtering
however if your queries are quite similar but you have huge numbers of permutations in your query conditions like complicated paging sorting filtering etc an object relational mapper tool is probably the way to go although the process of overhauling your existing code to make use of the tool could be quite complicated

89530
apache	nginx
actually since you re using nginx you re already in great shape and don t need apache

89530
nginx	lighttpd
i also happen to do what the nginx wiki suggests and use spawn-fcgi from lighttpd as my cgi-spawner lighttpd is a pretty fast compile w o weird dependencies so a quick and easy thing to install but you can also use a short shell perl script for that

89578
free	malloc
the second makes a number of functions more expensive but has a huge impact on malloc and free

89578
allocator	stl
i believe with the msvcp stl implementations it also eliminates all the allocator pooling that is usually done so that leaks show exactly the block you d think and not some larger chunk of memory that it s been sub-allocating

89612
kubuntu	gnome
since you re using ubuntu and not kubuntu i assume you re using gnome

89619
elf	dwarf
for more info take a look at dwarf the debugging format originally designed to go along with elf the binary format for linux and other os s

89638
width	height
in the broken box model the height and width values refer to the size of the box excluding the margins

89668
getter	setter
i write explicit tests for everything except simple getter and setter

89668
getter	setter
if the getter or setter only contains a return blah

89679
elf	dwarf
google dwarf a developer joke on elf

89714
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari	webkit	gecko
group #1 is browsers that use webkit safari for example presto opera for example khtml konqueror for example or gecko firefox for example

89714
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
ones that are definitely not dead are ie6 starting to push it ie7 ie8 latest opera 9.x latest firefox 3.x latest safari 3.x and others that have about the same capabilities

89714
opera	firefox
firefox 2.x isn t dead either and is needed for win9x users if they don t want to use opera

89780
bash	subshell
i m using ksh-style subshell here i m not totally sure that it works in bash

89786
getter	setter
you might want to move the validation outside of the getter and setter

89803
post	put
for example there is a featured post plugin that will put selected content on the front page

89833
getter	setter
i do except for getter and setter

89910
getter	setter
i do agree about not testing getter and setter
