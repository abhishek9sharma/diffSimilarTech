when designing app in visual studio c# if i know that i will have a certain number of datagridviews that all have same properties like width height color some other properties like disable option to directly edit rows etc. is it ok to make my own class mydatagridview that inherited datagridview class and make all adjustments there and then just instantiate that class later in code

5301186
alertdialog	progressdialog
so i wrote the code but the progressdialog dismisses and the alertdialog doesn t show

that said memory-mapped registers do exist but in any modern processors they belong to other devices never the cpu

hide	show
you can use the boolean property isminimized on the ribbon class to show hide the ribbon itself

5301839

as far as i know the default template does not have a show hide button like office does but it shouldn t be too hard to modify the template using blend to add one

5301878

free	malloc
when the progress process finishes and the memptr variable is free does it free the malloc allocated memory in the c function as well

i use the netbeans profiler which is actually an embedded visualvm to monitor the memory consumption of my java applications

5302304
width	height
edit the height and width of the div are resizable in browsers that support the css3 property resize

5302343

and then once it s done sizing which will take the child elements minwidth and minheight into account run some code that sets minwidth and minheight to the window s actualwidth and actualheight

5302408
db4o	eloquera
i think that eloquera www.eloquera.com is better than db4o and additionally has better licensing

5302408
db4o	eloquera
for instance eloquera is free for commercial use and db4o not db4o has the same licensing options than mysql free for free but paid for commercial use

5302465

just to make sure i was right on this i also tested your site in safari opera ie and firefox

5302547
gif	png
so when i attachment a file diferent to image when i donÃ¢ t upload jpeg gif or png example zip show this error

5302558
profiling	instrumentation
under profiling i selected ask on launch but instrumentation never pops up

5302566
lxml	elementtree
so if you want to parse xml into an elementtree but donÃ¢ t want to use the slow builtin xml parser if lxml is available you would need to check this the moment you need to invoke the parser

5302580
hex	binary
if you save your image you ll notice in a hex editor it s binary image data with your little snipped of html appened to the end of the file

5302848
g++	gcc
now i compile it with my g++ gcc 4.4.4

5302867
cvs	rcs
in fact this is essentially what cvs does though in recent versions it handles the rcs data itself rather than invoking rcs to do it as it used to do

5302867
cvs	svn
svn subversion is an attempt to rectify some of the problems in cvs though it also brings some new limitations and keeps many of the existing ones

5302867
bazaar	svn
it does however have a rather simpler user interface and there are a number of useful plugins including a distributed-development-friendly svn plugin committing from a branch back to svn need not interfere with the validity of others branches of your branches and bazaar metadata is even committed back to svn

5302867
bazaar	svn
it also supports plugins though its svn plugin isn t as nice as bazaar s it doesn t support lossless commits so branching from other peoples branches is unwise

5302949
put	get
i have put breakpoints at the dispose methods of panel and view and videoplayercontrol derives from axwindowsmediaplayer classes but none of those get hit before the exception happens

5302950
post	get
there is a chance that if your server expects a post it s not looking in the url for your parameters and if it is looking in the url it s expecting a get instead

5302969
hide	show
if you use use closeaction hide then the window can be show and hidden but you must do this with hide and show calls

5302994
google-chrome	firefox
it works perfectly fine in firefox and google-chrome

5302994
google-chrome	firefox
when i trigger the handler via ajax it goes into my stepin function and then does a redirecttoaction search at the end following rpg principles this is followed by firefox and google-chrome but not any ie browser and i m unsure why

5302994
google-chrome	firefox
i can add some generated code from google-chrome or firefox if that is likely to help

5302994
google-chrome	firefox
further edit checked in fiddler and in firefox and google-chrome the 302 redirect is honoured returning a 200 status code for the search page however for ie6 it seems it s not following any further

5303009
children	parent
i want the parent div to expand to the width of the children no matter what even if it means overflowing its own container

5303030
cpu	processors	disk	ram
for example you can see a dual-core 2.33 ghz processors 2 gb of ram 100 gb of hard disk vm but what you don t know is that behind the scenes your server could be throttled so that it will never use more than 33 of the available cpu resources

5303036
int	chars
for example using a base 62 alphabet i can represent int up to 238327 before the representation uses 4 chars instead of 3

5303077
pop-up	dialog
and it automatically pop-up up a print dialog asking for print

5303095
pop-up	dialog
but the other application process crash causes a dialog to pop-up on the machine asking if the process should be killed or help sent to microsoft or something

5303111
innodb	myisam
in myisam it is stored in the table s metadata in innodb in a special memory object populated with max id on the first insert after the server startup

5303166
children	parent
in this example the stretchable-div element will bust out of its parent and stretch to its children

5303203
children	parent
i didn t test this but you might have missed calling children on the parent

5303227
x86	64bit
the os is 64bit windows server 2008 running iis7 with an intel zeon x86 cpu

5303279
try-catch	exception-handling
as long as the exception-handling is caught by a try-catch nested inside the loop you should be able to continue the loop no problem

5303290
tolower	uppercase
if uppercase but no whitespace do tolower and return

5303315
setcontentview	findviewbyid
you need to call setcontentview r.layout.main before you make any findviewbyid calls

5303327
width	height
you would be better off using a 100 height and 100 width

5303360
hash	salt	hash	md5	salt	md5
indeed if you hash your password using md5 or sha1 adding a salt is a good idea btw you will not be able to recover the password

5303387
des	aes
if you want encryption there s aes des and various other functions available

5303407
sudo	passwd
you can provide the passwd to sudo

5303411
nsurl	nsstring
i have an nsurl a file path and i want to add an nsstring to the end of it the file name how can i do this

5303414
onresume	onpause
i skipped the onpause onresume but i implemented webview.pausetimers and webview.resumetimers and it at least stops the cpu bleed

5303414
onresume	onpause
i also added cookiesyncmanager.getinstance .stopsync startsync to my onpause onresume as well

5303417
vim	textmate
though i m no vim expert i ve been scratching an itch by working on a rough vim equivalent of textmate s Ã¢Å r functionality to run ruby code from a buffer and display the output

5303422
hash	md5
normally you will hash the password with md5 these days it s better to use sha-2 and when the user submits their password to try and log in hash that password as well and see if the hash are a match

5303422
hash	salt
add the salt to the beginning of the password and then hash it

5303422
hash	salt
store the hash of the salt+password and the salt together

5303422
hash	salt
now when the user submits his password to log in you would combine it with the salt hash it and check if the hash is a match

5303422
hash	salt
the salt ensures that if multiple users have the same password chances are they do their password hash will not be identical

5303425
quicksort	heapsort	quicksort	mergesort	mergesort	in-place	mergesort	heapsort	heapsort	in-place
of course you just asked for advice about sorting on stack overflow so i feel compelled to ask you if you need an in-place sort what kind of big-o performance you re looking for and then ask you to choose between quicksort introsort heapsort mergesort and stoogesort for what will work best for you

5303428
width	height
in your javascript set the font size and attributes that you are trying to measure put your string in the div then read the current width and height of the div

5303435
free	malloc
my question is is there any tool in visual studio which can find the malloc free pairs

5303504
inline	inlining
remove the inline hint knowing that the compiler is going to decide about inlining regardless of the hint

5303507
powerpc	i386

folder	directory
but there wasn t even a build directory in the android folder so i created one ran cmake in there and make again but get this error

5303642
post	get
check out my blog post for how to get around this -- basically you need to delete your xcuserdata for the project

5303666
memcpy	memset
of course it seems a bit heavyweight to link in msvcrt.dll just to get at memset memcpy etc

5303713
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
for starters i need to test on ie6 ie7 ie8 ie9 google-chrome firefox 3.6 firefox 4.0 safari 5 and opera 10 on their most likely os

5303734
portrait	landscape
in my app i display images in portrait modes amongst other information and want to display them full screen in landscape mode

5303734
portrait	landscape
in portrait mode the images in the end depend on user interaction so the landscape class needs to be told which image to display

5303776
free	malloc
it may even be that you have to call free on the pointer if getstr created it with malloc

5303779
google-chrome	safari
it seems like the creator of thickbox 3.1 added code to disable the loading functionality on safari google-chrome

5303897

5303899

5303935
stdout	stderr
most of us know that to redirect stderr to stdout we do

5303935
stdout	stderr
if you want to redirect both stderr and stdout of prog1 to prog2 you place the prior to the |prog2 pipe

5303935
stdout	stderr
on the other hand if you are redirecting stderr and stdout of prog1 to a file file.txt the goes after the

5303938
junit	jmock
the runwith jmock.class is for 4 otherwise you need to the testcase class that comes with jmock s junit 3 integration

5303944
gif	png
parse the html using domdocument to get the img tags while also filtering out any image that is not a png jpg or gif you know sometimes people place tracking scripts inside img tags

5303955
rss	feed
so i ve a very simple app that displays a bunch of rss feed from different sites in a listview

5303962
post	get	post	put	put	get

5303987
hide	show
what might be easier is to have two buttons and show hide them in your functions

5304005
for-loop	loops
there is only a for-each loops in xslt though no for-loop with a counter

5304043
stdout	stderr
that diverts stderr from the program to the current destination of the program s stdout which is the stdout stream of the shell and diverts stdout of the program to out.txt

5304043
stdout	stderr
that diverts the stdout of the program to out.txt then diverts the stderr from the program to the current destination of the program s stdout which is out.txt

5304045
awt	swing
here you have a class which does not relate in any way to swing or awt

5304047
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
if so try to do it in viewwillappear or viewdidappear

5304065
post	get
one end of the spectrum could be a dumb browser that just talks to a service using a form url encoded post and a get while the other end could be a more rich client that uses atom odata or a hypermedia based media type

5304075
inherited	properties
__curious_geek said it s not a good idea to inherited controls to set properties this way but it s good practice to always have common base class for your business classes and screens

5304090
gmail	hotmail
simple enough encrypt them and throw them in the database once they have added gmail yahoo hotmail etc

5304112
allocator	stl
the reason i say very close to being perfectly correct is that it s possible to customize how stl containers get their memory by providing a new allocator as a template argument in lieu of the default

runtimeexception like illegalargumentexception and nullpointerexception for example don t need to be explicitly caught because they shouldn t happen

5304143
nullpointerexception	runtimeexception	nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception	illegalargumentexception	runtimeexception
illegalargumentexception along with some others for example nullpointerexception are examples of a runtimeexception

5304150
children	parent
this styles only the nested divs that are children of the parent div

5304151
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
you need to read up on unchecked-exception - exceptions which inherit from runtimeexception

5304162
jruby	mri
i ve tested the above with mri 1.8.7 1.9.2 and jruby 1.5.6

5304192
folder	directory
one way i ve seen this handled on a number of very highly traffic ed sites is to have multiple folder in the inetpub directory

5304192
folder	directory
once the push to the new folder is complete you change the iis site to point to the new directory

5304196
extjs	mootools
these tools can include with a simple check frameworks such as jquery extjs mootools etc

5304215
min	max
the join condition for this table may need to be changed or you can use group by along with max min to show only the shortest longest trip depending on the need

5304218
udp	tcp
incidentally they do use bytebuffers for both tcp and udp connections

5304255
maven	pom.xml
however i have verified that the widgetset was indeed declared as a dependency in my project s pom.xml and i have also verified that it appears under the maven dependencies library icon in the eclipse ide

5304266
rss	feed
that allows you to build lists of things nodes users ... and expose them as pages blocks rss feed and much more

5304300
hash	md5
also for passwords you should be looking at bcrypt or similarly slow hash functions for passwords anyways instead of using a fast hash algorithm like md5 or sha

5304316
post	get
i understand it has to do with the session not been flushed even though i dont get it very well by reading other s post but my question is when does spring transction come in

5304339
mef	prism
take a look at the prism 4.0 quickstart - modularity with mef for silverlight

5304361
filtering	grouping
i would prefer to associate an specific grouping django.contrib.auth.models.group called students rather than all the users or at least filtering and or validate this field to just add and view students and also do the same with the teacher field

5304361
filtering	grouping
update 1 i just noticed that maybe i could filtering those users who are in a certain grouping using the optional parameter limit_choices_to

5304422
getter	setter
also note that browser support for javascript getter setter is probably sketchy.

5304423
range	min	range	max	min	max
ie the range includes min but excludes max and values greater than max or less than min wrap around in a circle

5304423
min	max
note that the min param can be assumed to be always numerically less than max

5304426
children	parent
so the two tables form a one parent - to many children relationship

5304426
children	parent
if i use the following query i will get the parent and the children at once where each parent will be repeated as many times as many children it has

5304426
children	parent
using this approach i d have to find all the unique parent rows and then read all the children

5304426
children	parent
and use linq to merge all parent with children

5304426
children	parent
the third and final also most inefficient approach is to grab all parent and while constructing each parent object make a trip to the db to grab all its children

5304426
children	parent
this approach takes n+1 connections 1 for all parent and n number of trips to get all children for each parent

5304487
post	get
facebook is requiring all canvas apps to support http post in the iframe instead of get

5304517
post	put
i put together a simple test of an ajax jquery post within a django framework but don t really understand why the output doesn t make it to a template page

5304534
folder	directory
my conclusion when something goes wrong in the migration process and you end up with both a and a .new file in your app s folder in the application support directory you are stuck because everytime that addpersistentstorewithtype tries to create a store for merging .new it runs into posix error code 17

5304538
children	parent
from there you d read the first table creating a dictionary of the parent in a by parentid then simply read each row in the 2nd table to add the children

5304546
getter	setter
if you trace you ll see that the setter actually calls the getter if the values of what you pass into the setter and the getter are the same the binding will not occur

5304548
screens	mdpi
if you only want to support mdpi screens with 480 800 resolution you can try adding this to your manifest file

5304563
children	parent
this ensures all children from the same parent are in consecutive rows

5304569
google-chrome	firefox
could be useful for google-chrome on windows or maybe firefox though

5304603
filtering	grouping
here s the thing - i need to filtering records based on grouping of fields

5304606
int	chars	int	double
can you convert a class object to for example to int double chars etc

5304628
gif	png
this might have the answers you re looking for converting transparent gif png to jpeg using java

5304645
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu linux probably provides some way of seeing this sort of information

5304657
hex	binary
the algorithm i m using to detect the viruses is via binary converted to hex signatures

5304665
serializable	deserialization
a traditional approach is to define a c++ message structure for each protocol message and implement serializable and deserialization functions for it

5304665
serializable	deserialization
using the helper functors above and representing input output buffers as char iterator ranges only one function template is required to do both serializable and deserialization of the message

5304700
min	max
1 enforce max min lengths from the db

5304734
direct3d	directdraw
originally the names of these apis all began with direct such as direct3d directdraw directmusic directplay directsound and so forth

5304754
subobject	instances
consider that even in linked lists the container will not allocate an instances of your type but rather a templated structure that contains a subobject of the type

5304783
gif	png
png was created to improve upon and replace gif graphics interchange format as an lossless image file format not requiring a patent license

5304797
firefox	safari
this same problem recently began happening in firefox and safari circa february 2011 if not earlier somewhere about the time i upgraded firefox to 3.6.1.3 and was then directed by firefox to update adobe flash

5304819
textview	imageview
i think that you re getting npe because you re trying to create a textview and an imageview in a view where they aren t there

5304819
oncreate	setcontentview
and in the oncreate method you set the view to this xml with setcontentview r.layout.main

5304819
textview	imageview
in your custom adapter you should access to your textview and imageview inside getview or bindview without any problem

5304853
profiling	debugging
if you want it to use debugging then pull down the platform dropdown select edit scheme go to the profiling side-tab and tell it to use debugging instead of release

5304882
qt-creator	kdevelop
as jvmti agents are usually headless are you using qmake because your project has a head that you are developing in kdevelop qt-creator

5304887
hash	salt
use a hash and salt

5304928
children	parent
i have a table that contains parent and children

5304928
children	parent
i want to be able to build the model so that it returns the parent and their children i.e it associates with itself

5304975
hbase	hypertable
they currently provide support for hbase and hypertable ref

5305003

iboutlet	ibaction
if you are not loading the view from the xib then there will be no connections made no iboutlet initialized and no ibaction triggered

5305035
oncreate	setcontentview
you aren t calling setcontentview in your activity oncreate

5305123
opensso	openam
i m trying to get the opensso openam fedlet up and running against an adfs2.0 server

opera	google-chrome
to get the url from any legit browser opera google-chrome with a bookmarklet

5305199
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
here s a fiddle that works for me in firefox ie safari and google-chrome

5305238
illegalargumentexception	runtimeexception
runtimeexception s like illegalargumentexception are used to indicate programming errors

5305243
setinterval	settimeout
you can use setinterval in conjuction with settimeout function

5305290
int	boolean
method.invokenative object object class class class int boolean line not available native method

5305293
super	self
super userfield self .clean value is calling the ancestor method forms.emailfield.clean value to check that the email is well formed

5305315
client-side	server-side
less can be used server-side or client-side

5305350
oncreate	setcontentview
the class-level variable initialization you do textgeneratenumber must be done after the call to to setcontentview in the oncreate method

5305391
client-side	server-side
the issue i am having is that the socket descriptor i am using is being recognized by recv as invalid but only on the server-side clientsocket instance returned from my serversocket accept - the client-side clientsocket instance has no problems

5305391
g++	gcc
the weirdest bit about this is that if i compile this exact same code with mingw gcc g++ on windows it runs fine

5305391
g++	gcc
the worst part is it works fine using mingw gcc g++ on windows and linux both

5305393
ftp	telnet
use ssh instead of telnet use scp instead of rcp and use sftp instead of ftp

5305398
versioning	upgrade
early passenger versioning for apache had some bugs so my suggestion is to simply upgrade passenger to the newest versioning

5305399
mouse	keyboard
basically something to automate the steps of opening keyboard mouse in systempreferences selecting the last tab keyboardshortcuts clicking + to add a new one and filling the info

5305418
monkeyrunner	adb
you write monkeyrunner script on your pc and it uses adb to communicate with a device emulator

5305477
versioning	upgrade
as we ve seen it doesn t work but also you ll need to change it every time you upgrade to a newer versioning of the heroku gem

5305477
rubygems	bundler
doing so may actually get the heroku command working but the whole point of using rubygems and bundler is that they manage stuff like this for you

5305482
sorting	grouping
then for each grouping you have double click the grouping select sorting and then add as many sorting fields as you need for the info contained at that grouping level

5305491
hash	md5
then i get an md5 hash i do this in php but it doesn t matter

5305491
hash	md5
after this you can compare the md5 with a pre-calculated hash of an empty canvas

5305516
chunked	transfer-encoding
each thread will do some processing and write its results in a single http chunk using http transfer-encoding chunked

5305517
cucumber	autotest
be careful though as running cucumber as part of the autotest stuff will slow down the runtime considerably especially if the browser it fires up is firefox

5305535
daemon	cron
the solution i d offer would be to use svn or any other version control on your host os x commit changes into that run a cron or daemon on your ubuntu that does svn update frequently on your folder

5305559
mouse	keyboard	keydown	mousedown
handle keyboard keydown up and mouse handling mousedown up events to make the 36 areas of the graphic respond to user inputs in the way you desire

5305582
stdout	stderr
using you re redirecting stderr to stdout

5305588
rss	feed
you can use the rss feed button at the bottom of the timeline view to monitor ticket changes outside of trac

5305599
hex	binary
if you have an arbitrary-long binary string use string hex escapes

5305646
int	boolean
if your not using then you might need to do the eager loading inside the repository such as accepting a boolean flag e.g getbyid int id bool include profiles

5305699
textview	imageview
on the third line i m setting those values for activityname textview activitydata textview and activitythumb imageview

5305741
post	get	post	put	put	get
another way to put it if you can t figure out how to do what it is that you actually need to get done post a question about that and you ll likely get some help here

5305751
versioning	upgrade
this is a good opportunity to encourage actually force people to upgrade to the latest versioning of the code-base

5305783
opera	firefox
domsubtreemodified does work and has become reasonably well supported firefox and webkit have supported it for years ie only in version 9 opera apparently still not at all

5305824
post	get
in php you will get all the post or get values

5305850
google-chrome	firefox
i am creating a custom facebook fan page using iframes and it s working great in google-chrome and mozilla firefox but not working in internet explorer

5305858
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
the aviewcontrollersarray has the two uiviewcontroller but the viewcontrollers property of the uitabbarcontroller is nil

5305886
put	get
if you don t want it to get location updates when in the background you need to call stopupdatinglocation when your app gets put into the background

5305938
post	get
i ve search and found two previous post regarding the problem but can t seem to get the solutions to work

5305939
int	double
you can mitigate this slightly by specifying that you want an unsigned int which usually double the maximum value by disallowing negative values but you perhaps ought to look into the fixed-width types available in stdint.h if you need a specific range

5305942
sorting	filtering
that way the collectionview definition would not sit in the view but instead in the viewmodel where it belongs and that would help you do all the manipulations you want easily in the viewmodel be it paging sorting or filtering

5305943
cvs	svn
okay i want to use sourceforge to host my source for a program but i have no idea how to use svn or cvs

5305947
put	get
is there a way to get the ouptput to put a new line after every xml element making the file more human readable

5305953
width	height
how about the width and height tags

5305966
mouse	keyboard
the only drawback with this is that filereference.save has to be called from a user action mouse click keyboard press

5306026
profiling	debugging
you can also edit the profiling scheme to make it use debugging builds when profiling

5306026
profiling	debugging
then select profiling item on the sidebar then make sure build configuration is set to debugging

5306037
tstringgrid	tcheckbox
i want to put a tcheckbox inside a tstringgrid in delphi in every cell of certain column

5306087
jar	war
classloaders are everywhere we have the version that reads the classpath system property in tomcat we have another that reads from a war file in osgi it reads from a jar file

5306132
keydown	keyup
when a key is pressed in a browser three events are generated keydown keypress and keyup

5306132
keydown	keyup
keydown and keyup have a keycode property which is approximately the physical key pressed

5306132
keydown	keyup
novnc needs to send the keydown and keyup events separately to the vnc server otherwise it s not a completely functional vnc client

5306144
pull	push
you can even implement push pull functionality in your repositories locally by storing your repository in a different folder

5306147
subtract	add
the trick is to get the current el s margin-left style and then convert it to int in order to drop the px and then add or subtract depends on where you want the element s margin-left to go

5306172
instances	transient
if for instances a transient non static object allocated on the heap prior to _struct2 is removed by the gc then the memory in use by that struct may be shifted into the free space used by that transient object

5306204
hex	binary
you can also view vcl rtl classes in the binary using a hex editor

5306209
integer	unsigned
we also discovered that if you want the ns uint64_t to be treated as a python long variable equivalent to a c unsigned long long then a few further typemaps were required to ensure the vector methods using values and references would instead just use 64-bit integer values

5306214
profiling	debugging
i thought at first that i could easily have access to debugging execution archiving conveniently from a single scheme particularly as each of these modes run test profiling analyze archive are selectable from the workspace toolbar

5306253
cifilter	nsimage
in fact since the false color patch is just a wrapper around the core image filter with the same name cifalsecolor you could do this without involving quartz composer at all --- just set up and apply a cifilter instance to your nsimage

5306279
google-chrome	firefox
i think ie will display the wsdl by default but firefox and google-chrome will not

5306294
illegalargumentexception	unchecked-exception
if it s a case that the caller won t be able to recover from throw an unchecked-exception illegalargumentexception

5306298
webclient	webrequest
not quite sure why you say you don t want to use webrequest or i imagine webclient for that matter when you are clearly creating an http web request but i ll assume you have your reasons

5306298
webclient	httpwebrequest
there is http proxy support built into .net at the higher httpwebrequest webclient layer - but you ve already discounted this

5306298
webclient	httpwebrequest
httpwebrequest or webclient and get

5306303
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
this currently works in google-chrome safari and opera

5306315
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it seems to work fine in ie7 ie8 firefox google-chrome and opera but apparently not in safari

5306338
cos	sin
this sounds like a job for sin and cos in java.lang.math

5306372
ubuntu	linux
i m currently running ubuntu on the machine that this will be used on but will gladly install whatever flavor of linux would make this easiest

5306374
apache	nginx
nginx and apache are common examples of this use case if you can t use that there s an article in the wiki about adding a layer of encryption to the client-side

5306384
cos	sin
you could first find angle as mike suggested and use cos and sin functions

5306415
valgrind	memcheck
rather than running it in gdb run it in valgrind technically memcheck is the name of the default tool it comes with

5306428
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
i have uinavigationcontroller that has a uiviewcontroller pushed onto the stack and displayed

5306471
nsdatecomponents	nscalendar
it would be more straightforward to create an nsdatecomponents with your date components and then use nscalendar s datefromcomponents to convert it to a date

5306493
post	get
what if i want to make specific filterings possible eg userb wants to get notified when a post tagged html is made and have atleast one comments or votes

5306494
tstringgrid	tcheckbox
don t try to place an actual tcheckbox control inside a tstringgrid

5306547
getter	setter
using getter setter is good advice for any oo driven language so yes you should protect your internal data members via the properly exposed methods

5306547
getter	setter
a nice byproduct of the c++ language is that those getter setter will probably end of being inlined which means it s just as fast as accessing the members directly only more safe

5306554
getter	setter
don t create getter setter by default

5306554
getter	setter
there are exceptions to every rule so you ll end up with a handful of getter setter eventually but it s not useful in most applications to have more than say one or two per class very rough guess

5306554
getter	setter
maybe you need hundreds of getter and setter

5306659
subscript	superscript
what do i need to do to be able to specify a subscript or superscript

5306666
profiler	aqtime
i then ran the c# app through the aqtime memory profiler and it reported that there were an excessive number of com c++ objects live on the heap

5306668
box-sizing	border-box
by far the easiest way is to make use of the box-sizing border-box property

5306669
opera	safari
to not support marker and i doubt that either safari or opera has it

5306675
post	get
suppose that you have a webpage that uses the post and get method and you wrote the following view to generate it

5306691
for-loop	arrays
then use a for-loop to go through the rest of the elements in the arrays

5306710
post	get
edit you can also accept a different view model in your edit post action than your edit get action serves up

5306724
width	height
i have a web service asp.net that displays the height or width of the display that is attached to the server

5306730
mutators	getter
personally i follow the school of thought if you have many getter and mutators your class design has a flaw

5306736
getter	setter
i like an approach where you let dynamic getter and setter in a class do all the work for you

5306768
pull	push
i was able to create a repository that everyone could push and pull from together

5306837
hex	binary
you can see the relationship between hex and binary here

5306848
hex	binary
one hex digit corresponds to 4 binary digits bits

5306886
superclass	subclassing
this just creates an object of type subclassing but assigns it to the type superclass

5306886
superclass	subclassing
in other words you cannot call any methods or access data specific to the subclassing you can only access the superclass stuff

5306887
getter	setter
the first approach means i only have to implement a getter setter for the name but i think this would tie my class too closely to a particular implementation

5306916
beanstalk	amazon-web-services
start with the amazon-web-services sdk for java video then move on to the elastic beanstalk video where you ll deploy the sampletravellog webapp from within eclipse

5306942
button	checkbox
the exgridview component has a checkbox property in the property inspector which must be set true then you must set up your column properties so that the column has a checkbox type set to checkbox or radio button

5306967
google-chrome	firefox
if you want hardware-accelerated 3d then you want webgl which is currently supported in google-chrome and the firefox 4 release candidate

5307048
sqoop	hadoop
i m trying to install the ms sql jdbc driver on ubuntu to be used with sqoop for hadoop

5307052
uiview	subviews
an alternative would be to loop through all of your uiview subviews and hide buttons as you find them

5307053
fancybox	jquery-tools
i m using jquery-tools to create a tool tip on this page the info icons and fancybox to create an overlay on this page the bel mij op buttons

5307075
instances	transient
if i set the cascade all on this field i just get another similar exception but about needing to save the transient instances of type employee entity employeeempty

5307090
filesystems	ntfs
folders with too many 10000 files doesn t work well under some windows filesystems so try to divide the files into several folders tune the ntfs filesystems cluster size reserved space for filesystems disable anti virus disable indexing buy an ssd slc hard disk.

5307130
hide	show
so my guess is to create a module that every time a node of that type is loading check the status field which is a field that we have created in that node type and based on the value of that field decide which node should show up or hide

5307152
put	get
this query is basically to fetch the column names of the table.there are more than million records in the table.when i put the above condition its taking so much time to fetch the first row.is there any alternate to get the first row

5307160
pop-up	dialog
there will be a dialog box that will pop-up so that the user will only have to input the email address of the recipient

5307212
recvfrom	datagram
as such i am not aware of any scenerios in which a zero byte return code from recvfrom on a udp socket would be caused by anything other than a zero length datagram being received

5307257
vb.net	vb6
so this is one of the features that did not make the transition to vb.net -- exactly - however you can accomplish much of what you would have done in vb6 with two different mechanisms in .net looping through the controls collection and handling control events

5307258
ffmpeg	libavformat
i would suggest you take a look at libavformat which is part of ffmpeg

5307313
reshape	tapply
in r native mode i believe that both tapply reshape and are dominated speed-wise by data.table

5307341
memcached	apc
also i generally avoid the apc user cache in favor of memcached

5307389
google-chrome	firefox
so far i have it implemented but it only seems to work in google-chrome browser not in firefox or internet explorer

5307410
post	get
i m using the loop in my own webpage to get the last three post from wp

5307426
superclass	subclassing
say you have a superclass fruit and the subclassing banana and you have a method addbananatobasket

5307432
post	get
in that post they mentioned that the objectsid was part of the security token but i have no idea how to get to this

5307484
int	boolean
your question isn t clear but i m guessing you want to change lst s contents so that the boolean values are true if the int exists in lstrank or false if not

5307537
post	get
you could encode the data in to a html form but then you would need to post that rather than use a get for it

5307549
udp	mtu
if both sides agree to modes 1 or 2 you will typically see an fu-a when a nal exceeds the udp mtu or configured maximum packet size

5307557
solaris	bsd	solaris	aix	bsd	aix
most posix platforms supports posix aio by now linux bsd solaris aix tru64

5307562
width	height
there is no such thing as drawing a line from one point with a height and width

5307602
hash	md5
it is a bad idea to try to turn an md5 hash into a string

5307602
hash	md5
if you want to store an md5 hash in a database it is better to encode as a string using for example base64 encoding and save the encoded hash

5307612
post	get
we have been able to get this to work for sending just a small few friends this message as a wall post notifications and messages are unavailable in the api

5307612
post	get
whether there is any way to get around it to post to all the users

5307636
setinterval	settimeout
setinterval as with settimeout adds the callback function onto the event queue when the timeout expires - if there is other event handling happening at the same time this can lead to multiple queued callbacks

5307733
swift	objective-c
the avfoundation framework provides both objective-c and swift interfaces for editing and playing audio-visual media in a mac osx or ios application

5307819
actualheight	actualwidth
i used actualwidth and actualheight it worked for me

writetofile	nsdata
it s unlikely that - nsdata writetofile options error will ever get more robust than it already is

5312399
writetofile	nsdata
you could use this in your app by replacing - nsdata writetofile options error with your own code that called f_fullfsync instead of fsync

5312399
writetofile	nsdata
before calling - nsdata writetofile options error to write your file you could rename the previous file to some other name and leave that file around just in case

5312408
pull	push
more often what happens is that i m hunting a hard-to-find bug and making a bunch of little changes directly in the test repo #3 and when i find the bug i just throw all of those debugging changes away and fix the bug directly in the git-svn repo #1 then push to #2 pull into #3 and test

concave	convex
i have a constraint delaunay triangulation cdt algorithm and i have a polygon it could be concave or convex as input

maven	pom.xml
if you don t want to use roo you can easily just strip it out of your maven pom.xml file after your done doing the initial scaffolding

5314019
move	drag
when implementing this i d guess that you d want to be careful about where you actually drop the icon in relation to your finger - if you look at how the text caret is move in a text block when you click hold drag then you ll see that the caret position is offset above the finger so that you can always see it

5314039

5314826

now zsh uses zle and bash uses readline library for the same purpose

5314982

5315151

the parent figure can t be smaller than one of its children or this child will not be visible

5315178

cut that getter setter stuff we have properties for a reason

5315200
getter	setter
setter and getter are not usually used in python

5315233
post	get
it takes a little work and you will need to know where the form post and the values that get passed

5315233
post	get
also you will have to add a different post injection per site that you try to login to which will get pretty messy

5315240

as an addition to beth s answer you will need a tool for creating an entity-relationship diagram

5315293
entity-relationship	diagram
edit if you don t want to build your own entity-relationship diagram layouter by yourself something i would not recommend you should try to find a third-party component for that

5315293
entity-relationship	diagram
here is one capable of creating entity-relationship diagram

5315310
min	max
honestly though if you don t need to search through it max min etc. it might be better to use some kind of flat file

getter	setter
if you change your mind you can always write one getter setter

stdout	stderr	stdout	fflush	stderr	fflush	fflush	gets
the warning is coming through stderr before stdout gets fflush

5316774
stdout	stderr
by default warn goes to stderr and print goes to stdout

5316774
stdout	stderr	stdout	fflush	stderr	fflush
in your current code you re seeing stderr being fflush prior to stdout

5316774
stdout	stderr	stdout	fflush	stderr	fflush
that sets stdout and stderr to be unbuffered and fflush on every print

5316779

i get an exception because he couldn t find father kitten but when i put between the to statements savechanges it works perfectly

5317146
hide	show
in any case i thought it would be best to just add an onchange event to the newly created hidden element from the first select box and then write my own javascript function which would show hide the second select box based on the hidden elements value when it changed as a result of selecting the country the third party javascript already updates the hidden element value with the newly selected country value

5317158
stdout	stderr
the other way to do it would be for your script to start a subshell itself which would inherit stdin stdout stderr

5317180
g++	gcc
btw this is for gcc g++

5317190
google-chrome	firefox
this leaves me to wonder if ie firefox google-chrome etc are using some sort of compiler or if it s an interpreter

5317658
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i m running into an issue with google-chrome only works fine in firefox and safari not worrying about ie that makes me wonder if this is a bug if i m using the pseudo elements incorrectly or if you re not supposed to combine pseudo classes and pseudo elements

5317660
portrait	landscape
now i change the orientation for portrait to landscape

5317664
post	get
everything else post correctly but i m seeing in firebug that it ll serialize the checkbox value as on or off instead of true and false that i get with a normal .

5317714

are you certain they mean min and max and not distribution

5317782
google-chrome	firefox
they are showed in firefox and google-chrome but not in ie9

5317806
folder	directory
i m editing a file in a folder in my root directory

phpstorm uses fifo queue to manage incoming debugger connections and allows to handle several debug connections simultaneously

5318157
cpython	pypy
pypy s jit can make python code execute much faster than cpython

5318159
int	double
your converttonum method is declared as returning a double but the actual value you return is an int the result of dividing two int is always an int so in practice any values less than 1 will be truncated to 0

5318186
centos	linux
in this case my website is located on my home development server running windows server 2003 and my smtp server is a remote dedicated box running centos linux with qmail

5318190
cvs	svn
bugzilla and cvs svn or git do different jobs

5318190
cvs	svn
in brief and assuming you re writing code alone and are not doing this collaboratively svn cvs will be useful as purely versioning systems ie to keep older versions so as to be able to go back check what has changed and keep a historical record while bugzilla is used to track bugs i ve never used it so that s all i know about it

5318250
pull	push
for example if the driver had to push the steering wheel in or pull it out to make the car go faster or slower they might risk changing the car s direction at the same time

innodb	myisam
you can not define foreign keys on default mysql storage engines isam myisam use innodb as engine then add foreign key constraints

5318339
nettcpbinding	net.tcp
we ll be using wcf to do this and we ve decided that we ll use a variety of bindings in order to facilitate each different client s needs including a nettcpbinding for our desktop app a net.tcp and or named pipe binding for an internet app running either locally or on a machine within the network and some flavor of http binding for an external web api

5318371

5318400
plupload	swfupload
as for the client side we ve looked at swfupload plupload and

5318424
unsigned	short
why does for example the result of operation between an unsigned short and int always yields an int

5318430
domxpath	domdocument
i m not sure what file_get_html is but you may want to use file_get_contents instead probably with domdocument and domxpath

5318450
int	chars
first int arithmetic is never performed with operands smaller than int so in the case of both the short and the signed chars operands are promoted to int the two int values are multiplied and then the result is an int

5318462
width	height
just change the height and width to whatever and you ve got a centered div

5318469
stdout	stderr
both stdout and stderr are connect to a terminal aka tty and output to it is buffered until a newline

5318483
google-chrome	firefox
i suggest that as a new developer you should get tools like firebug for firefox or google-chrome which can help you debug the underlying errors...although in this case since html simply outputs the text within the span tags the only way to know what stock_data equals to would be to view the source

5318519
post	get
i have not tried this myself but this post may get you started

5318555
pascal	delphi
fpc free pascal compiler is a 16 32 64-bit multi-architecture object pascal compiler with both turbo pascal apple pascal and delphi dialects

5318715
src	attr
next i need to set the href value and i can use attr for that but i don t know how to extract the value of src within the same call

5318735
vim	emacs	pycharm	komodo
many editors support this including vim emacs komodo wingware and pycharm to name just a few

5318794

5318876
puts	gets
the form gets from objc my control and puts it into panel

5318896
addition	multiplication
let s start with addition as this is simple and we can use parts of it for the multiplication later

5318896
subtract	add	multiplying	add	multiplying	subtract
i want method names that you can read like you would read the formula thus plus minus times instead of add subtract multiplying

5318896
multiplying	add
so we have to multiplying each digit i of the first number with each digit j of the second number and add the product in digit i+j of the result and pay attention to carry

5318896
equals	compareto
in the equals method we simply can delegate to the compareto method instead of implementing the same algorithm again

5318896
division	subtraction
subtraction and maybe negative numbers and division are more complicated so i m omitting them for now

5318896
multiplying	add	multiplying	division
as already answered in another answer about converting numbers we have to do division remainder multiplying add

5318906
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the largest inconsistency i ve noticed when styling select dropdowns is safari and google-chrome rendering firefox is fully customizable through css

5318906
google-chrome	safari
safari and google-chrome fix

5318911
serializable	deserialization
you will have to write your own serializable deserialization support for the protobuf-net file and if you want need to use the system.configuration namespace you will have to synchronize the content of your file with the standard config file

5318935
versioning	upgrade
check which versioning you have installed and potentially upgrade it to the latest

5318941
apache	nginx
a better way would be to run it under user space and proxy it via apache mod_wsgi or nginx

5318950
gif	png
i heard there is some way to add additional hidden text inside code of the image file like jpg png gif

5318998
children	parent
best thing to do is to do nothing parent controls automatically dispose their children controls

5319057
width	height
if you explicitly set the height and width or remove the height and width it works

5319070
strtol	atoi
strtol atoi sscanf etc.

5319074
pdcurses	conio	pdcurses	ncurses	conio	ncurses
you ll need a library like ncurses on nix or pdcurses for windows conio functions would probably still work on windows

5319085
multiplying	add
basically you take the value of each sample multiplying it by the decay parameter and add the result to the value in the buffer delaysamples away

5319115
rtos	ecos	freertos	ecos
the survey also does not consider non-commercial rtos such as freertos rtems and ecos

5319115
freertos	ecos
in 2009 for example freertos was downloaded more than 77500 times and ecos has extensive support for file-systems and networking etc

5319129
width	height
i am using lytebox s lyteframe plugin to display a html form at present time i can only specify the width and height of the content loaded into the frame as pixels is there a method of setting these properties to display as the same width and height of the content that is loaded into the box

5319137
int	boolean
trying to simply cast the value won t be possible since it would require rules to handle cases like casting boolean to int

5319184
serializable	deserialization
it s important to have these accessible as properties so the automated serializable deserialization works asp.net mvc model binding and those properties must also be individually nullable to indicate unsubmitted sections

5319189
post	get
if you are doing a search page i recommend passing the parameters using get instead of post

5319198
pull	push
developer a - local repository -- pull push --- github

5319198
pull	push
developer b - local repository -- pull push --- github

5319261
put	get
when i get the new latitude and longitude coordinates i need to put them into an html form as hidden fields

5319342
width	height
where 50 is the vertical scrollbar width and 0 is the horizontal scrollbar height

5319422
mp4	webm	vp8	ogg
basically i don t want to host and encode both mp4 and vp8 webm ogg

5319560
stdout	stderr
you re probably looking for proc_open which gives you the ability to work directly with stdin stdout and stderr as php streams meaning you can use the normal file reading and writing functions on them

5319571
rss	feed
to parse the following rss feed

5319571
rss	feed
i am well aware that using regular expressions to parse a context-free grammar is bad but in my case the regular expression is likely to work only for that rss feed it is a gmail inbox feed by the way and i know i can use an external library xml parser for this task it is only an exercise not an habit

5319600
fast-forward	merge
you can easily rebase feature branches in need of a review to keep them ahead of your main branch allowing the review to do a fast-forward merge and not have to worry about merge conflicts

5319618
google-chrome	firefox
basically a large gap appears between the main menu and the first item in the drop down it affects firefox ie google-chrome

5319649
opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari
this worked in opera safari ie and firefox

5319673
for-loop	loops
i m converting a for-loop to use nsoperations but most of the time the code just freezes at some point through loops

5319694
folder	directory
3 to package the myhelloworld class inside a jar i created the folder com mytest in the current directory and moved myhelloworld.java to that folder

5319725
opera	google-chrome
2 buggy with ie opera and even google-chrome

5319743
google-chrome	firefox
and it actually works in ie8 and firefox but in google-chrome i have underlined all the single textes inside the two child divs

5319833
mouse	keyboard
you cannot prevent them from taking a print screen while the hint is displayed but you can capture keyboard and mouse input so that they could not copy the text from the page

5319835
for-loop	arrays
with in the addmarker function we check and make sure we don t create duplicate marker on the map by calling the for-loop and if we the passed param has already been created then we return out of the function and do nothing else we create the marker and push it onto the global markers arrays

5319864
union	distinct
then to get everything that is at level x and above you do a distinct select on all of the children with a path_length x union with the root unless you included a record of null root 0 when you started your recursion looping

5319866
width	height
the visible area in a listview would be from x 0 to x width and from y 0 to y height

5319888
gif	png
along with jpg gif and png

5319888
reportlab	pdfrw
pdfrw can read and write pdf files and can also be used to read in pdfs which can then be used inside reportlab

5319927
post	get
if you still get errors also post item.h flight.h and common.h

5319978
backtracking	greedy
so it backtracking making the greedy quantifier match one less thing leaving the o at the end of the string unmatched

5319978
backtracking	greedy
that still doesn t match the f in the regex so it backtracking one more step making the greedy quantifier match one less thing again leaving the oo at the end of the string unmatched

5319978
backtracking	greedy
a possessive quantifier is just like the greedy quantifier but it doesn t backtracking

5319997
backtracking	greedy
if it were a greedy quantifier it would backtracking and try making the only match up to the next-to-last character then up to the third to last character then up to the fourth to last character which succeeds because only then is there a foo left after the has eaten the earlier part of the string

5319998
opera	firefox
anyway this works as intended in ie7 firefox and opera

5319998
google-chrome	safari
safari and google-chrome go quirky with it modified from

5319998
mouseover	mouseout
mouseover mouseout are the actual listeners explicitly called using apply 1 because i needed that height value for later and 2 because for some reason at least within jsfiddle it doesn t start out in the correct position and only if the listeners are called in that order will it get there

5320003
post	get
why should i use rest if i can get my job done with only post and get requests

5320027
submit	submission
this might be a really stupid and self-answering question i am stripping down my submission like so but need to submit to my table and also echo out the data to the screen

5320034
post	get
why do you think only using post and get means it s not rest

5320034
post	get	post	put	put	get
each uri potentially has get post put delete

5320039
post	get
post requests are by definition not idempotent so http caches will not cache these requests and results you still get the benefits of caching get requests without breaking your application s protocol

5320075
google-chrome	firefox

the second way should rather be using 2 different views one for portrait one for landscape and swapping the view controller s view in willrotatetointerfaceorientation

5328389
portrait	landscape
if the landscape and the portrait modes differ only by the position size of views i use the first one plus you ll get nice animations of the frame changes

example i ve heard that bl-classes are stateless by design entity classes or atleast that s what i call them - like person id name .. are stateful etc

5329618
stateless	stateful
anyways really short here s what i know bout stateful vs stateless

5329618

preorder	inorder	preorder	postorder	postorder	inorder
and i wrote the following programs to traverse trees preorder inorder and postorder

5330700
super	abstract
there is one more option if as i suspect you are using the command pattern - i have seen all the abstract interfaces super classes for command and response etc always go in the client side packages - those that are gwt compiled

5330720
put	get
we usually put such data into a staging table and then get rid of the duplicates in the staging table before we try to run a merge statement

5330812
postorder	inorder
and same for inorder and postorder

5330830
disk	ram

5330834
free	malloc
that is if my c++ application allocates memory in one thread using malloc will free successfully de-allocate the memory if called from another thread or can i expect it to throw an exception

5330860
free	malloc

webgl - not yet available except as beta in google-chrome and firefox

5330872

5330977
post	get
however that will only really work well if the target accepts this data as a get instead of as a post

folder	directory
this is natural and best practise for classpath resources but it requires you to create a matching set of folder in the directory where your configuration goes

5331225

hide	show
also the show and hide functions are easier than animating the opacity

5332147

here propertyname is a getter it s signature name exactly corresponds to your declared property name so if you want to check for setter presence you should add additional expression

5332161

csla	.net
csla .net is an open source framework created by rockford lhotka designed to help developers create a rich scalable reusable and maintainable business domain model for their application

5332654
csla	.net
csla .net also supports an architectural concept called mobile objects

5332654
csla	.net
the csla .net data portal enables this concept as well as completely abstracting any idea of the network from the application code

5332654
csla	.net
the platforms supported by csla .net include

5332654
csla	.net
the primary feature areas provided by csla .net are

5332654

objects created with csla .net

5332654
csla	.net
business rules csla .net includes a rules engine supporting business validation and authorization rules

5332654
csla	.net
linq csla .net collections are queryable and can optionally create live views so changes made to the results of a linq query are automatically synchronized with the original business object

5332654
csla	.net
mobile objects through the data portal csla .net supports 1- 2- 3- and 4-tier application deployments and allows an application to switch between deployment configurations without changing existing code

5332654
csla	.net
abstract persistence csla .net is not an orm and does not implement mapping to databases

it uses vml on ie and svg on other browsers

5332812
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
but even if not the api it s pretty hard to beat the argument that you can have rounded corners and other goodies that look the same on firefox 3.0+ safari 3.0+ google-chrome 5.0+ opera 9.5+ and internet explorer 6.0+ without using images

5332846
post	put
also i would strongly recommend you using the http post or put verb for something that is modifying state on the server

5332853
hash	md5
feed it into sha-1 or md5 or whatever hash function you have handy or feel like implementing

5332853
hash	md5
if the hash you re using is any good as md5 and sha-1 are

5332864
x86	64bit
supports x86 32 and 64bit and is in the process of supporting arm

5332876
viewdidload	viewdidappear

5332888
ienumerable	ilist
is there a collection class of type ilist or ienumerable that has a flag i can check or event that can be triggered if the collection changes either by add remove or update

problem is i am supposed to set the width and height in the carousel settings or leave those values blank to use the ones for the first banner

5332944
client-side	server-side
i heard that server-side code translates into client-side code

5332944
client-side	server-side
of course i don t care about server-side being translated into client-side but i am wondering if client-side programming needs to be done explicitly and to what degree

5332994
client-side	server-side
you said that you heard that server-side code translates into client-side code

5332994
client-side	server-side
so to answer your question yes you ll need to know some client-side things in order to do server-side code

5333028
uiview	subviews
i have a big problem concerning the resizing of a derived uiview with a uiscrollview as subviews

5333028
width	height
so i set the new frame which will update the width height an then i call to force the uiscrollview to update its frame in the layoutsubviews message of my view

5333039
post	get
ye olde method was indeed propagating the token as a get or post variable throughout the process which easily breaks hence still the possibility in the session settings to enable it automatically with url_rewriter.tags

5333040
memcpy	strcpy
you might use strcpy or memcpy or even a for-loop

5333059
uiview	calayer

5333099
popover	tooltip
i m looking for some sort of jquery popover or tooltip that opens onclick or onhover

5333114
jobs	cron
i tried looking into cron jobs but that only runs a script on a set time

5333114
jobs	cron
so thus cron jobs are not applicable here

5333170
pop-up	dialog	qtableview	qtextedit
under normal circumstances the qtableview data model works great just not when i pop-up this dialog and ironically the pop-up isn t using any qtableview at all just standard widgets like qlineedit qtextedit etc.

5333174
jobs	cron
why do you dismiss cron jobs

5333182
jobs	cron
you could still have cron jobs just lots of them not one per user but maybe one per minute

5333194
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome 9 and firefox 3.6 and opera 11 figure has no margin

5333211
width	height
the early-out looks a bit weird - how come if all four children on the rhs are null then the x y height width aren t copied

5333224
svg	vml
fortunately on ie you can use vml instead of svg

5333224
svg	vml
unfortunately you can t use jquery to animate svg and vml objects easily

5333224
svg	vml
it uses vml on ie and svg on other bowsers

5333224
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it works on firefox 3.0+ safari 3.0+ google-chrome 5.0+ opera 9.5+ and internet explorer 6.0+

5333224

5333252
subtraction	addition
i have to implement functions such as addition and subtraction of two sets of strings

5333260
getter	setter
whether you should use a django model or the cache backend really depends on your use case but you just described a contrived example or does your web app consist of a getter and a setter

5333334
children	parent
this is because a parent class can have multiple children

5333353
inherited	properties
inherited aka extend allows you to extend child classes based on the properties and methods of their parent class

is there a better way to do this so it will load correctly in both landscape and portrait and fill the screen when rotated

5333433
tstringlist	tlist
when you check the application with aqtime you can see the number of tstringlist tlist etc all the objects the database class uses growing and shrink - but checking the memory with proexplorer and with windows task manager the delphi 2007 version grows really fast

5333464
hide	show
i have had experiences with browsers and platforms giving me slightly different implementations of my show hide code

5333467
g++	gcc
if your compiler is gcc g++ then either -m64 is the default and therefore redundant in the second project or should be added to the first project

5333478
submit	submission
here is a handler that i developed to do a submit on enter that also tries to eliminate submission when the user uses enter to select an option in a field such as auto complete

5333493
uploadify	plupload
i am currently using uploadify to push files directly to s3 but would be happy to use plupload

5333493
uploadify	plupload
uploadify and plupload both rely on flash or silverliht runtime to interact directly with s3

5333493
webrat	cucumber
i am unaware of a way for cucumber or webrat to be able to interact with the flash or silverlight to click the browse button and select a file

5333495
free	malloc
this way if the string array has been allocated with malloc it can safely be free again

5333549
factors	matrix
from what i ve read once you decompose the term-document matrix with the svd to create u s v you need to multiple the singular values s with the left factors matrix v

doing anything beyond simple http get post is always a pain in flash and multipart post is particularly tricky

5333632
put	get
if i put php code in www folder i get the page but the code isn t interpreted

5333652
int	double
i learned obj c using kochan book and he classifies i for int f for float d for double

5333762
post	get
what is the best and easiest way to get the http body from the post request and parse it with variables

5333770
width	height
that constant is used to specify a layout width or height so in xml

5333790
post	get
you re a little unclear in your question if what you re asking is how to get the values of post variables then php has the _post super global that you can reference as _post key

5333790
post	get
if what you re asking is how to get some xml or something from the post body and parse it for values you might try the http_raw_post_data super global

5333800
client-side	server-side
client-side developer asking a question that i think has a server-side answer

5333886
nsstring	nsdata

for some reason when i put this line in the xml code my graphical layout shows the time white but i get an error saying error no resource found that matches the given name at textcolor with value androidcolor white

5333932
equals	compareto
you should either use the equals method or compareto

5333990
action-filter	onactionexecuting
when you create a custom action-filter by inheriting from the actionfilterattribute class you can override four virtual methods that run in the following order onactionexecuting onactionexecuting onresultexecuting and onresultexecuted

5334039
opera	firefox
i would recommend you try enabling pipelining in firefox and try it there or just use opera shudder

5334120
versioning	upgrade
you re running the rtm versioning you should upgrade to a newer versioning - at least sp1

5334122
hide	show
how can i dynamicaly toggle show hide each block independently so when i toggle in one section it doesnt toggle the other section

5334137
jvmti	jni
as far as i could check the only way to do that is using jvmti through a jni interface

5334236
struts	wicket
others are primarily concerned with view and controller logic and do not include a specialized data access component -- gwt struts spring mvc and wicket among many others

5334268
hex	binary
i first created a simple binary file in a hex editor that reads as follows

5334268
int	chars
after opening this file in binary mode and reading 4 bytes into an array of chars how can i use bitwise operations to make chars 0 bits be the first 8 bits of an int and so on until the bits of each chars are part of the int

5334303
oncreate	onstart
oncreate may not be the best place for it as the application is loading try using it onstart

5334310
updatepanel	formview
in this page i have 3 updatepanel nested ..one updatepanel contains one formview and

5334310
updatepanel	formview
other will contain one grid and a 4 formviews will make visible of user selection..4 of the won t come at time..depends on grid view item i will get visible..like grid view record is type one then type one formview will visible on the page ..one updatepanel is parent update panel.

5334326
serializable	deserialization
yes you can try around xml serializable deserialization concepts

5334357
mvvm	delegatecommand
just about all the decent mvvm frameworks contain them prism has delegatecommand mvvmlight has relaycommand etc but it s not too hard to write your own.

5334371
division	logarithm
it doesn t matter if those are natural binary or common logarithm because of the division by log 2 which calculates the logarithm with base 2 .

5334440
pop-up	dialog
i opened a pop-up using jquery dialog it contains all asp.net controls submit textbox

5334452
width	height
it has all 3 dimensions length width and height

5334488
post	get
note if you post your actual code here you might get more tailored help but i think this will get you going

5334589
subtraction	addition
i m not sure why the comparison is working for addition and not subtraction especially since the output values are identical in both cases

5334660
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in firefox but not in google-chrome

5334660
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome the inner loop is run the same amount of times as it is in firefox but the font size doesn t change at all

5334667
width	height
it uses a div element with an explicit width and height set dynamically computed via the javascript and is absolutely positioned to the top left

5334680
get	http-post
http-post or get based communication with a php script

5334689
implements	extends
most likely what you are looking to do is implements a widgetprovider which basically means extends android.appwidget.appwidgetprovider and overriding two methods

5334689
implements	extends
to communicate out information the widget provider like any broadcast receiver extends context and can issue startactivity intent or startservice intent i think this is most likely what you need to do unless you really are implements a widget host

5334733
getter	setter
atomic in a property declaration means that the getter setter will ensure that a whole value is get set regardless of what other threads might be doing simultaneously

5334747

5334819
width	height
i want to use the height and width to find the usable space of the screen

5334914
filtering	grouping
use dataview.getlength and dataview.getitem index to access filtering paged grouping data

5334919
postgresql	mysql
postgresql even has pattern matching - i don t know for mysql

5334929
google-chrome	firefox
i test it here and it works fine for both firefox and google-chrome

5334963
min	max
use max and min functions of php

5334965
submit	submission
i want to persist the selected value when that form is opened again and while submission if user doesn t select any value from drop down meaning the default value is present i want to give an alert to the user and then not to allow a submit until till the user selects an option from the dropdown

5334992
min	max
this is ok because php has some functions to find the min and max of an array

5335129
des	aes	des	rsa	rsa	aes
i have no idea how to do it for the php end but i m sure you can find a way to decrypt from standard algorithms such as des aes rsa

5335135
innodb	myisam
magento utilizes innodb heavily for transactions and myisam where appropriate for fulltext indexes

5335144
post	get
for some reason the application is calling a get on user_sessions after the post user_sessions which sends my credentials to linkedin

5335164
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
did you untick the wants full screen setting in ib either for the uinavigationcontroller or uiviewcontroller

5335212

i notice that a window for gnuplot always pops up and grabs the focus of my mouse and keyboard momentarily

5335249
actionscript	mxml
i am an actionscript developer and i know nothing when it comes to mxml

5335263
sorting	filtering
i m not sure i get the question but if you want to apply the sorting to the filtering objects you might want to add some sort of caching different from django s builtin caching that stores the filtering queryset and sort that

5335263
sorting	filtering
or you can pass the filtering option around using django s session management and redo the sorting query

5335263
sorting	filtering
now your sorting methods can get the filtering values that was passed originally

5335310
folder	directory
so if you are running it from the folder of your local filesytem on the file protocol it has no server and does not know that a blank directory should request index.html

5335317
width	height
the image will surely take up larger space when it rotates especially if the image is a rectangle because the height and the width are of different sizes

5335317
width	height
you will find that the paper now takes up half of its former height and double its former width

5335317
width	height
the usual solution is to make a square dimension containment with the height or width of the image whichever is higher then add a quarter to that value to accommodate the change in dimension when rotating

5335336
opera	firefox
if you manually use html5 audio then remember that firefox and opera don t support mp3

5335336
mp3	ogg
safari and ie don t support ogg vorbis but support mp3

5335336
mp3	wav	mp3	ogg	wav	ogg
chrome supports both mp3 and ogg vorbis but doesn t support wav

5335339
gif	png
you need to change to type of the image from gif to png

5335361
onresume	onpause
you could use events onresume onpause etc

5335376
int	chars	int	double
in other words binary code for setdefaultarray setarraysize fillarray and other member functions which you explicitly or implicitly call in your generic algorithm will be generated for int double chars and std string template arguments

5335384
stdout	stderr
and -u means unbuffered binary stdout and stderr

5335386
postgresql	mysql
this can be done in sqlite if you give the pk an int type and save the pk of the object to it instead of using a foreign key like you would with mysql postgresql

5335397
min	max
i assumed a sum of the durations here but you might want a min or max or perhaps even an overall delta

5335425
mouse	keyboard
there are many questions relating to simulating mouse keyboard input in wpf and windows for that matter

5335465
folder	directory
once you ve turned on personal web sharing yourusername will point to the sites directory in your user s folder in mac os users yourusername sites

5335492

5335586
portrait	landscape
and my app supports landscape as well as portrait orientations

5335593

a two dimensional array is just an array of arrays so just use payroll.length to get the height and to get the width assuming all rows are the same width

5335631
httpconnection	downloading
you can use httpconnection to downloading file over http https

5335655
junit	testng
unit tests can be of type junit 3 junit 4 or testng

5335655
junit	testng
for junit 4 or testng tests appropriate annotations will be automatically added

5335697
hide	show
probably the easiest way to hide and show the view is to adjust the alpha property on the view

5335727
portrait	landscape
and just for the sake of staving off any confusion it s probably worth mentioning you need to use the width of the status bar in landscape mode because uiwindow s coordinate system always works as though it s in portrait despite how you hold the device

5335727
uiview	subviews
this is in contrast to subviews uiview instances that get managed by a uiviewcontroller which benefit from automatic coordinate transformations

5335752
lwjgl	jogl
if you switch to lwjgl jogl or other libraries they often provide their own components

5335774
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
put a breakpoint on in table s parent view s viewwillappear and viewdidappear probably in the latter

5335785
hide	show
the control has a dropdownlist that according to user choice hide or show different panels

5335793
google-chrome	firefox
this worked in google-chrome and firefox and if a scenario was tagged selenium but in my tests while the fill_in and click_button steps passed the create action in my controller was not being called

5335797
sorting	filtering
i have a dataset of several million rows i am trying to page through with custom sorting and filtering but i am getting poor performance even with indexes on all the fields that i sort by and filtering by

5335804
jgit	egit
javagit egit and jgit

5335804
jgit	egit
i know that javagit and egit jgit are different

5335804
jgit	egit
what i don t understand is the difference between egit and jgit

if your host supports ipv6 you can use the scope component of the multicast address this is the x in the multicast prefix ff0x to implicitly restrict both incoming and outbound packets to the local host by specifying a scope of 1 use the ipv6 multicast address ff01 107 for the name service server on the local host only

5340538
setcontentview	findviewbyid
you won t be able to manipulate your view from the java side before your setcontentview call because findviewbyid r.id.yourview will return null unless the view in question is actually on the screen

5340557
jar	war
i m sure the javascript can be improved--i m no expert--but it seems to work well-enough for me running antunit tests to make sure my osgi manifests are created correctly. as an added bonus it loads from either a jar or ear or war file or a stand-alone manifest file

5340626
disk	ram
you might want to set file_upload_max_memory_size which will force files larger than that size to be streamed to disk rather than allowed to continuously consume ram

bounds java.awt.rectangle x 1280 y 0 width 1280 height 1024

5340820
packets	multicast
you may have figured this out already since the question is now 2 years old but to do multicast on a single host you only have to do two things 1 make sure that your receiving multicast sockets have so_reuseaddr set so that multiple processes can bind the same multicast address and 2 make sure your sending multicast sockets have ip_multicast_loop set so that packets will be looped back to receivers on the same system

dictionary	map
for the sake of clarity i will assume in the rest of this post that i am dealing with a dictionary map where the key string is the word and the value string its definition

5341184
dictionary	map
the way i found of doing this is to declare a second map the binding map that just binds each key of the dictionary to an integer

5341212
accessor	properties
if you change properties values using standard accessor methods core data will observe the resultant change notification and so invoke willsave again before saving the objectÃ¢ s managed object context

dbcontext	objectcontext
both generators produce the same entities however ado.net poco entity generator is based on objectcontext s api whereas ado.net dbcontext generator is based on dbcontext s api

5341243
dbcontext	objectcontext
dbcontext s api has a few very nice new features local query on navigation property etc. and api is somehow simplified but at the same time it looks like some features used in objectcontext api are missing in dbcontext api or at least it has not been explored enough yet

5341243
dbcontext	objectcontext
objectcontext api or dbcontext api

5341284
getter	setter

5341463
getter	setter
as i know one of the benefits using dto is that you can make all domain fields as public and remove all that stub code with getter and setter

what do you think about removing getter and setter from dto s too

5341497
calloc	malloc
you malloc calloc

5341526
fast-forward	merge
finally the merge of master with wip was just to fast-forward master to the end

5341526
fast-forward	merge
merge was just the safest of these because if something weird had happened it would have let you know that it was not a simple fast-forward

fixed-point is not worth the trouble anyway while that may be true on my platform i was creating this to improve the execution speed of my code on a platform where there was no floating-point hardware

5341671
google-chrome	firefox
i would recommend using firefox or google-chrome with the web developer toolbar to make html css validation easier

macvim	textmate
as changelog pointed out the absolute best way to get macvim to behave like textmate is to use janus

5341889
macvim	textmate
in order to launch mvim the way that you launch textmate with mate project_dir an mvim script is included in the macvim download

wtl uses atl _atlbasemodule.getresourceinstance for the module handle in its win32 calls

5341970
children	parent
that is a2 s immediate child becomes the child of it s parent along with its children

5341982
config	ini
then use an ini config file or a database to keep track of what you should load

5342013
qthread	qmutex
if there is a lot of data as you imply in your question make the shared memory available to both either by having it in a separate module or by using the pointer that was created when creating the qthread object and protect access to the memory with a shared qmutex

5342041
int	double
using the different tryparse methods that are defined on the int double datetime and other types in the bcl you can see if the passed in string is parseable to one of more of these types

5342060
move	drag
i have a jtable where the rows can be move with drag drop

unfortunately i cannot use boost and limited to stl

5342090
tabcontrol	tabitem
i want to expand the software by adding in a second set of ui elements that collect different data for database b and i want to navigate between them using tabs at the top so using tabcontrol and tabitem

5342090
tabcontrol	tabitem
i tried seeing if i could change the root element of the software from a navigationwindow to a page that contains a navigationwindow inside of tabitem since only page implements tabcontrol but i have not figured out how to do this if it can even be done

5342103
gmail	hotmail
if the email s an html mail and particularly if the receiver s going to be viewing it in a web-based email hotmail gmail yahoo etc... or an email client that supports html views then injection into the body is definitely a concern - xss can happen anywhere

5342336
vsto	add-in
i ve only recently started on the vsto add-in and noticed that now when i attempt to debug my xll i can t attach to an existing excel process

5342336
vsto	add-in
if i disable the vsto add-in then this problem goes away and i can debug the xll by attaching to the process

5342348
put	get
but i can t figure out how to get them all put in a foreach and output correctly

5342350
put	get
the issue i m experiencing is that i can get download files just fine but when i try to put upload them onto another server i get an eoferror exception

5342362
hide	show
successive show hide events can more simply use the form s visible property or show hide methods

5342366
indexof	hasownproperty
here s my full code so you can mess around and point out if i did something that invalidates my testing somehow but this seems to make sense to me using indexof it needs to iterate across the set until it finds the object assuming a purely linear collection not a tree same with hasownproperty needs to get list of all properties and iterate across them unless there s a mechanism built-in to find the property more efficiently

5342451
width	margin
why don t you just use and with a fixed width or a fixed margin

5342467
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this has worked fine in all major browsers ie7 8 firefox google-chrome safari opera for some time but when i upgraded to ie9 the banner is displayed with a 1 pixel shim on the right-hand edge which is throwing the layout off

5342510
put	get
but the whole problem of programming is we can never be sure of what our application is going to get put through

5342517
fixed-point	fractions
well there are fixed-point formats and fractions basically a specialized form of symbolic computation but neither are very popular probably because they don t have any benefits over float-point except for very specific applications

5342536
vbscript	jscript
one problem is that afaik jscript is unable to differentiate vbscript types on its own

5342536
vbscript	jscript
to jscript any com or vbscript object has

5342536
vbscript	jscript
the following could work Ã¢ but only when the json.stringify call is done within brackets since thatÃ¢ s the only time when both jscript and vbscript sections would both have been parsed and executed

5342536
vbscript	jscript
the basic principle should work iÃ¢ m not 100 certain of the possibility to pass a jscript function reference from vbscript

5342579
dns	spf
wrong dns setup blacklisted on dnsbls invalid dkim or spf setup invalid headers or mail encoding .

5342645
hide	show
a simple toggle to hide and show areas works perfectly i need to add a class to the p tag of the one that is open and remove it when its closed

5342666
int	double
i have a class that handles several numeric arrays type double and also needs to handle an array of descriptors which will include a mix of strings and int which need to be utilized as strings and numbers accordingly

5342719
clang	icc
vs is notably famous for being extremely lax in template code validation and template code that was accepted and compiled by vs will often be rejected outright by more compliant compilers clang comeau icc gcc .

5342962
post	get
when i change the drop down it submits but php does not get any post data

5342971
google-chrome	firefox
now the problem is that under google-chrome this code works smoothly but under firefox 3.6.15 when i resize the window then it takes a while to work

5342977
google-chrome	firefox
i can t figure out why this is happening and especially why firefox is able to access the resources while ie and google-chrome can t

5343023
rss	feed
in fact i just did a discussion search myself and found the resulting pages to have wildly differing layouts and not all of them have rss feed or use standard forum software

5343028
portrait	landscape
i have an ipad app with two different views one for portrait one for landscape

5343052
min	max
there are methods like min and max already available

5343052
intersect	contains
ienumerable also exposes methods like contains intersect and union - so ranges cannot only be queried they also can be combined

5343060
hash	md5
i don t have the code but you could generate an md5 hash code out of the album art

5343076
implements	extends
when i implements a custom widget which wraps a docklayoutpanel should i let it extends composite or resizecomposite

5343118
g++	gcc
so if you had one file called test.cpp that had two functions declared in it but one of them was unused you could omit the unused one with the following command to gcc g++

5343128
post	get
it will show you exactly what that javascript event sent to the server get or post + the data even if it is https - as well as the server response

5343169
awt	swing
this will be significantly easier if you already know something about awt or swing

5343171
jlist	jtree
most out-of-the-box swing components have support for this built in jtree jlist etc

5343234
nsmutablestring	nsstring
it sounds like it must be getting set to an nsstring instead of an nsmutablestring

5343260
post	get
i thought this would be equivalent to what i have above using the fluent api but i get a strange error i will post below

5343329
hide	show
you can show hide the background by yourself instead of using triggers

5343361
xmlhttprequest	jqxhr
i know of no way to access the xmlhttprequest object from jqxhr

5343379
width	height
when i look at onsurfacechanged it is being called once when the phone is powered on with width 480 height 800 then again when after the phone is unlocked with width 800 height 480

5343379
width	height
i am calling gl.glfrustumf each frame with the correct new width height data collected from onsurfacechanged but something is still making my window appear skinny and tall any ideas

5343379
width	height
it appears as if the surfaceview thinks the width is the height and the height is the width

5343379
width	height
i did more printing of the surface view s width and height and get this output

5343379
width	height
so the width and height appear to fix themselves sometime after onwindowfocuschanged but graphically it never looks correct

5343429
inherited	properties
settings done in properties sheet are inherited in every project

5343462
powerpc	i386
in that case your binary must have been compiled for three architectures i386 powerpc and x86_64

5343462
powerpc	i386
note however that in sdk 10.5 cocoa was not available for x86_64 so you will have to use sdk 10.6 for the x86_64 variant while keeping sdk 10.5 for the i386 and powerpc variants

5343501
tinyurl	bit.ly
a classic example to me is tinyurl bit.ly

5343564
docx	.doc
i need to be able to view a file .doc docx .pdf .txt .....ect in the system.windows.forms.webbrowser c# visual studio 2008 on a system that does not have office installed on it

5343591
profiling	instrumentation
also you can use instrumentation with the cpu profiling instrumentation to detect the bottleneck within your code

5343593
spidermonkey	chakra
definitely there ll differences between the javascript engines - chakra spidermonkey v8 and others as the implementations will vary and their support for non-standard features

5343622
google-chrome	firefox
and once you get a large suite of thousands of functional acceptance regression tests it will take hours to run even with faster browser such as the new ie9 firefox or google-chrome

5343622
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
the easy to code very rubyesque watir api and the broad browser support ie firefox google-chrome opera headless of the selenium webdriver back-end

5343626
postgresql	mysql
the row locking of h2 seems relatively immature compared to mysql or postgresql

5343626
postgresql	mysql
in addition mysql and postgresql also provide replication mechanisms instead of rolling your own

5343626
postgresql	mysql
lastly although i ve not run this performance test i suspect that although h2 is lightening fast for small to mid sized databases as you increase the database size and especially the number of concurrent queries mysql and postgresql will start to equal and then best its overall performance -- especially looking at query time distribution

5343654
japplet	jdialog
i have a japplet which contains an about button which when pressed creates a new jdialog

5343655
hash	salt
that said phpass portable hash does store the salt in its hash

5343655
hash	md5
also phpass uses php_version during the generation of those hash to check if the md5 function available with that version supports the parameter

5343665
folder	directory
i have a folder in my root mamp directory site

5343676
accessor	ivar
which will invoke ivar s corresponding accessor method

5343676
accessor	ivar
thus you will directly access ivar and not it s corresponding accessor method obtaining additional benefit - performance

5343711
plink	prompt
now the problem is when plink prompt the process.standardoutput.readtoend

5343711
plink	prompt
hangs and i have no way of figuring out whether i m prompt by plink to accept the key or actually logged into the linux server

5343717
width	height
6 in the event for disclosure triangle click use nsalert s saved window frame to adjust the height size and width of nsalert

5343760
squash	merge
you can also rebase onto the existing base and use the interactive session to squash or skip commits then merge that if you want it to appear as a merge instead of direct commits

5343779
xfce	gnome
open suse lets you select xfce as your desktop environment and xubuntu is an ubuntu variant that uses xfce instead of gnome

5343779
xfce	gnome
you might want to look at one of these options if you re running in a vm since xfce is slightly lighter weight than gnome although not all that much lighter these days

5343797
hide	show
and then this is the jquery code that hide or show them

5343829
post	get
looking at this blog post you might be able to get the behavior your are looking at by doing the following

5343850
fseek	fread
now we can read just the third column using the functions fread and fseek

5343897
spock	easyb
i just had brief looks at easyb and spock both seem to be similar however spock seems to be more technically oriented is there any best practice regarding when to use which

5343944
filtering	grouping
there is not currently a way on market to filtering for private grouping

5343988
getter	setter
you can of course get the desired effect by manually writing your property getter setter methods

5344005
mousemove	mousedown	mousemove	mouseup	mouseup	mousedown
as the title states i d like to know if there is a way to prevent mouse events specifically mousemove and not mousedown mouseup from propagating to a child control

5344049
hex	binary
also how easy would it be to switch between the binary representation and the hex representation

5344050
width	height
the problem happens when i change the parent s x y or width height and the drawn object got a bad effect like left blur

5344067
width	height
the format for imagedata returned from the function read is a 4-d array where your dimensions are in order frame height frame width image depth 3 for rgb images and number of frames

5344076
inherited	properties
uitableview is inherited from uiscrollview so use scrollenabled properties of uiscrollview

5344107
hex	binary
also how easy would it be to switch between the binary representation and the hex representation

5344132
try-catch	exception-handling
the try-catch construct for exception-handling handling is used by a wide group of languages like c# c++ matlab python and java

5344133
try-catch	exception-handling
try-catch is a syntactic construct for catching exception-handling raised by a code section

5344202
range	max
the matrix is small max 10x10 and values are in range from 0 to 99

5344215
gdal	arcgis
i think the issue was related to gdal dropping support of the format due to a conflict with arcgis unbelievable

5344308
google-chrome	firefox
how many parallel requests does the latest version of google-chrome firefox ie support

5344321
stdout	stderr
the implementation is solid and works however i found its not too useful since you can t specifically extract things like stderr or exit status because the commands run in a sub-shell so you can only get stdout

5344393
post	get
this should pass the get parameters as well as the post ones

5344409
public	protected
the way that i ve dealt with this issue in the past is to create 2 methods a public one in the base class and a protected abstract one perhaps virtual with no implementation as well

nsoperation	nsinvocationoperation
given that requirement which is the better approach just wrapping up the expensive method call in an nsinvocationoperation or writing an nsoperation subclass from scratch

5344667
nsoperation	nsinvocationoperation

5345267
mp3	wav
are you certain you don t mean a boolean and instead of an or extension is neither wav nor mp3

5345276
mp3	wav
if your variable strext was equal to wav it would not be equal to mp3 and versa-visa

5345276
mp3	wav
i think what you re trying to say is something like neither wav nor mp3

5345276
mp3	wav
which is logically equivalent to not wav and not mp3

5345298
mp3	wav
if you want to get into second if when strext is not equal to both wav and mp3 you need to use an operator

5346176
apache	nginx
you will probably always want an apache or nginx running as a boring web server to handle serving all the static files the sendfile 2 system call makes serving static pages from a real web server very fast it removes the double-copy of copying data into the process memory from disk only to copy the memory into the kernel for the network card -- by telling the kernel which filedescriptor s contents you want sent over which socket the kernel can arrange to copy data directly from disk to kernel memory for the network card

multiplying	add
in a modern cpu s instruction pipeline this could be more like start a loading start b storing wait for a to load multiplying by 2 wait for b to store return instead of start a loading start b storing wait for a to load wait for b to store start a loading wait for a to load add a to c return and you start to see why the potential for aliasing can have a significant effect on performance

5347042
int	chars
performance of built-in types chars vs short vs int vs

5347042
int	chars
are 8-bit chars and 16-bit short int types slower than native 32-bit int

comparator	comparable
the thing to take away from this is to implement comparable so that you can implement your own custom comparator method thats automatically called when you sort an arraylist

5347325
comparator	comparable
since comparator is defined by comparable while a comparator must implement compare that tells you that your class must be declared as which means that it must have a comparator method

5347339

versioning	upgrade
if your code is sufficiently different depending on the api versioning you re using you might want to fork your code and then merge it again later when you are confident most of your user base has upgrade to the api level you need

5353392
post	get
since the first query is just to get a list of post in the menu you probably don t need that huge select statement

5353461

5353513
disk	ram
my assumption in the question above is that disk is as fast as ram or faster than ram

5353513
disk	ram
the question really is if speed is high and cost of access is low from a certain disk can ram be eliminated

5353544
folder	directory
downloaded the libxml2 from ftp ftp.zlatkovic.com libxml and put the libxml-folder from the include folder in the devkit include directory for mingw in my case sth

5353574
disk	ram
because disk access is orders of magnitude slower than ram access

5353574
disk	ram
but if as you say disk access would be faster than ram there would be almost no reason to have ram

5353612
getter	setter
this means that for all class s it creates the setter and getter even though we wont want

5353630
firefox	safari
issue is that it is working safari firefox but not in ie

5353655
inherited	properties
when it inherited from control base class it would have many events and properties that may be not uses in usercontrol and i what to hide then in properties window

5353683
disk	ram
i m not very familiar with the options for interfacing with a ram disk via java but you re either going to end up with an inputstream which you can keep open for the life of the process and continually read from or you re going to continually poll from inside a while loop

5353711
versioning	upgrade
there is a versioning upgrade utility or versioning utility info here by infragistics

yes use the memory allocations and leaks profiling that are part of the instrumentation application

5353958
try-catch	exception-handling
because of the nature of the bug i placed the call inside a try-catch to log the exception-handling and then the exception-handling does not appear

you ll probably want to profiling it using the instrumentation app that comes with xcode

5353983

hide	show
show it when you start the request and then hide it when the request completes

5354083
serializable	deserialization
however i can t tell you right now if this cost is higher than the serializable and deserialization cost

5354108
getter	setter
as a side note i m using __get and __set in my page entity instead of full blown getter setter

setcontentview	findviewbyid
method findviewbyid r.id.share_to_twitter_webview returns null because you forgot to do setcontentview r.layout.main

5354294
qmail	exim
take a look at exim or qmail

5354304
post	get
i assume your example is a truncated version of your actual query so perhaps you should post what you are after to get a possibly more optimal query

5354384
post	get
whether or not you can use get post head delete etc will depend on the url and what s configured in the application that is running on the server at that url

5354393
width	height
no you would have to set the height width to the contents instead of the .wrap element itself

5354406

put	get
i have an instance of property which is abstract and i was using type inference to get the true type to pass to my ioc without having to resort to reflection to put together the right generic type

5354526
google-chrome	firefox
you can use google-chrome s console for simple stuff if it is not enough then there is tamper data plugin for firefox and for hardcore traffic inspection you can use wireshark analyzer

5354535
width	height
you re looking for the ihdr chunk and that contains the width and height

5354562
width	height
if you know for sure that you have a valid png file you can read the width and height from offsets 16 and 20 4 bytes each big-endian but it may also be a good idea to verify that the first 8 bytes of the file are exactly 89 50 4e 47 0d 0a 1a 0a hex and that bytes 12-15 are exactly 49 48 44 52 ihdr in ascii

5354564
redmine	chiliproject
i recommend the chiliproject fork of redmine

5354574
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome will return nothing but firefox will give you the json object

5354605
system.in	system.out
the short is yes but you have to build it using the standard output with system.out and using the scanner class to wait for new line input n from standard input from the system.in

5354619

5354752
ada	vhdl
don t forget ada and vhdl access types

5354805

5354841
stdout	stderr
in client i want to redirect stdout and stderr streams of child process to socket

5354901
profiling	debugging
i believe xcode will now handle this debugging team profiling automatically for you however i like telling it to use my development key as you know what it s doing and when they need renewing.

5354936
int	boolean	tinyint	boolean
if your field data is truly binary yes no true false enables disabled etc. then for the sake of cakephp conventions you should just use an int 1 or tinyint 1 field and then convert the boolean value to yes no etc in the view

5354963
gtk	cairo
the best way to do it would be to use a canvas like goocanvas which is made to work with gtk and draw with cairo

strdup	malloc	strcpy	malloc	strcpy	strdup
strdup does the malloc and strcpy for you

5355003
versioning	upgrade
they yielded separate hash results for the same string so now i need to get away from using string.gethashcode because i don t want to have to worry about this changing when i upgrade my app to to future versioning of .net

5355037
qlcdnumber	qspinbox
i have been trying to get the qlcdnumber to read the number in from the qspinbox

i need to print some pages with css backgrounds but they don t appear in safari or google-chrome in firefox there s an option in page setup but i haven t been able to find it in these two browsers

5355130
width	height
i tried creating an iconview extends imageview class which overrides onmeasure so that i could create image views of the necessary size by scaling the width depending on the height

5355130
width	height
2 how do i make my custom class get the height of the linearlayout so that i can calculate the necessary width for the custom images

5355133
google-chrome	firefox
if you have firefox and google-chrome open load the page in firefox and then in google-chrome the images appear

5355196
super	abstract
note also that the super calls in synchronizedtable Ã¢ s get and set methods statically refer to abstract methods in class table

5355201
vb6	vba
for vb6 but likely will work fine under vba

5355211
hash	md5
you could always use an md5 hash instead which is relatively fast

5355213
fgets	feof
you need to test feof fp after each fgets fp or test to see how many characters were returned by fgets fp or do a one-character get and unget

5355214
hash	md5
as a note sql server from 2008 supports has the function hashbytes that given some data a string for example can generate a md2 md4 md5 sha or sha1 hash

5355233
google-chrome	firefox
if you re using firefox take a look at firebug and if you re using google-chrome you already have one just hit ctrl+shift+j to pull up the console

5355244
stdout	stderr
since you are the proclaimed author of both server.exe and client.exe rather than trying to catch stdout stderr and redirecting it to a socket at that point you should re-engineer the client so that you re catching the text destined for stdout before it goes to stdout

5355250
phpstorm	webstorm
in phpstorm webstorm and mps is there a setting or way to get the peek functionality to show two lines on a control statement that is if or for or while when using allman bsd style coding braces on a separate line

5355362
width	height
to a database width height

5355365
free	calloc
by doing a free and then a new calloc call you are not guaranteed for the same memory space to be assigned to your array this could be a problem if you have a pointer to this array before doing that and try to use it later

5355376
inherited	subclassing
better yet would be to create a custom activity that all of your activities inherited from place the final processing logic in the ondestroy method of the custom activity and then have all subclassing call super.ondestroy in their ondestroy method

5355388
implements	extends
public class jokeview extends linearlayout implements radiogroup.oncheckedchangelistener

5355391
memset	calloc
so you can either use calloc or get the memory from somewhere else and use memset ptr 0 size

5355397
for-loop	loops
an alternative to the nested loops method you could use a while boolean loops method outside while boolean indicating whether a change was made for-loop internal

5355413
dictionary	map
i want to define a class on the fly with properties that map to the key value pairs from the dictionary and methods based on the type of data it represents

5355440
content-disposition	content-length
for instance are you explicitly setting the content-disposition header and the content-length headers

5355458
oncreate	setcontentview
just make sure in your oncreate to call setcontentview before you call super.oncreate

5355465
hash	md5
based on this the byte array should also be a pretty collision safe representation of the object graph and the md5 crc hash on this too

5355482
ant	maven	ant	emma
see the emma documentation for how to integrate emma into ant or maven scripts

5355574

5355602
haskell	ocaml
haskell does reduce and simplify some of the ocaml syntax

5355684
serializable	deserialization	public	protected
in implementing your custom exception you ll need to provide at a minimum the 3 standard public constructors plus the protected constructor and method required for serializable deserialization although the serialization-related constructor and method may be omitted if you ve not actually extended the base class

5355691
google-chrome	safari
i tried the same request on ios mobile browser google-chrome safari ie and the cookie information is sent on each request

5355718

5355888
width	height
the sizes of images get stretched even if cliptobounds is false and no width height is specified

5355950
tinyint	varchar
the choice of appropriate datatype entirely depends on how you ll be dealing with the table data in your application if any if you re having this table just for storing the records than varchar would be a better option since it ll make your data more verbose but if there s a processing to be done on the table data like filter results on certain criteria long names could be confusing when it comes to comparing them in the application logic and in such situations char or tinyint would be a better option

5355966
viewdidload	viewwillappear	viewdidload	viewdidappear	viewdidappear	viewwillappear
should be only implemented in viewdidappear because i tried it in viewwillappear and viewdidload and it s not working in the both methods

5356123
int	double
why don t applications typically use an int datatype such as int or long in c++ java c# to represent currency values internally as opposed to using a floating-point datatype float double or something like java s bigdecimal

5356123
int	double
obviously the int value would need to be translated from 100 to 1 or 1.00 before displaying it to a user or upon user input of a currency value but this doing this doesn t seem significantly more burdensome than formatting a double or a bigdecimal for display

5356196
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox

5356249
curlpp	libcurl
i ve downloaded curlpp libcurl and openssl

5356265
outputstream	inputstream
if you don t worry about using just java you could use the runtime class to execute the shell command withing java through exec command this will return you a process object on which you have either getinputstream and getoutputstream so you will then be able to process the output of both the java program and the shell command inside just one place and do whatever you want keeping it in memory and directly send it by redirecting the outputstream to the inputstream of what you use to send the mail with another exec or saving it or whatever

5356280

width	height
your datagrid s if present in a control like stackpanel has a fixed width and height doesn t have them as auto

entities	entitymanager
how do i reattach entities to the entitymanager after an ajax call

5356522
children	parent
so far the way we are doing this is to first fetch the human that will be the parent and then fetch the humans that will be the children and then add the children to an nsset property called children on the parent object

5356522
children	parent
this however requires fetching both the children and parent from core data which is slow especially given that we can have potentially tens of thousands of objects

5356523
jar	war
maven has support for jar war bin files but those seem to expect certain conditions to be true which don t apply for my flex projects i don t have a web.xml

5356523

5358250
getter	setter
in general setter and getter were a bad hack by the early gui builders borland to get around the fact that all variables should be private really this is absolutely necessary

5358250
getter	setter
a boilerplate setter getter is no better than a public member

5358250
getter	setter
they still allow full access to the variable at times the class can t control and still restrict in-class changes if your variable is an int you still have to change everything that calls the setter and getter to change the variable to a string

5358250
getter	setter
getter and setter encourage accessing the data of a class from outside the class

5358250
getter	setter
any code that accesses a member of a class should probably exist within that class as your design states and therefore shouldn t need setter or getter

5358250
getter	setter
a better pattern for those systems that need the cross-cutting variable access would be to access the variable directly through reflection but to call a setter or getter if one exists--making the setter and getter private if possible

5358254
getter	setter
for initializing it is also not good to call property setter and getter for much the same reason as above

5359013
put	get
many compilers put the vtable pointer at the beginning of the class so you could get it by casting your class pointer to a pointer pointer and retrieve it

5359066
int	double
can we not type cast an int pointer to a double type

5359067
min	max
i would like to create an advanced search form much like a job site would have one that would include criteria such as keyword job type min pay max pay category sub category etc.

it depends if you re in an environment running epo mcafee epolicy orchestrator or if your antivirus is standalone

5359091
int	double
int is usually aligned to 4 bytes on 32-bit hardware while double usually needs to be 8-byte aligned

5359093
int	double
on most platforms double is 8 bytes and int 4 therefore no you can not cast int to double and use it

5359096
int	double
you re not casting an int to a double you re casting an to a

5359177
for-loop	loops
this is not a case for a while loops if you want to loops a certain number of times always use a for-loop

5359295
getter	setter	mutators	setter	mutators	getter
if the code that uses a class only uses accessors mutators getter setter to access the object state then you can often make changes to the classes state representation and invariants while hiding the effects of the changes from the callers

5359295
subclass	accessor
an accessor or mutator method s behavior can typically be overridden in a subclass

5359295
getter	setter
it should also be noted that simple getter and setter methods are inlined by the jit compiler and therefore have minimal performance impact

as the command line arguments are treated as string array but given the condition when you are expecting command line argument other than string datatype that may be primitives boolean int byte short long float double chars than you need to parse the argument into the one what your program expects and here you use parsexxx methods to be precise parsexxx method take string argument and return the appropriate data type which you are trying to parse into

5362944
perforce	svn
you could work around the merge conflicts by putting the svn files into their dedicated branch inside the perforce folder then integrating merging the conflicts with their actual destination but this only brings additional work to solve a problem that shouldn t be there in the first place

5363017
folder	directory
it would me more relevant to check whether you do have a jre inside a directory of your hard drive and whether this jre is easily accessible via a reference of its bin folder in the path environment variable

innodb	myisam
innodb doesn t support auto_increment but no primary key being defined for the table but myisam does

5363228

what you would ideally want is to limit the image width and height within the view bounds

5363228
width	height
you will have to apply the same scale factor to both width and height to maintain the same aspect ratio

5363234
google-chrome	firefox
so google-chrome and firefox both look fine

5363234

addclass	removeclass
while removeclass kills all the classes the div get screwed up but adding just after that addclass cleanstate it goes back to normal

5363289

the other solution is to put an id attribute with the base css properties so they don t get deleted what also improves performance but i just want to know another solution to get rid of all except .cleanstate

5363296

int	double
it takes an image and returns a matrix with the pixels using double instead of int

5365881
post	get
i have been reading up on the post redirect get method but i dont wanna mess up tank auth

5365909
try-catch	exception-handling
to check if exception-handling was thrown inside error handler loop you must place dispatch in a try-catch block

5365920
switching	screens
the same goes for switching to another app like a screens capture app because the screens capture app will have focus instead of the browser causing the lock graphic to show

5365968
debian	linux
fyi running on debian linux

5365998
client-side	server-side
as a general rule of thumb at least in security you should trust no user so i think it would be the wise choice to validate the data client-side it s also faster and then if the first validation passed validate it server-side to double-check or to have a safety net if the user has javascript turned off something you don t see that often

5365999
puts	gets
in the code below the function uses http get to get xml representing a list of surveynames then gets the data from the xml and puts it in a html table

5366002
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
i recently figured out how to use objectoutputstream and objectinputstream to send objects over a simple java socket connection between a server and a client

5366083
outputstream	inputstream
i would suggest writing instrumented inputstream and outputstream which just pipe to from streams provided at construction time while counting the number of bytes going through

5366094
int	double
remember that the c++ language directly defines + for arguments of double and int there is no standard conversion involved

5366094
int	double
double operator+ double int -- requires one user-defined conversion and no standard conversions

5366094
int	chars
in this subclause the term promoted integral type is used to refer to those integral types which are preserved by integral promotion including int and long but excluding chars

5366100
versioning	upgrade
however this application can upgrade itself which is done by replacing the actual code written by me .py files with new versioning downloaded via the internet

5366105
nsoperation	nsautoreleasepool
according to the documentation you should create an nsautoreleasepool in the main method of your nsoperation

5366105
nsinvocationoperation	nsblockoperation
the documentation for nsinvocationoperation and nsblockoperation doesn t specify whether they create an autorelease pool for you so to be safe it would be best to create one when using those classes too

5366113
post	get
i m not sure how to what protocol i should use to send my fastcgi script the input output variables post get

5366127
background-image	background-position
the concept is to set the image as a background-image property of a container like a with a background-position of center center and the position of the container to relative or anything non-static

5366127
gif	png
the first is a position absolute clipping circle image of the color of your background either transparent png or gif i prefer the former and the next four are divs also with absolute positions that have left right top and bottom attributes set to 0 for each of the respective sides they will clip

5366127
width	height
the idea is to animate the top left width and height of the clipping circle image and synch up the width and height of the clipping divs using the step callback option of the .animate call by matching them to the current left and top values

5366215
mouse	keyboard
it allows you to launch a browser and programmatically control mouse clicks and keyboard presses to do exactly what you need

5366241
post	get
1 make the login post into a get

5366242
getter	setter
if you think you might need a more complicated getter or setter later the automatic property syntax lets you upgrade without recompiling all callers

5366281
ubuntu	linux
i need to install libgtk in ubuntu linux

5366282
post	get
if you want to send a get post request use or or the generic method

5366288
public	protected
public private protected

5366288
public	protected
also you can have get and set with public private and protected which can also

5366296
getter	setter
the real question you re asking and you might not even know it is why do you need properties or getter and setter in some other languages in the first place

5366296
accessor	properties	getter	setter
properties just offer a nicer syntax for getter and setter aka accessor and indeed a properties just wraps set and get methods under the hood

5366333
solaris	bsd
the hosts file is etc hosts in linux bsd os x solaris or c windows system32 drivers etc hosts in windows

5366333
solaris	bsd
you ll need to edit this file as root with sudo or pfexec in bsd linux solaris os x or as an administrator in windows

5366344
width	height
the width and height cannot be clicked upon also there is no uitableviewcontroller so i just used uiviewcontroller

5366344
width	height
change the width and height

5366382
google-chrome	safari
i know this works the way it should in google-chrome and i think safari since they are both webkit

5366406
put	get
however when i put it all together i get the following error

5366412
post	put
note put is idempotent and post not

5366447
post	get
the problem is when i curl the page to get the hash and when i include it as the post value in my next curl call to the same page the hash is not valid anymore since the succeeding curl cal is like the page refreshed already and it regenerated a new hash

5366513
punctuation	words
i am working with a text where all n s have been deleted which merges two words into one like i like bananasand this is a new line.and another one. what i would like to do now is tell python to look for combinations of a small letter followed by capital letter punctuation followed by capital letter and insert a whitespace

5366516
hide	show
in your case you hide your elements by default then show it again inside the load function after your binding has loaded

5366524
junit	testng
rather than putting your test steps in a database table it s probably better to use a testing tool like junit or testng to organize your tests

5366524
junit	testng
learn a testing framework like testng or junit

5366601
uiview	subviews
in the first case the uiwebview is a subviews of the uiview

5366612
dataoutputstream	bytearrayoutputstream
if that is the case just wrap a dataoutputstream on top of that bytearrayoutputstream and call writeint somesequencenumber before writing the image data to the stream

5366613
integer	unsigned
i ve tried to convert using a mask like so but if i 1 the other end of my stream a serial device expecting uint8_t thinks i ve sent an unsigned integer 6

5366643
onresume	onpause
i ended up using step 2 and setting my header object to null in onpause and resetting it in onresume that way the garbage collector could free up the resource

5366647
jdom	xerces
here is a variant that works if rome jdom and xerces are in the class path

5366683

unchecked exception generally happen at runtime example nullpointerexception illegalstateexception

5366949
uitableview	nsindexpath
i want to respond to a deleted event in the same way i would respond to a selected event where i get the dialogviewcontroller uitableview and nsindexpath

5366957
onresume	onpause
in your activity class implement the methods onpause onresume

5367001
ssl	https
you need to ensure the page is accessed through ssl https and you need to securely access your credit card processor

5367017
cvs	svn
change the use this reference source to a scm provider like cvs svn or git

5367024
hide	show
so i hide the comments in blog list page but i want to show comments count in list page

5367056
children	parent
how do i make the parent div be equal to the width of it s floating children

5367056
children	parent
the number of children in each parent varies and is unknown but the children must line up in a row without wrapping to a new line

5367056
children	parent
example if all three children are 150px the parent should become 450px so that none of the children wrap

5367056
children	parent
if there are two 150px children the parent should become 300px

5367056
children	parent
but the parent needs to vary based on it s children and not be a fixed width

5367064
maven	pom.xml	maven-dependency-plugin	pom.xml
resolving duplicate jars with maven is best done with a combination of the maven-dependency-plugin and maven-enforcer-plugin under maven or sbt s dependency graph plugin then adding those jars to a section of your top-level pom.xml or as imported dependency elements in sbt to remove those dependencies

5367130
hide	show
you also need to initially hide the image and show the loader gif

5367131
post	get
i know what get and post methods are in ajax but i was wondering how to implement them into a simple code so i can understand it better and here s a simple code i found

5367144
post	get
you need to post code to get a really accurate answer

5367168
valgrind	memcheck
i would run the program under valgrind memcheck

5367215
superclass	subclassing
in case you want to enforce the subclassing have their own version of printme just make the printme method in the superclass as abstract

5367230
superclass	subclassing
i would define an abstract method called .print on the superclass in such a way every subclassing of car must override it and have your own way of printing

5367245
mp3	wav	mp3	ogg	wav	ogg
i d expect audio formats with little compression like wav and midi to consume fewer cpu cycles than mp3 or ogg at the cost of higher ram usage

5367254
getter	setter
update note that getter and setter may simply get or set an instance variable but they might also do a lot of work such as going into the db and check the existence of a record and if not create it etc

5367266
int	double
you re comparing a double with a constant which is problematic for floating points numbers using int selected will probably do better or in case you need to use a double try using something like

5367273
min	max
you ll need to adjust the min max instance properties of the asg to accomodate whatever use case you re trying to satisfy

5367278
union	distinct
take into account that the union operator selects only distinct values by default whereas union all will also select duplicates

5367289
getter	setter
the need to use self in the setter is to avoid ruby setting the value as a local variable while the lack of the use of self only works in the getter instance when there is no local variable of the same name being used in that context

5367318
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
make sure that you re nextwindow uiviewcontroller has reference to the uinavigationcontroller

5367345
mp3	wav	mp3	ogg	wav	ogg
as for wav mp3 aac ogg all of those have the same technique which is what paul suggests in his answer

5367350
autocomplete	autosuggest
personally i would consider gwt too heavy to just add an autosuggest to a simple web page and instead use something like jquery autocomplete

5367358
postorder	inorder
we know the pre-order inorder and postorder traversals

5367362
getter	setter
the code in the .m file is instructing the objective-c compiler to automatically generate getter and setter for the animationlayer property using the _animationlayer variable to hold the actual value that is set

5367362
accessor	properties
setting the value using the properties accessor does

5367372
int	chars
i m thinking i d have to read in the size maloc an array and then maybe read in a string full of data then loop through each chars in the data cast it to an int and stick it in the appropriate index

5367397
getter	setter
if you are willing to break the conventions you can write your setter using jquery style using the same method for getter and setter depending of whether it has arguments or not

5367411
post	get
post and get

5367457
subtract	add
simple when the song changes set a variable foo somewhere to the current time and set another variable bar to the new song s current playback time usually gonna be 0.0 . when the song changes again subtract the value of foo from the current time then add the value of bar

5367470
width	height
the trouble is that when the second ball comes into contact with a stage boundary and is supposed to simply reverse its x or y velocity depending on the boundary hit it also apparently increases its width and height properties for some odd reason

5367470
width	height
the graphic doesn t change but the values of width and height do drastically and this results in some stuckhandler methods i ve defined for the odd situation where a ball ends up partially offstage getting called repeatedly

5367470
width	height
nowhere in the code do i change width height or scalex scaley properties so i have no idea why this is happening

5367470
width	height
width height properties indicates the width height of the display object in pixels

5367470
width	height
the width height is calculated based on the bounds of the content of the display object

5367470
width	height
when you set the width height property the scalex scaley property is adjusted accordingly

5367470
width	height
via debugging print statements i found that at the point where the width and height expand the scalex and scaley properties remain at 1 indicating that flash doesn t know the object s size effectively changed.

5367470
width	height
you can see that the width and height properties increase dramatically just after a velocity reversal which indicates collision with a boundary

5367482
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome does not provide an extension api to access the info from the operating system like firefox does

5367483
mouse	keyboard
other than that you could employ various ad hoc ways of tracking the mouse and keyboard action before the user tries to unload the page

5367540
postorder	inorder
because it is bst inorder can be sorted from pre-order or postorder 1

5367540
postorder	inorder
similar for postorder and inorder

5367549
subtraction	addition
i note this program is only for addition not for subtraction i

5367576
firefox	safari
this site doesn t care about ie try it in firefox or safari change the browser width and notice how the width changes using this property

5367580
free	realloc
when realloc moves the memory area and does return a different pointer it calls free on the pointer it was called with

5367619
getter	setter
it seems to have two properties with setter that are never used and getter that are basically lazy references to static members

5367647
portrait	landscape
now when the phone goes into landscape mode all of the objects in the nsmutablearray are deleted from the view but not from the nsmutablearray then when the phone goes back to portrait mode i put all the objects contained in the nsmutablearray into the view but when i try to access the first object i receive exc_bad_access

5367688
google-chrome	firefox
on the other side firefox and google-chrome use to some extent js which is easier and has a much lower entrance barrier how many c web developers do you know

5367688
google-chrome	firefox
on top of that if you plan this plugin extension to also work for browsers other than ie then you can develop a cross browser extension once using an extensive unified api and we will make it work for google-chrome and firefox

5367688
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and firefox each one gets a a native extension file crx and xpi respectively while ie a special exe engine to run your app

5367702
width	height
however for the wrapping to occur you need to give your label a correct width and height if the height is not big enough you won t see the other lines under the first one

5367709
google-chrome	firefox
i have a jquery ui datepicker control in my asp.net mvc application and it works fine in ie and firefox but it doens t work in google-chrome when i click the datepicker button

margin	height
i ve tried the css display table-cell option and it didn t work so i m using jquery to detect the height and then apply a top margin if necessary in order to accomplish the centering - which works when something needs to be adjusted but then doesn t work to readjust it to have a top margin of zero

there exist mathematical problem it is the problem of generating sequence of n unique random numbers random number is element of n 0 ... n like permutation but without using memory

5368428
int	chars
here i am tried to compile the java file and i used java decompiler to check the compiled code.why chars is converted int and some of the variable names also changed

5368473
int	chars
a chars is really an int type

5368473
int	chars
the chars type a chars contains a single 16-bit unicode chars that are actually represented by unsigned 16-bit int

5368504
int	chars
it looks like decompiler treats difference in constant types as difference in the types of local variables also it can use the signature of print choosen by compiler as a hint to determine the type of t and variable names are generated depending on types c for chars i and j for int

5368508
getter	setter
since you refer to arraylists and getter setter i assume you have a java background

5368508
getter	setter
getter setter are done in the form of properties in c#

5368508
dictionary	map
the dictionary is like a map in java

5368514
int	chars
jvm and bytecode do not distinguish between chars and int per se

5368524
range	max
so you would be creating a list then generating a random number in the list s range 0 to the size of the list as the max

5368542
int	chars
now some are pretty obvious like chars int etc

5368548
min	max
just to add that my x axis min and max are -2v and +2v and for y axis i would have -10ua to +10ua that is 10 10 -6

5368594

5368626
width	height
check the manager.sublayout int width int height api

5368626
width	height
so at some point after the screen has been constructed but before it is painted the ui framework calls its sublayout int width int height where all layouting measuring happens all child fields get their sizes

5368670
int	double
as said local variables for the vm can only have the types or more exactly can be accessed with commands for int long float double and reference - so all int types apart from long are treated as int internally

5368670
int	chars
the first variable remains chars since this is the argument type of the println method called here so the compiler has some way to guess it while the other two variables are not used anymore so they stay int here

5368687
int	double
why are you using int and double

5368703

sfx	zipfile
this possibility is exploited in producing self-extracting zip files sfx an exe which reads itself as a zipfile and extracts the entries contained within

5369190
sfx	zipfile
an sfx is basically comprised of some stub exe logic that knows how to read and extract any zipfile plus a variable set of zip entry records

when the doinbackground is complete i want it to pass an int value or perhaps a boolean value to the postexecute and then the rest of my code will execute

5370756
awt	swing
the problem is that awt and thus swing does not give us enough events - there are mouse-clicks mouse-moves and mouse-drags but nothing like two- or more-finger movements which are used in modern touch applications

5370758
accessor	properties
or if you need to do the above in a number of places you might want to implement an accessor for the ergtimes properties so that you can add a time directly

5370794
rss	feed
xgoogle has unfortunately stopped working for me but i ve found out that bing doesn t mind scraping their results as long as you use their rss feed found here

5370804
width	height
my program draws text strings into rectangles by working out the width and height of the text and selecting a smaller font if its too big for the rectangle

5370818
int	boolean
if you want your login class to accept an int or boolean in the postexecute result method you must specify in the asynctask s generic types what type of value to pass in

5370818
int	boolean
please note that these are the objects int and boolean rather than the primitives int and boolean

5370818
int	boolean
you should have no issue returning an int or boolean from your doinbackground method integer... as autoboxing should take care of the conversion

5370872
textblock	itemscontrol
fulltext is bound to the visibility property of two textblock inside the datatemplate of the itemscontrol

5370872
textblock	itemscontrol
i copied the visibility property as-is from the textblock both of them independently to the itemscontrol and it works correctly

5370875

any good implementation of quicksort heapsort or mergesort is likely to outperform it by a wide margin

5370905
pop-up	dialog
is there anyway to have the jqgrid pop-up set the correct zorder so this window shows on top of in front of the jquery ui dialog so this is usable

5370908
hide	show
you could put the controls that you want to show and hide inside of a div then just show or hide the div as necessary

5370926
postgresql	mysql
i m trying to update supplier table on both postgresql and mysql using the following update statement

5370957
typedef	struct
there is a typedef for a template specialization named ostream which obviously comes from the standard header and there is a struct ostream defined somewhere else in your code which you must seek to find and rename ramove

5370969
typedef	struct
the compiler can t tell if ostream refers to your struct ostream or the more complex typedef exported by the standard header file

5370971
folder	directory
on startup check if the examples folder is in the application storage document storage directory

5370971
folder	directory
if it doesn t exist copy app examples folder into the application storage document storage directory

5370988
postgresql	mysql
you can solve it by using the coalesce function available in both postgresql and mysql like so

5371029
cos	sin
open up your textbooks on sin cos and tan since you re using bangle

5371029
cos	sin
specifically you ll probably be looking sin for the vertical motion and cos for the horizontal motion

5371029
cos	sin
also you could consider caching the horizontal and vertical speeds since sin and cos are expensive

5371033
cos	sin
first convert the angle to a vector using the sin and cos functions

5371069
geocoding	geocode
there s nothing to stop you doing it but chances are if you continuously abuse the reverse geocode your app may get pulled or reverse geocoding requests will simply fail until your rate limit is reset

5371086
autocomplete	typeahead
s autocomplete anything suggest-style dropdown but the answer is 2 years old and seems to reference an fbml tag called typeahead which is no longer in use

5371224
disk	ram
save a copy of the system s ram to disk regardless of memory locks

5371241

then you should be able to calculate the bounding box for each of the layouts for given instances of rectangles 1...4 hint for the first case width sum of widths of 1...4 height max of heigths of 1...4

5371257
width	height
the listview should take up all the available height and as much width as possible while the relativelayout should be a small as possible and vertically centered within its parent

5371270
portrait	landscape
i was wondering if it is possible to get an uploaded images dimensions using php so that i could set it as a portrait landscape image which would help in making thumbnails that don t look awful

5371285
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
now all of that works perfectly in ie surprising google-chrome opera safari

please see screenshot below - google-chrome on top firefox below

5371422
plone	buildout
first thing i add to a plone buildout

5371438
background-color	transparency
by the way if you had an opaque background this would be very easy - you could just add a background-color property to the set to the color of your background and the transparency would work

5371459
width	height
i have the following script that returns the height and width of the image on my local server using php 5.2.6 but not on my shared hosting account using 5.2.17

5371484
maven	pom.xml
im currently developing a eclipse plugin which can download required jars and dependencies form maven without the maven compiler or pom.xml files

5371537
getter	setter
it is placed behind a proxy with getter setter that can capture and handle any changes

5371545
super	extends
when you extends a class that has required constructor arguments you must provide them using super

5371555
put	get
can someone tell me how to put in the parameters for the odeint function for the python to get the integral

5371555
put	get
i am trying to get the integral of e x from 0 to 2 but i am not sure how to put in the parameters

5371596
width	height
a quick but also dirty solution is to set the width height explicitely to 10 pixels via

5371673
prepare	execute
then produce a prepare statement handle and execute with the appropriate parameters - you ll find plenty of examples else where on stackoverflow

5371679
eigen	lapack
you should probably use something like eigen lapack vtk libraries and follow the style there

5371680
implements	extends
so one should think twice before implements that interface on a class high up the inheritance tree or extends it in an interface

5371688
versioning	upgrade
please upgrade to the latest versioning

5371689
google-chrome	firefox
i hear there s webgl for firefox 4 o3d for google-chrome and shockwave has been around for a decade for all browsers

5371696
converter	multibinding
in this case the multibinding requires a value converter defined

5371704
rss	feed
maybe i should just write my own rss feed

5371712
google-chrome	firefox
it s already built into google-chrome 9+ and will be in firefox 4 it s in the beta versions already

5371731
lwjgl	jogl
there are simply too many bloat layers on java2d for it be anywhere near as fast as an lwjgl or jogl app

5371800
put	get
i want to get all the rows back for comp101 and put it into coursepermissions

5371800
put	get
then i want to get all the rows back for comp102 and put it into coursepermissions

5371868
width	height
my app needs the height and width of the extended imageview

5371894
serializable	deserialization
i assume you want to do some general operations on those events like isolatedstorage or serializable deserialization operations

5371909
inherited	properties
finally i found the solution the code showed is wrong i added a jribbon as a properties in my jribbonframe but by default when a class inherited from a jribbonframe conatains the jribbon element

5371911
next	except
everything seems to work great except the fact that previous and next links don t work at all

5371950
vrml	x3d
for other way of doing 3d on web you can use something like vrml x3d flash got something serious but here is the good thing that happen with webgl

5371950
google-chrome	safari
i think it won t take long til it google-chrome and safari will be doing the same

5371995
getter	setter
not sure of exactly what is causing your described behavior but you re probably better anyway to have your toarray method call getter setter rather than having toarray operate directly on the class properties

5372002
pecl	pear
there are some on pear there s a pecl extension etc

5372026
int	chars
it appears to be basically a radix sort that is classify items by their most significant part leading bits digits for an int first chars s for a string then recursively by less significant parts

5372090
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
f12 in ie firebug addon for firefox ctrl+shift+i in google-chrome and opera

5372115
range	max
c is in range 0..1 0 means there is no behavior deviation and 1 is max deviation

5372119
jobs	cron
cron jobs are of course a possibility but i want the refreshing of data to happen as soon as the previous interval has completed

5372149
listview	gridview	gridview	listviewitem
i have a binding for listviewitem which is under gridview listview scrollviewer

5372149
listview	gridview
after i press ctrl+a in a listview gridview all items that are currently in the scrollviewer area will have isselected set to true

5372206
getter	setter
to solve this you should create a component of your titlewindow that accepts data the data you want it to know about by using a getter setter named dataprovider which is the standard

5372221
lsp	principles
one thing to remember is that traditional oo principles such as the lsp only describe public inheritance

5372230
jobs	cron
cron jobs are of course a possibility but i want the refreshing of data to happen as soon as the previous interval has completed

5372230
daemon	cron
the neither a cron job nor a daemon are the way to solve the problem unless the daemon becomes the data sink for the scripts

5372247
serializable	deserialization
have any of you seen an implementation of progressbar-like behaviour with object serializable deserialization

5372298
jobs	cron
i was thinking about using this for my e-mail newsletter tool instead of cron jobs as configuring cron jobs has various pitfuls

5372316
multiplying	add	multiplying	division
the conversion between different number systems in principle is a repeated division remainder multiplying add operation

5372352
folder	directory
notice how the kind of the documents directory is no longer a folder but a document after your download completes

5372374
ant	maven
if these do affect your project when exporting rather use ant maven to build your project

5372398
jdom	dom4j
use the one that s built into the jdk or perhaps you ll find jdom or dom4j easier to use

5372422
put	get
a long while ago i wrote a dreamweaver extension called get put all which allows for getting or putting of all open documents

5372447
inherited	properties
since they will be used separately a is not the parent of b b won t inherited properties from a in the layout

5372459
width	height
width 100 height 100

5372459
width	height
the actual controls.image covers the entire screen but the source image contained in the controls.image does not fill the entire controls.image height width

5372459
width	height
i am not worried about warping the source image i would just like to fill the entire controls.image no matter what the height width of it are

5372482
r5rs	r6rs
rarely will you find someone writing an application in pure r5rs or r6rs scheme and because of the minimalistic standard most code is not portable across scheme implementations

5372482
scheme	racket
there are various object systems you can load as libraries when you want to do oop but integration with existing code heavily depends on the scheme dialect and its surrounding culture chicken scheme seems to be more object-oriented than racket for instance

5372482
scheme	racket
mit scheme is known for strong interactivitiy support while plt racket feels much more static

5372482
lisp	scheme
in any case interactive programming does not seem to be a central concern to most scheme subcommunities and i have yet to see a programming environment similarly interactive as most common lisp

5372482
lisp	scheme
overall common lisp is much more uniform than scheme and more radical language experiments if done at all are usually embedded as a portable library rather than defining a whole new language dialect

5372482
lisp	scheme
common lisp features a built-in object system clos a condition handling system significantly more powerful than mere exception handling run-time patchability and various kinds of built-in data structures and utilites including the notorious loop macro an iteration sublanguage much too ugly for scheme but much too useful not to mention as well as a printf-like formatting mechanism with goto support in format strings

5372482
lisp	scheme
both because of the image-based interactive development and because of the larger language lisp implementations are usually less portable across operating systems than scheme implementations are

5372482
lisp	scheme
scheme dialects tend to be more static and less interactive than common lisp

5372495
awt	swing
the code you posted is used for awt painting not swing painting

5372503
prepare	execute
you probably should not try to open a transaction after a prepare statement has been started but before it s been execute

5372558
iboutlet	ibaction
control-drag from your object to your source file - presto iboutlet or ibaction created

5372586
width	height
the next time the print header routine is called the call to calcgraphicheight fails because the width and height of the image are zero

5372618
lwjgl	jogl
as someone who co-developed a 2d casual game in java using lwjgl i recommend against using lwjgl or jogl if you re going to be making a casual game

5372634
floating-point	integer
so super-naive but probably adequate pseudocode is as follows note that it ignores stuff like conversion between integer and floating-point values

5372657
addition	multiplication
so we need a way to represent an arbitrarily large binary number and implement multiplication by 10 and addition of small numbers

5372657
addition	multiplication
you can then apply the algorithms for addition and multiplication your learned in elementary school except that digits will overflow when they exceed 1 rather than 9

5372675
int	double
it is declared as having a single parameter of type double but the two virtual member functions named print in base are declared as having one and two parameters of type int

5372682
int	double
because double can be automatically converted to an int in the first definition it sees in the base class

5372683
hide	show
another might be to take the css media attribute idea and run with it render the raw data in the original html document hide it in the screen stylesheet and show it in the print stylesheet

5372686
mouseleave	mouseenter
i think you have a typo Ã¢ your event for mouseleave is the same as the one for mouseenter

5372696
for-loop	loops
i ve been advised to use a for-loop and loops through each line

5372724
post	get
i believe i could get this working using post but the only problem is that i want the target page number to go in to the url in this format

5372741
wordpress	joomla
i know about the popular cms like joomla drupal wordpress etc

5372759
range	min	range	max	min	max
if this needs to be limited clamp it to a min or max value if it goes out of range

5372774
subtract	add
you could just find the day of the week of the passed in date subtract that from the target day of the week and finally add that result to the date passed in

5372865
put	get
i ve tried to put the struct in twice and i get

5372905
post	get
on a normal get i want to return strongly-typed object of type caseeditmodel and on post verb i want the view to return an object of type case to the controller

5372937
children	parent
each dom element is an object in and of itself having children parent properties etc

5372952
division	modulo
and since you asked for an explanation the modulo gives you the remainder when you do a division

5372953
truecrypt	umount
my understanding is that with truecrypt you would need to download the full 3gb partition open it edit some files umount and then resend the whole 3gb

5372956
whenever	capistrano
you should be able to just require the whenever capistrano command in your cap deploy file like so

5372956
whenever	capistrano
require whenever capistrano

5373010
bash	zsh
i m using oh-my-zsh but loading it both in bash and zsh i m still getting the same error

5373032
cpu	processors
multi-core means that a single cpu has multiple processors cores that can execute threads or processes concurrently and typically appears as multiple processors to mainstream operating systems

5373055
postgresql	mysql
if you would specify the type of sql postgresql mysql oracle etc... server than i might be able to produce a neater query

post	get
that way i get the new post on top

5373071
post	get
yes on a get your add action can return caseeditmodel to the view and on a post the argument for the add action can be of type case

5373071
post	put
on the post the model binder will try and bind to whatever you put in for an argument

5373098

height and width are each a multiple

5373112
put	get
when i put a breakpoint in my code on the very first nsautoreleasepool before that line even runs i get this warning

5373147
post	get
security trough obscurity does not work and using post in stead of get only makes the information slightly harder to snatch up if you re actually looking the user over the shoulder

5373147
ssl	https
if an update is available you can send the user to a webpage using https to download the update which saves you the trouble of implementing ssl yourself

5373173
hide	show
this will allow you to hide or show elements as required

5373196
ubuntu	opensuse
apparmor would be easiest to use on ubuntu opensuse sles pld mandriva pardis or annvix distributions as the tools come pre-installed

versioning	upgrade
i m working with a client who is using an old versioning of gcc 3.2.3 to be precise but wants to upgrade and one reason that s been given as stumbling block to upgrading to a newer versioning is differences in the size of type float_t which sure enough is correct

5390239
margin	height
you could try adding a 100 height margin to the top and a -100 margin to the bottom one

5390240
google-chrome	firefox
that s because you have block level elements inside inline elements that is you have a inside an and firefox chooses to render this differently than google-chrome as the behaviour is unspecified

5390649
qtableview	qtreeview	qtableview	qabstractitemmodel	qtreeview	qabstractitemmodel
so i have a sourcedatamodel class inheriting from qabstractitemmodel that seems to work properly currently i only display it in qtableview qtreeview but later on i ll create some custom views

5390649
qmodelindex	qabstractitemmodel
the problem was that the view do not use qabstractitemmodel data from its model but rather calls qmodelindex data on its items which in turn calls the qabstractitemmodel data of the item s underlying model

5390677
google-chrome	safari
it works fine on safari but it is broken on google-chrome 10.0.6

hash	md5
then if the size has not changed you ll generally want to calculate a hash of the file s content -- which is generally either an md5 or sha1 hash

5390744
postgresql	mysql
in version 4.4 you can only get hsql mysql oracle and postgresql scripts handy but not sql server script

5390781
hash	md5
this one-liner calculates the md5 hash

5390823
temp	tmp
in summary it seems that the same error is sometimes displayed when the app pool user doesn t have access to the tmp temp folder

5391305
nsdatecomponents	nscalendar
if you want to get the current hour and compare it to some times you re going to have to use nsdate nsdatecomponents and nscalendar

5391305
nsdatecomponents	nscalendar
read about nsdate nsdatecomponents and nscalendar to learn more

5391314
hide	show
basically you cannot force the tooltip to be show constantly because windows is the one who decides when the tooltip hide usually on mouseleave or after some amount of time to keep the look and feel of the applications consistent the tooltip control is made to act this way

5391320
cairngorm	flex
i m now using the cairngorm flex framework and it supports mxml

5391352
post	get
you need to send the username and password using get or post methods to the webserver using the url

5391399
children	parent
so it seems that when calling left_join the children in this case the matching children are eagerly fetched and the children collection of the parent is already populated

5391399
children	parent
this second query will of course no longer take the restriction on name into account and will simply fetch all children for the parent

5391471
freebsd	linux	freebsd	netbsd	freebsd	debian	openbsd	freebsd	openbsd	linux	openbsd	netbsd	openbsd	debian	gentoo	freebsd	gentoo	ubuntu	gentoo	linux	gentoo	debian	gentoo	openbsd	debian	linux	ubuntu	freebsd	ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	openbsd	ubuntu	debian

if webview fits the html page in the view to avoid scrolling then the width and the height of the view applies for the page as well

5391518
debian	linux
i am running debian linux dev 2.6.26 with mercurial 1.0.1

here s a link that show s the difference b n get and post methods

5391836
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i ve tested nn firefox and google-chrome for mac and linux this works as it should prevent reloading of the ajax part on the first load of the page but in safari it prevents the first user activated reload

5391836
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome for mac and linux will reload the ajax bit directly on the first page load

5391837
viewdidload	viewwillappear
if you want some code to be executed when the view is about to be displayed be it when it s being pushed or when the top one is being popped it makes more sense to use the appropriate method viewwillappear for that instead of trying to call the viewdidload method at a time when it isn t appropriate

5391837
viewdidload	viewwillappear
can t you just move whatever code you have in viewdidload to viewwillappear

5391840
lemmatization	stemming
edit i actually need a stemming + lemmatization

5391905
accessor	properties
the problem now is that the set accessor for the properties ispressandholdenabled is never called ie

5391966
width	height
the scrollviewer gives its content infinite width height to render

5391966

5392100
iprincipal	iidentity
don t store user identifiers or other sensitive information in the session implement iidentity and iprincipal with forms authentication instead though this doesn t completely rule out information exposure altogether

5392125
getter	setter
in the abstract domain class i have all getter and setter and simple persistence stuff in it in the concrete domain class is the more complex stuff and the test class stands for it self

5392135
free	malloc
actually free doesn t delete anything it just tells the os it can use that memory again for example next time you call malloc it could overwrite some of your nodes

5392138
many-to-many	one-to-many
if you want to expose other properties in junction table you must map it to separate entity and mapt two one-to-many relations from former entities used in many-to-many

5392262
mvp	presenter
in mvp you should not be using methods from another presenter

5392292
set	bag
i am quite new to the world of nhibernate and i can t seem to get this to work with the use of a criteria query query a many-to-many relationship or query a collection set bag on an entity

5392314
children	parent
if the main window opens a child using window.open and the child opens a window using window.open these two child windows need to be siblings and children of the main window currently one child is parent to the other and this is causing problems

5392324
min	max
changing the max min values doesn t affect the value of the slider

5392344
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i need the functionality in safari 5 firefox and google-chrome would be nice but are not essential

express	node.js
i m using the jqtpl and express modules on node.js for the server and i have jquery and its template plugin for the client

5392478
onkeyup	onkeydown
the quickest way to solve this is to redefine onkeydown onkeyup calls in your activity b and do not call super.onkeydown when you receive back key just finishactivity

5392512
free	malloc
the behaviour of malloc and free depends heavily on the operating system and c library that you are using

5392512
free	malloc
the c library memory allocator which is in fact part of the application code and uses the pages provided by the os to provide fine-grained memory management facilities as provided by malloc and free

5392515
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome does not show the calendar itself only the button row on top

5392546

i have a request entity which has references children for buildings many-to-many and requesttimes one-to-many

5392764
inherited	properties
when i inherited from a class such as button how do the properties of button work in the derived class

5392764
inherited	properties
the private fields of button are not inherited in my derived class but don t the properties need to still be there so that the public properties can access the internal private state

5392793
google-chrome	firefox
when i m doing this in the modern browsers such as firefox or google-chrome i can do something like this

5392859
std	ostream
while it might seem like an awkward situation consider that n might be the std namespace test might be ostream and operator+ could be

5392898
viewdidload	viewdidappear
when releasing the view controller the view s events will target a freed object and make your program crash probably in viewdidload or viewdidappear if it s instant but it doesn t matter

5392900
bmp	png
i am currently saving the image as a png but have the option of a bmp or jpg as well

5392900
bmp	png
edit changing the save format from png to bmp or jpg with the threading seems to reduce the save time considerably

5392909
hide	show
make your own image to use as a tab and apply this plugin to any div to hide the content off the right left top or bottom of the screen it animates to show the content when the handle tab is clicked

5392912
user-controls	tabcontrol
either way after you perform this you may create a tabcontrol and add templated data to its datacontext or a user-controls to each tab

5393020
client-side	server-side
this seems to be quite an omission - i think most people would assume that the remoteattribute would work like all the other built-in validators and validate on both client-side and server-side

5393051
oncreate	setcontentview	oncreate	findviewbyid	setcontentview	findviewbyid
presumably that view is one from your activity either fetched from your xml layout via findviewbyid or constructed and passed to setcontentview in the activity s oncreate method

5393084
pull	push
i don t have much experience using external repositories pull push but i suspect this could be solved using local external repositories

5393111
pull	push
you can then push and pull between the main repo and your clone

5393111
pull	push
take a look at git clone git push and git pull

5393135
folder	directory
no problem - the xcode 3 installer lets you select an installation directory - my preference is to install it in developer-old for consistency with the earlier xcode 4 installers but you can put it anywhere you like perhaps even create a subfolder inside the xcode 4 installation folder for xcode 3

5393146
codeigniter	cakephp
you might want to read this thread in the codeigniter forums which compares speed on a full site first developed with cakephp and then rewritten using codeigniter

5393159
public	protected
this means that the defining class can control access to them and make sure that they are not set to invalid values or that any work that needs to be done upon their changing is done but the derived class can still make use of the way that they are used to implement protected and public members

5393161
fadein	hide
it looks like it is getting confused with the fadeall function because you are running the fadein within the hide function

5393175
rss	feed
i heard that there are problems with the rss reader webpart if the webpart consumed a feed from my sharepoint

5393278
children	parent
when i saveorupdate the parent it also saves its children

5393278
children	parent
more importantly when i create another parent with children based on the same set these children need to be persisted separately

5393324
versioning	upgrade
it s an upgrade and bugfixed versioning of the current winning answer hgimenez

5393334

problem with this approach is that there is only one mapping allowed per sql type and it doesn t resolve correctly between int and double .

5393359
mdpi	hdpi
as i m just rendering vector art for each physical size without respect for dpi pairs like large mdpi and normal hdpi which are both 480x854 pixels are duplicate files

5393387
width	margin	width	height	margin	height
setting the width height margin and padding is great knowing where my components are going to be puts the mind at ease

5393401
qt-creator	kdevelop	codeblocks	kdevelop
other options are qt-creator kdevelop codeblocks and ultimate++

5393417
for-loop	loops
lazlo have a look at these examples vectorizing a loops and coding the r-ight way - avoiding the for-loop

5393428
public	protected
if a class is not marked with any accessibility modifiers internal public protected private protected internal it s by default internal if it is top-level not nested or private if it is nested

5393437
google-chrome	firefox
edit possibly that could work in all the browsers not only google-chrome and firefox i know that might not exist but i would like to have an alternative for people that use ie

5393444
rss	feed
one of the simplest simplest methods to syndicate content onto a remote domain is to parse the rss feed using magpierss

5393444
rss	feed
to get the rss feed for a particular category use something like

5393457
realloc	malloc	free	malloc	free	realloc
you must always pass exactly the same pointer to free that you got from malloc or realloc . if you don t the behavior is undefined which is a term of art that means you can t rely on the program behaving in any predictable way

5393483
daemons	systemd
if your operating systemd has a daemons command

5393493
public	protected
however any public or protected members of button are accessible in myclass

5393540
free	malloc
you must pass to free the same pointer to the same location malloc returned

5393543
google-chrome	safari
first off open up firebug or google-chrome safari console and log your data being passed to your php page - then perhaps just start seeing what s being passed

5393568
teamcity	jenkins
if you use any sort of continuous integration tool like teamcity jenkins or cruise control you could have your commits automatically cause the other solutions to be built

5393579
listview	gridview
wouldn t a gridview or listview with details view be a better control for your problem

5393602
serializable	deserialization
gut feel is that the expression tree serializable deserialization will take much longer than just evalling some conditionals

5393602
serializable	deserialization
serializable deserialization is slow - and will increase at the very least polynomially as n increases.

5393621
hash	salt
the entire purpose of a salt is to ensure that the same two passwords result in a different hash value

5393621
hash	salt
each salt value would require a rainbow table to be created encompassing all of the password hash possibilities

5393621
hash	salt
now the salt value has to be available to the function that is going to hash a password attempt

5393692
gridbaglayout	miglayout
gridbaglayout will be powerful enough to do everything you need but it is not as easy to use as something like miglayout

5393701
tax	shipping
logically there s nothing wrong in calculating summaries and storing them in a table to reflect the amount that was actually invoiced - including tax shipping etc

5393773
inherited	properties
inherited properties from superclasses of the hibernate documentation

5393779
move	drag

i managed to get some code put together that works in every browser but one internet explorer

5393794
min	max
-100 max contrast 0 no change +100 min contrast note the direction

5393799
stdout	stderr
you should probably set the redirecterrorstream property so that you don t have to handle two input streams stdout and stderr making for a much simpler design

5393803
hash	salt
how is bcrypt verifying the password with the hash if it s not saving the salt anywhere

5393803
hash	salt
the only idea i have is that it s somehow appending the salt at the end of the hash

5393807
equals	charat
an o n solution would be to iterate the string from 0 to length-2 and using charat .. to verify whether the current character is equals to the current+2

5393840
put	get
now to put some condition according to the variable received .the problem i am facing is that how can i get the name of the vairable which i have received

5393902
hash	salt
how is bcrypt verifying the password with the hash if it s not saving the salt anywhere

5393902
hash	salt
the output of the function is not merely the hash it is a text string which also encodes the salt and identifies the hash algorithm used

5393902
hash	salt
clearly the returned string is version information followed by the number of rounds used followed by the salt encoded as base64 followed by the hash encoded as base64

5393935
cassini	iis
it works if i switch from cassini development web server to iis

5393950
jar	war
anyway i just unchecked package under my war project properties lib directory and added an entry for the same jar in project properties packaging specyfing web-inf lib as path

5393992
hide	show
often we can use p foo or foo.inspect to see the instance variables but is it only the default behavior and the object can choose to show something else or hide all instance variables probably by re-defining the inspect method

5393997
ubuntu	linux
ps it might matter i am working under ubuntu linux 10.10

5394010

if collection is clicked will only show the collection textbox and hide the other divs

5394010
hide	show
the code below seems only show but not hide after change

5394048
realloc	malloc	free	malloc	free	realloc
malloc free and realloc are not part of c language

5394099
google-chrome	firefox
i am using a userscript for google-chrome and firefox and i am checking for links that have been visited by the user

5394099
google-chrome	firefox
on each link and they all return red for the visited links in firefox but in google-chrome they all return blue

5394113
width	height
a component will always set the height and width of children

thought it would be a simple show hide but it dosn t seem as simple as that

5396907

5398653
getter	setter
i also sometimes have to assign some specific values to some members of the specimens i have autofixture create but i tend to use the above technique because the normal .net api of getter and setter is already specialized at doing exactly that

do this in onsurfacechanged so you ll know the width and height to use

5398969
getter	setter
so it s a setter in case you need separate functionality than default for getter and setter

5398982
tcplistener	tcpclient
i need to choose between tcplistener tcpclient and wcf

5398982
multiplying	subtract
and microsoft s 6-stage tutorial makes wcf sound pretty cumbersome involving code generators command-line and xml crap just to remotely subtract or multiplying two numbers

5398982
tcplistener	tcpclient
wcf doesn t seem to facilitate these things so i abandoned it in factor of tcplistener tcpclient

5398982
tcplistener	tcpclient
using tcplistener and tcpclient the work of juggling the connections and threads is getting a bit messy i have no experience with iasyncresult and i m not just not confident in my code quality

5399255
for-loop	loops
as a first step you can take a look how to simplify the while loops inside the for-loop

5399281
portrait	landscape
one needs to set up 2 different layouts for the activity one in portrait normal mode one in landscape mode

5399281
width	height
in landscape i changed this by inverting the layout height width attributes for all controls and setting the orientation of linearlayout to horizontal the tabwidget and framelayout must be next to each other horizontally

5399281
textview	imageview
the difference with the original google code is that the view layout itself the textview and imageview ids are from our own application not android internal ids

5399281
width	height
for a landscape-friendly version we need to invert again the layout width and height attributes

5399285
entities	entitymanager
then all create read update destroy crud operations on the entities are managed through an entitymanager repository

5399319
getter	setter
but i want to get the advantage of creating a getter setter method with the synthetize thing but with an int

5399320
post	get
you can use hibernate annotations to expose the set of tags that are applied to a given post as a java collection so that you can just say gettags to get all the tags

5399320
post	get
and you can do the same thing on tag so that you can say getposts to get all the post that have a given tag

5399347
post	get
i was just wondering how to pass in post parameters such as following exercept from html options normally i would get a array in language such as php would work i believe

5399348
profiler	visualvm
visualvm will not register this method in the profiler until one of the other threads sends the message the first thread was waiting for when the application terminates

5399348
visualvm	jprofiler
the solution as i see it right now is to pay for jprofiler - visualvm just doesn t seem trustworthy for this task

5399360

5399475
min	max
make two auxiliary arrays each with as many elements as the input array called min and max

5399475
min	max
for each element m of the input array compare its value to the corresponding values in min and max

5399475
min	max
if input m min m and input m max m then m is a balancing point

5399475
min	max
building min takes n steps and so does max

5399529
client-side	server-side
there are a few ways to do this but i would use both a server-side and client-side cookie

5399551

you could save your state during onpause and restore in onresume

5399724
public	protected
if you are writing code in a class that inherits from a base class and you want to call a protected or public method on that base class is it best right or wrong or otherwise to call base.myprotectedmethod or this.myprotectedmethod in c#

5399759
hex	binary
reading a elf or intel hex or srec file are quite trivial and from that you can see all the bits and bytes of the binary

5399776
maven-shade-plugin	maven-jar-plugin
you might be happier with the maven-shade-plugin plus configuring the maven-jar-plugin to set the manifest class name so that java -jar works

5399777
superclass	subclassing
i have several subclassing that derive from one superclass

5399846
rss	feed
i m not sure if it is as simple as using rss feed or if it is a plugin the pulls the information from my favorite twitters

5399952
free	malloc
as long as you re doing the free for each malloc then memory s not being leaked and future allocations will come from the same memory

5399958
webkit	gecko
this renders the same way in gecko and webkit for me the original fiddle has the gap in webkit but the legend is ignoring the bottom -40px in gecko

5399964
doc	rtf
i m not sure what you mean by dynamic user guarding name but a trick i saw with an rtf file if you can send an rtf file instead of doc docx is to save a template as you d like it to go in the email but use something like variable in the document wherever you want to replace a variable

5399965
superclass	subclassing
that means you can subclassing arrayadapter and inside your subclassing getview method you can simply chain to the superclass cast the view it returns to textview and do your thing

5399970
min	max
imagine if you had min and max in the same select which row should the non-grouped columns come from

5400026
folder	directory
in the case of you will be inserting the stddef.h header file from the crtdll directory which should be a child folder defined in your compiler as the holding pen for header files during the compilation and linking of your program

5400032

you probably changed the setting only for the debugging build profiling

5400137
folder	directory
iwant the form to locate into the directory folder in which views located

5400149
ienumerable	idictionary
you should not be having problems serializing your testcol property because javascriptserializer automatically supports serializing all types that implement ienumerable but not idictionary -- which includes list -- into json arrays

5400162
inherited	properties
going back to what i said about inherited - there is no such thing with interfaces which means just because both interfaces have a properties with the same name the derived one isn t overriding or hiding the base one

5400185
accessor	properties
if those functions are properties of some other object which exists in your page then you should be able to call them using the object properties accessor

5400199
post	get
i am trying to post a notification in nsdistribtednotificationcenter but i get these messages in console

5400213
children	parent
i only want to load into the parent records those children that match the criteria

5400275
hash	md5
the faster the better as this function will get called roughly 20 billion times during the execution of the program i m running it is the performance-critical code at the moment. it doesn t need to be written in c it really just needs to outperform md5 somewhere in the realm of the built-in hash for strings

5400338
ubuntu	debian
the debian packaging system which ubuntu uses conflicts with what ruby expects

5400349
children	parent
here is the query i came out with so far but it does not return result correct it doest not get the page title of the parent but return their children page title instead

5400402
width	height
that code above works but you may be stretching the width to the point where the content is being stretched out of the scene trace the width and height

5400410
width	height
just make your dots with a border radius equal to half the height width

5400424
folder	directory
the hierarchy setup of the folder in the directory is the same as the setup of the group in xcode

5400426
width	height
are you trying to resize it to a certain height and width or just have it automatically resize to fit the content

5400471
children	parent
change the left join to inner join if you are not interested in root parent pages without children

5400482
children	parent
the parent s state depends on some aggregate of its children s states

5400482
children	parent
in another variation it passes them a callback that the children can invoke to notify the parent

5400482
children	parent
during destruction of the parent it must be on the lookout for ongoing callbacks from its children

5400482
children	parent
if there are locks in both the parent and the children very likely in a multi-threaded non-trivial application locking order becomes an issue the parent invokes a method on the child which in turn experiences a state transition and tries to notify the parent dead-lock

5400482
children	parent
adding removing children outside the constructor can be an issue if the child tries to notify the parent from its destructor

5400482
children	parent
the parent must be holding a lock in order to modify the map of children yet the child is attempting a callback on the parent

5400482
children	parent
what i m looking for is some advice on how to handle clean destruction of the parent in the face of threads locks and dynamic addition removal of children

5400577
post	get
so when you factored out part of your method s presumably get or post on a sublcass of webapp.requesthandler functionality to another function you can no longer refer to self and get the response property

5400591
public	protected
i suspect what you really want though is something like the non virtual interface pattern nvi - expose a protected virtual method in your base class that child classes can override but have a public method on the base class that is actually calling that method internally - this approach allows you to extend what you are doing before and after that call

5400680
fflush	gets
along with echo is repetitive content gets fflush then shows up twice when the page is regenerated use ob_end_clean or

5405791
equals	tostring
tostring should return a useful method to debug the state of one object not to identify an object in the java semantic equals object

5405791
equals	tostring
of course as equals object is not necessarily correlated to tostring highlighted differences should be studied with our eyes but it would be already a very good basis and anyway it is much better than no comparison tool

i think this is because many ipad android-specific websites rely on webkit features that aren t present in gecko

5406498
getter	setter
my guess as to why is because a property on an interface uses the readonly modifer to determine if it should have a getter setter rather than the presence of a getter setter

5406516
put	get
the problem arises when i put this app within a page tab environment ie add app to my page pull up in a tab everything works except for the share button when clicking on the share button within the tab i get the provided application id is invalid.

accessor	properties
a properties is a construct that has accessor methods

5406580
accessor	properties
when you put the overridable keyword in a properties it is applied to its accessor

5406580
accessor	properties
for a read-only properties you only have the get accessor so it is overridable

so i have a an ajax call on the onchange event of a text box and a very simple mask function to add dashes to an ssn on the onkeyup event

5406811
put	get
you mustn t change the relevant values within a key after adding it to a map - it will potentially cause false positives and even false negatives you could use the same key reference you used in put and not find a match with get if you ve made a change which affects the hash code for example

5406830
hide	show
the simplest solution to this question would be to handle the click event and set the visibility property on the elements you want to show hide in the event handler

5407567
free	alloca
alloca allocates on the stack and has no knowledge about scopes so it gets free after leaving the stack frame after leaving the function

5407578
free	alloca
it will be free at end of function but since you call alloca inside the loop you ll likely get stack overflow

5407590

rtsp	sdp
when transmitting files over rtsp at one point a message is sent sdp such that

5407618

as mark peters noted the issue is most likely that penquant and pen.getlargecapacity are both int meaning java is doing int division and then casting the int result to a double

in the other .c generated automatically by this other tool called bison or yacc you will find

5407672
profiling	benchmarking
not having done any profiling or benchmarking i d say it s a fairly safe bet that if you don t need regex magic then the overhead of the regular expression parser which you ll get no matter what in terms of memory as well as cpu usage costs you a lot more than you can possibly gain on the other end

5407673
client-side	server-side
models are used on both the client-side and server-side for validation

5408669
width	height
imaging plane-thing is a distance of 1 away from the camera and has a width and height of 0.5

5408690
accessor	properties
in this specific scenario the obvious advantage of accessor is that you can limit access to only those properties and children that are valid for your xml schema assuming that a schema exists which should be so because you are in control of the xml

5408690
getter	setter
this will be implemented by the setter but the getter will also help you reduce typing a bit

5408706
post	get
well the form itself is html your form will post or get to your php script and this will send the email and show output

5408707
post	get
otherwise you will get e-mails all the time even if someone just hits this script with their web browser and no post data

5408717
post	get
i also found a blog post about coroutines that goes into more detail on one of the two methods though he doesn t himself get into preemptive threading

button	checkbox
if you want to be able to check the button independently you need to use checkbox

5408765
int	chars
second you would want to read each of those int as separate chars ie

5408765
int	chars
c c c instead of i i i and convert those chars codes to int values

5408765
int	chars
subtract int ch - 48 where ch is one of the chars read in by fscanf

5408765
int	chars
also check out ladenedge comment to my answer regarding using a width specifier for the int values instead of reading in chars and converting them

5408797
toupper	uppercase
toupper will return the uppercase value instead of modifying the value in-place

5408820
checkbox	dropdownlistfor	hide	show
if the outcome of the checkbox is actually a whole series of non related suboptions or the parent control was a dropdownlistfor which determines which child elements become available then it would be better to hide show only those elements that are appropriate to the current selection

5408835
post	get
in a web application its clear get and post variables

5408853

google-chrome	firefox
or more exactly if you overlay the screenshots of firefox and google-chrome the text in firefox is 2-3px below the text in google-chrome

5409041
google-chrome	firefox
if i reduce the padding-top in .nav a in order to adjust this in firefox it s not in the middle in google-chrome

5409041
google-chrome	firefox
moreover the text seems to be broader in firefox than in google-chrome

5409041
google-chrome	firefox
the first start is in firefox the second one in google-chrome how it should be

5409041
google-chrome	firefox
the next text is an overlay between firefox und google-chrome - firefox is broader

5409104
writetofile	nsdata
you can use writetofile atomically or writetofile options error of nsdata for that purpose

5409116

width	height
favorarea boolean default true Ã¢ specifies whether to manipulate the width height and frame rate if the camera does not have a native mode that meets the specified requirements

5409181
width	height
using this parameter selects the mode that most closely matches width and height values even if doing so adversely affects performance by reducing the frame rate

5409181
width	height
to maximize frame rate at the expense of camera height and width pass false for the favorarea parameter

5409225
fadein	fadeout
i m already using fadein fadeout and some positioning animation so ideally i d like a plugin which overrides these functions to make use of css3 without me having to change the core functionality

implements	extends
another way is to implements your own tag extends componenttagsupport giving it a name in a tld so you can call it from your jsp

5409299
fast-forward	merge
therefore in order to preserve the history as a straight line in your dev branch and also to have a fast-forward merge of your dev branch into the master branch in future i would recommend to use rebase instead of merge

5409332
width	margin
one possibility would be to add fixed width rows and columns to act as the padding margin you are looking for

5409332
width	height
you might also consider that you are constrained by the size of your container and that a grid will become as large as the containing element or its specified width and height

5409332
width	height
you could simply use columns and rows with no width or height set

5409332
width	height
that your grid contains fixed width height boxes which contain your actual elements

5409339
google-chrome	safari
it should only work in safari and google-chrome

5409364

the problem is that these custom settings are configurable per-user and are lost when the user upgrade the software a new folder for the new build versioning is created and the old folder is no longer used

5409364
migrate	upgrade
so i need a way to migrate these settings either on update or on the first run of the application per user after the upgrade

5409378
google-chrome	firefox
this works really well but i thought i could get a speed up if i used native json parsing in ie8 google-chrome firefox so i added this bit

5409383
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
also as noted in the comments when you are iterating over the values in an arrays for a for-loop you should not use array.length directly as the length method will be called every time through loops adding a great deal of unnecessary work

it s not recommended to do this i mean subclassing of uitabbarcontroller but uitabbarcontroller forbids rotation if not all uiviewcontroller do allow rotation

5409880
min	max
you can dynamically update the max and min based on your data set

5409880

lwjgl	jogl
i think lwjgl has a implementation too but the jogl one is better

5409937

as you are doing a post the data provided in str should be parsed by coldfusion and put in the form scope

5409961

hash	salt
send the salt along with the hash

5410001
valgrind	callgrind
i m doing some bottleneck profiling with valgrind callgrind and noticed significantly different resource usage behavior in my application vs when run outside of valgrind callgrind

5410005
getter	setter
it s quite possible that the castor defaults - using introspection to get the list of fields with getter setter methods and generating xml tags based on class and member names will do most of what you want

5410011
actionscript	mxml
i am constructing the line series using actionscript and also using line mx linestroke in mxml to change the color of the line

5410084
google-chrome	firefox
the following snippet works as expected in google-chrome and ie9 but in firefox i only receive the click event

5410109

which works fine for int values but for some reason fails for any zero or negative double value

5411646
versioning	upgrade
i also don t recall seeing any warning from the usual microsoft suspects scott guthrie scot hanselmann etc saying that you couldn t run the same solution across both versioning of vs so you should be good to upgrade at the speed you want

5411667
int	double	range	minimum
since the range of double s are symmetrical around origo as opposed to int which stretches one step further on the negative side you can get the minimum negative value by writing -double.max_value

the reason for using mergesort is that they want a stable algorithm - where equals objects by compareto or compare are at the same relative order as before

5411819
equals	gethashcode
return the count of the dictionary as suggested by digemall it won t give a great distribution but still better than always returning the same value and it satisfies the constraint for gethashcode objects that are considered equals should have the same hashcode

5411847
getter	setter
now based on this description one would expect the business object to not just have getter and setter but also behavior such as what i show below

vaadin	gxt
as far as widget goes they do not offer as many eye candy stuff as vaadin gxt or smart but i like to stick with the bases

5413100
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu is gpl - if you make any changes to the ubuntu or rather linux kernel itself then you have to offer those changes to anyone you distribute ubuntu to - that has nothing to do with any applications or data you use on the operating system

5413100
ubuntu	linux
you don t need qt for any of this you can have a browser run full screen at startup in ubuntu or any other linux and you can have a simple start page which will also start other local apps with just html - this may be a lot easier

5413309
abstract-class	superclass	implements	extends
but any given class can only have one superclass - extends - as opposed to any number of interfaces - implements so if you use abstract-class you essentially paint yourself in a corner of the inheritance tree because your class can only extends a single class

5413329
inherited	subclassing
interfaces are non instantiable classes that only contains methods that subclassing can inherited

the problem with this approach is that you need to enter a passphrase at some point so using it with cron jobs is a bit trickier

5413547
width	height
what s also nice is that the doowiki sizes with your page like a div instead of you having to set height and width parameters of an iframe

5413588
stdout	stderr
we solve that by creating a pty with the openpty function and passing it to both stdout and stderr of the subprocess

width	height
whilst this may not be noticle for tables rendered only at page load for dynamically changing tables like hiding showing a row which has a border this is noticable because it changes the height of the cell above or the width of the cell to the left by -1px due to the way td height and widths are calculated and therefore causes noticable resizing from the original

5418531
button	checkbox
there doesn t seem to be any real convention surrounding the issue as there is for more established interactions like button checkbox etc

5418531
move	drag
do i click the arrows to move them or do i click and drag or is there some other mechanism

5418542
google-chrome	safari
this error happens in safari and sometimes google-chrome

5418575
hide	show
if the operation gets completed i need to register a script in the ajax postback to hide the loading panel and show the content

5418597
serializable	deserialization
it s much better than the built-in .net serializable because it doesn t save the assembly-related data which can make a deserialization a real trouble

5418648
udp	tcp
tcp is stream-based while udp is message-based which means that you can get a half message in the first read and the other half at the second read

5418739
awt	swing
as most java programmers know updates to swing guis should only be done on the awt event dispatching thread and the recommendation is that long-running processes be executed on a worker thread with updates sent to the event dispatching thread using swingutilities.invokeandwait or swingutilities.invokelater

5418740
mouseup	mousedown
on mousedown the item starts dragging but not at the same speed as the mouse so i continue dragging when the mouse is outside the window but if the mouse is not over the page i can t get mouseup events

5418746
innodb	myisam
if the results don t need to show up immediately in your search you could run a cronjob periodically once per hour that inserts new rows in the innodb table into a separate table searchindex which is myisam with fulltext index and is being used only for searching

5418753
jobs	cron
2- get you schedule jobs out of you application and use the linux system cron jobs

5418768
getter	setter
as suggested by martinho here are some links explaining the getter setter in js 1.5

5418824
getter	setter
also i deleted both methods from the class and let the synchronised getter and setter do the work

5418853
mouseout	mouseup
you can maybe catch the mouseout event and then call your mouseup function from there

5418890
vbscript	jscript
since windows scripting can handle jscript as well as vbscript iÃ¢ d recommend going that way

5418926
post	get
you are looking for the ajax method or one if the convenient front-ends for it post get load or getscript

5418926
post	get
when using jsonp as the result type jquery silently turns ajax post and get requests into script requests adds a script tag with the url and url-encoded parameters to the data source and expects a script back that executes a callback with the returned data

opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i could do it with firefox google-chrome and opera but i could not with safari i don t care about ie for the moment

5419015
interrupt	wakeup
maybe you didn t follow this advice and got a spurious wakeup or interrupt

5419048
spweb	spsite
another important consideration is that you can t simply copy the contents of spsite and spweb items etc as this will cause all kinds of hell with guids and so on so your approach should be to create new spsites and webs based on the information you gather programmatically from your source private site

5419083
public	protected
why is _save public and not protected for example

5419086
google-chrome	firefox
the problem is that it looks great on firefox but on google-chrome the only issue is the button s height

min	max
if the scene rect changes after user edit the saved scroll position will no longer be valid since the new min max are now different

5419161

now on my device at least the mainbackground image is scaled so that the height is the same as the screen but the width is then slightly less and so there is a gap on the left and right sides

vb6	vba
in vba and vb6 i ve often seen where classb can only become a valid object through a method of classa

5419711
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and firefox seem to be in conflict with displaying the styles in your classes small green and input in conjuction with the style applied for the id add-friend-button

5420295
awt	swing
swing and awt use layout managers to determine where components are put inside containers see

5420300
client-side	server-side
i should also note that each page that requires a custom validation will generally need to perform at least one server-side validation so i will never be able to use client-side 100

5420326
maven	cargo
based on that in the example we could probably package the various contexts in separate maven modules for cargo booking route path finding and handlingevent aggregation

5420345
getter	setter
create an enum create appropriate methods in your dao to make sure that any getter setter only accepts that enum

5420379
opera	firefox
the script should work at least on ie 7 firefox 3.6 and opera 11 haven t tested on other browsers

5420421
persistent	transient
to be more specific i have a persistent object in the database and have a transient object not inserted to the database yet and those two objects are same with respect to equals and hashcode methods

5420421
instances	transient
but since the id of the entity class of those objects is annotated with generated value annotation hibernate still creates a new instances for the transient object in the database

5420425
serializable	deserialization
if you re using sql server i invite you to have a look at my open-source bsn modulestore project it s a framework for db schema versioning and using sps via some lightweight orm concept serializable and deserialization of objects when calling sps

5420474
width	height
these three boxes should take up the full width of box i and each should be 33 of the height of box i

5420483

5420712

specifically will the public non-privileged method assigned as a properties of the prototype object get inherited

5420719
rar	zip
i think there should be zip rar rather than .zip rar

you can also switch hide and .show with either .fadeout and fadein or .slideup and .slidedown

5420760
dbase	adoconnection
i have to copy some information from an old dbase database using adoconnection and adotable

5420774

if i install one instance and then keep using that specific stable versioning i m sure we won t need to upgrade and sync with the official launchpad upstream at all do i take huge risks like losing all data

5420831
int	chars
every car has its id which looks like 124ate 6 chars long and name like superpan and production year as int variable

5420836
int	double
it seems you just want a general mapping from the standard numerical types int int float double to double

5420902
superclass	subclassing
since nstextstorage is a subclassing of nsmutableattributedstring which has a method through its superclass nsattributedstring initwithhtml baseurl documentattributes you can use this to get what you want

5420909
cout	cin
msvc runtime does not flush the output buffer when calling system it isn t required to thus all output to std cout remains buffered if no std flush std endl or input from std cin were performed

5421007

5421329
getter	setter
and they are also much slower than a regular getter or setter

5421355
vsto	add-in
if you re creating a c# vsto add-in you can intercept the document save or saveas events

5421393
pop-up	dialog
i m using jqueryui s dialog with the modal form option to open a pop-up form

as rinuwise said you can make x and y visible by declaring them protected or public but it s still wrong logic

5421445
width	height
moves it to the left and up by half of the width and height of the fixed-size div respectively

5421451
width	height
i have many videos and photos with size of width 600px but different height in a wordpress blog

5421454
width	height
the concept is to set the top left positions at 50 and then use negative margins set to half the height width to pull the container back to being centered

5421473
tax	shipping
this happens regardless of whether tax is involved or not and regardless of shipping method flat rate fedex ups

5421545
width	height
i don t think you can use expressions for height and width

bmp	png
i read that when using crystal report stored procs it s best not to use bmp files i tried jpg and png didn t work either

5421622

please note before you vote to close this is a different bug than the multiple threads about a firefox 3.5 google-chrome bug which prevented items from being clipped at all by rounded borders

5421627
getter	setter
note that the getter and setter won t and i don t think can change

5421627
solaris	aix
my concern is that a compiler on one of the platforms i ship on linux aix hpux solaris windows will play some game with the bool type i m not aware of and break something

5421629
put	get
now i understand that is because i put the query inside a using and after the end using i can t get the related objects upon looking this up i tried changing the query the using statement to this

5421697
put	get
can someone give me advice on how to get the value of text1 text2 and text3 and put them into a string

the url pattern for all children of this post type are people jim however when i view post i get stuck in an infinite redirect loop

5421795
textchanged	keyup
i tried programatically evoking the keyup event from within a textchanged event but that still didn t flag canundo to true

5421863
getter	setter
couldn t you fix this by moving your .translate from your setter to your getter

5421885
implements	extends
we were better off making our proxy extends our target api then implements whatever methods where missing in the new api and mapping them to the new api

5421897
put	get
my ultimate goal is to put the information i get in to a local database but since i don t know how to get the information from the string i don t know put the info in the database

5421922
wordpress	joomla
reinstall wordpress joomla download customer data is not so fun

5421994
integer	fractions
yes readdouble is useless here it will interpret your 64 bit integer as an ieee 754 formatted double-precision float sign bit + 11 exponent bits + 52 fractions bits and that will get you a garbage result

5421994
integer	unsigned
if the sign bit is set your code will effectively be interpreting the 64 bits as an unsigned integer which is not what java is sending you

5422004
inline	inlining
if i remember it correctly inlining is not used for debug compiled code but release code might inline the called method making the jitter load dll b before the check

5422008
put	get
put the cursor at the start of the first id hit macro- start recording add a quote hit end to get to the end of the line hit another quote and i m guessing a comma move one line down and hit home to get to the beginning of the line

5422058
width	height
this is for x and y axis - but width height and margins have to be changed for every element

5422061
free	malloc
i m trying to implement malloc and free for c and i am not sure how to reuse memory

5422061
for-loop	arrays
in my malloc i would then use a for-loop to look for any value in the arrays to equal 0 and then allocate memory to that address

5422072
mouseup	mousedown
you can just override the mousedown and mouseup methods

5422075
google-chrome	firefox
but if i use firefox or google-chrome to load the page each page load is about 3 seconds

5422109
hash	md5
use the uniqid function if you just want a random id of a specified length or use the md5 hash of your long url if you need something repeatable

5422114
folder	directory
but what i also want to do and i may not be saying this correctly is to have config.ini file located in a directory that is not writable ie all the folder like org.eclipse.osgi etc and point that stuff to user.home somewhere

5422151
pop-up	dialog
what bugs me is that every time i run the app it doesn t ask me for my credentials again but it does pop-up a fb dialog window saying i ve logged in fine and i have to press the okay button in the bottom right

5422177
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
the view has a dropdownlistfor of roles that is populated by the model and there is a list below that of checkbox with a number of privileges

i currently have the following set-up a person may enter their id on the webpage and this is sent via a form post where the controller picks it up and queries the database using linq to get the customer

5422227
free	malloc
in fact most malloc free implementations will allocate a small header for each block returned by malloc

5422227
free	malloc
you can avoid the o n in malloc by implementing a priority queue of free blocks

5422238
backgrounding	multitasking
backgrounding audio playing is supported with multitasking but it s not very clear that backgrounding audio recording is

5422253
post	get
that would match any request be it get or post to your foocontroller with method bar

5422253
post	get
replace match with post or get if you only want one specific http verb

5422254
trie	dawg	trie	tree
dawg s are a special kind of trie where similar child tree are compressed into single parents

5422255
hide	show
in this kind of situation i would mark each checkbox with a bit of metadata and then when the change event occurs on your drop down you enumerate over all the check boxes on the page and then show hide them as appropriate

5422279
invokelater	invokeandwait
you can simply create a new thread runnable or futuretask to run on an executor and call invokeandwait only when necessary to update components but if you can get away with it invokelater is better

5422284
portrait	landscape
the problem happens when i rotate from portrait to landscape or from landscape to portrait

5422284
portrait	landscape
let say i am in portrait mode i switch from view1 to view2 then rotate the ipad in the simulator from portrait to landscape when i switch back from view2 i.e to go back to view1

5422290
submit	submission
and using onsubmit to submit the form fails to provide the page s proper function which indicates to me that it s the script-defined function in the onsubmit code which needs to be executed - meaning that simply filling the box via javascript and then submission the form with javascript will not work

5422290
keydown	keyup
it looks like i m going to need to be doing a create-init-dispatch of either a keydown or keyup event

5422291
domxpath	domdocument
as gordon said you need simplexml instead of domdocument domxpath if you want to access child elements like parent- childelements

5422301
accessor	properties
this makes it easy to add many properties without having to manually create the accessor

5422326
width	height
it returns the first image height not the image that has been replaced which is a loading spinner image so i need it to be able to retrieve the image height and width when it has fully loaded into the dom

5422333
getter	setter
unless you do something else in the getter or setter they are functionally identical

5422338
getter	setter
in the background vs creates autonamed variables for you when using the auto getter and setter

5422340
getter	setter
the only way this could possibly be better is if you feel you will be adding more logic to the getter and setter at a later date

5422375
zoo	xts
it s because xts zoo are aligned by their index before any operations are performed

5422378
folder	directory
then re-add the lib directory taking care to choose the create folder references option

5422432
packets	pcap
i use the following script python + scapy to create a defragmented version of a pcap file that contains fragmented udp packets

5422432
packets	pcap
my problem is that the pcap timestamps of defragmented packets are set to the date of the defragmentation and not to the date of the capture

5422435
put	get
the problem is this how do i get svcutil to put address in it s own commons namespace

5422525
children	parent
what you have implemented is a max heap the values of the children of each node are smaller than the value of the parent node

5422525
children	parent
you need to just change the siftdown function so that the parent is always the smaller than the children

5422537
nhibernate	queryover
but maybe there is something new in nhibernate 3.1 that can do this with even using queryover

5422544
public	protected
say i have a class with a method defined in a namespace other than public protected or internal.

5422544
public	protected
easy enough to override protected public etc

5422549
superclass	subclassing
hibernate nhibernate how to persist subclassing as instance of superclass

when you go to use simplecursoradapter which i recommend in your listactivity make the last field in your simplecursoradapter constructor to be which is the ids for the textview you stored in xml

put	get
edit i ve put in more of my code is it an issue with how java deals with mathematical operations in a binary form that when 225.86301881168654 - 500.0 it becomes the weird result i get

5426839
nsurl	nsstring
however the easiest way to get round this and convert it to an nsstring without changing the method is setting the string to the nsurl s absolutestring

5426929
min	max
but you could filter the results again by wrapping another aggregate around the above query and then pick a min or max product id to ensure you will get only one result per order

5426930
post	get
basecommandcontroller works only with get post

5426959
submit	submission
i d also suggest a name change for the function if you modify it to do this and handling the form submission via ajax -- if not you can remove the handler and simply trigger a submit on the form

5426966
nsstring	nsobject
the objects it contains are all nsmutablearray objects each of which will normally contain 10-15 objects a simple extender of nsobject with a few nsstring and nsdate properties added and may contain as many as 50

5426985
getter	setter
in fact in well designed object oriented code you sould probably not have many if switch getter or setter either

5427007
accessor	properties
as you can see i m accessing properties with accessor operator instead of indexer

5427012
free	realloc
element is pointing at the just implicitly free by realloc array which may well have been overwritten by the memory management system

5427062
pascal	delphi
if you need it delphi object pascal might not be the language of choice

5427064
int	chars
it appears that the x specifier is expecting an int -sized input to be passed while you seem to be passing it an unsigned chars isn t that what is

5427077
implements	extends
and interface1impl implements interface1 and extends dao2 class

5427091
opencv	cimg	cimg	magick++
i have looked at opencv gil cimg and magick++ but either they were not too great or i couldn t figure out how to convert an image to grayscale with the library

5427092
width	height
you have swapped the height and width in your code is that on purpose

5427120
implements	extends
so the proxy implements the interface but does not extends the class and hence you can t cast to it

5427130
put	get
mind you some people add values to existing enums not caring about order and if they put the new value at the top you get undefined behavior in code written like that

5427154
put	get
you could technically put the reference to the door handler outside the using statement but then if your idoor implementations are disposable they ll get disposed along with the lifetime scope at the end of the using so be careful with that

5427187
put	get
so it will only get what you put in limit

5427199
width	height
this is a raw format and you can easily subsample the pixels of the returned image yourself take a single pixel as the average of every 4 pixels so you will reduce both your image width and height by two

5427206
des	aes
the underlying block encryption method that is symmetric as noted by ian triple des aes etc.

5427276
google-chrome	safari
i used to write rounded corners using css3 for google-chrome and safari like this

5427280
powerpc	i386
the problem is that the python 2.6 included with os x 10.6 was built for three supported architectures i386 x86_64 and powerpc for compatibility with earlier releases of os x and python s distutils tries to ensure that all c extension modules are built with the same arch s as the python interpreter and library

5427288
firefox	safari
as a matter of fact soon enough you won t need these two properties anymore as the standard border-radius is now supported by safari 5+ and firefox 4+

5427298
next	except
i can figure most of it out except how to keep control in php so when the timer times out we go back to php for call to next page

5427329
for-loop	loops
so the question is for a big list which is faster the for-loop or loops that every does with the overhead of the test function call

5427329

hide	show
i have a hide show div faq section on my website using jquery

5427400
factors	mean
you can simulate different colors of filters by changing the factors -- by far the most common filter in b w photography is red which would mean increasing the red and decreasing the other two to maintain a total factors of 1.0 but keep the g b ratio around 6 1 or so

5427425
dictionary	ropes
removing an item from a dictionary or collection cuts that one ropes

safari and leaves google-chrome alone

5427450
post	get
this is called the post redirect get pattern

5427455
background-color	transparency
declaring background-color separately however may be much better for your scenario as it lets you use different colors based on the same background images if you re good with transparency pixels on the parts of your images to be filled with the css background color

5427484
stdout	stderr
add the -s silent option to remove the progress meter then redirect stderr to stdout to get verbose output on the same fd as the response body

i see no reason to store both the julian day number and the tdatetime just use a constant subtract add from the trunc fbasedatetime value and return that in the getjuliandaynumber setjuliandaynumber functions

5427581
entity-relationship	diagram
update it looks like you re better at entity-relationship modelling than me so if you posted that diagram i d upvote it and that would be it

opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
all the other browsers ie9 google-chrome 10 safari 5 opera 11 do not throw an error on that line

5427846
google-chrome	firefox
the screenshot is from using the code below - and when i use padding instead of height firefox looks fine but google-chrome is unaligned

5427850
put	get
if your purposes still require a lot of subquerying as you put it there is a neat prefetch pattern that nick johnson outlines here which basically fetches all the properties you need in your entity set as one giant get instead of a bunch of tiny ones which gets rid of a lot of the overhead

5427909
jstl	taglib
you need to declare jstl taglib in top of the jsp page where you re using jstl tags to get them to run

5427909

5427915
for-loop	arrays
on the other end i am iterating through a for-loop so this method gets called 20 times if the picture arrays i need to collect has 20 images

5427915
for-loop	arrays
i am thinking that instead of passing in an image id i can just pass in the count of the arrays i need to make and then setup a for-loop of some sorts here in the request method which would then allow me to pass back an arrays of images.

5427932

ibatis	mybatis
but ibatis developers has moved to create more elegant version of ibatis called mybatis

5428770
prepare	execute
if you have a query which needs to be execute multiple times with changing data the best option is a prepare statement

5429444
mouseover	mouseout
for this particular experiment i ve attempted to get the infobox window pop-up when the marker has been hovered over and out however i ve struggled to resolve the issue with the event system regarding mouseover mouseout on the infobox window

5429444
mouseover	mouseout
what happens is that i can locate the div and use a google.maps.event.adddomlistener to attach a mouseover and mouseout event to the infobox except it s too fiddly -- when i mouseover a child node within the infobox it counts as a mouseout on the parent node and fires the event

5429473
jlist	jfilechooser
i have a jlist on my jframe which populate all the musics listed in there using jfilechooser done

5429788
division	multiplication
what s more if you start writing bit shift operations instead of multiplication or division your code will rapidly become unmaintainable

5429836
post	get	post	put	put	get
curlopt_post curlopt_put and curlopt_get allow you to send post put get requests -- which are some types of requests that are common enough to have their own options

5429889
int	double
is it int or float or double or any other primitive type

5429902
put	get
because by using foreach you can get key and value pair but to check something you have to put condition

rtp	sip
basically the dll s are responsible for things like voice recording+voice output through openal afaik and rtp and sip implementations

5430121
min	max
it would not work well for long duration animations however as it actually only changes the animation speed at the max min points of the animation

5430131
post	get
if you re modifying things on the server you should probably use a post request instead of a get request but this should work if your server side script only accepts get requests

5430135
boost	allocator
i would say that is intuitive but there may be a more clever solution to overload the allocator instead to internally hold a boost array and use it to make your vector s allocator

5430135
boost	allocator
with regards to the pod or nearly pod issue the actual data in the vector is guaranteed to be a contiguous buffer and internally your allocator is using boost array so it will be contiguous

5430142
int	boolean
the following types for parameters can now be enforced either coercively or strictly strings string int int floating-point numbers float and boolean bool

5430162

you re better off performing this task using binding where the view pull the data to itself generally from a view model using the mvvm design pattern rather than trying to push the data into the view from code-behind as you appear to be doing

5430397
children	parent
aslo it looks strange that you don t have cascading and don t persist children inside the same transaction with the parent

you can derive from the class normally and override the function which is presumably protected virtual internal private cannot be virtual and it would not need to be internal if it were public

5430732
g++	gcc
gcc is the c compiler and g++ is the c++ compiler

mp3	ogg
i m not aware of any really significant differences in performance for decoding ogg and mp3 equivalent audio

5430802
children	parent
i m not sure but i think the difference between them is that requestlayout is called by a view that has changed its size position in its parent and forcelayout is called by a viewgroup that needs its children to be re-laid out

5430856
pull	push
you can only pull data from a server no push possible

fgetc	fread	feof	fread	feof	fgetc
feof is only useful after fread has returned zero or fgetc has returned eof

5432517
fgetc	fread	feof	fread	feof	fgetc
it is always necessary to check the return value of a read either an fread or an fscanf or an fgetc before calling feof

do you just write it as regular setter and getter methods

5432634
versioning	upgrade
another being you might want to upgrade a major dependency sql server versioning or whatever and see if everything builds again without actually upgrading the real build server

5432706
getter	setter
i am getting tired by adding tons of getter setter all the time in my beans

5432706
getter	setter
in my real world i have to access about 15 classes with about 10 data members in each class which would produce 300 useless setter getter

5432727
getter	setter
in sproutcore i am using the universal setter getter method like so

5432727
getter	setter
this is quite different to objective-c how would i write a custom getter setter

5432727
getter	setter
as you can see you have one method that is the both the getter and the setter

5432732
getter	setter
in eclipse for example define some properties rightclick source choose source and then generate getter and setter

5432751
getter	setter
see this link the getter and the setter are implicit

5432771
children	parent
parent has to-many relationship to a child called children

erlang	lisp
i was wondering if it is somehow possible to modify python code live while keeping all state of instantiated objects and methods like i think is possible in lisp or erlang

5432964
erlang	lisp
i am basing this statement on the cool erlang movie and this fragment from practical common lisp when the bug manifested in the wild--100 million miles away from earth--the team was able to diagnose and fix the running code allowing the experiments to complete

5432968
nunit	mstest
here you can find good table which shows nunit and mstest attributes side by side

5433010
do.call	lapply
you could use lapply with do.call rbind ... instead of the for-loop

5433143
getter	setter
note that i do not wish to discuss the relative merits of having setter and getter in general just the reasons why spring has made this choice

5433174
post	get
the problem is that you are specifying method post but passing the arguments as the url is a get

5433174
post	get
you either need to use the get method or you need to perform a post write the parameters to the request stream

5433271
getter	setter
since configuration happens by bean properties getter and setter you can t really tell - in the likely case that both exist - if you want to call setvalue or set the member value

5433426
nunit	mstest
since you re using nunit you could try this technique to run mstest as well

5433429

5433652
primes	palindrome
the flip side is that factorisation isn t entirely cheap but then it s all pretty small numbers and you can simply generate a list of all primes less than 1000 for your trialling as any palindrome with a primes factor larger than 999 will not be a product of two three-digit numbers

width	height
in such a case the grid slows down to a crawl even when column width height is constrained to only show the first 300 characters of data in that cell

5433850
hide	show
another problem might be that if you are fade-ing the elements to hide the old and show the new content you might need to get them nested like this

5433933
inherited	subclassing
you can get a full list of classes that inherited from context in the docs under indirect subclassing

5433941

in a loop i then run select.select on each subproccess s stdout stream waiting for them to tell me they re ready

5434106
icu	gettext
if you don t need icu s full power and are only interested in message translation you may want to look at gettext which depending on your platform and licencing requirements may be a smaller cleaner and less-complicated alternative

5434133
mapply	lapply
this is much faster than the loop but not quite as fast as the mapply and lapply solutions shown previously

5434143
width	height
perhaps creating a white image the width and height you want and setting it as the background on hover would do what you need to

5434146

textmate	bbedit
coda bbedit and textmate are--in my opinion--the most popular text editors for web development

5434243
textwrangler	bbedit

5434383
next	except
everything works perfectly except on thing when in edit mode the user has explicitly hit the edit button and the insert row has appeared at the top if the user tries to delete the bottom row the next row up gets deleted instead

5434407
inherited	subclassing
while it is possible to monkey-patch your classes to allow you to change the behavior of put you might be better off writing a method -- call it save for the sake of argument -- that wraps the put in a more explicit and obvious fashion and frees you from having to worry about having the patched behaviors being inherited or not by subclassing

5434417
udp	tcp
you can use the connection-less udp protocol instead of tcp if reliable delivery of messages is not of concern

5434450
folder	directory
i cannot figure out why quite yet but it seems like the issue may actually be that going forward in directory can be autocorrected but going backwards being at level 3 in one folder and jumping back causes issues

5434518
uiview	cashapelayer
even better you could try making your uiview s backing layer a cashapelayer by overriding the following class method

5435010
int	chars
the format specifier 2x reads two hex chars and stores them in a single int

5436069
stateless	stateful
explain the differences between stateless and stateful systems and impacts of state on parallelism

5436087
put	get
now you talk about things being faster given that the clr is natively aware of string i suspect a third-party class won t be able to match the speed for some of its operations and you d have to put a lot of work in to get many of the others to be the same speed

5436185
post	get
while i can pull data from tcpdump and greping for get post that would leave me with simply the path on the webserver and i would not obtain the associated fqdn

5436206
pull	push
using right-click menu on them you will be able to push pull your changes to from your bitbucket repo

5436242
stdio	getc
i would do this with the higher-level stdio functions by calling getc and writing to a buffer until i saw a nul byte and then ungetc on the nul

5436258
switching	screens
actually i ended up doing was calling container.resolve on the view i called called container.resolve on the view model this could be done with a standard background worker - then in the runworkercompleted with happens bank on the main thread i create the view passing in the view model that we happily waited for in the background and switching out the wait screens which of course wasn t impacted by our long running process

5436271

i just upgraded to xcode 4 and i m trying to open a project i created with the previous xcode but when i open it after about 1 second it hide all the folders and inline projects in the project navigator and only show the resources folder

5436330
disk	ram
i had a project-specific reason for wanting my own in that we re dealing with very large amounts of data and therefore it s optimal to leave them on disk as memory mapped nsdatas ie use ios s virtual memory system so that it s exactly as though the file is loaded as an immutable object without having to spend the ram and most of ours in practice were coming in uncompressed form though the container format allows jpg and png forms if i recall so rolling our own was a subtantial benefit because there s no reprocessing step Ã¢ we just end up directly mapping the original dicom where the data is in a suitable format

5436339
portrait	landscape
my view on the other hand rotates to both portrait and landscape and in both orientations the keyboard obscures the textfield.

5436339

5436480
multiplying	add
you can now infer from the definition of sinc x above whether you have to multiplying the two functions or add them

5436489
portrait	landscape
you ll need to set the frame size of your views that you add as subviews before you show them otherwise you ll run into issues the orientation is landscape but the last time you saw the previous view it was portrait

5436489
portrait	landscape
so then you add it as a sub view and fade it in but it shows up as portrait then when we pop without animation the same view but the one that is in the stack now is landscape

5436494
filtering	grouping
basically all we re doing here is passing in the filtering list of grouping we want to use into the context for the template

5436494
filtering	grouping
since i m trying to alter how the grouping filtering is displayed i m checking if it equals grouping

5436494
filtering	grouping
the only things that i ve changed here are adding a new argument to the method called grouping so i can pass in my filtering list of grouping from before as well as adding a new key to the dictionary to pass that list into the context for the template tag

5436494
filtering	grouping
obviously enough i ve set up a check to see if this value is in my filtering list of grouping i want to show and only render the link if it is

5436736
hide	show
what if instead of clearing the source you simply hide the image on closing and show it again upon opening

5436742
explode	implode
alternatively you could use explode to create an array of each individual id and then loop through so you could do some checking on each value to make sure it s correct before using implode to concatenate them back together into a string that you can use in your select .

5436793
pop-up	dialog
if you are using chrome it will automatically open the pdf in a new tab and pop-up the print dialog

use jquery to show hide your throbber

5436875
for-loop	loops
as you mentioned you could use a for-loop to get this value out of each row and add it to a list but loops like that aren t very concise or declarative

5436875
for-loop	arrays
when you call .toarray it pulls items from the .select which pulls items from the .cast which iterates over dtgetimages.rows the same as if you d written a for-loop to populate an arrays

5436892

pull	push
is there a risk of damaging the repository using a file share if we use different versions or the tools to pull from and push to the central repository

5437077
google-chrome	firefox
this issue occurs in several situations that i know of when using firefox 3.5+ or google-chrome using some specific ntlm configuration for which i don t have the details at hand and when using fiddler see the ad fs 2.0 continuously prompted for credentials while using fiddler web debugger technet article post and the fiddler and channel-binding-tokens blog post which contains more technical background information

5437077
google-chrome	firefox
note that nowhere i could find any information how to make ntlm authentication to ad fs from google-chrome and firefox 3.5+ work without switching off extended protection

5437077
google-chrome	firefox
i mean internet explorer works with extended protection why don t google-chrome or firefox

5437077
google-chrome	firefox
or is this a google-chrome firefox implementation bug restriction in their use of the windows ntlm library

5437084

min	max
i know how to use math.min and math.max on an array but how would i get the min and max of just the height in this example

5437171
post	get
when the user pressed the submit button either an http get or an http post message was sent to the server and the browser refreshed using the html code returned from the cgi program on the server

5437195
post	get
this will unobtrusively ajaxify the ajax.actionlink generated result and perform a post request instead of the default get one

5437195
post	get
if you have used firebug you would immediately have seen this that the browser is simply redirecting and sending a get request instead of the expected ajax post request

5437226
subtract	add
i can do all the drawing code but need to know how to convert an ordered series of rectangles each with a mode of add or subtract into one or more polygons

5437248
width	height
to do this you need to play around with the background offset and width height of the actual element that you re setting the background on

5437268
width	height
set the width and height of the element to 48px

5437268
width	height
if you can t control the width and height of the element you are trying to put the background in but you can add new dom elements you can try adding a span inside the element you really want to put the image as a background for

5437319
post	get
seeing the get working with jsonp and the post not working at all seems to imply that you may be going cross-domain

5437389
put	get
you have to get the value of the textbox and put the result back in the value

5437402
easyhook	detours
if you want to use pure c++ check out the libraries easyhook and detours

5437402
easyhook	detours

so from an abstract high-level view i want to get the post returned from the above scope and remove any which have any associated locks even if just one

5440705
hash	salt
then do something like concatenate all parameters in your case just the id together with the salt and create a sha hash

5440705
hash	salt
now when someone changes the id they would also have to regenerate the hash which is impossible without the secret salt

5440784
put	get
so was looking through different collection types in c# but could not figure out which one has best performance in regards to speed of doing put and get operation in queue

5440822

i kept the folder imapbuilder on the same directory as the home page file

5441529
getter	setter
sample of getter and setter in java

5441542
getter	setter
java getter and setter aren t as easy to use as c# s

5441542
getter	setter
in java every getter and setter has to be explicitly defined rather than using the shorthand you have there

5441542
getter	setter
for example for your code public int productid you would need a line defining the variable in addition two methods a getter and setter as follows

5441542
getter	setter
you d need to define similar variable declarations and getter setter methods for each variable you have

5441554
textview	imageview
to use something other than textview for the array display for instance imageview or to have some of data besides tostring results fill the views override getview int view viewgroup to return the type of view you want

actualheight	actualwidth
edit after further inspection i found out that it s not the updatelayout itself causing the problems it actually happens when i call actualwidth or actualheight

5441755
gif	png
your only chance of a workaround is to create the gif which doesn t support alpha transparency like png does which is the reason for the rough edges in a way that works with the background you re putting it on - like defining the dominant background colour as the transparent colour so the edges are calculated for that colour instead of black

5441811
winpcap	libpcap
i would suggest starting with libpcap or its sibling winpcap on windows and then interpreting the saved captures

jnetpcap	libpcap
jnetpcap might be what you re looking for it is a java wrapper around the native libpcap library that sarnold mentions

5441984
dlsym	dlopen
as an example in linux you would look at dlopen dlclose dlsym functions

5441984
dlsym	dlopen
basically the user implements a .so object and when your application loads it opens the .so file with dlopen once the library has been loaded and the user enters a string you can look for the specific function name with dlsym and call it through the function pointer

5441986

5442050
setinterval	settimeout
quick question regarding settimeout does it execute periodically like setinterval

5442063
setinterval	settimeout
off-topic note that you almost never want to give either settimeout or setinterval a string containing code

5442070
setinterval	settimeout
if you want settimeout to act like setinterval you ll have to make the function you specified recursive

children	parent
for now i have an idea to add a number field for children so the first child for a given parent object gets 1 the second gets 2 .

5442251
margin	height
if more stuff is going in there it s probably better to give the container a height if you absolutely must and tweak the margin padding etc

5442259
versioning	upgrade
now this isn t a ideal situation and i m a noob when it comes to creating upgrade but the situation i wish is that the program looks at a website ftp server where i deploy a new versioning

5442268

stephen walther has an old post on the basics that can get you started

5442285
getter	setter
then you could implement appropriate getter and setter

however when i resize the application my component which fills the application container ie width height 100 seems to make the rotations calculus based on it s previous width and height

5442393
rational-numbers	fractions
remember that any rational-numbers in 0 1 can be represented as a finite sum of distinct positive or negative unit fractions

5442441
uilabel	uibutton
for this you can subclass uilabel and overwrite its -drawrect method and then use your own uilabel and add a uibutton over it of custom type

5442470
intersect	contains
these tests return an enum of contains disjoint intersect

5442543
implements	extends
your best solution would be to implements your own layoutmanager or extends an existing one if one is really close to your needs using the features and controls you are looking for

5442574
uiview	subviews
i have a uiviewcontroller that contains a uiview subclass as a subviews

5442574
uiview	subviews
in the subviews i dynamically create another uiview

5442574
uiviewcontroller	uipopovercontroller
when the innermost view is created then the uiviewcontroller is informed via a delegation that it must show a uipopovercontroller whose arrow head need to be pointing to the inner most view

5442577

i need in my website to hide show a rounded corner div that contains the pie.htc to round it in ie

5442577
hide	show
if i click any link with href then click to show hide the div with the rounded corners it will be displayed without styling

5442577
hide	show
you can click show container then hide container several times and it works perfect but if you click on click here just alert link which is just link with alert then click on show container it will display the content of the div without the background as an example this is as tested in ie8

5442587

adrian link post is about storage of the passwords in a database and you will get there useful info

5442704
width	height
tags accept both height and width declarations through css

5442704
width	height
if you wanted to do it inline it d be for height and width values of 100px

5442704
width	height
incidentally if you want to maintain proportions you can simply define the width without the height

5442712
scatter	graphing
eventually i want a scatter plot with a fit line and error bars with axis that stay on the screen while the graphing is zoomed .

5442712
switching	screens

int	chars
in c suppose the pointers are strictly typed ie a pointer to an int cannot be used to point to a chars

5442803
memcpy	memmove	memcpy	malloc	memmove	malloc
without pointer casts you must have several versions of memcpy memmove malloc as these all require pointer conversions to be implemented and used

5442823
spaces	delimiter
in fact the rfc even states that spaces are delimiter and should be ignored

5442845
inherited	properties
all container controls have a controls properties which exposes a controlcollection which takes only a system.windows.forms.control or classes that inherited

5442851
rational-numbers	fractions
bisection will give you a limit toward a specific real number as represented as a power of two and continued fractions will take the real number and find the nearest rational-numbers

5442851
integer	fractions
our continued fractions search needs to round to the nearest integer not use floor this is clearer below

5442851
next	except
on further reflection continued fractions are the way to go never mind bisection except to determine the next term

5442914
uilabel	nsstring
for any question of this nature simply go to google type in something class reference where something should be replaced with uilabel or nsstring or some such objective c class and follow the result from developer.apple.com

width	margin
you need to set the width of the second nested div to 800px for the auto margin to work

5443346
width	margin
right now it s the same width as the containing div so the margin has no effect

get chars int reads until the deliminator n but does not extract it - so it gets stuck on it

5445528
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
the reason you re seeing that extra margin at the top is because uinavigationcontroller normally expects that it will be sized to fill the entire screen except perhaps a tab bar at the bottom if it s inside a uitabbarcontroller and therefore expects that the top edge of its view will be under the status bar if the status bar is visible

submit	submission
when submission the form the submit button is disabled

5445891
super	extends
if a extends b then i know i can user super

5445908
rational-numbers	fractions
note that this can be combined with templatetypedef s original interview question and apply towards any rational-numbers p q not just between 0 and 1 by first computing q x 0 then for either positive negative integers bounding between two consecutive integers and then using the above algorithm for the fractions part

5445908
rational-numbers	fractions
first note that until the rational-numbers is found the # of steps n k for each new continued fractions term is exactly 2b a_k -1 where b a_k is the # of bits needed to represent a_k ceil log2 a_k it s b a_k steps to widen the net of the binary search and b a_k -1 steps to narrow it

5445938
explode	implode
use parse_url trim explode array_pop and implode

5445969
pop-up	dialog
strange that everyone answered this question but failed to spot the obvious problem given that exceptions raised in a background thread are asynchronous and can occur at any time this means that showing exceptions from a background thread would pop-up a dialog box at random times to the user quite possibly showing an exception that has nothing to do with what the user is doing at the moment

5445985
google-chrome	firefox
i was receiving a 302 error occurring only in firefox google-chrome ie8 worked fine

yacc	bison
technically one way to write such a preprocessor is to use standard tools like lex flex and yacc bison to define your grammar and generate the parser say in c

5446227
yacc	bison
it would be best if analogs of tools like lex flex yacc bison were available within mathematica i mean bindings which would require one to only write code in mathematica and generate say c parser from that automatically plugging it back to the kernel either through mathlink or librarylink

5446248
ready	each
even if i m ready to make a big search replace in all my codebase to use slf4j i m not ready to check each log statement and reformat it to use the format of slf4j

any class you wish to extend should go in the corresponding directory in your applications folder

5447028

one way to implements this is to have a class that extends application

5447039

int	chars
an interesting point that was noted in the discussion of another answer which i didn t really think the author needed to delete is that there is a difference between a chars set which in the other author s words - don t remember his username defines a mapping between int and chars capital a is 65 and an encoding which defines how those int are to be represented in a byte stream

5447396
int	chars
most old chars sets such as ascii have only one very simple encoding each int becomes exactly one byte

5448335
lisp	scheme
of course this will depend on the dialect but i d be interested in answers for scheme cl clojure or other lisp

5449336
inherited	subclassing
maybe i haven t fully understood the problem but why instead of subclassing foo inherited aren t you storing foo like a field type in fooson composition

5449336

5449480
unsigned	short
best you probably can do is use the above mentioned uintptr_t if you have a c99 compiler or compile a program on the target platform which checks whether sizeof void is equal to any of the sizeof unsigned short int long long long and generate a header file where you typedef your own uintptr according to what the program found out

5449678
post	get
i don t understand why post and get are not an option

5449680
typemock	moles

short	base
the short answer is no you cannot assign an object of some base class to one of a derived class at all

int	double
in math.h due to its primitive nature the abs function is essentially just for int types and if you wanted to get the absolute value of a double you had to use fabs

5450536
int	double
it improved things like having to distinguish between fabs and abs and just made abs for both double and int types

5450536
int	double
use math.h and use abs for int fabs for double

in the multibinding the first binding is your binding as now - without the converter

5455595

nfa	dfa
note also that these efficiency improvements are only applicable to a nfa engine which uses backtracking perl php java python javascript .net ruby and most others. a dfa engine will not see any performance boost by this technique see regular expression matching can be simple and fast

5455722
response.redirect	redirecttoaction
i think what s happening is that redirecttoaction is doing a response.redirect which is terminating the processing of the request and not allowing the cookie to be set

5455759
width	height
you should prefer to pas teh target width amd height as parameters teh way you set teh height prevents multi-threaded usage and makes it very hard to read

5455759
width	height
also are you sure you are setting the image height correctly the height is related to a ration between height and width a narrow image will give you a very tall image and stretched image assuming the width of the target image is to remain constant

5455764
stdout	stderr
ofcourse we all know that ls command exists immediately after printing some stuff to stdout or may be stderr but the above script never exists

getter	setter
should not contain descriptions of its getter and setter

5456181
getter	setter
you asked why the description of the getter setter should contain a description of the variable not the other way around

5456181
getter	setter
the getter and setter should describe the effect they are having which may include the modification or retrieval of some abstract property of this object

5456278
post	get
however instead of hardcoding the value 30.days.ago i want to get the retainer value from the post s category and base the condition on that so something like

5456278
post	get	post	put	put	get
so put into words i want to get all of the post which are expired and the expiration status is determined by each post s category s retainer value post in the movies category expire in 10 days post in the games category expire in 5 days etc.

database-normalization	denormalization
this is deliberately going against the principle of database-normalization and is hence called denormalization

5457208
folder	directory
maybe the best solution is to create shared folder and save all resources files images etc. to that folder on each server create virtual directory point to that folder and use that path when providing link for downloading file

5457211
nsbezierpath	appkit
nsbezierpath is appkit though so you have to fall back to reverse engeneering

5457211
uibezierpath	nsbezierpath
it might not be too difficult because uibezierpath and nsbezierpath probably both depend on cgpath but that s only a guess

5457212

5458098
width	height
i have text with a background image of a fixed width and height

5458098

5458204
integer	unsigned
but this seems very unclear as it is relying on the numerical overflow of the unsigned integer to be above 10

5458251
integer	unsigned
if the destination type is unsigned the resulting value is the least unsigned integer congruent to the source integer modulo 2 n where n is the number of bits used to represent the unsigned type

5458251
integer	unsigned
unsigned integers declared unsigned shall obey the laws of arithmetic modulo 2 n where n is the number of bits in the value representation of that particular size of integer

5458258
width	height
the tag has a fixed width and height it s 100 of the tile size--this is in an itemrenderer

i ve got the table that is created via javascript file and everything is fine with styles in google-chrome and firefox but there is a problem in ie8

5458589
inherited	properties
a derived class inherited all methods fields and yes properties too although private methods fields and properties are generally not directly accessible or visible from the derived class unless it is nested in it s superclass the parent

5458616
width	height
so even with height and width it may never fill the complete space that is allotted for i

5458660
inherited	properties
in a word yes properties are inherited along with the fields and the methods

5458660
inherited	properties
both private and public methods fields and properties are inherited but private members are inaccessible by the child class unless the child class is nested within the base class - scoping and inherited are connected but different things

5458700

5459110
post	get
you cannot upload files via get that is what post is for

5459110
post	get
in case more clarification is really needed get is generally used for retrieving data from the server while post is for sending data to the server

5459132
division	modulo	division	multiplication	multiplication	modulo
if the divisor is known in advance for code produced by a c compiler this is a constant known at compile time then integer division from which the modulo can be easily obtained can sometimes be implemented with a multiplication and a shift

5459132
division	multiplication
in many processors integer multiplication is vastly faster than integer division

5459132
division	multiplication
some processors do not even have an integer division opcode multiplication on n -bit values can be optimized into a circuit of depth o log n whereas there is no known method to optimize a division circuit below a depth of o n

factories	presenter
in the start method you should start up your presenter usually using a new instance and start up your display usually reusing an instance - the client factories is good for this

5459488
int	chars
let s say you have a 32 bit int and a 64-character chars set for your strings

5459488
int	chars
that will allow you to store five chars into an int

5459519
outputstream	inputstream

put	get
boost variant please don t capitalize v works another way you can only get back what you put inside

5460194
put	get
boost.any library doesn t differ from boost.variant in this respect what you put is what you get but boost any is unbounded you can store value of any type in boost any but in boost variant you can only store what was declared by variant s template parameters

for-loop	arrays
so you need to use a regular for-loop instead of for each and access the arrays elements by their indexes

5472816
scrollable	panels
but there it is very slow when trying to scroll the panels the picturebox is inside a scrollable panels

5472835

5472888
filtering	grouping
to filtering outside the grouping by clause you can use the having keyword

5472920
int	chars
i have to store about 10 int is it better to use 10 int columns or a only varchar column whit values splitted by a chars

5473107
associativity	operator-precedence
but we know when the operator-precedence is equal same - associativity comes into play hence is evaluated as

5473107
associativity	operator-precedence
also another link i found says this on operator-precedence and associativity

on that side i have no problem because i have listed the sql query of the two parameters ready to give the name of the server and database to consult in each case

5473328
put	get
but when i put it up to my server i get a strange error like an xml markup error

5473350
xlwt	xlutils
maybe have a look at xlrd xlwt xlutils

5473417
firefox	safari
some browsers including firefox and safari don t download a font file until it is actually needed to render text

5473424
versioning	upgrade
and think i may also upgrade to a premier versioning

5473453
width	height
i guess you have to use the clientrectangle s width and height instead of the window width and height

5473492
xlwt	xlutils
if the available tools like xlrd xlwt and xlutils don t work you may have to fall back to programmatically editing the file with excel via com

5473543
matlabpool	parfor
i understand that you can use a matlabpool and parfor to run for-loop iterations in parallel however i want to try and take advantage of using the high number of cores in my gpu to run a larger number of simultaneous iterations

5473579
hide	show
how can i programmatically show hide this opaque view from uisearchdisplaycontroller

5473665
submit	submission
on ok button of dialog i want to submit the form...but it is not submission code on ok

5473694
hide	show
you can show the symbol but it is probably better to hide it

5473709
rsa	aes
basically it uses php s openssl functions for public-key encryption rsa of the key for symmetric encryption mcrypt for symmetric encryption aes and zip as the container format

5473727
udp	tcp
can you recommend me a good c++ library or implementation for udp socket multicast and tcp

5473739
prepare	execute
the thread that execute atfork handler in child is an exact copy of the thread that execute atfork prepare handler in parent and thus is entitled to unlock the mutexes

5473896
hex	binary
i understand that these values are stored in binary but i need to transmit them in hex

5473976
vsto	add-in
a .net vsto add-in dll is not a normal com dll for instance it doesn t self register it has no tlb embedded within it so word can t deal with it through that add-in s dialog as far as i know

5473976
vsto	add-in
vsto add-in s have to be installed via an installer

5474025
hex	binary
you know that an int is stored in binary the hex value is always and never preserved so i m interpreting your question as pertaining to printing to the screen

5474074
innodb	myisam
how the data is stored exactly is abstracted by the storage engine innodb myisam

5474166
awt	swing	swt	swing
it is not easy to mix swt and awt swing ui in the same process

5474166
awt	swing
your code is freezing because awt swing event loop is not running in the eclipse process

5474166
awt	swing	swt	swing
it is really only appropriate for situation where there is an enormous amount of awt swing and a temporary solution is necessary while the ui is ported to swt

5474172
google-chrome	firefox
these newlines are shown correctly in firefox and google-chrome but not in internet explorer 7

5474178
jsf	seam
seam in action also interleaves jsf facelets and html tags

5474202
getter	setter
this member is available via a getter so in theory a class could call getmymember and then set this to another value without calling the setter

5474211
int	boolean
have a table of availability with columns int hotel_id date date boolean available

5474231
haskell	agda
i would suggest agda because it has calling compatibility with haskell

5474239
vb6	vba
as mentioned by hans passant be sure to use data types that are compatible with vb6 vba

5474313
getter	setter
this member is available via a getter so in theory a class could call getmymember and then set this to another value without calling the setter

5474324
put	get
you could also get rid of the first if if you put coalesce thisdate current_timestamp in the above where i currently have thisdate

5474331
implements	extends
yourworkerthread is a class that extends thread and implements a method run where the logic of the server is located

5474391
implements	extends
with that in mind you can let s say class b extends class a then if you whant class b to have a particular constant defined class a should implements an interface

5474401
public	protected
hmm if object b extends object a and object a contains a constant or variable then object b will also contain them if the variable is protected or public

5474404
inherited	properties
you can also enforce properties to be passed to derived classes using abstract classes or regular inherited

5474415
ready	each
surely after returning from select you d go through the set once processing each ready descriptor on the way

5474447
accessor	properties
is not a properties accessor

5474484
width	height
then it will be too tiny to see and just set background-image to whatever you want the button to look like and the height and width to that of the image you are using

5474490
button	checkbox
how to get all values of checkbox on button click asp.net

5474519
packets	multicast
this seems to work fine over ethernet but causes problems over wifi apparently due to low bandwidth allocation for multicast packets on most routers

5474530
put	get
when i put my email in email when it sends i just get a message from localhost i know the mailbox is working as i used a different script but i would like to use this script as i can change font and size

5474549
nofollow	noindex
what i did on my store is tag those links in the layered navigation with rel noindex nofollow and i put the same into the robots meta tag in the target pages

5474564
width	height
firebug says that it s just element with width and height but where x and y position is pointed and how

5474667
width	height
i altered it a little bit so that you can customize the overlay rectangle width overlay rectangle height overlay text size and scroll thumb width

5474713
noexcept	throw
non-throwing if it is of the form throw noexcept or noexcept constant-expression where the constant-expression yields true

5474737
free	malloc
you can use malloc to allocate memory for the array and free to release the memory

5474780
rss	feed
these widgets will consist of twitter feed flickr feed other rss feed etc...there will also be an administration area where admins can add manage what widgets are available for users to add

5474808
google-chrome	firefox
i am looking to port my firefox and google-chrome addon into an ie addon

5474810
capistrano	bundler
i have a rails 3 project with bundler and capistrano

5474835
x86	64bit
but you d want either c program files microsoft sdks silverlight v4.0 libraries client or c program files x86 microsoft sdks silverlight v4.0 libraries client dpending on if you are on a 64bit machine

5474841
integer	unsigned	integer	fractions
you have to decide to represent this using an existing data type for example you could let an 8 bit unsigned integer type which have the range 0 - 255 represent the fractions values 0 - 1.0

5474841
floating-point	integer
however you typically can t use the same approach here as there is a big difference in how a floating-point value and an integer is represented

5474842
post	get
also mvc fail miserably for websites when it is about to connect to the model other than simple post get it fail with xml asynchronism and it fail with ajax

5474854
chgrp	chmod
as per a tutorial i chgrp to www-data i think that s what apache is running as and then chmod g+w

5474886
int	double
i m trying to create a generic class that accepts only two types int and double as if i would make the class with only double type i would be wasting space when i would use the same class for object having only int fields

5474886
int	double
to leave that generic but limited to only double and int

5474947
int	double
double is 64bit and can contain any value that int can have

5474947
int	double
also since the int s never have a fraction casting from and do double won t cause loss of precision or rounding errors

5474951
width	height
i m trying to make a box with rounded corners where the height and width of the div depends on the content so it s automatically adjust to it.

5474964
int	double
you can however store any int value in a double so i would just use a double for everything

5474966
int	double
but if object size is your primary concern then this might not be the best solution as you need to store a reference to the wrapper object double or int in addition to the object itself which is almost certainly larger than just storing a double itself

5474967
put	get
i get the same if i remove the button and action but put in a handler for the scrolling event of the uiscrollview

5474969
free	malloc
i use exactly the same steps as in the example from the link it s just that my shared library also includes a set of global variables and overrided versions of malloc free etc

5474993
strcpy	malloc
otherwise you can use malloc and strcpy for your s in the struct .and

5475051
children	parent
when i create a self referencing parent child association on an entity the designer always marks one end many which would be the children and is ok like that

5475114
int	double
examples of this are datetime int double decimal etc

5475185
getter	setter
is there any easy way except subclassing to add additional instance variable or property instance variable + getter setter

5475189
implements	extends
faulthandlercairngormcommand extends sequencecommand implements iresponder

5475208
elf	coff
there are tools to help with that binary to coff converter i ve seen an elf version as well maybe this

5475244
cos	sin
if your intent is simulate 3d spherical rotations your easiest route would be to forego the 2.5d api and just use simple scaling and sin cos calculations for the positioning

5475250
phpmyadmin	heidisql
find the query in the browser and paste it in your mysql client heidisql phpmyadmin or whatever

5475274
tablet	galaxy
i m developing an android app i m testing with samsung galaxy tab for any reason my xxx_layout.xml is not working it remains in its first version if i modify it none of this changes are viewed i make all the process to generate an signed apk clear any data in the tablet before install but this problem still appearing

5475283
innodb	myisam
for the first set of tables we are planning to go with myisam and for the second ones with innodb engine

5475283
innodb	myisam
are there any performance issues in joining myisam tables with innodb tables

5475296
post	put
so - pretty much the same situation as if you were sending a html multipart form to a php script that does a file upload and accepts some additional post fields - except with put and php curl

5475299
entities	entitymanager
cascade attribute will cause create delete actions updates are implicitly handled by entitymanager session on owning entities to cascade down to in your case all entities in a collection

5475310
public	protected
use private protected or public instead to declare a property along with its visibility var defaults to public

5475314
screens	hdpi	screens	tablet	tablet	hdpi
now on a tablet with a hdpi or xlarge screens layouts in res layout-hdpi or res layout-xlarge are taken before the ones in res layout

5475355
int	double
i know for a fact nvidia uses a float maybe double to represent colour wheras gdi uses int i believe

5475355
ati	nvidia
try comparing ati amd rendering to nvidia rendering and you can clearly see that colour is very different

5475364
children	parent
if i am understanding correctly a category belongs to a parent and a parent can have multiple children so i think you need a hasmany relationship something like this

5475414
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it is working fine in firefox google-chrome and safari but if you open it with ie the slide bar is hiding the submenu

5475497
pop-up	dialog
example francisco changes the wording of a pop-up dialog and commits his changes

5475514
width	height
to open it at the very top left with a width of 50 and height of 20 you would do

5475519
move	drag
i can drag my finger up and down and this makes the uiscrollview s scrollbars appear but my custom-drawn content never move or changes - i still always only see the top half

5475540
postfix	lamson
it looks like people have used postfix listening on port 25 and forwarding requests to lamson

5475564
stateless	stateful
because http is stateless and jsf is stateful

5475564
filtering	grouping
i ve seen lot of codes and projects which unnecessarily duplicates the entire database table into java s memory in flavor of a session scoped bean where java is been used instead of sql to filtering grouping arrange the records

5475609
disk	ram
we re running a moderate size 350gb database with some fairly large tables a few hundred million rows 50gb on a reasonably large server 2 x quad-core xeons 24gb ram 2.5 10k disk in raid10 and are getting some pretty slow inserts simple insert of a single row taking 90 seconds

5475650
mouseup	mousedown
i need to undo some behavior in a library i m using by stoppropagation of the mousedown and mouseup event for the textinput

5475650
mouseup	mousedown
as i mentioned above i need to be able to stop the propagation of mousedown and mouseup from the textinput to a component up the food chain - event.stoppropagation in mousedown and mouseup for the textinput does the trick

5475666
post	get
getting profile permissions works find yet when i post to profile permissions i get

5475667
hash	md5
if it is a standard has algorithm like md5 you can find websites that already have large mappings of source and hash and get the answer that way

5475681
windows	wow64
process or a wow64 process windows

5475710
children	parent
my question is are there any real life scenarios in which one would want to not stretch the parent element around it s children as in the overflow visible box in the above example

5475719
apache	nginx
i have nginx setup as a reverse proxy and to serve static files javascript css images and apache using mod_wsgi for serving django as described in the documentation

5475724
mouseup	mousedown
i think all you would need to do is register listeners for the mousedown mouseup and click events and then use to stop the events from bubbling further from the currenttarget out to the parents stopimmediatepropagation would stop the event from triggering listeners on the current object

5475726
mouse	joystick
i m working on a project where i need to use a joystick directinput to control the mouse pointer inside a wpf application

5475726
mouse	joystick
preferably this should actually control the mouse allowing the joystick to be used to control other applications as well

5475828
google-chrome	firefox
i m not sure if this is something that isn t supposed to work but i cannot seem to figure out why it works perfectly in ie and google-chrome but not in firefox

5475865
pop-up	dialog
what you should do instead is pop-up a loading dialog at the time the request is made then move your code for showing the other pop-up and closing the loading dialog into the complete handler

5475892
hide	show
i m trying to hide show a subset of rows when clicking a row with a specific id

5475892
hide	show
only problem is this code for some reason only hide show the very first set of rows

5475908
qmap	qdatastream
i saw in qtassistant that qdatastream supports qmap and qmultimap inherits qmap

5475910
implements	extends
consider extends the existing interface with a new interface and implements that just in the app that needs it

5475938
folder	directory
so i hava a usual flex project folder with .actionscriptproperties .flexproperties .project files in it and src libs html-template directory

5475945
getter	setter
in the preapproval class there are a few public getter setter for the datamember attributes

5475947
octal	hex
i don t know how to properly specify the character code of Ã¢ emdash but vim tells me it is 151 hex 97 octal 227

5475972
mp3	wav
you can easily save that data as it happens and subsequently save that file as a new wav mp3 what-have-you

5476005
bmp	png
the second parameter lets you pick the format you want to save the image on like bmp png or jpeg

5476007
versioning	upgrade
this way you ll get a chance to run code not only once per app lifetime but also once per versioning upgrade

5476063
width	height
jquery now uses a csshooks feature for certain .css requests width and height in particular

5476081
jobs	cron
specific use i have jobs scheduled to run daily using a cron trigger

5476110
client-side	server-side
this is a very nice way of designing your code because it decouples any client-side requirements from those on the server-side

5476112
udp	tcp
according to unix network programming vol1 received udp packets and received tcp packets are never passed to a raw socket

5476112
udp	tcp
if a process wants to read ip datagrams containing udp or tcp packets the packets must be read at the datalink layer .

5476133
postgresql	mysql
install mysql postgresql image magick etc

5476151
firefox	safari
the first code snippet below works in ie and firefox but doesnÃ¢ t pop a new window in safari

5476161
qtextedit	qfile	qstring	qtextedit	qstring	qfile
instead of using qtextbrowser setsource read the contents of the file manually with qfile and then set the contents of the browser to that qstring using qtextedit sethtml

5476161
qstring	qurl	qstring	qfile	qfile	qurl
this allows you to check that the filename returned from your database is valid that the html contents are valid by inspecting the qstring read from the qfile and that construction of the qurl and search path used by qtextbrowser setsource is not an issue

5476163
portrait	landscape
this will mean if your device is in landscape and you switch activity the new activity will display in portrait on its side and the user will then have to rotate the phone into portrait mode to view it correctly

5476175
google-chrome	firefox
you ll also want to test in ie i ve only tested in google-chrome 10 and firefox 4

5476218
put	get
you should put up some of loading image or something while it is running also anytime you call a gui you should run a loop with a timeout that activates the app then checks for the existence of the items you want to click then when it exists click it and get out of the loop

5476252
hide	show
go int edit region for the region you want to hide show

5476256
rss	feed
i just don t want to show the rss feed but i want to also show the proper nodes and

5476262
mouseup	mousedown
in such case i got what i wanted by stopping propagation on the mousedown event but not on the mouseup

5476265
submit	submission
lastly give your form a submit button and try clicking it instead of submission the form

5476284
innodb	myisam
whenever there are joins involving myisam and innodb innodb tables will end up having table-level lock behavior instead of row-level locking because of myisam s involvement in the query and mvcc cannot be applied to the myisam data

5476284
innodb	myisam
unfortunately if there is a mix of innodb and myisam in the join query the innodb tables would have to experience an intermittent lock like its myisam partners in the join query because of being held up from writing

5476284
innodb	myisam
believe it or not there is still an open ticket on innodb myisam joining during a select for update

5476333
post	get
unrelated to the concrete problem you d like to use post for this instead of get

5476384
width	height
okay so say i got a rectangle this is all 2d made from thing a s x y width and height

5476520
hash	salt
then hash this using my secret key as the salt

5476521
folder	directory
unfortunately after setting ror up all i get is a directory listing of my public folder

5476557
viewmodel	caliburn
if caliburn can help what should the viewmodel hierarchy be to support that

5476566
post	put
however i have noticed if i put other buttons on the screen and the post back it doesn t fail even after authentication has timed out

5476662
serializable	deserialization
remember each call to webservice need xml serializable deserialization time processor power + space memory

5476737
post	put
2 - use curlopt_postfields with a string and make it look like a post and then you change the http method with curlopt_customrequest to put

5476743
user-controls	elementhost
also the user-controls is being used as an elementhost in a winforms application not sure if this makes a difference

5476761
setinterval	settimeout
settimeout will only fire once setinterval will fire every x milliseconds

5476763
freebsd	linux
most of the solutions i ve found thus far are linux specific but i need this to work in freebsd

5476839
jnetpcap	libpcap
i m trying to port jnetpcap a java wrapper for libpcap with jni to android

5476839
jnetpcap	libpcap
when trying to compile jnetpcap as a shared library and linking with libpcap.a i m getting errors because some libpcap s functions weren t declared in this scope

5476849
next	except
this doesn t seem to do anything except increase the counter value next to the text box

5476875
int	chars
and as this string will contain chars in the 0-9a-f range casted to an int you have

5476894
children	parent
now parent can have it s own opacity value that will not be inherited by it s children

5476894
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this is fully supported by firefox opera google-chrome safari and ie9

5476895
qplaintextedit	qwidget
i would try subclassing qplaintextedit and reimplementing qwidget keypressevent

5476927
int	chars
this is because reading an int from the stream makes the stream read until either it reads a nondigit chars or it runs out of chars to read

5476974
keystore	jks
that s easy when the ca certs are in a jks keystore but i need to use the windows keystore as well

5477025
put	get
when i put xmlelementwrapper i get null in groupnodeslist

5477025
put	get
when i put xmllist i get an exception saying that groupnode is a complex type to be put under xmllist

5477072
maven	pom.xml
i consider this maven s pom.xml as one of the most important artifacts generated by the spring roo

5477072
maven	pom.xml
using pom.xml you can configure your ide projects settings among other maven tasks building and reporting for example

5477087
folder	directory
through putty gave ec2-user chown permissions in var www html and sub directory and plopped a simple index.html in that folder

5477189
udp	tcp	icmp	udp	icmp	tcp
when you create a raw socket you can specify which protocol to bind to udp tcp or icmp using the ipproto_tcp etc protocol options

5477189
udp	tcp
so if you set ipproto_tcp and open a raw socket on port 5000 your application will receive raw tcp packets sent to port 5000 but not raw udp packets sent to port 5000

5477227
jnetpcap	libpcap
or downgrade jnetpcap to version that support old libpcap

5477227
jnetpcap	libpcap
libpcap 0.9.8 if from 2007 so you should choose jnetpcap from around this year as well

5477288
getter	setter
org.springframework.beans.notreadablepropertyexception invalid property invalid of bean class pachet.dbo.user bean property invalid is not readable or has an invalid getter method does the return type of the getter match the parameter type of the setter

5477305
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
the other browsers opera google-chrome safari ie works well

5477395
int	double
so you will need to modify your code to either take into consideration this extra line or remove it from the first record as your code is expecting int string string string string double string whereas the first record is int string string string string double string double

5477438
rss	feed
this is a very simple question but its difficult for me to answer myself because i am testing my pipe with rss feed that are always changing

5477524
folder	directory
is there a way on build of the deployment project that i can look at the project folder and dynamically add the files and directory to the msi

5477527
post	get
i am new to jquery and ajax for that matter and i am trying to get a grasp on how the get post ajax methods work

5477588
freebsd	linux	freebsd	netbsd
there is some ability to deal with other operating systems conventions freebsd has the linuxulator which handles the linux-specific kernel interface netbsd similarly has emulators for the system call formats of other operating systems using the same hardware say ultrix on mips or osf 1 on alpha linux used to have ibcs2 to handle the unixware sco unix kernel interface wine provides replacement shared libraries and a binary loader for pe-style windows executables

5477655
google-chrome	firefox
my website has a form which works in firefox but not in ie or google-chrome

5478443
google-chrome	safari
in google-chrome and safari it works as it should

5478468

5479109
for-loop	loops	for-loop	while-loop	loops	while-loop
see also loops while-loop for-loop and do-while

5479110
for-loop	loops
in contrast to a for-loop the foreach loops doesn t require the coder to maintain a counter variable to avoid off-by-one fencepost bugs

5479168
appfuse	struts
zend really isn t substantially more complicated than say a struts + appfuse + hibernate stack

5479187
for-loop	loops
personally i used only once time ago in order to break a for-loop inside other two for loops with if-else and continue in the outer loops as break inside a loops breaks this loops but you continue in the outer loops not the most-outer that was my case

5479253
hide	show
in the first one you show the image and in the second one you hide the image

5479270

5479272
google-chrome	firefox
if you open it in firefox all works well and the position of the overlay div in the images is perfect but in google-chrome and ie the result is different

5479277
ready	each
each payment view model could implement an interface for example with a getpaymentdetails method and perhaps this could return a serialized form of the details ready to be persisted

5479277
viewmodel	caliburn
should also mention in your conductors view let s assume it s called shellview.xaml you can use a contentcontrol to display the current payment viewmodel and have caliburn inject the appropriate view and do the binding which is referenced as the activeitem

5479277
viewmodel	caliburn
caliburn will automatically bind the selected value a payment viewmodel to the activeitem property on your conductor and therefore your current view will automatically switch as you change combobox values

5479290
rational-numbers	integer	rational-numbers	fractions	integer	fractions
try integer arithmetic using rational-numbers equivalent fractions like they teach us in grade school

rsa and el gamal and similar systems work with any field that specifies both a multiplying and an add operation and ecc has a different representation of that field that magically packs more data into a bit

5479325
x509	openpgp
this is still not an easy problem as the complexity of x509 demonstrates but mechanisms such as openpgp and openssh have simpler models and mechanisms that work well for many uses

5479325
des	aes
of course speeds can vary significantly by algorithm des is wickedly slow in software and can be fast in hardware but aes is 1.8 to 3.3 times faster for small data sets on my system and could probably be much faster still in hardware.

5479356
post	get
however i am unable to get the id attribute from the post object here

5479402
pop-up	dialog
how can i make the message notfication dialog box pop-up when the page load

perhaps upgrade your versioning of gcc

5479536
disk	ram
do you have enough ram to support whatever programs are running without too much swapping to disk

5479618
ienumerable	ilist
if the library designer does not do this note that c# s ienumerable only does a small subset of the covariant portion of ilist then you re out of luck and you have to resort to the same hassles you have to do in a language without any sort of variance

5479657
setinterval	settimeout
instead of using settimeout you want to use setinterval

5479657
setinterval	clearinterval
for that you ll need to call clearinterval on the result of setinterval

5479668
setinterval	settimeout
also i would use setinterval instead of settimeout for this reason

5479669
put	get
would the application be too slow if i get the tasks at each session put them all in a list then preform my operations on that list

note i am aware of how to do recursive settimeout calls as that s what i ve been using this question is my trying to figure out if it s still worth using them or whether setinterval can be used safely

5479787
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox google-chrome it works perfectly

5479790
folder	directory	installation	upgrade
i also keep the app installation folder in the registry for major upgrade i use applicationfolder property and directory id -- instead of installlocation -- per wixui_advanced requirements

5479790

set a left margin or minus half the width of the handle

5479806
google-chrome	firefox
you can t have spaces in the window name in ie and in fact it only works in firefox google-chrome by fluke it s not compliant to try to use them

5479858
mtu	icmp
see the following wikipedia entry for an overview of mtu maximum transmission unit and a basic description of the path mtu discovery method basically setting the the df do-not-fragment flag and relying on the icmp destination unreachable datagram too big messages to detect that some node on the way couldn t handle the packet and hence try with smaller size until it goes through

5479954
put	get
this will allow you to connect to a mysql database and use all of the .net ado standard stuff to get your data and put it elsewhere

5479976

ideally i d want to be able to dlopen my exeutable and dlsym the section but that doesn t work because its a section and not a symbol

5479994
rss	feed
and just the code is pulling the title from the rss feed you can pull the description link pubdate etc

5480017
width	height
the only thing i m aware of that passes on height which hasn t come from top of the tree is an absolutely positioned element - so you could for example absolutely position all the top right bottom left sides and corners you know the height and width of the corners anyway and as you seem to know the widths of left right borders and height of top bottom borders and the widths of the top bottom centers are easy at 100 - the only thing that needs calculating is the height of the right left sides if the content grows -

5480055
post	get
i was thinking of some type of after_save to the post model but i can t get it working right

5480285
pull	push
we have a git repo hosted on a central place beanstalk and all of us push and pull there

5480294
addition	multiplication
but more to the point you don t want to be using gemm to do matrix addition -- you re doing a completely pointless matrix multiplication which takes takes 20 000 3 operations and many passes through memory for an operatinon which should only require 20 000 2 operations and a single pass

5480294
factors	matrix
matrix multiplication is memory-bandwidth intensive so there is a huge factors of 10x or 100x difference in performance between coding it yourself and a tuned version

5480302
folder	directory
i made a winforms application which acccesses folder on another server in another active directory domain

5480302
pop-up	dialog	folder	directory
the line of gets all directory from a folder but it may sometimes fail with an exception because the credentials to access the folder basic authentication have not been saved so the basic auth dialog box pop-up again and again breaking the system

5480339
width	height
the issue is that sometimes the animation is changing the width and height of the uiview

5480349
hex	binary
your guess was close - the exponent is a binary exponent not a hex exponent though

5480352
hide	show
edit here s another example that hide the element then show it and repeats forever documented code

5480356
openssl	m2crypto
if that does not work try getting and compiling openssl yourself and configuring m2crypto to use that

5480364
gesturedetector	motionevent
make use of a gesturedetector within the view.ontouchevent motionevent ev method

5480364
gesturedetector	motionevent
read the docs in your view use a gesturedetector to translate the motionevent received by the ontouchevent method..

5480367
google-chrome	firefox
instead asking it first you can simply check your code by firebug in firefox or in the developer menu in google-chrome

5480379
google-chrome	firefox
the same code works fine for google-chrome and firefox

5480382
subclass	abstract-class	implements	extends

filtering	grouping
we then grouping by set key and filtering out any sets having the wrong number of items

5480442
cpu	processors
unlike the web where preloading buffering involves downloading the file to the local system buffering on a local system is limited by the system s resources and processors cpu speed

5480454
explode	implode
after you ve removed the non-alpha characters you can explode on spaces and then implode with dashes

5480484
explode	implode
i would explode the string at the spaces and then implode it with dashes like this

memcached	apc
with your other caching back-ends apc memcached etc data is shared and available for requests from every client

5480755
memcached	apc
while per-client caches are reasonable things generally the difference in operation model between them and the other shared-storage cache back-ends you mention apc memcached etc mean that many applications that are expecting a shared-storage cache will likely break when presented with a per-client cache

5480779
textview	imageview
i am hoping there is a library like scriptaculous for javascript that allows me to easily manipulate an existing textview imageview etc

5480804
floating-point	integer
however arithmetic on numeric values is very slow compared to the integer types or to the floating-point types described in the next section

5480890
getter	setter
the types are inconsistent primitive in the getter and wrapper in the setter

5480890
getter	setter
it should work with both getter and setter set to primitive boolean even if the private var is set to wrapper boolean

post	put
you ll have to do some post processing to put the data into a comma-separated list

5480956

it says in the docs that you must implements a shell data source with a protocol handler to extends the index but then says in other places that if you re just adding a new custom file format you just have to create a filter handler or a protocol handler

5481021
union	distinct
i had to use union distinct to avoid duplicate rows being added but other than that it was pretty straight forward

5481057
ant	maven
junit junit.org drives the tests invoking a series of pages with httpclient and can be deployed alongside the application run standalone with ant maven or run separately inside your ide

5481057
junit	testng
it provides an excellent test context framework and specialized testrunners that hook in well to testing frameworks like junit or testng if you prefer

5481066

i have a class called locationservice which extends service and implements locationlistener

5481099
mp3	ogg
i have a list of files in mp3 format and in ogg format both formats for each

5481110
int	boolean
but for individual boolean 1 byte and int 4 byte values the compiler can automatically align them in such a way that the cpu can guarantee that all reads and writes to them are atomic so that isn t a problem here

5481145
screens	hdpi	screens	mdpi	mdpi	hdpi
when i run it on a 480x800 mdpi 160 simulator scale to 7 inches it works fine but on a 480x800 hdpi simulator it padding the edittext down to the near bottom of the screens nearly 600px is that 400dip x 240 160

5481148
int	double
you need to make sure the data types match as mentioned before your bubblesort class operates only on an int array this is the code as modified to work with double arrays which is what diff contains

5482033
kde	gnome
you could use other terminals too- putty xterm rxvt etc even the kde and gnome terminals are available through cygwin ports - but mintty is probably the best option for most cygwin users needs it s rather simple small and fast and it integrates well with windows

5482033

another option would be to redirect compilation messages use to redirect stdout to a file overwriting it if it already exists to append and add a if you want both stdout and stderr redirected

5482063

5482544
put	get
the issue is my repository contains a submodule which doesn t get put in the archive and therefore doesn t get put in the release directory

5482545
hash	salt
the reason to use a different salt for each user s password is so that an attacker can t take a list of all the hash passwords and see if any of them match the hash of something easy like password or 12345

5482545
salt	md5
if you were to use the password itself as salt then an attacker could calculate md5 12345 .md5 12345 and see if it matched any entries

5482545
hash	md5
for example if a user has the password password then an md5 hash stored in the database would be 5f4dcc3b5aa765d61d8327deb882cf99

5482545
hash	salt
the attacker can calculate the hash of a weak password plus your salt and see if any user in your database uses that weak password

5482545
hash	salt
use a distinct salt value - now you take something distinct like the user name e-mail address or even user id and combine that with the password and the large random string from your configuration file before you calculate the hash

5482545
hash	salt
now an attacker who knows your salt still has to recalculate the hash for every user to see if they have used a weak password like password

5482565
post	get
in order to get the list of menu items in the post action you need their corresponding values must be included in the html and because this is a collection follow the standard naming convention so that the default model binder can parse them

rss	feed
i am grabbing the rss feed from various websites and displaying the content like title title link associated image and short description in my site

depending on the browser the enter key may only cause a form submission if the form has exactly one text field or only when there is a submit button present

5482617
jobs	cron
cron does repeating periodic jobs and at and batch are for one-time jobs because those two commands don t support automatically repeating commands

5482617
jobs	cron
we use cron a lot at work for jobs

5482618
mouseover	mouseout
just that click events on them don t work anymore just the mouseover and mouseout

5482620
super	implements
the constructor is there for when you have a class that implements it you can call it implicitly or using super

5482625
subclass	abstract-class
in my opinion the constructor in abstract-class can do some init work which all the subclass do not need to repeat in its own construtor

5482634
inherited	properties
when you instantiate a class that inherited from this abstract base class you can call the constructor of the abstract base class to assign any properties private the abc

5482697
post	get
you shouldn t be sending your data as a get request you should be sending it as a multipart post call

5482713
width	height
basically add a width and height to the longlistselector

5482765
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox 4 or google-chrome 11 i see that the divs appear side by side as i would expect

5482765
google-chrome	firefox
at the top of the page ie9 works fine just like firefox and google-chrome

5482768
cassini	iis
it won t work with cassini nor iis 6.0

5482776

if the zip doesn t contain content.jar and artifacts.jar go to your eclipse install s dropins directory create a subfolder name doesn t matter and expand your zip into that folder

5482800
cvs	svn
there are version control systems like cvs which operate on the file level and there it s possible to have the version numbers of files in sync between branches but in svn you create a copy in order to create a branch

5482889
width	height
put a div over the top of your iframe like so replace top left width and height values with your own

5482955
hash	salt
the reason why random password salt is recommended for hashing password so that an attacker who knows the password hash can t compare it to rainbow table of pre-calculated hash from dictionary

5482955
hash	salt
if you re using password as salt attacker can pre-calculate hash of word.md5 word first from their dictionary

5482966
free	malloc
if the pointer is not null i free it before i use malloc

5482972
postgresql	mysql
if you are not limited to mysql postgresql sql server or oracle would give you a lot more

5483050

5483093
rss	feed
i m trying to build an open source tool that will accept rss atom url feed as input data and then i want to validate these entries to avoid errors when parsing the xml results

5483097
onclicklistener	onitemclicklistener
if you used custom adapter for listview then you set clickevent on button or other views.you can t set onclickevent in main file because in that file we set onitemclicklistener if you want onclicklistener on particular view like button then you written your code in onclicklistener code that write in the adapter class

5483100
sorting	filtering
i don t know what kind of application you are developing but if you need to display data in a datagrid i would suggest using the devexpress xtragrid available for winforms wpf silverlight and asp.net which has a servermode which works pretty well with subsonic s linqtemplates since it can be bound to an iquerable and itself handles the paging sorting filtering on the iquerable and only needs a few records at a time

5483147
dxcore	coderush
it is possible to do this with the parsers that are part of dxcore and coderush

5483160

children	parent
parentid list which is parent id list is are id of menu record that have child i just want to load all record includes root menu that have no children record and children record

5483353
inherited	properties
but if you want to take advantage of javascript s prototypical inherited you can t use any properties on this to refer to the parent because you ll run into the grand-child problem it s easy to create a parent child hierarchy that way but it fails as soon as you try to create a grandparent parent child hierarchy

5483353
superclass	subclassing
when defining the subclassing you assign the superclass s version of the function to a property on the subclassing s version of the function

5483361
uilabel	uibutton
note that the green bar is a uiview and notifications is a uilabel and round button is a uibutton all set up in ib

5483370
rspec	capybara
my recommendation would be to use either shoulda extends test unit or rspec with capybara and -no- cucumber

5483397
google-chrome	firefox
the moment i add at the top of the page ie9 works fine just like firefox and google-chrome

5483482
ssms	sqlcmd
go is not sql command it is special batch control command for tools like sqlcmd osql or query editor in ssms

5483483
cpython	ironpython
by the way if you really are an expert at java or c# threading then you probably should go with threading instead but use jython or ironpython instead of cpython

5483499
xmltype	clob
if the values only contain xml then either clob or xmltype may be used - you ll need to work out which is better for your situation - more info here

5483693
post	get
everyone can send you a post or a get for that matter request

5483701
ocl	uml
it used to be ocl in uml 1.x but now with uml2 direct access to the metamodel you can just create any constraints directly in the model without any transformation

5483701
ocl	uml
my workaround is also better because i can write whatever i want and directly put it inside my class diagram without having two different models one for uml and one for ocl

5483703
width	height
if i set its width and height to 100 it s trying to fit parent s size but it keeps width-to-height proportion so if it s proportion does not equal parent s proportion there can appear empty space near this component when resizing parent

5483704
subclass	abstract-class
write the application differently - create a matching interface and write the service provider implementation against it testing that and also write a minimal subclass of the abstract-class that does nothing more than forward calls to the interface

5483721
put	get
in fact when trying to put htmlencoded entities back into xml those will get messed up because entities start with an ampersand and that would get encoded then to for instance lt

5483749
post	get
sure you can use get or post

5483751
dlsym	dlopen
i could use dlopen to load gtk but that s ridiculous because i d have to give the full path to it and then i d have to call dlsym a lot to link every function that i need

5483755
getter	setter
take the javabeans approach where a bean has to have a getter and setter

5483761
gif	png
we support png jpeg and gif formats

5483779
packets	multicast
at this point the only way to receive the needed multicast packets is to add in the routing table a rule to reach the network where the sender is another network trough the dvb as if the dvb needs to reply to the multicast sender

imagemagick	graphicsmagick
take a look into imagemagick or it s open source alternative graphicsmagick

5484278
disk	ram
well for a computer with 12gb or ram and 2tb of hard drive maybe you can say it can take 20 years for the program to exceed the capability of the computer when hard disk is full or when the 12gb of ram cannot fit all the variables it might be billion of years that an integer cannot fit in 1gb of ram but as far as the program is concerned it just keep running unless the memory manager cannot allocate another bignum or the hard drive is full that the exception is raised and the program is forced to stop but the program is written to run indefinitely

5484280
pbkdf2	hash	scrypt	pbkdf2
if one doesn t want to use a proper password derivation function Ã£ la bcrypt scrypt or pbkdf2 you should at least use sha-256 for new designs and have a plan to migrate to sha-3 when it will be out so be sure to store the scheme you used to hash the password with the result so both scheme can coexist as you use the new hashing procedure when people change passwords

this can of course be done by just doing two queries against the db one to get the matching rows for the parent and one for each row that was found to know how many children have that as parent

5484338
children	parent
i have two tables table1 contains parent and children and table2 contains the information and the id here is ofcourse the id that is saved in parent and children in table1

5484338
children	parent
now i want to first find all the children to a certain parent and in the same sql-statement i want to know how many children is connected to each child

5484338
children	parent
so parent 807 has two children 808 and 809

5484338
children	parent
my sql looks like this gets the children to parent 807

5484378
width	height
what i need is for the wrap1 to only be if they make it smaller than the width of the content then it automatically increases the height of the div so it doesnt go outside the wrap1 div at present it is forcing it down onto second line correctly but div height is a wrong

serializable	deserialization
the complete process of serializable involves also deserialization in which the java object will be reconstructed

5484603
serializable	deserialization
therefore adding a private constructor to a serializable class will not work on the way back deserialization and since you can t have both private and public constructors with the same arguments in gwt case the default - no args - one stick with the public modifier

5484611
google-chrome	firefox
i found that with this hack it did not work in firefox or google-chrome if i place the code block inside the document ready event using telerik .scriptregistrar .ondocumentready the properly window.mvcclientvalidationmetadata is somehow cleared when it reaches this event even though the metadata are properly pushed in originally

udp	tcp
it is common for clients to implement reliability on top of udp if they need reliability or sometimes just some reliability but not any of the other things that tcp offers for example strict in-order delivery and if they want at the same time low latency or multicast where it works

5485831
udp	tcp
also note that it is easy to implement your own stack on top of udp that performs worse than tcp

5485844
udp	tcp
seams like you are mixing tcp socket serversocket and udp datagramsocket

5485859
udp	tcp
what i mean here is that due to the connection -based nature of tcp ip as opposed to the isolated datagrams of udp ip

5486310
put	get
if you don t want to change the aspx s but can easily change the definition of the dbrset property you can put there a wrapper over the sqldatareader and implement your own indexer that would first check for null and go into the inner datareader to get the value if not null

5489006
opera	firefox
this is possible in firefox and opera but impossible in both webkit and ie 8

5489009
submit	submission
this allows in the case of multiple image images submit buttons for the server to distinguish which one was activated since only the activated submission control is successful included in the submitted data

5489035
children	parent
for my form however i want to have a select list made up of the child elements so that the parent form has a list of children

5489093
inherited	properties
this is not necessary but by doing so i can inherited the maven properties i ve defined

5489093
maven	pom.xml
note that the id declared in the asembly descriptor for the individual swf plugin projects is now used as a classifier in the dependency section of the pom.xml file as well as a part of the maven location in the assembly descriptor

5489093
maven	pom.xml
i could either double the projects and package them together like i do with my stylesheets or i could run the entire maven reactor for the parent pom.xml and master assembly twice with different groupids and thus create two completely separate paths for all involved projects

5489096
maven	pom.xml
i did not find a way to create multiple artifacts from the same pom.xml file not even to run the flexmojo compile target more than once even when binding with execution tag maven will complain

5489096
maven	pom.xml
the main project pom.xml see below gets a manually derived name while all other projects main application and all stylesheets are automatically derived from this and produce maven artifacts which are only used internally

5489156
children	parent
to delete the node check if it has children if it doesnt free it and remove references to it such as the parent child ptr

5489177
hide	show
another option would be to add a property to the child page and master page and use session data to hide and show buttons

5489177
hide	show
in your master page you could have a session variable you can set to hide and show the buttons

5489177
hide	show
you would then check the homevisible property when loading the master page to show hide the button

5489218
width	height
targetimage- height 300 cap- width

5489235
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	width	margin
if you use google-chrome or safari or firebug with firefox for that matter you can easily check out the width of an element and how padding and margin in affecting it

5489259
memcpy	memmove
use a copy operation to correctly copy the contents rather than assign the addresses as suggested use std copy - or others such as memcpy prefer memmove - it s a little slower but is well defined for overlapping blocks etc.

5489311
inherited	properties
particular on whether we can define properties in an aggregating pom and then inject them into the referenced modules thus allowing that module to locally overwrite the default properties defined in the inherited hierarchy

5489311
inherited	properties
we would like a super parent pom for both parenta and parentb to inherited shared properties and config such as dependencymanagement and plugins etc

5489311
inherited	properties
these build files are not part of any inherited tree so nothing will pick up the properties

5489311
inherited	properties
but when we need to override this inherited we would like to be able to specify injectable properties in the build file which would act exactly as if they had been specified in the module originally

5489579
disk	ram
computing the index tree is not really cpu-heavy and since the index pages should fit in ram on any modern system the operation of inserting a single node when the tree is not rebalanced would be close to o 1 time-wise a single disk operation to update a leaf page of the index

5489584
hash	salt	hash	md5	salt	md5
the salt is used to prevent rainbow table attacks where a dictionary of common works hash with md5 is used to try to gain entry

5489584
hash	salt	hash	md5	salt	md5
using the salt ensures that even if they had an md5 hash of the word it wouldn t work because they don t know the salt

5489584
hash	md5
the md5 algorithm is a 1 way hash algorithm and not an encryption value

one would be to use nginx and apache have nginx server static files for your django application and if possible might be able forge a bridge to have it serve file attachments from a couchdb-document not sure if that is actually possible

5489795
apache	nginx
you would also have nginx serve as a proxy to the apache django portion to handle application logic

5489795
apache	nginx
i m by far no expert in the area most of my experience is nginx apache and django but i ve been following couchdb for quite sometime and there was a time when everyone would park it behind nginx for security purposes but i believe those issues have been resolved.

public	protected
i ve read thorough all your comments and i agree with most of the conclusions however i have one scenario in which i think will benefit from public protected partial methods without loosing the original intent

5491014

the problem is sometimes the repaint method exists in the object for purposes other than being called from the generated code at that point when i declare the method body i should be able to make it internal protected or public

i have an old awt swing application

5492028
for-loop	loops
whether writing the for-loop like that is a good idea or why is it not just using the erase-remove idiom are different issues as a matter of fact the previous loops is arguably better than erase-remove for a list the concrete situation is that the semantics have changed and because the type is syntactically compatible with the previous one the compiler will not notice that the code is wrong it will not point you to that function and chances are that you will not review rewrite it

5492029
stdout	stderr
attempts are being made to get a proper ipc component that will allow you to write to the process stdin and read from its stdout and stderr but this is not yet available in releases of xulrunner
