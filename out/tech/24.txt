1400062
serializable	deserialization
this isn t exactly an answer to your question but since reflection.emit isn t supported in cf an alternative approach you could take to serializable deserialization would be to compile your classes into a regular windows application and make use of reflection.emit to programatically generate serializable and de-serialize methods for each class which could then be incorporated back into the class in the cf version

1400910
getter	setter
some of you have been told to always include setter and getter methods for all private instance variables

1400910
getter	setter
but isn t including those kinds of setter getter a core part of creating javabeans

1401117
post	get
if i switch the getjson call with a .ajax get or post everything works fine

1401118
getter	setter
you do not want to blindly create getter and setter for all instance variables

1401118
getter	setter
if you have a bankaccount class with a balance instance variable creating getter and setter for it makes sense if you want to be able to check and set the balance

1401118
getter	setter
so the getter setter still allows for the implementation to vary and thus does not violate encapsulation and by extension neither do javabeans

1401118
getter	setter
if the client does not need access or modify this there is no point in creating a getter or setter for it

1401124
getter	setter
getter and setter are not required in a java bean class

1401124
getter	setter
however in order for variables to be discovered automatically when your bean is used you must provide getter and setter following a standard naming convention getvarname setvarname...

versioning	upgrade
so if your application was installed by a windows xp or vista user and then that user upgrade to windows 7 your default protected admin user will be denied write permission on the application folder since it has a different sid under the new versioning of windows

1402339
versioning	upgrade
this problem would only affect you if you try to upgrade the dependent assemblies and it would only affect users who installed your application under an earlier versioning of windows and then upgrade to windows 7 so i don t know how big a deal this would be for you

1402362
for-loop	arrays
you could then initialize the arrays linearly or with a nested for-loop

1402362

cpython	ironpython
2 the libraries in ironpython are very different than cpython

1403134

width	height
i have an issue with regards to using a scaletransform on a canvas in silverlight the canvas scales correctly however the height and width values always remain the same

1404217
width	height
a 100x100 canvas scaled so it appears 200x200 is still 100x100 with regards to the height and width values how can these be updated to reflect the new size

1404217
width	height
another related issue is how to alter the height and width of an element and have this scale the canvas or xaml element appropriately ie

1404217
width	height
setting a 100x100 element to 200x200 makes everything in it twice as big - this should be a solution where only the height and width of the element are set to alter the scale

1404217
width	height
height and width need updated so that when this canvas is in a scrollviewer the scrollbar correctly updates for the new size - this happens if the height and width is assigned manually to the new scaled size but this needs to work for all sizes

1404217
width	height
conversly i need to have another canvas that when its height and width is changed the elements inside are scaled appropriately as this will be a resizable icon for use on the same or another canvas

1404217
width	height
if this is not possible in silverlight directly is there anyway of achieving this effect in code if not in xaml as this is possible in wpf if an imagebrush is used however silverlight does not support this and need a scalable canvas and a canvas that when scaled updates it s own height and width

i m extends exception to implements a setter on the message property

1404559
super	extends
and that solves requirements 1 2 and 6 but id does not allow super calls new functions override parent functions constructor chaining and dynamically extends a parent does not provide the new methods to a child class

rss	feed
what i have is a web application which runs a particular job every hour to poll a number of rss feed and at any time a user can define a new rss feed for polling

1404735
width	height
so it s not possible for its width and height properties to reflect the transform

1404867
dictionary	map
if you want to add objects of simple types like string or double to a resource dictionary today you need to map the needed clr-namespaces to an xml namespaces

super	extends
categories extends the original class but they don t subclass it therefore a call to super doesn t find the method

1405094
superclass	subclassing
alternatively you could subclassing the class and then either use the subclassing or use + void poseasclass class aclass to replace the superclass

1405098
gif	png
an alternative to regular images png gif jpg would be to use the w3c recommended svg scalable vector graphics format

ienumerable	iqueryable
there s an asqueryable extension method that i believe you can use on a generic list ienumerable or array that will convert any list of objects to an iqueryable

1405470
int	double
you must cast one to a double otherwise c# will do int division

1405506
post	put	post	get	put	get
get head requests should not have any harmful side-effects from http 1.1 spec 9.1 in particular the convention has been established that the get and head methods should not have the significance of taking an action other than retrieval. that s what post put delete methods are for

getter	setter
there is also a generate getter and setter feature which also generates the appropriate code in the function bodies

1405732
put	get
depending on the chosen method it will get added to your application automatically former case or you may want to put proxy class into you app_code folder latter case

1405801

width	height
the width is greater than the height so our calculations are

1406092
width	height
a container set to inline-block can receive properties only afforded to blocks such as width or height without loosing the default positioning associated with an inline container

1406101
width	height
if you re looking for an alternative plugin i d suggest looking into blockui as the css for its overlay is easily configurable and you should be able to accomplish a full-size dialog by using 100 for the height and width properties

1406109
tlistview	tlistbox
i know it s not a listbox and it s a little bit complex than tlistbox but it can act like tlistbox or tlistview ttreeview and it s way faster than standart tlistbox tlistview ttreeview. it can add 1000000 items in 125ms

1406127
width	height
there should amend the height and width options to fill the window

1406180
post	get
just use get or post data as normal

1406182
multiplying	division
originally two answers multiplying upvoted and even originally accepted both currently deleted were buggy -- not doing the -1 before the division and dividing by 4 instead of 3

gridview	detailsview
so in short add the timestamp to the datakeynames of the gridview detailsview etc and remove any visible fields

1406278
listview	gridview
i have a listview which is using a gridview to display a datatable and when new rows are added to the datatable the listview grows as expected but when it reaches the bottom of the canvas it carries on growing

1406391
gridview	objectdatasource
user control has gridview which is populated using objectdatasource

inherited	properties
note the parameters for the ftp task have been set as properties this allows them to be overridden from the command-line and or inherited from the parent pom

1406463
hash	md5
there are test suites available for determining hash collisions for md5 for use in breaking md5 hash comparisons

1406501
salt	md5
if you build something such as a random salt stored with your data plus the current time if associated with the record you are protecting into the md5 generation then it will dramatically increase the difficulty of the attack

1406560
put	get
what is most puzzling is that if i turn around and get a new meta instance with that project_id and put the data in it saves no problem to the db

1406566
int	double
if any of the numbers you re working with are int types you ll need to cast them to double or floats or any real number type before the divisions

1406571
google-chrome	firefox
it works for my firefox 2 google-chrome 2

1406589
int	boolean
it is easier to manage you only have to deal with a single int value whereas an array of boolean would store quite differently in say a database

1406752
unsigned	short
set c unsigned short arg0

1406752
integer	unsigned	unsigned	short
you don t need to worry about endianness since each unsigned short in your utf-16 uchar type holds a code point or half surrogate as a native binary integer

1406768
post	get
the ways to reliable keep state between requests are memcache the datastore or through the user cookies or post get

1406772
put	get
it s a bit of a hack yes but if you can put in an unrealistic say 1 1 1770 constant piece of data that you could insert at the database file read data input level then use the column labelfunction to render as null if the data matches that column it should work or at least the sort function will get called

1406777
int	double
you basically have to type it to a string float double int or whatever you need.

1406799
pull	push
this will most likely push them away from the base shape so you need to pull them back onto the base shape

1406845
google-chrome	firefox
firing this testpage up in ie will result in a messagebox which shows what it s supposed to while loading it in firefox or google-chrome results in a messagebox which says null

superclass	subclassing
how can i get logging messages to output in both the superclass and subclassing

1406931
superclass	subclassing
edit the way i am do the logging is that i have an instance variable in both the subclassing and superclass so it would look something like the following

jquery	simplemodal
i m using the simplemodal popup in jquery and i would like to set the height of my popup dynamically depending on my content

1407082
post	get
a 501 response means not implemented and is usually taken to mean that the server didn t understand the http method that you used get post etc

1407082
post	get
either way the server is saying that it doesn t under the get or the post method whichever one your code is actually sending

1407094
implements	extends
you should make your save method virtual or abstract and implements extends the method as needed for each entity

1407098
spaces	delimiter
this is especially handy for iterating through the spaces or return delimiter results from the stdout of any of a number of unix commands

1407106
width	height
when i inspect the contentsize variable the width is 252 and the height is 36 which is expected

1407106
width	height
but if instead of 300.0f i plug in 222.0f into the width variable the width is 189 but the height is still 36 and only the first 4 longtext words are displayed on 2 lines the third line seems to be cut off somehow in the calculation

1407111
pop-up	dialog
you use ajax instead of a redirect so that you can specify incorrect credentials and the browser doesn t pop-up a dialog

1407116
postgresql	mysql
having said that i like working with it it s usable outside the framework and it will give you mysql postgresql or sqlite support

1407124
getter	setter
my understanding was that the getter simply returned a pointer to either nil or an object that already exists was set by the setter i think i understand the retain as we are giving away a pointer and we need to track that but what about the release is that just a failsafe incase i later forget to release the nsstring object

1407214
websphere	ibm
we have a webservice running on websphere 6.1 using the ibm jax-rpc based webservices

1407380
equals	gethashcode
i am curious to know the scenarios real world examples when one should use a custom object for key and thus implement methods gethashcode equals etc

1407394
min	max
add the company name to the group and perform a min max to grab one in the select list

1407395
cos	sin
e it cos t + i sin t

1407399
equals	gethashcode
since your addresscachekey type overrides the equals and gethashcode methods they would be a good candidate for a key in the dictionary and you would be able to determine whether or not you needed to take a trip to the database to retrieve a record based on more than one piece of data

1407408
equals	gethashcode
you should override equals and gethashcode whenever the default equals tests for reference equality will not suffice

1407408
equals	gethashcode
and you want two point s two be considered equals if their x s are equals and their y s are equals then you will need to override equals and gethashcode

1407410
equals	gethashcode
if you are writing a class that might possibly be used by someone else you will want to define gethashcode and equals when reference equals is not enough

1407457
int	chars
you can use a regular expression to see whether your input line matches your expected format using the regex in your question then you can run the above code without having to check for value and knowing that the int x conversion will always succeed since you ve already confirmed that the following chars groups are all digits

1407489
filesystems	ntfs
directly in the ntfs filesystems

1407510
equals	gethashcode
just to make it clear there is one important thing about and gethashcode dictionary uses gethashcode to determine if two keys are equals if is of custom type you should care about implementing gethashcode carefully

1407510
equals	gethashcode
based on ergwun s comment i checked the behavior of with special respect to tkey s implementation of equals object and gethashcode

1407526
post	get
i have been through many post on this site and examples on the web but cant get the web server to proceed after i tell the thread to wait

versioning	upgrade
i wonder how many users still have not upgrade their phones from versioning 2.2.1

1407561
getter	setter
if class1 and class2 may in fact contain a null id you want to modify your getter setter to get set integers instead of primitive ints

1407561
getter	setter
if both class1 and class2 should never contain a null id and you consider this to be a class invariant you may keep the primitive int type in the getter setter and either

1407561
getter	setter
if class1 may have a null id but class2 may not you should have class1 s getter and setter use an integer type instead of an int primitive and you should create a dozer customconverter that returns a default value when the source field is null

1407564
folder	directory
the log directory will probably be one or two folder up from the root http folder so it may not be accessible using the iis user

1407567
cvs	svn
i have a rather complicated deploy setup for our drupal site that is a combination of cvs and svn

1407567
cvs	svn
we use cvs to get the newest versions of modules and we deploy with svn

1407567
cvs	svn
unfortunately when cvs updates remove files subversions complains because they weren t removed in svn

1407568
kde	gnome
i ve found that gtk+ apps come closer to looking right in kde than qt apps do in gnome but not by enough to matter

1407579
spaces	delimiter
by default cut uses a tab as a delimiter and subversion may output spaces there

1407640
int	chars
getchar returns an int to differentiate between a valid chars and eof

1407651
atof	strtod
by using strtod instead of atof props to p daddy i was able to cut it by 90 chars

scons	autotools
it derives from the concepts of other build tools such as scons autotools cmake or ant

1407909
put	get
i am sure i am probably doing something silly here involving scope but i can t quite put my finger on it the error i get is this

1407920
width	height
then it looks at the height of the scaled image and if that is not big enough to also cover the window top-to-bottom it calculates how much bigger it must make the image in order to covert that part then scales the width up by that amount and sets the height to the window height

1407924
firefox	safari
this works very well in firefox and safari but they do not work at all for ie

1407925
realloc	malloc	realloc	strcpy	strcpy	malloc	strlen	realloc	strlen	strcpy
if you want to accumulate an array of strings instead of just processing them one by one puts b above then you ll need to get your hands dirty with realloc malloc strcpy and strlen

1407931
jsr168	jsr286
i haven t really kept abreast of jsr286 portlet 2.0 - this stuff should work with jsr168 portlet 1.0 - so it is worth checking the new api if you re using it.

1407937
getter	setter
the actions are separate classes but i m creating a new instance of them in the view passing the view into the action s constructor and providing getter and setter on the view which the action calls directly

1407972
versioning	upgrade
upgrade project we will be upgrading to the newest versioning

stdout	stderr
alternatively you can also pass subprocess.pipe to the stderr and stdout to suppress the messages

my only concern with a notsupportedexception is that generally those are the exceptions that get thrown when dark matter has been introduced to the system or to put it another way this method must go into the system on this interface but we won t turn it on until version 2.4

1412631
addition	multiplication
write your own relational operations and exclude the used of addition or multiplication as a possibility

1412688
int	chars
as mentioned in the comments below and in the linked article chars int unit empty list and some instances of variant types will have this property

1412713
innodb	myisam
you can alter your myisam tables to innodb and then define foreign key constraints with the on delete cascade option

1412719
octal	decimal
this is because 0123 is octal notation because of the 0 at the beginning while 123 is decimal

1412722
octal	decimal
because 0123 means 123 in octal base 8 which is 83 in decimal

1412725
octal	hex
prefixing a number with 0 indicates octal base 8 much the same way 0x indicates hex base 16

1412730
octal	decimal
0123 is notation for an octal number 83 decimal off the top of my head whilst 123 is a decimal number

1412775
melt	reshape
i thought of using the reshape package to melt the data but that is just a preliminary thought

1412882
clang	llvm
when i switch the compiler version to clang llvm 1.0 in existing projects i get the following build error when precompiling the .pch file

1412882
clang	llvm
additionally xcode should not even be trying to find llvm-gcc-4.2 as the whole point is that i switched from that compiler to the new one clang llvm 1.0

1412901
ready	each
the first ajax request that i make alerts the server that i want some json content and it begins building and cacheing a response sending me back status pending for each subsequent ajax request until the json is ready

1412929
mouse	keyboard
important the user could select a cell by keyboard tab or arrow and by mouse clicking

1412931
rss	feed
jeremy - at this point you d be better off emailing me or even better writing to the hecl mailing list rather than relying on my rss feed to notify me of so articles related to hecl

1412935
int	chars
if they are chars type of data you might need to convert them to int in the where clause to get it to work

1412956

i made this script to show and hide these spans once clicking on a section of the image map

1412956
google-chrome	firefox

1412981
lisp	scheme
if i want to learn clojure should i start by learning scheme or common lisp

1412990
lisp	scheme
the differences between lisp and scheme and clojure itself for that matter shouldn t be a concern especially if you are just starting to learn

1412998
folder	directory
all i want to do is add folder from my local computer to the repo setup in the remote directory

1413011
post	get
the problem with the post approach is that you are not saving anything by your actions and so you are expressing your intentions better with a get request

1413042
hide	show
link how to show hide divs by select. jquery

1413072
hide	show
swap show hide so that it looks like this

1413169
int	double
however if you have multiple different types of data like string int double currencies percentages etc which all use a jtextfield as an editor then you need to create multiple custom editors

1413174
lisp	scheme
if you really want to study lisp scheme is a good place to start

1413193
boost	stl
this seems to be a common ish sort of problem but it s not one that s solved by boost or the stl

1413203
ocp	principles
ocp open closed principles is one of the solid principles

i need to collect data text and radio button dropbox checkbox selections on a web form store it somewhere then provide the ability for users to display similarly collected data from other users as well as search sort and filter the aggregate data

1413296
put	get
i d like to avoid reloading the first page just to get the id value but i don t want to put the id in a querystring

1413308
post	get
also in firebug where it says either post or get it says options

1413311
throttling	throttle
any system that implements throttling in php is likely just going to throttle sending it off the the mta and the mta still ends up being a point of failure

1413312
post	get
have the link post instead of get

1413324
maven	m2e
if you are also using m2e it should work ok with maven projects as well as long as you ensure that maven and eclipse are compiling to the same target folder so the eclipse incremental compiler can be used to modify the class file

1413369
int	boolean
however i don t believe its appropriate to write out that special case explicitly in your function either otherwise your function is incongruent with the way .net implicitly treats int and boolean

1413401
lisp	scheme
use the ideas that make lisp scheme powerful but rethink them around the java platform

1413403
submit	submission
put general form submission stuff in form.onsubmit rather than an onclick on the first submit button

1413484
x86	64bit
the differences between 64bit and 32 bit jits can be considerable especially on x86 platforms where calling conventions can change and enregistering opportunities are very different

dotnetzip	sharpziplib
i m aware of dotnetzip and sharpziplib but neither support the asynchronous functions from what i can tell

1413521
lisp	scheme
they are excellent if for some reason you want to use standard scheme or standard common lisp on the jvm

1413550
haskell	ocaml
interpreters do exist for static languages haskell and ocaml both have interpreters and there used to be a popular interpreter for c but that was a long time ago

1413550
lisp	scheme
however the points he describes can be handled at run-time in a compiler and many compilers exist for lisp and scheme that have this type of dynamic binding

1413558
inherited	subclassing
the same inherited annotation is on the subclassing

1413560
postgresql	mysql
for instance many db libraries act as interfaces in that they can operate with many different actual dbs mssql mysql postgresql sqlite etc. without the code that uses the db library having to change at all

1413663
processors	hyperthreading
spinwait is useful on hyperthreading processors

1413663
processors	hyperthreading
with hyperthreading multiple os scheduled threads can be running on the same physical processors sharing the processors resources

1413663
cpu	processors
spinwait indicates to the processors that you are not doing any useful work and that it should run code from a different logical cpu

1413663
processors	hyperthreading
if this thread is running on a thread on a hyperthreading processors it is consuming processors resources that could be used for other threads running on the processors

1413669
width	height
if it were up to me i would design the triangle so that it would be immutable and take in the width and height in the constructor

1413682
x86	64bit
still if anyone knows a consistent class or registry key that will output 32 64 32-bit 64bit or x86 x64 i would greatly appreciate the information

1413738
children	parent
normally this wouldn t matter since the parent would usually become large enough to contain all of the children so they would show through the parent s background

1413862
pull	push
now all is setup well and everybody is able to do whatever they are expected to they are able to pull push commit - everything looks fine except when we check logs

1413890
stdout	fflush
maybe you have to call fflush stdout at the end of your program to fflush console output

1413906
public	protected
1b or are they just called at the top to set them to be protected private public

1413910
post	get
if the latter and i think you will eventually have this problem it s because you are returning the entire view regardless of whether you get the page via ajax or a full post

1413911
micrium	freertos
i know i can go with something like freertos iar powerpac or micrium to name just some of the options for the os and file system

1413913
serializable	deserialization
this is probably not the answer you are looking for but there are plans to implement proper polymorphic deserialization and necessary support on serializable for it for jackson version 1.4 or so not the next one 1.3 but one after that

1413913
serializable	deserialization
for current version you have to implement custom serializable deserializers i would probably just define factory method for deserialization and type getter for serializable define getanimaltype or whatever in abstract base class as abstract override in sub-classes -- or even just implement in base class output class name of instance class

1413970
cfstring	nsstring
i believe that you can t do this directly but you can create a custom static probe that feeds in the cfstring nsstring as a char which you can use with copyinstr

1414007
cvs	svn

1414011
put	get
i have tried to put the code in linklabel_click event handler in try-catch block but i still get the error below

1414030
udp	tcp
it may be the case that i m just misthinking that a browser acts more like a udp client than tcp in this instance but any suggestions or explanations would be welcome

1414070
children	parent
if you add the children first then parent elements then their parent elements and so on you will incur a major performance cost due to invalidation of all children in the tree instead of just the path back to the root through each parent

1414086
validationsummary	customvalidator
i have a customvalidator requiredfieldvalidator and validationsummary controls on an aspx page to check the current password and make sure the new password is not blank

1414103
versioning	upgrade
please upgrade to the alpha versioning of the groovy-eclipse plugin v2

1414118

short answer dijkstra s is your best bet if you want just a few shortest paths and the floyd-warshall algorithm is better if you want to find the shortest paths between every pair of nodes

1414255
implements	extends
his take on the program to the interface statement as you can gather from his title is that you should happily implements interfaces but very rarely use the extends keyword to subclass

1414273
mouse	keyboard
one usually on the keyboard for modifier keys and such and the other on the mouse

sorting	grouping
paging with grouping works with a trick but than sorting fails on complete dataset

1414670
applaud	ripple
while i applaud your idea and realization of uniqueidentifier being a really bad choice for a primary and clustering key in a sql server table i think in this particular case i d probably leave it as is - trying to convert that will cause lots of ripple changes all throughout the asp.net tables - probably just not worth the effort

1414711
firefox	safari
it looks fine in safari firefox but in ie these pages just float the div left

1414748
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
at the moment firefox 3 internet explorer 7 safari 3 google-chrome renders this list perfectly screenshot here

1414856
ocl	uml
so if you have purchased a high-end uml tool which supports mapping ocl to code generation set up a stereotype in your tool to express what the strategy pattern is and then generate code which includes those assertions if they are runtime or applies the assertions to the structure in the model if they are meta model assertions

1414856
super	abstract
i m not quite sure whether the tools let you write constraints against the metamodel - ie assert that a strategy must provide a function which rather than just asserting the pre and post conditions but then such assertions are also checked by the type system of most languages if you make the method abstract in the super type of the strategy anyway

1414870
postgresql	mysql
the cms is build on php and mysql or postgresql

hash	salt
never store passwords in a database but store a salt and hash version of every password

1415160
hash	salt
second rule calculate a hash over password with additional salt and store this in your database

1415160
hash	salt
then hash again with hash plus salt

1415160
hash	salt
better yet create a list of salt just list of words and whenever a new user account is created pick a random salt word to use to hash his username plus password

1415160

getter	setter
it s quite tedious when all 3 things are needed or when i have to delete all 3 and i m wondering if there s a plugin or something where you can simply say i m going to have a variable called foo of type bar and i want getter setter methods for it

1415767
getter	setter
according to convention properties should typically not do anything substantial in the getter or setter

1415780
int	chars
bit 32 is the lsb of int 1 ... then that s the same in little endian as bit 0 is the lsb of chars 0 .

1415780
int	chars
bit 32 is the lsb of chars 4 ... in which case you can just cast a pointer to the int array to a pointer to chars array

1415786
hex	binary
i read the file in binary mode converted by the data into a string representation of the hex values and used unofficial wordperfect documentation to create regular expressions to swap out all the hex strings representing non-text formatting codes and meta data then converted everything back into text

google-chrome	firefox
if you want to know how firefox 3.5 or google-chrome gets the geolocation then please take a look here how google firefox geolocation api works

1415926
google-chrome	firefox
basically what firefox 3.5 as well as google-chrome does is to get the list of nearby wi-fi networks and send that list using json to a google webservice which will then return the approximate coordinates

1415926
google-chrome	firefox
to get geolocation from firefox google-chrome you just call a few javascript methods

1416042
unix	bsd
the winsock api is based on unix bsd sockets

1416064
dictionary	map	hash	salt
the point is since salt is different for each user you cannot use a prebuilt dictionary of hash to map the hash passwords to clear text rainbow attack

1416068
hash	salt
when creating the hash password you should use double salt

1416068
hash	md5	hash	salt	salt	md5
create a salt random md5 or sha1 then use format something like sha1 -- password-- salt-- and then store hash password and salt in database

mef	prism
today i would say prism and mef complement each other

1416077
mef	prism
thus as prism is currently built on unity you can use it to leverage mef

1416077
mef	prism
this means with mef you have modularity from top to bottom wheras with prism modules are more granular units

1416090
mef	prism
as far as prism with mef the challenge at this point is you need to write a bunch of code as prism does not yet have implementations of the services necessary to talk to mef

1416090
mef	prism
it enables unity and mef to talk back to one another thus you can using the existing prism source with mef through the unity bridge

1416097
hash	salt
since the salt is some private string only you possess knowing the hash of a salt password will not help an attacker who has a run of the mill rainbow table

1416097
hash	salt
if the salt is the same for every user then when he sees that the hash xyz123 corresponds to apple and notices that another user s hash is also xyz123 he can conclude that that user s password is apple

1416097
hash	salt
if you store the hash of username+salt+password you only need to know the single global salt value at lookup time

1416103
hash	salt
you can take for example a hash of the id and a salt value and store it- you can then verify the token when the user connects

uiview	calayer
the uiview is a delegate to the calayer and is responsible for drawing it s graphics when needed

1416197
uiview	calayer
calayer will let it s delegate the uiview draw into a cgcontextref

aptana radrails is a free one based on eclipse does regular ruby too

1416548
textmate	aptana	textmate	radrails	komodo	aptana	komodo	radrails	aptana	radrails
you might want to try komodo edit which is more in line with textmate than say a full blown ide like aptana radrails

1416567
put	get
put b over a using a blend mode get the resulting image

1416589
octal	hex	octal	decimal
also if given base 0 it will assume hex if the string begins with 0x octal if it begins with 0 and decimal otherwise

1416593
profiling	benchmarking
you could always profiling or benchmarking it

1416596
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationitem
the popnavigationitemanimated is used for a uinavigationitem only not for a uinavigationcontroller object

1416607
post	get
what i need is a query to get the top n post in descending order by vote score where vote score is defined as the number of up votes the post has - the number of down votes the post has

1416610
postgresql	mysql
note that this is ansi sql so will work across sqlite mysql postgresql oracle sql server db2 etc. etc

1416610
post	get
to get your top n post you would simply append to the above query

1416610
postgresql	mysql
limit is used by postgresql and sqlite a bit differently in mysql and not in oracle or sql server as an fyi

1416610
post	get
so to get the post info associated with this

1416619
hex	binary
the function nsrl_hex2bin takes a binary buffer the size of that buffer and the hex string you want to convert

1416634
folder	directory
it might be better to saving to the local files folder in the profile and popping up an explorer window for that directory

1416636
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
also you are using a for..in loops to iterate over orders if orders is an arrays you should use a normal for-loop

1416636
for-loop	arrays
another reason to avoid it is because the order of iteration used by this statement is arbitrary and iterating over an arrays may not visit elements in numeric order and also it seems to be much more slower than a simple for-loop

1416643
subtract	add
your code is doing exactly what you asked it to do because you didn t ask it to add or subtract one day you asked it to add or subtract 24 hours

1416674
put	get
you can put before your argument this way you ll always get a tuple

1416677
builtin	isinstance
typically strings plain and unicode are the only iterables that you want to nevertheless consider as single elements -- the basestring builtin exists specifically to let you test for either kind of strings with isinstance so it s very un-grotty for that special case

1416700
hex	binary
you can open the file in a hex editor which is a text editor that is more sensitive to binary data

1416714
multiplying	add
take that number multiplying by 60 and add 57 to get the minutes

1416714
multiplying	add
take that multiplying by 60 and add 19

sudo	passwd
currently it detects a sudo command and then i try and get it to bring up an authorization window for the user s passwd exactly like you would see in installer

1416742
hex	binary
hex editors are more of a tool for geeks as they also give you the computer data in hex a more readable format compared to binary

1416753
hex	binary
if you view a file using a hex editor you can see both the binary representation of the file and ascii text interpretation of the binary side-by-side

1416767
tiff	png
it takes a data that contains bytes of a recognized image format like jpg png or tiff parses thoses and decompresses the images appropriately

1416798
queue	fifo
for this you re best off a file based fifo queue

1416821
google-chrome	firefox
sharepoint works on other browsers but it s a bit more frustrating to new users of it when it s on firefox or google-chrome

1416827
lisp	smalltalk
slightly more seriously though lisp and smalltalk are still in tiny niche spaces after 60 and 40 years it turns out that the child of the two bore fruit

1416827
lisp	smalltalk
various lisp and smalltalk hackers are starting to show up speaking about their child ruby at ruby and rails cons

1416827
lisp	smalltalk
as it happens ruby timeframe 15 years has quite a bit of the lisp and smalltalk magic

1416833
boost	stl
once you get your head around programming with boost and stl it can really feel like a higher-level language

1416835

1416933
post	get
i m not sure why this is the case but if i can get some more info on this i ll update this post

1416966
sorting	grouping
you could grouping the strings based on guesses about the alphabet and language and then use locale-specific sorting for each grouping

1416984
instances	transient
note that the benchmark shows singleton resolution and transient resolution a singleton is there you register an instances of a class using unity

1416990
width	height
when i traced out main screen s bounds and any subview s bounds the width and height is still 320x480 rather than 480x320

1417011
hash	salt
i m considering a strategy of distributing users amongst mysql masters based on a hash of their username plus an unknown-to-user salt just as added insurance against any funny games

1417013
post	put	post	get	put	get
you need to specify the method in your link_to_remote call - either get put post or delete

1417013
post	put
put is for updates post is for creates delete is for well deleting

1417025
g++	gcc
configured gcc for mips.. g++ core

1417028
inherited	properties
i have a custom control which inherited from system.web.ui.control and some of its properties can be declaratively set using databinding expressions

1417112
hide	show
in those cases you either have to have all fields thereby confusing the user or some javascript to hide show the relevant fields again making the user experience a bit weird fields disappearing appearing as they enter the credit card number

1417136
qunit	jsunit
qunit and jsunit come to mind

1417170
post	get
this is covered with a few extra wrinkles in post asp.net mvc how do i get virtual url for the current controller view

firefox	safari
is it just firefox ie and safari

1417205
disk	ram
buy additional ram and setup a ram disk and do your compilation there beware that if you restart your machine you ll loose ram disk content - this can be mitigate stable os version control sistem ... speeding up build times dramatically or speeding up the build â ditch the ssd and go for the ram drive

1417246
width	height
a binding with the grid or window with property height or width didn t work either

1417257
hash	salt
alternatively you could add a hidden field containing the record id and cryptrographically sign that field to make sure it can t be changed or take the record id hash it using the user id as a salt and check that assuming you re using the membership providers you should use the provider unique id not the login name

1417331
int	chars	int	boolean
the promotions are outlined in 6.3.1.1 arithmetic operands boolean chars and int which says among other things

1417331
integer	unsigned
the promotions are applied only to objects or expressions with an integer type with a rank less than int and unsigned int or bitfields

1417331
unsigned	short
even though the variables are unsigned short they are promoted to int since on your platform int can represent all the values of unsigned short

1417331
unsigned	short
as litb indicated in a comment if the platform had int implemented as a 16-bit type which is permitted - ms-dos for example the promotion of unsigned short would be to unsigned int instead of int since an int wouldn t be able to represent all values of unsigned short unsigned short must be at least 16-bits

1417359
sorting	filtering
filtering and group-by but not sorting on mva attributes is supported

1417362

1417451
django	web.py
deepen your python skills by using it for everything say django or web.py python

1417451
lisp	smalltalk
it s worth looking at the origins of languages php was originally announced as an extension of ssi ruby tries to take the best of perl smalltalk and lisp but has elements of a c java-like syntax perl is intimately connected to unix and everywhere although usually invisible to end users despite some very good perl web frameworks

1417530
udp	tcp
instead of using heavy-weight tcp we can utilize the connection-oriented reliable feature of tcp on the top of udp by any of the following way

1417530
udp	tcp
it aims to provide a solution where udp is too primitive because guaranteed-order packet delivery is desirable but tcp adds too much complexity overhead

1417581
public	protected
if you have an abstract class with virtual properties they can either be protected or public and this is what the outside world will see

1417581
inherited	properties
when you extend inherited this class you can override these properties but not mark them as private

1417594
firefox	safari
in safari ie all 3 work fine however in firefox 3.5 only the news ticker seems to work

1417633
filesystems	btrfs
i suspect that the modern linux filesystems ext4 btrfs do this too

1417674
octal	decimal
vb.net supports decimal without prefix octal with prefix and hexadecimal with prefix integer literals directly

1417681
hlsl	glsl
now obviously there are the shader languages such as hlsl cg and glsl that have native support for this kind of stuff however i m looking for something that s able to at least compile to sse without autovectorization but with built-in support for vector operations

1417696
dictionary	map
to map a list as a dictionary

1417755
cpython	ironpython
as a general purpose python ide i use netbeans python ea which treats cpython jython and ironpython pretty much as equals so i can just set it to the platform i want to use today and everything else remains the same

1417757
put	get
if you put that sql_calc_found_rows and then if you put a limit you will get the full number of rows is no affected by the limit

1417783
postgresql	mysql
we are using container isolation to run different instances multiples version of the databases postgresql and mysql but the naming scheme problem is still the same

1417790
pop-up	dialog
the write can only be initiated by user interaction a button click and it will always pop-up the host os s file save dialog box prompting the user to choose a location or cancel

1417797
put	get
in terms of the external urls i think it helps to distinguish between the urls that make up the api of the system get users 1 put users 1 etc and the urls that are just there as a convenience to humans using a web browser users new users 5 edit etc

1417797
put	get
these urls are typically just the address of the resource you want to interact with and then you use the http method and the parameters to indicate what it is you want to do get show me this resource put change this resource etc

1417797
post	get
to look at your examples above then get users create might make sense and is pretty similar to get users new which is the default but post users create would roughly translate to make a new one of users create which doesn t quite make sense

1417800
ggplot2	lattice
it s not a problem for ggplot2 or lattice graphics - you always have to explicitly print them when they are called in non-interactive settings like from within a script

1417841
shadowbox	lightbox
if i remove the doc type the sliding captions function correctly but shadowbox and other lightbox type popups do not because they require the doc type to be set to work correctly.

1417841
google-chrome	firefox
works fine in firefox and google-chrome regardless

1417854
post	get
i would interpret method as get or post or whatever but it makes no sense to me in the context of your other findings - the content of the post cd or not surely can t affect that

1417862
photoshop	fireworks
i fixed it by opening every jpg image and saving them again in a good image editor like photoshop or fireworks

1417878
pull	push
those distributed cache products use various push and pull models with pub-sub messaging to achieve consistency across the instances

1417893
nsstring	nsdata
if the description property of the nsdata object can return a string is there any way i can produce an nsstring from the nsdata object without getting null

1417944
implements	extends
in other words if you extends or implements something with generics remember to define the generics arguments for them

1417947
nsstring	nsdata
i apologize if my previous answer misled you i was merely printing the description to demonstrate that the nsdata can be encrypted and decrypted. instead use nsstring s -datausingencoding and -initwithdata encoding methods to convert between nsdata and nsstring

1417947
nsstring	nsdata
base64-encode the nsdata then create and return and nsstring of the encoded output

1417959
post	get
the keyword you are looking for here is cross-site request forgery or xsrf where an authenticated user can be made by an attacker via scripting or other methods to make a get or post request to your site

1417959
client-side	server-side
these attacks are not quite as immediately damaging as server-side sql command or client-side html javascript injections but they are more common than both few web programmers both to include the proper countermeasures unfortunately

1417968
vim	emacs
so there is this question for vim users that keeps popping up in my feed reader but i m an emacs person

maven	pom.xml
this container is populated with the maven dependencies by a maven builder added to the .project when the maven nature is enabled which processes the pom.xml and downloads any artifacts and sources if needed

1418085
maven	m2e
by default m2e uses an embedded version of maven to do its processing

1418085
maven	pom.xml
there is a comparison of the eclipse maven integrations alongside the maven-eclipse-plugin a goal that generates the eclipse metadata files from the pom.xml contents

1418092
udp	tcp
facebook for example changed some kernel level thingys in linux changed how memcached works for example they wrote a memcached proxy and used udp instead of tcp

1418102
temp	tmp
if you re not using a full-blown programming language you should place temp files in the folder whose name is stored in the environment variable temp or tmp

1418114
post	get
also what if a resource can be updated at any time would the method to return it be a get or a post

1418117
post	put
i have some fairly simple code that uploads a photo or video to an endpoint using http put or post

1418125
getter	setter
is there a way either via the ui or in config files to change the names of the c++ getter setter generated by eclipse cdt from the java-style getsomething to the more c++ like something

1418126
rss	feed
i am trying to subscribe to an rss feed for a fighter s history via mixedmartialarts.com but this particular website updates the pubdate for each of the fights causing duplicates every time the pubdate is updated

1418182
next	except
you do seem to have identified the key patterns except that i m not sure how the objects in the pool differ among them if they do -- how does each object know to perform possibly different processing before handing the possibly-modified data on to the next object in the chain or breaking the chain

1418216
children	parent
every nodes children has a left right value that is between the parent nodes left and right which makes it very easy to find for example all children parent of a node

1418229
quicksort	mergesort
be aware of the real-world impact of the so-called hidden constants too - for instance the classic quicksort algorithm is o n 2 in the worst case and o n log n on average whereas mergesort is o n log n in the worst case but quicksort will outperform mergesort in practice

1418302
int	chars
on most platforms int and chars are examples of types that are primitive but can be boxed

1418329
int	boolean
autoboxing allows java to automatically convert things like boolean and int to their object versions boolean and int automatically in most cases

1418334
subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	addition	multiplication
say for example that the variables are the letters x y z t and the operators are a for addition and s for subtraction -- strings of adjacent letters implicitly mean high-priority multiplication as in common mathematical convention

1418364
strcpy	malloc
did you realize that the malloc + strcpy sequence does not copy base_dir into path

1418418
post	get
get after post

1418420
post	get
see the post redirect get pattern

1418448
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
the sequence in which the various methods like viewwillappear viewdidappear of uiviewcontroller and the is called is different between the first time the map is loaded with one particular location and the subsequent times the map is displayed with the same location

1418486
typedef	struct
a small function i wrote to highlight functions globals macro s struct and typedef

1418495
mockups	balsamiq
balsamiq mockups is very nice and has a free web based version it nags you every once in a while asking if you d like to purchase

1418500
superclass	subclassing
essentially types within generics have to match exactly to be compatible they can t be subclassing or superclass

camping	ruby-on-rails	merb	camping	merb	ruby-on-rails	ramaze	camping	ramaze	merb
apart from ruby-on-rails i ve heard about merb camping sinatra and ramaze

1418538
merb	ruby-on-rails
edit as pointed out in a comment merb and ruby-on-rails are merging and according to merb creator ezra zygmuntowicz see this blog post merb is ruby-on-rails and ruby-on-rails is merb so i guess merb isn t that light

1418625
svnadmin	svnlook
both svnadmin and svnlook are considered server-side utilitiesâ they are used on the machine where the repository resides to examine or modify aspects of the repository and are in fact unable to perform tasks across a network

1418642
for-loop	arrays
edit i just noticed that you don t even have to use an arrays since you convert it to a space separated string in the for-loop anyway

1418645
ubuntu	opensuse
i usually am on either opensuse 11 or ubuntu 9.04

1418678
post	put
according to this post no one ever put it online.

1418685
move	drag	touchesbegan	touchesmoved
ideally when the drag exit event is fired the button would stop receiving touch move events the customview would get a touchesbegan event even if i need to fake one myself somehow and all future touch events touchesmoved etc would be sent to the customview

1418741
post	put	post	get	put	get
yes get and delete map pretty cleanly but put can do create and update but complete replacement only and post is a wildcard verb

1418741
post	put	post	get	put	get
post is really to handle everything that does not fit into get put and

1418781
super	implements
if implements properly an object will release any objects it owns before calling the super this them to get deallocated if their retain count is also zero

1418791
udp	tcp
mmorpg s that i m familiar with probably don t use web services for communication since they are stateless but rather a custom server-side program a service that listens for tcp and or udp messages

1418791
udp	tcp
they probably use a custom tcp and or udp based protocol look into socket communication

1418867
int	chars
the second parameter to memset is typed as an int but is really an unsigned chars

1418869
int	chars
the second argument to memset is a chars not a int or u32

1418869
int	chars
c automatically truncates the 0xbaadf00d int into a 0x0d chars and sets each chars in memory as requested

1418890
margin	height
i d try putting a negative margin or other positioning method equal to half the page height on the target anchor tag

1418891
tcplistener	tcpclient
is it necessary to close the connection of a tcplistener or tcpclient after every message received or is it possible to close it at a later time while it continues to receive data

1418901
udp	tcp
online games are going to have their own protocols built on top of tcp ip or udp

1418934
gcov	lcov
for instance gcov or lcov both count the number of times a line is executed so certainly you could modify the source to print out that line and sleep instead of just incrementing a counter

1418965
debian	centos	debian	linux	centos	linux	ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	linux
the resulting executable must be installed in a number of linux distributions slackware arch ubuntu debian centos and a few more and i am completely clueless on how to achieve it

1418965
debian-based	centos
all i know centos and debian-based oses has package managers like apt or yum but i am not sure those apply to my case

1418970
implements	sealed
i m a bit confused on the best way to implements idisposable on a sealed classâ specifically a sealed class that does not inherit from a base class

1418970
implements	sealed
i m assuming that because memblock is completely sealed and never derives from another class that implements a virtual protected dispose bool disposing is not necessary

1419042
uitableview	nsindexpath
- void tableview uitableview tableview didselectrowatindexpath nsindexpath indexpath

1419130
implements	extends
for composition the stack class should have a list not implements or extends a list-based class

1419141
banking	billing
i don t want declined authorizations showing up on their billing statement as seen in an online banking system as pending

1419175
post	get
i just saw this code while studying the wordpress source code php you can see they mergre turn all get and post values into 1 request array

1419180
post	get
this is so if you have a get variable and a post variable with the same name it will choose the post variable over the get one

1419199
put	get
on a sunday afternoon to put something together in a few hours you would need to know a framework and buy some plugins and get everything up and moving without much work

1419201
free	malloc
valgrind uses its own malloc and free so it can alert you to incorrect news and deletes

1419219
nunit	mstest
is there really any difference between nunit mstest etc

1419240
cout	cin
in this code cout in usually stdout and is receiving the characters enter first name firstname which is presumably a variable is receiving the data from cin which is probably stdin

1419244
put	get
get and put would work just as well if they didn t conflict with alas-too-common other uses

1419244
cout	cin
but that doesn t seem to have much to do with right-to-left vs left-to-right just with your q s title about reading aloud -- cin absorb x or essteedee cout emit blach emit essteedee endl kinds of reading code aloud on the phone

1419254
accessor	properties
when using an object properties instead of variable it is interesting to know that the get accessor of the intermediate value is not called

1419254
accessor	properties
only the set accessor is invoked for all properties accessed in the assignation sequence

1419289
int	chars
from the documentation one can assume that 0 can be either an int or a 1 chars string to signify empty

1419314
subtract	add
why add length and subtract 1

1419320
nunit	mstest
both nunit and mstest as well as most of the other xunit frameworks can also be used for full integration tests ones that use the actual dependencies such as calling web services

1419320
nunit	mstest
mstest see msbuild nant nunit mstest and frustration

1419320
nunit	mstest
for a strict comparison somewhat biased in the other direction see comparing the mstest and nunit frameworks

1419320
nunit	mstest
from a personal standpoint pure opinion the key features i need have been available in nunit so i ve seen no reason to evaluate mstest

1419379
distutils	buildout
i m working on a buildout script that needs to install a distutils package on remote server

1419438
hide	show
i will show and hide it using jquery with

1419453
stdout	stderr
for example send data to stdout and errors or informational messages to stderr

1419453
stdout	stderr
you can also redirect data from stdout and messages from stderr independently

1419459
width	height
have you tried setting the height and width of the picture to 100

1419528
folder	directory
edit another reason for this behaviour in git is that it can t track things that are above the root repo directory above the folder containing .git folder which would definitely be required if you want your super-projects and sub-projects refer to the same repositories

1419563
accessor	properties
the properties directive declares the accessor methods not the underlying members

1419570
awt	swing
that is an awt component and you should not be using awt components in a swing application

1419570
awt	swing
awt components are painted on top of swing components which could be causing the problem

1419570
awt	swing
i ve never mixed awt swing components so i don t know what wierd painting artifacts you will encounter

1419610
for-loop	arrays
how to identify s length where is an arrays so that i can use that in the for-loop now i have used as 15 by default.

1419621
width	height
need to check this one they probably affect the width and height of the element differently

1419624
pthreads	fork
apache2 achieves this using a combination of fork and pthreads

1419640
jobs	cron
if you have a light workload you can use the approach used by django-mailer which is to define a jobs model save new jobs into the database then have cron run a stand-alone script every so often to process the jobs stored in the database deleting them when done

1419650
debian	linux
i just installed it with apt-get on debian linux with

1419662
ienumerable	ilist
most of the time i end up going with ilist over ienumerable because ienumerable doesn t have the count method and you can t access the collection through an index although if you are using linq you can get around this with extension methods

1419710
children	parent
of course there is one view that is the parent of all others and the view controller keeps track of that one and can then follow the tree down to handle the children for the purposes of handling touch or updating etc.

1419723
post	get
look at this post about using xmlrunner.py to get python working with hudson

1419813
post	get
as other post mention you couldn t rely on the browser to do this automatically but since you re writing the web pages you can get the browser to do the compression you re after with a little work

1419839
client-side	server-side
considering php is executed on the server-side you cannot have this kind of pop-up in php you ll have to go with some javascript code that s executed on the client-side ie in the user s browser

put	get
i decided to put this issue aside and continue development which included adding things after level five so the user can loop through levels and return to the main menu and so on and so forth...and i m not sure why but the userdefaults are saving for level five now so i don t know if it s because before level five was the very last thing the application did and even though it didn t terminate itself and did other things maybe it wasn t actually writing the defaults to disk...i m still not sure what was wrong but it s working now and i can t get it to fail to see if i can get an error with the synchronize.

mouseup	mousedown
you could try to set up document wide event handlers for mousedown and mouseup

1420467
mouseup	mousedown
on mousedown you store the element under the pointer and on mouseup you check if there is a selection

according to mcobertura-65 the maven cobertura plugin still doesn t know how to aggregate reports of sub-modules into a consolidated one

1420969
maven	cobertura
some work has been done to implement a merge target on the maven cobertura plugin see mcobertura-33 but this code hasn t been included in the plugin yet

1420981
stdout	stderr
the syntax will redirect 2 stderr to 1 stdout

1420987
udp	tcp
however i think most people that take the time to understand it and who know the shortcomings of tcp appreciate it -- it is a well designed protocol that builds on our 30 years of knowledge of tcp and udp

1420987
sctp	tcp
streams provide usually i think you can turn it off an order guarantee within them much like a tcp connection but there can be multiple streams per sctp connection

1420987
udp	tcp	sctp	tcp	sctp	udp
my personal summary of sctp is that it doesn t do anything you couldn t do another way in tcp or udp with substantial application support

1420987
sctp	tcp
diameter clients must support either tcp or sctp while agents and

i would put blatantly wrong values so that you get a clearly wrong value when this occurs

1421039
stdout	stderr
is to redirect stderr toâ stdout as strace writes to stderr by default

1421056
affinity	processors
to do so i call getprocessaffinitymask to retrieve the system affinity mask and then switch the process to each processors in turn

1421056
affinity	processors
it returns exactly the affinity mask i expect but apic ids can still be the same for different processors

my pom.xml is with jar and i use the maven-assembly-plugin with jar-with-dependencies descriptor

1421289
equals	gethashcode	equals	icomparable	icomparable	gethashcode
types that implement icomparable must override equals.types that override equals must also override gethashcode

1421294
stdout	stderr
keep in mind that you have to read everything the app send to stdout and stderr else it might get stuck writing there

1421320
equals	icomparable
icomparable is an interface that defines that two instances of the implementing class can be seen as greater than less than or equals to one another

1421320
equals	icomparable
in the above example i have implemented icomparable but not overridden equals

1421320
equals	compareto
if you call compareto with two separate instances of the class that have the same value it will say there are equals

1421320
equals	gethashcode
two equals items should return the same hash code which are used for quickly finding items used as keys in hash tables so if you override equals then you should also override gethashcode

1421320
equals	icomparable
so if you are overriding equals then you should also define all of the above to ensure consistency if you are implementing icomparable then the same applies

1421328
equals	gethashcode
there are two ways that objects in your code could be compared equals and gethashcode

1421328
equals	gethashcode
for your object to be compared properly in all situations when you override the equals method used for some comparisons you must also override gethashcode used in the rest

1421332
equals	icomparable
icomparable is used for comparing two objects - if these are considered equals then compare will return 0

1421332
equals	gethashcode
when a class overrides equals it should also override gethashcode since two equals objects should hash to the same value and this hash should be based on the fields properties used in the implementation of equality

1421364
mouseup	mousedown
an ugly hack will be to use the mousedown or mouseup events

1421366
sorting	grouping
i work with mybindingsource at my own i do sorting grouping ..whatever in a separate thread

1421403
onclick	onchange
in every onchange onclick etc event .

1421421
int	boolean
date boolean string text decimal int are distinct datatypes here

1421462
unix	aix
i am moving an application from unix aix to windows

1421491
free	malloc
from what i know correct me please a memory allocated with malloc will never be released back to the system ever until the process ends i.e the allocator will simply keep it in the free list if i free it

1421510
mouse	keyboard
you can override wndproc update program.lastactiontime on each relevant keyboard mouse event message

1421532
free	malloc
this applies only to your current system based on the documentation you have provided for free and mmap and malloc but as the previous poster has stated behavior of these is implmentation dependent

1421559
bufferedreader	bufferedwriter
i parsed a text cal code with bufferedreader and bufferedwriter in java unfortunately lines which i red and wrote with outstream.write line

1421587
bufferedreader	bufferedwriter
well bufferedwriter and bufferedreader are encoding agnostic - they never deal with the actual encodings as they re just buffering existing readers and writers

1421587
outputstream	inputstream	bufferedreader	bufferedwriter
to work round this you should usually use an inputstream inputstreamreader or outputstream outputstreamwriter pair possibly wrapped in a bufferedreader bufferedwriter and specify the encoding explicitly

1421594
free	malloc
if you were to free the remaining allocation glibc s malloc implementation should be able to return most of the pages allocated back to the system

1421613
tooltip	scrollbar
as we know ie selectdrop down list has limitations on tooltip on individual option items and also horizontal scrollbar

1421635
instances	transient
if you do not specify a value for the lifetime the type is registered for a transient lifetime which means that a new instances will be created on each call to resolve.

1421650
daemons	systemd
to manually run the script the same way the systemd does use service daemons start if you have that command or else try

1421662
hash	md5
yes if you hash the ip address with md5 or sha1 you ll get the same hash for a given ip but without the ability to easily reverse it

1421662
hash	md5
if this is a concern instead of a 128 bit hash like md5 use a 32 bit hash so that the hash space is the same size as the ip address space

1421662
hash	md5
to do this you could simply truncate an md5 hash

1421697
put	get
i admit i m not a c++ expert i m certainly not as seasoned in it as many of you seem to be but if i can cut and paste 99 of the code from c# to c++ and get it to work in 5 mins then i m a little put out that it takes twice as long to execute

1421718
int	boolean
the one downside of this approach is because matlab doesn t have a way to marshal or serialize arbitrary matlab objects into java you re limited to floating point numbers int need to cast them in matlab using int8 etc. boolean strings arrays and java objects

1421770
button	checkbox
the click method is intended to be used with input elements of type button checkbox radio reset or submit

1421793
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
true i do have a uitabbarcontroller waiting in the wings and it has tabs with uinavigationcontroller and other vcs in it

1421820
many-to-many	one-to-many
how do i get a one-to-many output in the admin interface with the class service as basis a reverse many-to-many

1421849
int	double
the big difference between converting int to long and converting float to double is that the int types have two components sign and value while floating point numbers have three components sign mantissa and exponent

1421901
gmail	hotmail
imap settings for yahoo hotmail and gmail

1421950
free	malloc
for your specific implementation there is no reason to free since the malloc won t release to system memory and so it will only release memory back to your own allocator

1421964
hash	md5
we use an md5 hash function to create the unique 32 character string for indexing purposes

1421968
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox

a few people 20 enter the site every day and a few rss readers are subscribed to some feed we put out

1422001
mouse	keyboard
am i just rubbish at using my mouse and keyboard or have i completely misunderstood this property

1422005
rss	feed
if they coincide you could set your rss feed to be static for that time

1422027
httpconnection	downloading
you can downloading image using httpconnection and inputstream create encodedimage from stream and then display it

1422031
post	get
now when i send the data - either from the class that is supposed to send the get request or simply from the browser s address bar the query that i see in debug netbeans has gibberish characters and the parameters themselves post request.getparameter are

1422040
multiplying	add
on an x86 environment where floating-point evaluation is actually done in the specified type using sse registers conversions between float and double are about as expensive as a floating-point add or multiplying unlikely to be a performance consideration unless you re doing a lot of them

1422124
free	malloc
there s no immediate problem with returning memory allocated with malloc or new but you do have the problem of ownership what function should free delete it when and what do you do about possible copies

1422132
queue	fifo
if you want polymorphism you need pointers in c++ so would use a deque of pointers to the abstract type assuming it s a fifo queue rather than a lifo

1422164
portrait	landscape
i am having tabbarcontroller.it is having 3 viewcontrollers.i want to support landscape mode in only one of these viewcontrolers.and other 2 view controllers in portrait mode.how to achive this

1422172
stdout	stderr
you need to capture stdout stderr

1422198
operands	scalar
vectorized programs can run multiple operations from a single instruction whereas scalar can only operate on pairs of operands at once

1422265
put	get
i guess the question is does the custom validator get associated with the drop down list or do you put a custom validator on all of the fields a b c d e f etc...or is there the concept of a form-level custom validator that i can have called

1422268
interbase	firebird
i have a firebird database running on server version 2.1.3 and am connecting to it with delphi 2007 using the dbexpress objects using the interbase driver

1422299
macvim	textmate
i would recommend textmate as above and also macvim if possible

1422427
ant	maven
i was wondering if anybody has seen a technique for adding maven dependencies to ant

1422427
ant	maven
it seems to me that if somebody extended ant to be able to reference maven dependencies perhaps only for open source libraries ant could piggyback at least one great feature of maven without having to re-invent the wheel

1422460
cvs	svn
in cvs there is a cvsinfo file that takes care of this i am wondering if svn has such a thing

1422476
ant	maven
the maven has a set of maven ant tasks that can downloaded and placed in your ant lib directory

1422476
ant	pom.xml
after that you can declare a classpath in ant that is defined by the dependencies in your pom.xml

1422482
ant	maven
there are also maven tasks for ant though they are not as fully featured

1422485
cassini	iis
note the blank page is coming from cassini if you move the app to an actual iis server you will see the 401

1422501
stdout	stderr
the script runs fine when stdout stderr are not redirected

1422501
stdout	stderr
when i add both stderr and stdout redirection i getg the following error

1422599
glasspane	mouselistener
add a mouselistener that consumes mouse events to the transparent glasspane this will get you modality feature #2 background seems non-responsive

1422629
firefox	safari
this works perfectly in firefox and safari but internet explorer is generating an error

1422647
switching	screens
this approach can get very tricky and feel hacked together if you don t debug it properly because you need to be aware of all the enabling disabling going on otherwise you may find that you re unable to submit the page when everything appears valid on screens but in actuality something was left enabled when you should ve disabled all validators on each call before the switching then enabled just the ones you need

1422650
rbac	acl
it is a common antipattern in the php world that frameworks like ruby or django are cloned only as a subset of what these modern frameworks deliver - as a typical syndrome yuo see a lack of good acl or rbac integration into these frameworks - what essentially is a joke

1422657
put	get
i could put the dance program in a network database but i d have to shove instructions in fairly quickly and there d be a lot of readers using a rather thick protocol dbi sqlclient etc.. to get a small bit of text

1422711
portrait	landscape
how it works the dimensions of your poster image determine whether your video opens landscape or in portrait mode

1422711
portrait	landscape
so poster images that are wider than high will open landscape poster images that are higher than wide will open a movie in portrait mode

1422711
width	height
object width 300 height 200 ..

1422711

hash	md5
in my user database table i take the md5 hash of the email address of a user as the id

1422725
hash	md5
convert_uuencode and convert_uudecode for the md5 hash

1422725
hash	md5
replace every character of the md5 hash by its ord value

1422730
vb.net	vb6
the data ideally can be read by normal windows file-access methods ie a std file filesystemobject objects stream and text file all basic pc vb6 vb.net file handling methods even excel text import

1422743
post	get
changing it to _request brings in the values for post get and cookie

1422758
pull	push
mercurial works in changesets not files so you can t use traditional pull push to do this

1422767
post	get
lots of people like to post really impressive numbers that don t take into consideration the transfer time needed to get the input data from the cpu to the gpu and the output data back both going over a pcie bottleneck

1422796
bmp	png
if you are converting between lossless formats ie bmp png etc any image library including the fcl image bitmap classes will work perfectly fine

1422894
inherited	properties
is there a way to not be forced to include members with the mustoverride properties when you inherited

qtkit	quicktime
32-bit quicktime has mediasetsoundbalance but i don t see an equivalent property for qtkit at the media or track level could be wrong though

is the http connection over ssl https

1423162
jsf	seam
if memory serves the facescontext is set up and torn down in the facesservlet in core jsf you may know better than me if seam requires other servlets to do some lifecycle lifting

i think what would be feasible would be a container format with a encoder decoder or something like that

1423238
put	get
you ve spoke your piece now shut up and do the work they tell you to do do it well do it fast and if you want put as much mvc into it your part as you want as long as you don t tell anyone else how to write their code if you re so good you get it done extra fast then ask them for more work to do and repeat above steps

if you know the width and height of an image set it

1423333
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome this is working exactly as expected

1423343
actionscript	haxe
alternatively you could use flashplayer 9+ in theory but you d have to implement the whole protocol in actionscript 3 or haxe so that s not so much of an option i guess .

1423443
fast-forward	merge
this setup allows to use simply git pull when on branch development while on desktop and git would automatically fetch all changes fro repository at laptop into laptop master and laptop development remote-tracking branches and then try to merge laptop development into development current branch -- which would usually result in fast-forward simply moving development branch

1423532
profiling	benchmarking
again benchmarking and profiling are your friend

1423551
hash	md5
but if what you want to do is convert an md5 hash into a string

1423561
hide	show
i m trying to show up a container if a input field gets the focus and - that s the actual problem - hide the container if focus is lost

1423566
int	double
except when i try to convert a double type matrix to int type matrix or vice versa

1423567
put	get
similar to how you would do it on the web you can just put the tab control and floating control inside a grid and set the margins of the floating control to get it in the right spot

1423595
sqldatasource	objectdatasource
objectdatasource also allows for more efficient paging than a simple sqldatasource i m assuming that s what you re using

1423599
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
of course it all works fine in firefox safari and opera

1423682
pull	push
edit answering the question the image when implemented as a barbuttonitem will flow off the screen when you push pull the next view controller as expected

1423726
listview	gridview
i am really surprised at the scarce documentation sample code for the wpf gridview listview view gridview

1423729
inherited	properties
currently i have a custom control that inherited from textbox the control does not have the style properties defined but i can set the properties in the page markup and the style will be applied correctly

1423808
typedef	struct
to a first approximation c++ automatically creates a typedef for you when you use the plain struct x .

1423852
button	checkbox
checked limits it to checkbox radio button that are selected within the previous group

google-chrome	firefox
as is right now it works in firefox and google-chrome but fails in ie8 works in ie7 -- in ie8 i get the error alert edit the error was because of a debugger

1423886
content-disposition	content-type
if i comment out the content-type content-disposition etc and just write the data to the browser then the entire file will download and display in the browser

1423893
initializer	class-method
simply because the initializer method is an instance method and class_eval is defined for objects of type class which means they can be executed only in class-method or inside the class body

1423910
post	get
will this question get seen or should i have posted a new question and referenced this post

1423939
client-side	server-side
if i controlled the server-side as well as the client-side code i could also consider compiling such script fragments on the server instead of on the client and then sending it as precompiled code to the client side to be executed

1423939
disk	ram
is there a way to send such code a dotnet assembly presumably over the network to the client have client-side code receive it from the network into client-side ram and invoke it on the client side without storing it as a file on a client-side disk drive

1423947
partialfunction	implicit
if you are coming from groovy background where they have an implicit iterator or even from scala where you can do without this |i| using partialfunction then you might find it a logical question however at the current moment the best you can do in ruby 1.9 or even inside rails is to use the symbol#to_block method like jrl mentioned

1423972
margin	height
a line of text has some space above it based on line height that has nothing to do with margin or padding

1423982

rational-numbers	bigint
if you really need to see all 150+ digits you should use the bigint for integers bigrat for rational-numbers and the bignum for floating point numbers modules

1424426
ant	maven
they choose where they want them how they want to access them and then have their build tool which unless they are just playing around should not be an ide like eclipse but rather a dedicated build tool like maven or ant where to place it

implements	extends
you can implements a basecontroller that has a user property and have your controllers extends from it

1424500
inherited	properties
the built-in panel control doesn t have an exposed doublebuffered properties so the way to do it is to add a usercontrol name dbpanel to your project and change the code so that it inherited from panel instead of usercontrol you can change this manually in the cs file after you add it

rtp	rtsp	rtp	rtmp	rtsp	rtmp
in research i ve found that there are a few protocols rtsp http streaming rtmp and rtp

1424946
rtp	rtsp
rtsp rtp is what microsoft switched to using deprecating their mms protocol

1424949

strtol	strtod
the standard defines the number formats accepted by the scanf function family d i u o x in terms of the definitions for strtol strtoul and strtod

1425730
strtol	strtod
the standard also says that fscanf will only put back a maximum of one character into the input stream and that therefore some sequences accepted by strtol strtoul and strtod are unacceptable to fscanf iso iec 9899 1999 footnote 251

maybe this brings you some information gem-idea automatic spam protection with captcha in before_filter when http-method is post put or delete

1426348
temp	tmp
you can use tmp as a valid path that actually points to the users temp folder in windows

1426376
mouseleave	mouseenter
perhaps the mouseleave or mouseenter events are enough in your case

1426412
serializable	deserialization
after deserialization i am able to access only those fields which were available in object before serializable

1426570
int	chars
i would convert the int id to a base 38 int and replace the digits by chars of a given list

1426579
portrait	landscape
ya i am having view for each viewcontroller.but i want to support landscape in only one view and rest all in portrait mode.even i am returning yes in bool shouldautorotatetointerfaceorientation uiinterfaceorientation interfaceorientation

1426591
int	chars
there is performance degradation from this specifically because you re using chars rather than int for lookups but unless you have a large 1 million+ rows or data it probably won t be an issue in practice

1426600
width	height
apparently you just have to specify the width and height after initialization

1426638
implements	extends
extends any class or implements any

1426664
post	get
but how to handle changing value in current form which is not lead to form post or get simply handling onchange functionality

nwire for java can give you the complete list of classes which extends a given class or implements a specific interface

1426915
children	parent
question is how do a return a list of b with all the entities in children of all parent without resorting to the type of code below i was thinking u must be able to acheive the same within a single linq query

1426918
post	get
hopefully it ll get answered ot i ll post it up here

1426932
chown	chmod
both of these can be accomplished with a combination of chown and chmod

1427031
post	get
the query string is used for http get requests and form variables for http post requests

1427031
post	get
so when i say that the two are not interchangable i mean that you cannot change the page from using a get to a post without breaking functionality

1427031
post	get
so imho the implementation of the page can quite clearly reflect the fact that you intend it to be called by a get or a post request

1427051
svg	vml
i wanted something javascript which could be included in my web page and which would silently convert all my svg to vml in a fashion similar to what excanvas does for canvas

1427079
accessor	properties	inherited	properties
i had to move away from generic classes anyway for other reasons so through inherited i just create a properties for my object to be serialized and serialize deserialize it in the set get accessor and store the serialized string in a string properties in the base class which is inherited

1427147
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
when should we opt for sortedlist and sorteddictionary over dictionary

1427147
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
what is the difference between sortedlist and sorteddictionary in terms of application

1427158
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
sortedlist tkey tvalue uses less memory than sorteddictionary tkey

1427158
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
sortedlist tkey tvalue is faster than sorteddictionary tkey

1427167
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
sortedlist and sorteddictionary pretty much do the same thing but are implemented differently thus have different strengths and weaknesses explained here

1427191
mp3	wav
the best way to do this is to apply the 30-second truncation fade in and fade out to the wav audio data before converting it to an mp3

1427191
mp3	wav
either way applying gain and or attenuation to time-domain sample data as in a wav file is much easier than trying to apply these effects to frequency-domain data as in an mp3 file

1427199
oncreate	ondestroy
i need to catch onactivate oncreate and ondestroy events of child form in the main parent form code

1427213
versioning	upgrade
databases tend to survive longer than most applications since administrators are smart enough to not fix things that aren t broken so they often don t upgrade their systems with every new versioning

1427213
versioning	upgrade
still it s a real pain when you upgrade your database to a newer versioning yet the extensions aren t compatible with that one and thus won t work

1427264
pull	push
aside from the discussion on whether this should be a push or a pull what s the best way to get what is effectively a software update out

1427320
versioning	upgrade
the first is the actual live website the second is the last versioning in case we need to roll back and will be the target of the next upgrade

1427334
implements	extends
i d extends dateperiod and implements a toarray method

1427362
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
i read here that sorteddictionary does not allow indexed retrieval unlike sortedlist

1427377
hide	show
i have a javascript which is a little larger so i tried to show a .gif on the begin off the script and hide it after its finished

1427410
serializable	deserialization
or is the serializable deserialization more expensive then processing the code again

1427457
int	double
array of six int value and an array of four double values

1427486
serializable	deserialization
the point is that i cannot serializable the mailsender which is org.springframework.mail.mailsender btw and want it to be injected at deserialization time

1427509
put	get
if i put everything in one single i will have that output which i don t want to get

1427550
cldc	midp
most mobile phones use some combination of the mobile information device profile midp and the connected limited device configuration cldc

1427558
xlsx	.doc
the xlsx extension is not because the file is hosted in sharepoint but because it is an office 2007 template all office 2007 extensions have an extra x behind their extension so .doc becomes .docx

1427575
integer	unsigned
a dword_ptr is not a pointer but rather a pointer sized unsigned integer so rather than ref uint it should be an intptr

1427581
subtract	add
rectangular problems with only add subtract bitshift + table essentially doing rotation by angles of the form tan -1 2 -n

1427581
cos	sin
although if multiplies are cheap enough to allow using dot product then don t bother with cordic perhaps use a table of sin cos pairs for rotation matrices of angles pi

1427641
goto	break
i d actually dare to suggest consideration of goto to break out of loops in such cases

1427686
range	max	range	min	min	max
i think this interpretation of the standard is wrong a subsequence of expected form should always yield a valid integer value if out of range the min max values are returned and errno is set to erange

1427689
post	get
besides here i have posted my original problem to the developer s forum if i ever get an answer i ll post it here unless else post it here first

1427701
getter	setter
there is a setter and a getter for the effectivefromdatejulian which is a number representation of the date

1427701
getter	setter
it is a getter only though and relies on the setter for the numeric property to get its data from

1427707
postgresql	mysql
my question is this since rails looks for employees_projects projects_roles and employees_roles but not employees_projects_roles is there a way to alias those names to the real table name and still allow crud functionality in the database mysql or postgresql

1427718
post	get
if you use ajax to dynamically do the get post and all you are doing is trying to show a loading icon while this is happening its fairly simple to throw up an asynchronous activity indicator

1427718
hide	show
the above code sets a dom object with id loading to show and hide when any asynchronous request has been initiated and stopped

1427718
hide	show
this is also possible without jquery of course there s just a bunch of browser compatibility javascript and its not as easy as simply subscribing to the ajaxstart and ajaxstop events to show and hide your loading img

1427784
.htaccess	httpd.conf
if you re asking whether you can move the mod_rewrite configuration from .htaccess to httpd.conf then yes

1427865
jar	war
if the 3rd party jar is defined as a dependency in your war project it will automatically be bundled into the web-inf lib folder of the war when it is packaged by the war plugin

1427865
maven	pom.xml
also note that if the 3rd-party jar is a properly-defined maven project it s dependencies will be defined in its pom.xml

1427865
jar	war
once the jar is on the war s classpath you can reference any spring configuration files it declares by importing them into your war s application context

1427872
mvp	command-pattern
without using css-based ui design event bus command-pattern based gwt-rpc mvp presentation tier and google-gin gwt implementation of guice it s hard to overcome complexity in gwt just like in any other heavy gui framework

1427908
restrict	shared
i am developing a site on a shared host and have to restrict my data schema to a single provided database

1427921
nsstring	nsdata
you really need to change the nsstring object into either a utf8 representation to send or to archive it as an nsdata object you send with the full length - you can t just cast an nsstring as a c string either for sending or receiving

1427923
free	malloc
using rcpp and with stl container classes like vector etc means you never have to explicitly call malloc free or new delete which removes another frequent source of error

1428112
width	height
i was able to get around it by setting the height and width of the image tag however when if the margins on the print preferences changes the image will be chopped when printed

1428138
webkit	gecko
hopefully ie will come along in performance but that has clearly not been their focus over the more recent revisions so it s unrealistic to expect it to keep up with engines like webkit and gecko which have put a high priority on performance and have improved in leaps and bounds over a relatively short time

1428178
width	height
the only way to get a map to display in a tab at all is to set the css width and height of #map_canvas to be absolute values

1428178
width	height
changing the width and height to auto or 100 causes the map to not display at all even if it s already been successfully rendered using absolute width and height

1428178
width	height
but as i said i appear to be stuck with applying only absolute width and height css to the map div

1428193
width	height
i would like panel a to be sized to the height width of the frame and maintain that size on frame resize but i would like panel b to overlap a

1428193
width	height
b will be at a fixed position 0 0 to make it easier with a fixed height and width

1428298
awt	swing
do not mix lightweight swing and heavyweight awt components within a container where the lightweight component is expected to overlap the heavyweight one

1428305
kerberos	ntlm
now from what i have read this is telling the service to use ntlm rather than kerberos

1428305
kerberos	ntlm
so what is going on here a little bit of background on the difference of ntlm and kerberos why it would work with one and not the other why this element doesn t need a value how to configure a service not to need it and why it is needed at all

1428323
google-chrome	firefox

1428418
jsf	seam
i recently sat down to port a simple rails app i have to jsf using seam to get a feel for which i would be more productive in

1428418
jsf	seam
jsf seam appears to be very popular but it doesn t make sense to me that it would forbid all http methods but post

1428433

annotation public protected private

1428444
coalesce	nvl
to supplement the rest of the answers here which deal primarily with null values and coalesce nvl nvl2

1428499
postgresql	mysql
something that would allow me to port schema from say microsoft sql server to postgresql or mysql to sqlite

1428508
width	height
as far as i can tell it appears that disabling a second monitor is done by calling changedisplaysettingsex on the second monitor and providing a width height colour depth and refresh rate of 0

1428523
for-loop	arrays
if order is unimportant sort the new arrays the old arrays will naturally always be sorted and then do a for-loop through the list

1428526
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari	svg	vml
raphaã l uses the svg w3c recommendation and vml as a base for creating graphics and supports firefox 3.0+ safari 3.0+ opera 9.5+ and internet explorer 6.0+

1428537
getter	setter
getter and setter specifically are

1428541
exif	jfif
effectively when you mention jpeg jpg you are actually talking about jpeg jfif although there is a spec for jpeg tiff and jpeg exif usually digital photos is where you ll see these

1428541
exif	jfif
a lot of the time whatever produces the exif file will also include what jfif parsers need to decode properly so it is transparent to the end user but not entirely a valid and to spec exif file

1428558
mousemove	mouseup
matlab slider has a problem that it fires callback only on mouseup and not on mousemove so pure matlab implementation would always feels strange

1428602
equals	tostring
a frame object contains few properties but doesn t override equals yet overridden tostring seen above

1428606
sorting	filtering
more on queries filtering sorting complex lookups

1428626
haskell	ocaml	haskell	scheme	ocaml	scheme
i would highly recommend picking a functional programming language you are comfortable with f# ocaml haskell or scheme and taking a long look at how its standard library is structured

1428647
mxml	haxe
if you want to target the avm2 use either flex through mxml with least possible ammounts of as3 or haxe .

1428647
mxml	haxe
but you really should just build a clean app from scratch using the best of what the language you use provides being a subset of oop aop and fp haxe avm1 would allow all of these things or a declarative approach as allowed by mxml .

innodb	myisam
i converted my primary tables over to innodb and now many of my queries are taking over 1 minute to complete where they were nearly instantaneous on myisam

prototypejs	mootools
for example do they use a library like jquery mootools or prototypejs and how do they avoid namespace clashes

1428893
kerberos	ntlm
here is a blog post explaining ntlm versus kerberos with respect to wcf

1428897
int	boolean
if you re using votefu which it looks like you are then i d recommend that you convert to using int to store the vote values instead of boolean

1428900
debian	linux
could threads work just as well it s debian lenny linux

1428970
gif	png
i have used it extensively to dynamically create class instances from remote jpg gif png

1429003
inherited	properties
the second feature is a little harder to implement but if you inherited from all your controls and add a command properties which is triggered by an internal event such as click which is binded to a command instance in the viewmodel

1429005
freebsd	linux	freebsd	solaris
solaris freebsd osx have dtrace linux has oprofile

1429016
sorting	grouping
maybe i m missing something but what about grouping by foreign key and sorting by the resulting values

1429033
button	checkbox
otherwise it is possible that a value of inappropriate type to your button filed reference to checkbox instance will be assigned to a variable you pass

1429038
cpu	affinity
use cpu affinity masks for both sql and iis asp to isolate the two on separate cores configure sql to reserve less ram so that it leaves free memory for iis asp configure your app pools to recycle aggressively to prevent application pool growth

1429048
min	max
if i specify a parameter in my wsdl is of type xsd int what is the max and min values for that parameter

1429076
fink	macports
i downloaded macports used easy_install tried fink

1429076
fink	macports
this predates the macports fink apt approach but you have much more control on it although you have to do everything by hand

1429076
fink	macports
does macports fink whatever allows me the same flexibility of rehacking if something goes wrong

1429159
jsf	seam
in my personal experience jsf seam aren t actually very popular due in large part to these sorts of issues

1429197
folder	directory
i ve played with the idea with subversion of having a myproject_eclipseproj folder that only contains the the eclipse project files and directory with an svn externals prop that pulls in all the myproject files directory

1429197
versioning	upgrade
you could also have specific folders for different eclipse versioning so each developer wouldn t be forced to upgrade if something changed in the .settings or .project file between versioning

1429215
updatepanel	scriptmanager
controls can register with the scriptmanager directly or via an updatepanel

1429221
cpu	processors
if it uses 5 times as much processors power but completes in 1 5 the time then the cpu used is basically equivalent

1429228
for-loop	arrays
a length property is also set which is why the matched elements of a jquery object can be iterated over like an arrays using a for-loop or commands such as

1429266
pop-up	dialog
i am trying to save a file using getsavefilename and want to have a couple extra pop-up at the bottom of my save file dialog to allow the user to specify further options

1429273
innodb	myisam
as written in should you move from myisam to innodb

1429273
innodb	myisam
innodb needs tuning as a final note about myisam to innodb migration i should mention about innodb tuning

1429273
innodb	myisam
tuning myisam from defaults rarely gives more than 2-3 times gain while it can be as much as 10-50 times for innodb tables in particular for write intensive workloads

1429273
innodb	myisam
just for the record the people behind mysqlperformanceblog.com ran a benchmark comparing falcon myisam and innodb

1429273
innodb	myisam
the benchmark was really supposed to be highlighting falcon except it was innodb that won the day topping both falcon and myisam in queries per second for almost every test innodb vs myisam vs falcon benchmarks â part 1

1429317
opera	firefox
when i tested it at home at work on windows 2000 ie6 xp four different machines and a virtualbox instance ie6 7 opera 9 firefox 3 and vista ie 7 as well as through konquerer and firefox on ubuntu on two different machines it worked fine i don t have a mac

rv is udp ems is tcp

1429402
fseek	fread	fseek	ftell	ftell	fread
each time you do an fseek fread or fwrite what is your output when you invoke ftell

1429403
udp	tcp
basically i am trying to convert activestate code recipe 392572 using the win32 iphelper api to getting the active tcp udp connections using the getextendedtcptable function

1429411
viewdidload	dealloc
so if you are adding your subview viewdidload gets called and you initialize your player then perhaps you are removing the subview and adding it again since you didnt release the view assuming you have only one copy dealloc does not get called i dont think so anyway then if you re add the view masscheersoundid will get overriden and leak.. another problem might be that since you have masscheersoundid as a property you allocate it and the setter generated also retains it so then you are left with a +2 reference count when it should only be +1...so assuming my assumptions are correct i would suggest to write viewdidload like this

1429453
draggable	droppable
i am using jquery draggable droppable bound to a live mouseover event

1429453
firefox	safari
in firefox and safari i m getting a strange behavior where when i initially load the page only some of the droppable areas work

1429508
fseek	ftell
fgetpos and fsetpos use a fpos_t so can potentially work with very large files in scenarios where fseek and ftell won t

1429525
children	parent
an easy and common fix for this is to simply put something after the floating children set to clear them and therefore force the parent to have height - for instance

1429651
mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown	mouseup	mousedown
in short that solution uses the mousedown mouseup and mousemove events of the controls to allow them to be dragged around

1429672
appkit	nsapplication
you need to link against foundation and appkit especially the latter for nsapplication or whatever gnustep s equivalents are

1429681
invokelater	invokeandwait
if i take the whole thing which runs for about 0.4 msec from outside the swing thread and wrap every call to a mutator in an invokelater or invokeandwait the ui is a lot more responsive

1429713
button	checkbox
for this to be possible through pure button pushing the browse dialogs popping up after selecting add external jars... and add external class folder... would need something like a checkbox to specify if you want to add the relative or the absolute path

1429718
ant	maven
you can either use ant + ivy or maven to manage your library dependencies

1429720
ubuntu	linux
i prefer dynamic shared linking but when i tried to build boost shared libraries on ubuntu linux i got lots of errors or warnings why there are always errors warning notes and other stuff when compiling grrrrrrrr so i don t know if it was compiled alright

1429726
ssl	https
https is the protocol used to request a page from the server using ssl or tls encryption

1429741
awt	swing
btw it s awt s event dispatch thread not swing s.

1429767
maven	m2e
maven 2 has a steeper learning curve but provides a much richer set of functionality for building your projects and eclipse integration through m2e or iam

1429805
haskell	ocaml
here is ocaml code that uses functors to give a strict implementation of haskell parameterised over the monad in question

1429821
hide	show
this is a link to using a windows function to hide the horizontal and force vertical to be show at all times

1429834
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
i can get a download prompt for text files fine in opera google-chrome and firefox but not ie

1429858
tolower	toupper
this search is case sensitive but you can just as eaily use toupper or tolower to change it

1429916
sorting	filtering
alternatively consider supporting filtering rather than sorting to accomplish the same purpose

1429929
put	get
in fact i want to put connection string for sql database in this file and get it when needed so i need to change it if the connection changed

1429933
entity-relationship	diagram
at the top of the section he talks about e-r entity-relationship diagram

1429961
comparator	comparable
this depends on either comparator from the comparable interface or compare from the comparator to ensure uniqueness

1429999
move	drag
so if you try to drag an item from the main list to a sublist it will consider the entire sublist to be a single item and try to move over it as such

1430043
google-chrome	firefox
i am trying to troubleshoot why ie is slow slow processing this javascript compared to google-chrome and firefox

1430043
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome and firefox there is no delay for any onclick events but in ie it pauses for like 5 seconds before doing anything

1430096
for-loop	arrays
i had declared some variables as const which ie doesn t recognize and i was also using the for..in construct on arrays which i replaced with an indexed for-loop

1430110
post	get
i would suggest that you change your form submission to use the post redirect get pattern to avoid a resubmission if they hit refresh on the demo page

1430123
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
i agree with you as far as firebug s performance goes in recent releases therefore i have found myself using the excellent webkit inspector - in both google-chrome and safari - and opera dragonfly a lot more recently

1430148
folder	directory
right click in package explorer - import - file system - browse to the directory containing your jars - check the boxes next to the jars you want - browse to the workspace folder you want to import to probably your lib folder - finish

1430154
post	put
i have a form that i use jquery i don t think i need to put code in this post the question is pretty basic

1430164
vim	emacs
without getting into a religious argument about why one is better than the other what are the practical differences between emacs and vim

1430171
vim	emacs
the biggest difference for me in choosing to use emacs over vim was the built in gdb support in emacs

1430188
vim	emacs
there is a huge difference on a day-to-day level - vim or any vi variant is inherently modal you go into command modes where you cannot edit and emacs along with most other editors are not

1430188
vim	emacs
that is at the heart of the vim emacs debate

1430199
vim	emacs
also emacs shortcuts are mainly accessed through modifiers and obviously the vim interface is famously modal giving access to an absurd amount of direct keys for manipulation

1430199
vim	emacs
emacs used to be the only editor of the two that was proagrammable and while vim has a lot of weird levels to it s programmability with the addition of python and ruby bindings and more i forget vim is also programmable in most ways you d care for

1430213
stdout	stderr
i m trying to redirect the output of a third-party native dll which outputs to stdout stderr from within c#

1430213
stdout	stderr
the output of both stdout and stderr should go to a log file

1430227
mousemove	mousedown
the alternative is listening on mousedown instead of mousemove which fixes the previous issue however the nested button loses it s click

1430230
vim	emacs
emacs has viper-mode so in some real sense it provides a superset of features excepting those described in what vim features are missing in emacs with viper and vimpulse

1430231
inherited	properties
it doesn t inherited from known properties of your other projects

1430235
readonly	temporary
readonly queries can be load balanced across all your n readonly nodes and if your read write master goes down temporary at least your app will be able to service read operations

1430280
width	height
doing this will require you to rework your layout but in theory it should allow you to change those elements either via normal means like their height and width properties or via strange stuff like zoom and not have them affect the layout of anything else as absolutely positioned elements are not supposed to affect the layout of anything else on the page

1430288
ant	maven
a third choice besides chssply76 s options is to use ant with the maven ant tasks

1430304
puts	gets
asp.net mvc page has one link ajax.actionlink which gets the form to create and puts it in one of the div

1430419
restrict	shared
if you don t have a shared memory location which is accessible from multiple threads or you can write your code to either eliminate that shared memory variable or restrict access to it to only one thread then there is no possibility of a race condition and you don t need to worry about anything

1430419
restrict	shared
to eliminate nbr 4 you have to restrict write access to the block of code that accesses the shared memory from more than one thread at a time using lock or some comparable synchronization methodology

1430434
vim	emacs
vim was always faster to start up than emacs

1430434
vim	emacs
i m saying that on any machine out-of-the-box installs of vim will start up faster than out-of-the-box installs of emacs

1430434
vim	emacs
and i tend to think that after a moderate amount of customisation of either one vim will still start up faster than emacs

1430452
int	double
for an anonymous type with an int and a double as properties i disassembled the following c# code

1430475
punctuation	words
punctuation is defined to be included with the words it is closest to

1430478
nstextfield	nscolorwell
i m attempting to bind an nscolorwell to the nstextfield value and implementing an nsformatter subclass

1430478
nstextfield	nscolorwell
the nscolorwell is bound to an ivar in the app delegate which is also bound to the nstextfield

1430546
kerberos	ntlm
i can see in the windows event viewer that it s not using kerberos to connect to the box iis is on it s using ntlm

1430615
hide	show
at this point once the user logs in he will see the master tempdb and will also see the new db which he is a db owner of..you may want to go to tools option and enabled the option to hide system objects so that you don t show the master tempdb etc

1430624
put	get
get rid of the semi-colon after scrolltop and put it at the end of the line-

1430657
google-chrome	firefox
works in google-chrome and works in firefox but not in ie

1430662
action-filter	onactionexecuting
aside i ve also written a list action-filter attribute that picks up these values from the route and if the model is a collection automatically applies the sorting and paging in onactionexecuting

1430669
ienumerable	iqueryable
using linq particularly with extension methods on ienumerable iqueryable you can build up your queries using your standard and custom logic depending on the inputs that you get

1430704
post	get
in methods that respond to search or paging i first load up any values from the session then override them and set the session values if necessary with values from the querystring or form parameters depending on whether it is a get or post

1430725
width	height
how can i bind both ellipse width and height properties and attached canvas.left and top properties so that i can set values to be different fractions of s

1430725
width	height
so canvas.left and top could be 1 2f s while width and height could be 3 4

1430735
cakephp	kohana
i m not sure what the right term for this piece of software is but i m calling it an application platform or an application framework but this isn t anything like cakephp kohana or zend - it s another level higher than that

1430747
portrait	landscape
however if content in landscape mode requires the user the scroll down then when the user returns to portrait mode the screen is zoomed out so to speak

1430798
mouse	keyboard
i am quite new to driver development and trying to write a simple filter driver that will enable or disable a keyboard or mouse device

1430808
ant	maven
if you build with something other than an ide like with maven or ant two popular build tools you would need to set the classpath using the ways they specify

1430851
google-chrome	firefox
i am using plugin here and i got a problem in internet explorer and google-chrome not firefox

1430862
vb6	vba
for vba and vb6 it s free

1430900
apache	nginx
unless you are running a very non-standard setup your web server apache iis nginx etc. will have multiple processes that run php separately for each request that comes into the server

1430913
post	get
to create an easy way to get the last number post comments etc

1430917
cpu	processors
while listening for an event your program has no need to consume cpu time and thus will sleep until an event occurs freeing the processors for usage until then

1430929
postgresql	mysql
i m facing the same issue with running part of an application off postgresql for where it will benefit and the rest of mysql where it s better

1430939
vim	emacs
i started with vi went to emacs then to vim

1430939
vim	emacs
cut and paste in vim takes more steps than in emacs iirc

1430939
debian	linux
i ve been in the bare minimum linux to fix something just a month or two ago in a debian distro

1430956
stdout	stderr
should i output this warning to stderr or stdout

1431011
vim	emacs
both are old but still you will get the philosophy and you might choose to use the current tool vim 7.x or emacs 25

1431019
action-filter	onactionexecuting
the easiest way to do this is to write a common base class that all of your controller types subclass then stick an action-filter on that base class or override its onactionexecuting method

1431045
width	height
it has stretch uniform and no explicit width height set

1431069
put	get
you should probably rewrite this to put things like start increment and span somewhere in static storage rather than in function arguments because this will get rather confused if they change but i m feeling lazy about that

1431080
google-chrome	firefox
the same url works fine in rest of the browsers ie firefox and google-chrome

1431101
post	get
how would i do it using jquery and how would i get the value in php post processing

1431102
punctuation	words
as a first cut you can try b which will match any string starting with at a words boundary non-word character such as whitespace or punctuation

1431115
width	height
my intention is to create a web login for a c# application which need to be opened in ie in specified width and height and needs to call a function in the application program

1431125
width	height
i don t think is possible to specify new ie window width and height values you may need to use javascript for that

1431126
stdout	stderr
if the user does not want the warning from stderr to go to a downstream process that is parsing stdout they don t have to do anything special

1431126
stdout	stderr
if the user wants the warning from stderr to go to a downstream process that will parse stdout and stderr the user can use 2 1 to redirect stderr into stdout

1431132
ftp	smb
this is automatic and you dont need to do anything other than making the folder you talk about to a network shared folder via smb or ftp server

1431158
translation	localization
localization like this takes consideration of the languages you want to translation to

1431226
google-chrome	firefox
but with firefox and google-chrome the value for user.identity.name and isauthenticated is always empty

1431226
google-chrome	firefox
when using ie it s fine but with firefox and google-chrome it s not

1431246
google-chrome	firefox
are cookies enabled in firefox and google-chrome

1431283
google-chrome	safari
i have made it work in google-chrome safari by making the following two changes

1431283
google-chrome	safari
the effect is quite jittery in google-chrome safari this seems to be something to do with webkit reporting the newly applied height of the textarea as 4px less then you set it to i assume this is due to the box model and some browser applied styles but i don t know

1431288
folder	directory
pack uri scheme is only used for files inside resource directory where else if you just add a file or add a file as a link and set its type to content it will only copy the file in your bin folder but it will not be packed inside application resource directory

1431318
ubuntu	linux
if you are trying to install boost on ubuntu linux just run sudo apt-get install libboost1.37-dev

1431318
ubuntu	linux
for example using the package system s version of boost will make it more likely that your software will run smoothly on other ubuntu linux deployments which use the package manager s version of boost

1431374
getter	setter
you may need to move the attribute if you need the code to execute only after the setter rather than the getter

1431383
implements	extends
i m still quite new to spring and i ve found it to irritating making all these crud daos so i ve made a public class genericcruddao extends hibernatedaosupport implements cruddao

1431388
folder	directory
well my example is a wpf app that adds files folder in a directory to a treeview but you should get the general idea

1431418
hide	show
when you show one you want to hide the others so something like

1431418
hide	show
or you may wish to hide them all before the switch and then show the one specified

1431444
hash-collision	key
hash tables do have an even larger advantage over sorted trees when the key comparison is expensive as with strings because for large sets fewer items will have a hash-collision than a search tree is deep and because it s possible to cache the hash code for key already in the set skipping the expensive comparison for probably all but the matching result

1431461
installation	upgrade
i suggest you upgrade your java installation

1431490
hide	show
your newcustomerviewmodel will contain those fields and might depending on your flavour of mv be responsible for some presentation logic to show hide parts of the view and basic validation ensuring that both password fields match

1431491
inherited	properties
you d need to update the inherited properties of the view to be the code-behind file

1431530
cpython	ironpython
but there are certain portability issues between ironpython and cpython

1431530
cpython	ironpython
if there are scripts written in cpython which use these you will have a hard time porting them to ironpython

1431530
cpython	ironpython
also if the ironpython scripts use any .net libraries you will have a hard time porting them to cpython

1431563
getter	setter
dtos in mvvm and mvp are usually very dumb objects and are basically just a bunch of property setter and getter

1431567
firefox	safari
is it possible to code a pure c++ plugin for safari re-using my firefox npapi plugin would be great

1431606
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
the npapi plugin mechanism is the standard mechanism for browser plugins on macos and linux -- everything other than ie really -- if you use the npapi your plugin will work on safari firefox and opera

1431666
children	parent	daemons	launchd
daemons sets sigcld to sig_ign when launchd which at least on linux causes terminated children to immediately be reaped rather than becoming a zombie until the parent invokes wait

1431671
antivirus	mcafee
i disabled the antivirus mcafee and corrected the user name i unnecessarily gave the domain whereas it was not required

1431675
put	get
you can put some php file into the root and get

1431722
width	height
in other cases capturepicture returns a picture with height and width values 0

1431741
keydown	keyup	keydown	mouseup	keydown	mousedown	keyup	mouseup	keyup	mousedown	mouseup	mousedown
the movie clip continues to receive events for example mousedown mouseup keydown and keyup

1431806
spweb	spsite
one option is to build in some protection where if a valid spcontext can t be found this is created with new spsite spweb objects as necessary to provide that context

1431806
spweb	spsite
this may require some rearchitecture depending on how the expression builder was designed particularly because you would now need to correctly dispose of the created spsite and spweb objects something that s not required when using spcontext

1431843
font-lock	slime
i am doing small modification to slime so that i can get all currently loaded symbols from lisp analyze them and make font-lock fontify them

1431851
hide	show
how can i make the grid show or hide row details using a checkbox column

1431863
font-lock	cperl-mode
i hack on cperl-mode mostly and it is a simple matter of cperl-init-faces which sets the internal font-lock variables and a restart of font-lock

1431875
gif	png
the images could be png gif jpg while the header content-type seems to only have space for one type

1431892
width	height
i played around with width height as auto but that didn t work

1431966
nonetype	iterable
returns me a nonetype object not iterable error

1431988
pascal	delphi
for delphi developers a company called peganza created two useful sourcecode analysers pascal analyzer and pascal browser

1431991
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in firefox google-chrome etc but if i load it in ie none of the jquery functions run and ie s script debugger shows

1432026
btrieve	pervasive
is there any solution to work with btrieve pervasive db from ruby level

1432029
hide	show
as for show and hide even when the selectors will work this isn t defined as you expect

1432067
keydown	keyup
different browsers have different keycode values in keyup and keydown events which will not necessarily correspond to the ascii code for the corresponding character

1432208
google-chrome	firefox
firefox 3.5 and google-chrome already support it

1432273
django	turbogears	pylons	turbogears
python is also a very good choice for web development with good frameworks like django pylons turbogears etc

1432273
wxpython	pyqt
python is also great for cross-platform desktop applications using wxpython pyqt tkinter gtk etc

1432285
versioning	upgrade
here s a way to execute your upgrade commands only if a certain versioning is in place

1432316
lisp	smalltalk
javascript for instance is a scripting language with object oriented aspects smalltalk c++ functional aspects lisp and the syntax of c

1432317
firefox	safari
unless jquery is being super clever and it is clever but i don t think its this clever you aren t getting a resize event because firefox and probably safari only support the resize event on the window object

1432317
width	height
note i use the settimeout method here because ie often lags when sorting out width and height parameters when content has changed

1432317
width	height
by using settimeout it lets ie sort things out before the height and width properties are accessed

1432320
implements	extends
i have implements a class that extends system.timers.timer object

1432328
g++	gcc
and then you can execute gcc g++ from any directory

1432334
vb.net	vb6
vb.net not vb6

1432400
subtract	add
if status can only have two values then what you need is add those two values then subtract status

1432401
opera	firefox
firefox seems to have different padding i would need to have the submit box 1px smaller in padding to fit but that would throw opera 10 off and ie7 is just way off

1432419
vim	emacs
but the emacs styles mixed tabs and spaces are not that much friendly to vim

1432422
sqldatareader	sqlconnection
due to wrapping the sqlconnection and sqlcommand around using blocks the sqldatareader gets closed after the customexecutereader is called therefore i can t read the sqlreaderresultset at the business level layer

1432462
stdout	stderr
this is a quick-and-dirty stdout and stderr replacement and also does not handle any raw_input related bugs obviously since it doesn t touch sys.stdin at all

1432474
versioning	upgrade
it was a versioning issue such that i started the project with a beta versioning of mvc and have since upgrade to mvc rc 1.0 it was not a mvc versioning issue from development machine to production server

1432559
hash	salt
hash the password use salt for added security using your favorite algorithm and store the hash and the salt

1432559
hash	salt
compare salt hash input with stored data to check a password

1432584
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
components developed in visual studio 2008 should work ok in ie firefox safari and opera there was a problem in vs2005

1432589
hash	salt
adding a salt accounts for additional security because the same password will not result in the same hash

1432621
portrait	landscape
if you can afford the memory overhead it may be the best thing to add a new landscape view on top of all the portrait views not discarding them as you suggest

1432621
portrait	landscape
the user then interacts with this landscape view as desired until going back to portrait

1432630
subtract	add
for each firing of the history function you will subtract the oldest value from the historyrunningtotal and add in the new history value

1432649
hash	salt
so you hash + salt the password and store that in the db for the user who want to access the service and when the user wants to authenticate you apply the same algorithm to create the hash and compare those

1432699
children	parent
this problem occurs because linq entities tend to have links between parent and children items in both directions

1432741
actionscript	haxe
unlike actionscript 3 haxe even can use alchemy opcodes .

1432755
onclick	onmousedown
the solution i want to use is forwarding onmousedown events to onclick

1432758
width	height
the standard tscrollbar class is a wincontrol itself where the scrollbar is taking the whole width and height of the control

1432836
hide	show
i m writing a simple bit of javascript to hide show items in a list depending on the checking unchecking of checkboxes

1432847
hide	show
while i ve gotten as far as to show a div layer at a particular location after clicking an image i m not sure how to hide the layer if i click on any other part of the webpage

1432867
range	median
we all love robust measures like median and interquartile range but lets face it in many fields boxplots almost never show up in published articles while means and standard errors do so all the time

1432867
ggplot2	lattice
it s simple in lattice ggplot2 etc to draw boxplots and the galleries are full of them

1432886
post	get
use the pricing post request to get the estimated pricing for the image

1432889
outline	text-indent
as a result i did the trick but i want to know how i can do it with the text-indent trick but fix the outline

1432926
wordpress	expressionengine
i ve looked at others about wordpress expressionengine etc all of them have excellent features

1432945
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
it works in firefox google-chrome but in opera and ie i should manualy reload page to see an effect

1432946
cassini	iis
our web service is running under ultidev cassini instead of iis which runs under the system account

1433012
r5rs	r6rs
if you are using one of the standardized versions r5rs r6rs etc. you can define build-vector yourself for example like this

1433057
super	abstract
i have a super abstract class

1433057
superclass	subclassing
and this last superclass has also two subclassing andquery and orquery annotated with xmlrootnode

1433057
super	extends
i also have a propertyquery class which extends query super class

1433064
apache	nginx
in the apache or nginx conf file where passenger s settings live you set a passengerruby environment variable

1433074
many-to-many	many-to-one
if your association table stores additional information as they almost always do you should just break your many-to-many relation into two many-to-one relations

1433076
mouseevent	mouseenter
the above code compiles and run but if you move the mouse inside someuicomponent the â œdo somethingâ code will note run because actually you are not overriding the base method mouseenter mouseevent ev

1433088
sorting	filtering
so you can see that is filtering by date but the thing is when i have the same date the sorting loses the focus

1433113
nsoperationqueue	nsinvocationoperation
i would suggest using a nsoperationqueue with a nsinvocationoperation

1433131
wordpress	joomla
although this is easy to do i would lose the handy ability within my content management system joomla wordpress to easily reference and link to these images

1433190
int	double
for eg double val 35 then i want int 40

1433200
bazaar	git
benchmark test 2009-08-16 git 1.6.3.3 hg 1.3.1 bazaar 1.17

1433200
bazaar	git
bazaar has improved in leaps see upcoming 2.0 and the shared repositories in bazaar is as fast as git branch

1433200
bazaar	git
the development phase and development discussion messages of both git and bazaar suggest that in the future git and bazaar will advance quicker than hg

1433205
hide	show
my page have a menu when the user click it hide div blocos and show the content using url parameter setted in menu

1433205
fadein	hide
all menu links hide and fadein the content.

1433205
hide	show
when user click on that the start content show up but it hide after .

1433205
google-chrome	firefox
only in google-chrome ...ie8 and firefox 3.5 works fine..

1433213
serializable	deserialization
the benefit being you don t have to deal with handling all the xml serializable and deserialization

1433232
opera	firefox
opera 10 for this example firefox 3 for this example and internet explorer 7 for this example all display an button differently

1433232
opera	firefox
this focus-inner property is default 0 on opera 10 something like 5px for firefox and must be 6px for internet explorer

1433251
wordpress	joomla
joomla wordpress to easily reference

1433264
ssl	https
edit https ssl tls support has been available in monotouch for a few years now

1433315
vim	emacs
even though i use emacs all day every day and love it unless you intend to spend a lot of time in the program you choose i would pick vim

1433320
vsto	add-in
on your machine when you run the add-in from visual studio it should create a registry key in hkey_current_user software microsoft vsto security inclusion someguid

1433351
width	height
that includes width and height font sizes line widths - every visible component of the control

1433387
int	double
of the files declared i as a double instead of as an int c s

1433387
int	double
a machine with 64-bit int and double you d not even get a warning

1433387
int	double
on a machine with 32-bit int and 64-bit double you d probably get a

1433387
typedef	struct
definitions enum struct or union types or typedef generally do not

1433483
hide	show
i wish it may help you im using this to hide and show some fields in a jsp you may arrange it to fit your need

1433504
versioning	upgrade
or you could specify a versioning for the file so upgrade rules will treat it like replacing a non-versioned file with a versioned one but then patches can get antsy about having the wrong versioning of this file

1433505
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
if you roll along the menu you will see in google-chrome safari firefox ie7 etc

1433532
min	max
for example say the scale min is 0 and the scale max is 10 000

1433535
actionscript	haxe
are there any reliable debuggers for haxe out there in an actionscript 3 context and do they support breakpoints conditional breakpoints watches locals and stacks

1433545
division	modulo
the answer appears to be at prb overflow with integer division and modulo

1433545
division	modulo
modulo and the integer division

1433545
division	modulo
perform integer division and modulo

1433568
stdout	fflush
flushing stdout after the printf isn t normally needed for terminal io but can be if you re piping it to a disk typically when you re logging a crashing program it will lose the most interesting bit just before the crash if you don t fflush

1433568
fgets	getchar
because fgets reads up to and including the end of the line there are no characters left in the buffer so you only need one getchar and slightly awkward input such as 1234 space enter doesn t cause the program to terminate without pausing

1433597
rss	feed
yes i had tried to create an rss feed using the toolkit

1433602
awt	swing	swt	swing
i never liked to design windows in java awt swing swt too much work for an ugly interface

1433623
opera	firefox
now for the question is there a way to set the bloody colour in opera for this focus event which would solve that issue or to have it in firefox without having to bloat the design in every other browser or a way to make ie conform at all

1433736
getter	setter	public	protected
i would personally stop using a protected field as well - consider adding an indexer to your base class with a protected setter and a public getter

1433745
opera	safari
you can also use firebug lite wich works on ie opera and safari

1433768
google-chrome	firefox
i m testing this in firefox and google-chrome

1433808
children	parent
i know that it will be recursive delete if i will delete parent it will delete his children

1433855
128bit	64bit
for testing purposes i need to find two 64bit integer values that exactly multiply to a 128bit intermediate value with a specific bit pattern

1433880
width	height
everything has a width height set to fill_parent except for the tabwidget which has its layout_height set to wrap_content and the layout_gravity set to bottom

1433880
width	height
first thing i noticed is that webview s donâ t show anything until all the parents have width height set to fill_parent

1433889
children	parent
the problem is that when you delete a child you won t delete the link from its parent and when you delete a parent you won t delete any links from its children to any grandchildren

1433898
opera	firefox
i gave it a couple tries and found that opera and firefox both render it wrong

1433898
opera	firefox
it would render correctly in opera and firefox however now its wrong in ie7

1433909
128bit	64bit
i ll just add that if the 128bit number is prime or has a prime factor larger than 64bit then there will be no solution to your problem

1434047
button	marquee
the problem is that i have a marquee that slides when you click the next button

1434061
sorting	filtering
from here i have access to the all the objects from via icollectionview via sourcecollection in which i for now presume sorting and filtering is respected

1434063
sorting	filtering
i definitely support the add filtering idea as well if feasible - i find myself using excel for 50 of the work with tables lists originated from any app website due to its exceptional combination of filtering and sorting

1434087
firefox	safari
some browsers firefox 3+ and probably safari

1434100
mouse	keyboard
pair programming is about one having keyboard and mouse and the other one providing feedback

1434100
mouse	keyboard
you can switch these roles or give the keyboard to one and the mouse to the other but you will always have to work on think about the same piece of code for it to be pair programming

1434135
maven	buildr
finally buildr is an excellent way of using maven s dependency management and plugins while also supporting ad-hoc tasks

1434139
next	except
this layout is working fine except in ie6 where at certain page widths it bumps the right column to the next line

1434139
google-chrome	firefox
edit i m using a cross browser inline-block hack that works great in firefox ie s google-chrome

1434146
post	get
what s more odd is that i ve been inspecting the post data that google itself uses and attempting to replicate it exactly but i still can t get it to work

1434159
move	drag
when i drag the width slowly over time from about 800px to 1600px it randomly move the right column around

1434192
versioning	upgrade
you should know exactly what s in the database and your upgrade script should do the create or alter as appropiate based on the current versioning of your application schema versioning control and your database

1434337
google-chrome	firefox
it works in firefox but doesn t work in google-chrome

1434377
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
if you go to via firefox google-chrome or safari it looks the way i wanted which content and sidebar is next to each other

1434385
mp3	wav
i ve tried saving in a variety of formats -- wav mp3 asnd etc and having no luck

1434405
128bit	64bit
and i ll just add to previous comment if 128bit number has prime factor larger than 64bit then it certainly has a factor less than 64bit

1434452
folder	directory
i currently have it setup so the link hits a page inside the directory structure of the website and this page s folder is set to integrated windows authentication

1434459
pow	sqrt
if you are just comparing relative magnitudes of distances you can probably get away with using the manhattan distance which will save you two calls to pow and one to sqrt

1434462
nunit	mstest
that doesn t mean that you can t use a unit testing framework such as mstest xunit.net nunit etc. to drive your service tests

1434486
unix	bsd
and yes on unix including linux bsd and mac os x or in a unix shell on windows you can use a shebang line at the top of the file to make the file automatically run using python

1434511
pow	floor	pow	math.h	pow	ceil	ceil	floor	ceil	math.h	floor	math.h
the aforementioned ntdll.dll exports only a few of the math.h functions floor ceil log pow ...

1434513
kerberos	ntlm
you need to know that the user is who it claims it is and the only way to do that is to let ntlm kerberos authenticate the user ie

1434530
width	height
for example if you had a class rectangle it might make sense to make the constructor rectangle double width double height and make the rectangle constructor private

1434550
vbscript	jscript
as far as i understand the scripts could be ported to jscript vbscript or plain batch which shouldn t be a problem

1434567
decimal	ieee
as for decimal digits of precision ieee binary64 has 52 binary digits

1434571
jsf	seam
jsf with seam can do get fine

1434571
post	get
jsf usually uses post to get your field data to the back end

1434582
qpainter	qimage
i m trying to open a png image and write some text to it a watermark via qimage and qpainter

1434587
pull	push
so it sounds like you have an existing database schema and an existing entity model also known as a repository and you want an orm to push pull data to from your database and your application

1434604
post	get
no method in jquery but you can just use xmlhttprequest object returned from the jquery get post ajax functions

1434612
google-chrome	firefox
i found out by trying a different browser that is firefox google-chrome instead of ie

1434619
min	max
also you can control the pooling by using your connection string min max pool size etc.

1434662
int	boolean
i want my users to use spinedit for int checkbox for boolean etc

1434714
free	malloc
the pointer from the malloc in create_bitmap_data_provider is never free

1434720
dxcore	coderush
i recently installed coderush and have been playing with the dxcore framework

1434758
draggable	droppable
i use draggable droppable jquery feature as follows

1434824
post	get
so i am looking for some sort of reverse mechanism then get and post

1434851
post	get
perhaps the simplest way is to submit the job and get an id back via a straightforward page post

1434887
button	checkbox
i have an html form that works fine it shows a list of things with checkbox the user checks some of them and clicks the remove button which submits the form

1434887
onclick	onsubmit
as the onsubmit method in the form tag or the onclick in the submit button tag it works fine but uses the ugly browser-native confirm dialog

1434907
folder	directory
the other option you have is to create another folder beneath the original folder and then that folder will be deployed to the out directory

1434907
folder	directory
and then in the testrunconfig you still select the testfolder folder and the testdeployment folder will be deployed to the out directory

1435020
clang	llvm
imho real useful program slicing tool often come within static analysis tools for example codesurfer for c++ and clang of llvm

1435021
equinox	knopflerfish
what is new is that a few items have been standardised which should enable for better interoperability between different osgi engines like equinox felix and knopflerfish

1435026
width	height
you can not define the array with non-constant dimensions width height outside of the function that is - not in the stack frame because the dimensions aren t known at compile-time

1435056
width	height
you might be able to get away with just including a loading message container at the top of your page which is 100 width height and then removing the said div on load complete

1435073
hash	md5
as pseudo-random generator i used only the last of the 128 output bits of the hash function md5 choose whatever function you want instead

1435107
put	get
more important than which database you use is to get up to speed on relational database design before you start to put this together

1435171
filtering	grouping
is there a way in infopath or moss to filtering the list so it doesn t include grouping

1435173
std	ostream
is there any way to coerce the outputstream to a std ostream in the jni layer

1435268
put	get
this does the following get input and put it into a stringstream

1435333
firefox	safari
i want the solution to work in ie firefox safari etc

1435357
floating-point	integer
do you mean that you have a floating-point value and want to know if it s an integer or not

1435418
merb	ruby-on-rails
i would be more concerned going from merb to ruby-on-rails 3

1435433
erlang	ocaml
i think ocaml is a great way to get started in fp and erlang is not very difficult once you have the basic fp concepts down

1435516
versioning	upgrade
i recently upgrade my subversion repository to versioning 1.6 and i m connecting to it with eclipse

1435525
pop-up	dialog
select delegating members in the pop-up and it will open a dialog in which you can select the methods you want

1435540
width	height
ideally i need a function like image crop image source int x int y int width int height which returns a new cropped image instance and does not require source cropped images to be placed to canvas

1435543
folder	directory
in my case i ve created an user in active directory by code then i create a folder for the user

1435548
post	get
the query i am using now to get my post with their categories are

1435549
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
the same page works as it should in firefox google-chrome and opera

1435557
versioning	upgrade
this started happening when we upgrade to the release versioning of s#arp architecture 1.0

1435616
implements	extends
can anyone give me a code example of how i would create and implements this category to extends this class

1435626
spaces	delimiter
you can also set a different delimiter but it uses spaces by default

1435666
width	height
width and height can vary idependently but square violates that contract

1435682
puts	gets
this form puts the name of the field inside the text box and uses a really simple script to clear the field name when the the field gets focus

1435682
firefox	safari
this has worked fine in ie6 ie7 firefox and safari but seems to have broken in ie8

1435698
hide	show
or show the first and hide the other one

1435699
google-chrome	firefox
also the prompt is showing in both internet explorer and firefox but isn t in google-chrome

1435733
post	put
i ve put out a quick cheatsheet around that framework - see the september post at my blog

1435780
mouse	keyboard
another big bonus i like about intellij compared to eclipse is that it s much less intrusive - i really hated how eclipse would manage to get popups on top of popups and mouse focus would be somewhere but keyboard focus is stuck on something underneath etc

1435788
post	get
true it s not maintained by its creator but when i get the time i m going to create a new sourceforge project for it so people have a place to post their patches

1435843
width	height
assuming the tilecontainer idea you just need to iterate over all the children and make sure they have the same height width max child height max child width and then do the layout steps mentioned above

1435848
children	parent
if the date is always going to be the same for all of the children models then why not make it an attribute on your parent model instead

1435848
children	parent
you can always use the delegate method in your children model to fetch the date from the parent

1435848
children	parent
finally add in a before_save callback or whichever callback is appropriate for your case in the parent model that saves the date to all of the children

1435878
spaces	delimiter
if you just want to remove consecutive spaces delimiter you might use text to columns

1435913
std	ostream
conceptually speaking the way to get foo print ... to write to an existing java outputstream instance is to write a c++ std ostream implementation that actually does a callback into java to do output

1435913
std	ostream
outputstream to a std ostream in the

1435956
cassini	iis
you should be able to debug iis just as if you are using the visual studio web server cassini

1435970
post	get
so either you have to transfer the variables using the _session array this stores a cookie on the client computer so don t sent any sensitive information through that array or you can either post or get between the scripts to send the variables

1435982
keydown	keyup
for keys that have printable character equivalents you should use the keypress event because you can retrieve character codes from the keypress event which is generally not possible for keyup and keydown events

1435983
put	get
i see that if i put a colon between the hours and minutes i get the desired output

1436069
hash	salt
so use a hash of username password and a site specific salt value should make a globally unique hash subject to the limitations of the hash algorithm itself

1436069
hash	salt
i ve made the assumption that hash should be sufficiently unique that i m not ever likely to end up with duplicate hash and therefore duplicate keys please correct me if i m wrong in that assumption. authentication is done by recreating the hash from the user name and password supplied by the user plus the secret salt and checking if that hash exists in the db

1436119
hash	salt
it should be safe to store the hash password with the user you can also have random salt for each user too so the same salt isn t used for each password

1436123
hash	salt
if you orphan a password hash and if your salt never changes then you have to prohibit any future use of once-active usernames to prevent former users from getting into their namesakes accounts

1436123
hash	salt
for example what if the salt were the hash of a user s account creation timestamp itself salt with a value that you can calculate from that timestamp

1436123
hash	salt
someone would have to figure out both your scheme for hashing passwords and the scheme for hashing timestamps and the scheme for generating timestamp-hashing salt before the association of a user name to a password hash would be likely to compromise anything

1436126
hash	salt
your salt and hash key is protected

1436154
udp	mtu
they are easily generated for udp simply by making the datagram bigger than the mtu

1436159
children	parent
the best thing i can suggest is a query for the parent records followed by a query for the children using an in parent id list query

1436159
children	parent
one for the parent and one for the children

1436159
children	parent
on the client side you can then take a parent id and get a set of children records

1436197
udp	mtu
if you send a udp datagram larger than the mtu it will be fragmented

1436199
google-chrome	firefox
note at this time firefox and google-chrome support the xmlhttprequest2 which does allow uploading via an ajax request

1436220
windows	wow64	x86	64bit
mason you can use iswow64process wow64 is the x86 emulator that allows 32-bit windows-based applications to run seamlessly on 64bit windows

1436295
comparator	comparable
you can rely on the natural ordering of the key as in its comparable interface or you can do custom ordering by passing a comparator

1436301
yacc	bison
i would keep the lexer flex lex as dumb as possible it should just provide a stream of basic tokens identifiers keywords etc... and have the parser yacc bison do the error detection

1436315
int	boolean
however you don t necessarily want everything to be ref-counted every little int every string every boolean every element in an array .

1436320
folder	directory
all these files folder were maintained under a single project working copy in tortoisesvn under a single directory

1436344
spaces	linefeed
if this is so consider using regex.replace inputfromtxtfile s as this will replace all forms of white spaces including spaces tab linefeed and newline

1436377
activemq	rabbitmq
i have looked at rabbitmq activemq openamq tibco rendezvous and websphere mq

1436402
ssl	https
the simplest solution by far is to just use a ssl socket instead of a normal one a la https ftps style

1436402
ssl	https
there is no difference at all in the protocol between http and https the only difference is that they operate on different ports 80 vs 443 normally and one uses a normal socket and the other uses a ssl encrypted socket

1436408
disk	ram
if you exceed physical ram for your working set you ll be paginating and swapping in and out to disk and your performance can rapidly degrade up to a state known as thrashing were basically all available cycles are going to the tasks of getting pages in and out and negligible amounts of actual work can actually get done

1436411
int	boolean
i m attempting to shorten the memory footprint of 10b sequential int by referencing them as indexes in a boolean array

1436419
cpu	hyperthreading
at one extreme where the processing time dominates the i o time the benefit that threading gives you is just the ability to take advantage of multiple cores and possibly hyperthreading to make use of the maximum available processing power of your cpu

1436434
powerpc	i386
you can build 64-bit python or- gasp - a 4-way i386 x86_64 powerpc ppc64 universal binary from source but unless you really need to work with absolutely huge disk files amounts of memory i m talking multi-gigabyte memory maps for example chances are you do not need 64-bit anything right now

1436480
children	parent
i have updated the setvaluefor method to iterate over a node s children and set the checkboxes as selected or deselected when a parent has been modified

1436483
put	get
from my understanding each of these methods get and put are atomic

1436483
put	get
what should we synchronize on to ensure that if thread1 does a get and thread2 does a get followed by a put that the first get will receive the new value added by thread2

1436531
g++	gcc
i will speculate that there is no math.h header in usr include - because if there was gcc g++ would normally pick up from the same place as

1436571
superclass	subclassing
a different subclassing for each implementation with shared functionality either in a common superclass or using the template method pattern

1436593
int	boolean
only use null true for non-string fields such as int boolean and dates.

1436656
hash	salt
use the salt hash of the password given by the primary user as one secret

1436656
hash	salt
use the salt hash of the password given by the first secondary user as another secret and so on for each additional secondary user

1436656
hash	salt
don t store the salt hash

1436656
hash	salt
when a user enters their password you retrieve the protected shared secret use the salt and hash of their password to produce the salt hash decrypt the protected shared secret and now you ve got the original primary user password

firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
this is not how the select dom element behaves under firefox 3.5 google-chrome 1.0 or safari 3.1 where the options property is exposed as a javascript array.

rather than the expected result of a jquery object with x elements as occured using firefox google-chrome and safari i was returned a jquery object with 1 element the select element itself

children	parent
when that parent qobject is destructed its children will be destroyed as well

1437092
qobject	qwidget
qt provides no additional guarantees beyond standard c++ if you re not using qobject or a subclass of qobject such as qwidget

1437099

from what i can tell size i did not specify the sizetocontent attribute the default is manual so it will use size of a window is determined by other properties including width height maxwidth maxheight minwidth and minheight

but since the default for the mins are 0 the maxs are infinity and the width height is nan....what s going on

1437249
int	chars
you should use int and not chars

1437279
int	chars
the documentation for getchar is that it returns the next chars available cast to an unsigned chars and then returned in an int return value

1437279
int	chars
the reason for this is to make sure that all valid chars are returned as positive values and won t ever compare as equal to eof a macro which evaluates to a negative int value

1437279
put	get
if you put the return value of getchar into a char then depending on whether your implementation s char is signed or unsigned you may get spurious detection of eof or you may never detect eof even when you should

1437288
int	chars
if the int value returned by getchar is stored into a variable of type chars and then compared against the int constant eof the comparison may never succeed because sign-extension of a variable of type chars on widening to int is implementation-defined

1437290
folder	directory
have you created a lib directory in your .vfs folder and copied the sqlite3 package into it

1437293
width	height
given the height and width properties you should be able to work out the halfway position remembering that y is positive downwards

1437303
put	get
put also the type of the get request as xml

1437308
int	chars
i agree with all other people in this thread by saying use int c not chars

1437314
mousedown	mouseenter
just add any extra events you require such as keypress mouseenter mousedown etc in a similar manner

1437319
nant	cruisecontrol
this error only happens for one application and only in cruisecontrol with nant but not when runing the test with nunitgui.

1437358
int	chars
if which is pretty much always true then the promotion of the chars to an int will never result in a negative value and eof must be a negative value

1437358
int	chars
that s one reason why all or at least many if not all the functions in the c standard that deal with or return chars specify int as the parameter or return type

1437412
mouse	keyboard
i can set breakpoints etc. but i don t want to debug using a mouse but using keyboard

1437429
qthread	qobject
qthread itself is derived from qobject

1437429

tools like ab are commonly used towards testing how much load you can take from a battering of requests at once alongside cacti munin your system monitoring tool or choice you can generate data on system load requests sec

1437749
profiling	benchmarking
profiling and benchmarking code and not requests is also important to which plenty of folk have already done so for django benchrun is also not a bad tool either

1437749
apache	nginx
as for apache vs nginx in regards to your django app it seems that mod_python is indeed faster than nginx lighty + fastcgi but that s no surprise because cgi regardless of any speed ups is still slow

1437758
gridview	sqldatasource
i have an sqldatasource and a gridview and neither can be cast into a dataset or datatable

1437987
ubuntu	linux
os i would go for a dual boot system with some linux distro maybe ubuntu

1438013
getter	setter
put a breakpoint inside the setter getter and debug making sure that you use step into f11 not step over - this should help explain whats going on

1438053
multiplying	add
now one way to do this would be to make one global board and 32 sub-boards with a different name like sub_board 32 and then write a new bunch of board manipulation functions that work on the new 2 dimensional sub_board but this would ruin my optimization because there would need to be an additional multiplying and add for every access to the game board

udp	tcp
tcpview is a windows program that will show you detailed listings of all tcp and udp endpoints on your system including the local and remote addresses and state of tcp connections

1438233
int	boolean
there s quite a few little bits of java which come from it being a better c++ - in c or c++ there s an automatic conversion between boolean values and int so in c++

1438233
int	boolean
java concentrates on fixing this ambiguity with parsing two binary operators by making boolean and int types non-convertible so you have to join them with another operator

1438234
google-chrome	firefox
it all works fine in firefox and google-chrome but ie gives priority to the the text in the table rather than the a tag so you get a text selector cursor and can t click the link when you hover over the text

in all the other browsers ie8 firefox google-chrome safari opera it animates in a motion which seems like the computer is hanging

1438418
padding	overlapping
my thinking is that maybe ie sees overlapping elements as in positioned on top of one another as a possible conflict and thus makes a decision to try to accommodate both well the link is yay big but the text outside of it really isn t a link so let s treat it like normal text etc but that elements that overlap purely for style which i think padding is considered would not raise any alarms because hey it s just a visual thing

serializable	deserialization
i know that i should do deserialization in the same order as i have done serializable

if i have an dependency jar for my application is it better to place it in the war files lib directory or to place it in the global application server like tomcat lib directory

here are the steps that i took to successfully install pil on mac os x 10.6 without using macports or fink

1439865
fink	macports
your best solution that doesn t involve macports or fink would probably be to compile and install python from the 2.6 release branch from either the mercurial python repository or the subversion python repository

1439870

put a linkbutton inside the updatepanel and get rid of the link you currently have

1440035
comparator	comparable
the simpler way is to implement comparable with your existing objects although you could instead create a comparator and pass it to the sortedmap

1440035
comparator	comparable
note that comparable and comparator are two different things

1440035
comparator	comparable
a class implementing comparable compares this to another object while a class implementing comparator compares two other objects

1440036
comparator	comparable
you can either implement comparable directly on your class or pass a separate comparator to the constructor

1440038
treemap	treeset
edit2 if you only have a bunch of objects that you re throwing into the collection and it s not a map it s not a mapping from one set of objects to another then you want a treeset not a treemap

hide	show
for example if you need to just hide show a couple controls i d include controls into the view that would be empty in some cases and contain data in others

1440454
hide	show
if it s more than a couple controls are show hidden at once and your framework supports a concept of panels reusable parts of the view i d separate that group of controls into a panel and show hide that panel depending on the conditional

ienumerable	ilist
i ran into the same problem except i had ilist in place of the ienumerable above.

1440506

turns out that subsonic returns an iqueryable so that s why you have to use the ienumerable in the view

a unsigned short in c++ is usually a 16-bit unsigned integer uint16 or ushort in c#

1440556

1440558
int	chars
remember in c++ chars is actually a pointer to memory usually represented by a 4 byte int

1440559
getter	setter
on the other hand if you would see a getter setter method call there then you would know right away that it is not a public variable access and that there is a function handling the call and it can even return error code or exception if so chosen

filtering	grouping
i have tried various ways of filtering the data to eliminate false-positives and have been using neural networks to a limited degree of success to grouping cracks together

1441322
stdout	stderr
my guess is that stdin stdout and stderr are pretty much connected to dev tty anyway unless redirected

1441322
stdout	stderr
and since the most common redirections for for stdin and or stdout via piping or but less often for stderr odds on are that using stderr would be most likely to still be connect to the keyboard

versioning	upgrade
if the conversion tool is actually broken i ve had mixed success using it in the past with the success rate being inversely proportional to the overall complexity of the project then one reason to include it anyway is to convince developers to start new projects using the latest versioning of visual studio and not to start them with an older versioning and hope that the upgrade process will be seamless

1442189
udp	tcp
in order to implement this i m considering using a simple heartbeat protocol between the instances to determine who s online and who isn t and while this is not terribly complicated i d like to know if there are any established heartbeat network protocols based on udp tcp or both

yacc	bison
if that s the case you re best bet is to do some basic parsing using lexx yacc or flex bison or your favorite clr language tree parser and detect invalid set statements

1442488
try-catch	exception-handling
i guess you can use exception-handling to cover all these cases but does that mean that a programmer will have to wrap all of those in a try-catch block

rather than create one large page and hide show the relevant controls for that animal or having panel controls to group the data i chose to create user controls for each animal

1442614

one trick i ve seen used in the past is to render some text say 50 arbitrary characters or ms and then measure the size of the rendered container and do the math to figure out the height and width of a single character

1442901
udp	tcp
for heartbeats use udp not tcp

the simplest and easiest way would be to enable rss on the lists you want exported and then pulling the rss feed into a seperate database using an external tool

1442954
openbsd	linux
porting a c program from unix to windows or even from linux to openbsd may be a straightforward recompilation but for an assembly program you may find that some callee-save registers become caller-save or that the floating-point parameters are passed differently

1442981
put	get
websphere has a hierarchy of classloaders parent classloaders cannot see child classloaders hence you get surprises when you put different aspects of your application in different places

1442981
websphere	ibm
you can specify the search order preference parent last so that these take prececdence over jars supplied by websphere - but note that some fundamental jars cannot be over-ridden you cannot replace the ibm security for example

kerberos	ntlm
it is not that important when you develop an intranet application since you will most likely rely on ntlm or kerberos but when you publish to the web it gets quite handy

1443062
ssl	https
if i try to add more than 1 ssl binding i get the error at least one other site is using the same https binding and the binding is configured with a different certificate ...

1443066

observer-pattern	presenter
because in between you have the presenter class es that will react on model changes and ui events observer-pattern databinding as a technique

1443181
superclass	subclassing
it is not a nice idea to expect the superclass to know the parameter to be used in the init of its subclassing since it is really hard to ensure that all the constructor will be the same maybe the animal dialog window takes diff parameters

1443187
short	base
glad you asked short answer - because the calculation that determines the common ancestor base of related files depends heavily on how prior merge conflicts between them were resolved

1443187
hash	md5
ditto if you chose an acceptmerge resolution but happened to commit a file with the same md5 hash as a foo.cs

1443337
int	double
the first one is slightly different in that 0 is an int literal which will be widened to a double

1443347
children	parent
i want to process the children tags in a xml file only if it matches the parent tag

1443347
children	parent
in the above code i want to match the parent tag first i.e parent tag-1 or parent tag -2 based on user input and only then process the children tags under it

1443361
free	malloc
i was bothered as i was used to develop in c c++ since suddenly all the open close create destroy lock unlock patterns that shows up in so many ways in software apart from malloc free could be broken since everybody believed that all cleanup was automatic

1443434
gridview	objectdatasource	gridview	formview	objectdatasource	formview
they want a small application using asp.net gridview formview and an objectdatasource with a dataset xsd file

1443434

google-chrome	firefox
ie firefox google-chrome all manage to negotiate the proxy sucessfully as do adobe air applications

1443618
folder	directory
now i ve re-ordered the directory structure i am referencing the folder instead of using the groups

1443628
codeigniter	cakephp
but if you use a framework such as zend framework symfony cakephp codeigniter etc.

1443634
lisp	prolog
i m reasonably familiar with c++ although haven t touched it since the nineties work on a daily basis and 100 confident with c# would consider myself advanced to expert with java and have developed a reasonable amount of stuff in lisp and prolog back in the day

1443744
int	chars	int	boolean
i would say i m pretty new to this but could someone explain the basics about data types more specifically int chars boolean string and floating-point numbers

1443746
int	double
the int literal 0 is converted to a double with a widening primitive conversion see 5.1.2 widening primitive conversion in the java language specification

1443761
int	boolean
one downside is that you can define only boolean floats strings or int no complex data structures

1443800
codeigniter	kohana
codeigniter or it s successor kohana

1443846
ilist	iqueryable
i am not so great with iqueryable ienumarable ilist etc

wsdl.exe	svcutil.exe
i had no problems consuming this service with .net both svcutil.exe and wsdl.exe work fine regardless of serializer used but looks like i m totally missing something obvious about serialization in java

1443866
profiler	yourkit
for analyzing heap memory you could use a profiler like yourkit and see whether the heap limit -xmx is obeyed or not

1443892
public	protected
changing the private to protected or internal or public depends on what you need should help

1443894
put	get
i think this approach worked well for me because the mac os is the bigger picture and the iphone is a subset - it helped me get context on how things had been put together

1443918
strstr	substr
why don t you just cycle over your array and check with a regular expression or strstr or substr ... search_string

1443925
getter	setter
and then override it in class b but throw an exception in getter and setter

1443942
post	get
whether you have a get or post depends on your scenario - in a get you won t have request data going out

1443954
width	height
first you have to make sure the silverlight control in your html page has a width and height of 100

1443954
width	height
remove the default width and height from the control header part where the xmlns are defined

1444016
put	get
so you need to get the image data with getimagedata and put it back with putimagedata

1444018
libxml2	libxslt
nokogiri wraps libxml2 and libxslt with a clean rubyish api that supports namespaces xpath and css3 queries

1444027
isnull	nvl
i think you are looking for left outer join and isnull nvl functions but without knowing the dialect of sql and the tables cannot be exact

1444028
switching	screens
the application requires a lot of switching between the various screens and is also graphic intensive

1444041
min	max
if you really want one either you put other constraints or use max or min

1444041
min	max
if you want just a value for text you can use max or min

1444060
inline	inlining
the compiler can inline whatever it wants in case inlining doesn t violate the code semantics and it can reach the function code

1444162
width	height
when an html element has the height and width set to zero jquery does not find the object when using a selector and specifying visible although the object is visible

1444162
width	height
the above will ignore children of #test where the width and height is zero

1444163
bazaar	svn	bazaar	git
i have used svn git and bazaar quite extensively on various different projects

1444177
yourkit	jprofiler
i also looked into yourkit and jprofiler

1444213
jdom	dom4j
i prefer dom4j personally but i don t mind other apis such as jdom or even xpp3 which has xpath support

1444224
silverstripe	kohana
i got the following error warning while tring to install kohana silverstripe

1444260
post	get
the data was retrieved when using get method but it is not when im using post method

1444298
integer	unsigned
this is less hackish since it operates on an unsigned 64-bit integer first and then extract the bytes

1444341
nullreferenceexception	argumentnullexception
in .net i would throw an argumentnullexception rather than a nullreferenceexception

1444368
wordpress	joomla
using wordpress or joomla or any other framework will require enormous emounts of custimization of the framework to meet your ends

1444379
pop-up	dialog

asp.net-mvc	html.actionlink
i m building an asp.net asp.net-mvc application using vb.net and i m trying to apply a css class to a html.actionlink using the code

1444499
bazaar	svn	bazaar	git
it s free very very easy to set up and use doesn t require a server because it can just access the local filesystem and you can find loads and loads of documentation and help if you get stuck because i think there are far more people who use svn than bazaar or git for example..

1444505
put	get
what would be nice is if i could put it in the deploy directory of the jboss server and could somehow get a reference to it

1444528
min	max
so i have this function used to calculate statistics min max std mean

1444549
nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception	nullpointerexception	runtimeexception	illegalargumentexception	runtimeexception
if you write your own exception you can force it to be caught whereas both nullpointerexception and illegalargumentexception are runtimeexception which are frowned on in some circles

1444549
nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception
as others have said illegalargumentexception is an option but i think nullpointerexception is more communicative

1444566
hide	show
now i managed only to show hide the control

1444567
min	max
you should calculate the sum of values min max and count in the first loop

1444612
for-loop	loops
if your matrix is stored as a vector of vectors then in the outer for-loop you should directly retrieve the i-th vector and then operate on that in the inner loops

1444625
centos	linux
i have now moved this functionality to a linux box running centos and on which i have installed imagemagick libxml2-devel

1444662
onclick	onmousedown
another alternative solution using onmousedown instead of onclick is provided by darwin below

1444673
mouse	keyboard
the ui user interface thread is the main thread in your application responsible for processing windows messages such as mouse clicks keyboard input repainting the screen etc

1444827
jobs	cron
we we re operating a soup-to-nuts kind of operation -- windows services cron jobs database backups web site updates etc

1444829
mvp	presenter
recently i had a task to migrate a windows application built on mvp to asp.net 1 view 1 presenter rule of thumb

1444898
daemons	systemd
then have the systemd start this daemons at startup

1444916
profiling	instrumentation
instrumentation in xcode 3.2 also now has a nice time profiling instrumentation although that s mac-only

1444916
profiling	instrumentation
i ve found that instrumentation works well for profiling but it can drop samples if the system is under heavy load

1444918
disk	ram
if yes then faulty ram hard disk page file is very possible

1444919
toolchain	binutils
during this initiation period i came across some terminologies stuff that i am not acquainted with like configure toolchain binutils etc

1444950
toolchain	binutils
your examples toolchain and binutils are not complex concepts and a simple wiki article should suffice

1444952
actionscript	mxml
yes you can use any text editor to write mxml and actionscript code and then use the command line to compile the code into a swf flash movie

1444954
ant	maven
you ll have to be able to build usually ant often maven

1444975
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i need to support ie6+ as well as modern browsers firefox google-chrome opera safari

1444991
udp	tcp
client send some messages to server using udp or tcp

1444991
udp	tcp
server must be able to support both udp and tcp

1444991
udp	tcp
in my program user client is given choice in the start to select what he want to use udp or tcp

1444991
udp	tcp
so my main problem is how can i know or differentiate in the server side if the client is sending message using tcp or udp

1445000
rss	feed
i m using rome to read and combine rss feed caching is done with ehcache in a java environment

1445005
udp	tcp
just let the tcp socket listen on port x and do the udp connections through port y

1445011
qmainwindow	qdockwidget
is it possible to turn off opaque resizing on qmainwindow qdockwidget separators

1445027
udp	tcp
before the packet reaches you you don t know whether it s udp or tcp

1445027
udp	tcp
so you want to bind to both udp and tcp sockets if you expect requests both ways

1445049
udp	tcp
when you create the socket you pass a type - sock_stream tcp or sock_dgram udp

1445058
width	height
is there a way for me to just create a shape once and then move it around on a canvas and change its width and height without all this ram usage

1445064
actionscript	mxml
mxml is an xml language that acts as a shortcut for actionscript

1445064
actionscript	mxml
you can code in mxml instead of actionscript and the compiler will convert your mxml into actionscript before compiling

1445064
actionscript	mxml
the compiler converts the mxml into actionscript classes and then compiles the actionscript classes the ones created as mxml and the ones coded natively in actionscript into bytecode

1445064
actionscript	mxml
currently you can code both actionscript and mxml -- and then compile using flex builder flash builder or the mxmlc compiler which is free

1445064
actionscript	mxml
flash csx can does not understand mxml so you it can only compile straight-forward actionscript

1445064
actionscript	mxml
note there are third-party tools such as fdt that can also be used to write and compile actionscript and mxml

1445064
actionscript	mxml
you can even use mxml to auto-generate actionscript that s not part of the flex framework your own custom classes

1445083
awt	swing
the event dispatch thread belongs to awt not swing

1445135
sorting	grouping	sorting	filtering	filtering	grouping
since it will contain everything for both filtering on field_two sorting on field_three field_four field_five useful for grouping by and making sure that field_one is not null

1445139
setinterval	settimeout
that might require falling back on setinterval or settimeout but i m uncertain of the syntax to do that

1445141
public	protected
for example technically the standard allows for shuffling the layout of members that belong to different access specifiers public protected etc.

1445182
datatrigger	eventtrigger
triggers i still get confused sometimes about where i should use datatrigger s trigger s or eventtrigger s.

1445228
keydown	keyup
do not try to get character codes for keyup and keydown events

1445228
keydown	keyup
secondly you get different sets of values in a keypress event to what you get in a keyup or keydown event

1445274
int	double
it seems that in the original example the return value from foo operator double is cast to an int and then back to a double

1445294
int	double
i guess the question is then why does the compiler choose int instead of double in the first example

1445295
hash	md5
it could be anything but i would try md5 or hmac-md5 first because they are most popular 16-byte hash algorithms

1445298
kde	gnome
i d suggest something like kde gnome firefox or eclipse

1445327
int	double
is not ambiguous the conversion from foo to int is used using your conversion function that converts to double that works because after applying the conversion function a standard conversion that converts the double to int truncation follows

1445327
int	double
in the second case since the operand has type double no such trailing conversion to int takes place and thus the result type of

1445339
antialiasing	transparent
and it seems working fine antialiasing is much better however this beats the idea of a transparent background in the process

1445390
folder	directory
try the public folder in the user profiles directory

1445407
int	double
it cannot convert item to int but it can convert item to double which it then converts to int

1445421
post	get
i ve disabled site search don t need it anyway outside this recipe area and i think i can build a simple block to get or post i always forget form data to the view

1445443
pop-up	dialog
the only drawback i see is that whenever the session is extracte notes pop-up a password dialog box

1445454
int	double
we can convert a foo since we can implicitly convert a foo to a double and thence to an int

1445512
fadein	fadeout
if i use fadeout and fadein here the .overlay disappears completely and the script thinks i ve moved my mouse out even though i m still hovering over the .overlay

1445549
firefox	safari
additionally it will be limited to only mac users with safari or firefox

1445590
stateless	stateful
put another way if this were an non-web application the stateless servlets would be objects i would delegate a task to and the stateful object would maintain the results

1445618
int	boolean
if you have registered a parameter as pdo_int but the variable holds a boolean pdo converts the bool to an int long

1445627
stdout	stderr
i have a program that writes to stdout and possibly stderr

1445627
stdout	stderr
i want to run it from python capturing the stdout and stderr

1445647
stdout	stderr
to a stdout or stderr pipe such that

1445655
put	get
this will put it in with the already defined ccharacter group so it ll get whatever highlighting that gets - in this case character

1445657
width	height
if all you re doing is changing it s offsets and adjusting it s width and height without needing to fundamentally change the structure of the shape such as rounding the corners of a rectangle of some such you should be able to just maintain a reference to the shape and adjust it s x y scalex scaley properties to effect the changes

1445688
versioning	upgrade
i have an asp.net application that i ve upgrade from versioning 1.1 visual studio 2003 to visual studio 2008 .net framework 3.5 asp.net 2.0

1445694
many-to-one	one-to-many
many-to-one associations and one-to-many obviously do not suffer from this issue

1445714
jruby	mri
for mri i always use ruby-prof but i don t think this works on jruby

1445718
mvp	presenter
i have applied the mvp pattern to my tool so that view and presenter are seperating the ui and logic

1445778
versioning	upgrade
in investigating this further and testing more options i think the best answer is to modify the product code in addition to the product versioning and author it as a major upgrade which removes the previous versioning first and then installs the new files

1445781
jobs	cron
before going to the extreme of having separate tables and running cron jobs i would make sure the simple approach is a problem when tuned correctly

1445821
executable	upx
you ll also probably want to upx your executable before you append them

1445823
mouseleave	mouseenter
in fact your solution depends on this because you can t trigger the mouseenter and mouseleave events on the overlay and still have the elements beneath clickable

1445823
mouseleave	mouseenter
the container should have the mouseenter and mouseleave actions bound to it and when the overlay fades out completely it should be hidden as well

1445827
lisp	scheme
a classic programming exercise is to write a lisp scheme interpreter in lisp scheme

1445865
libpcap	wireshark
i am stuck in converting a datetime object to a timestamp for the libpcap capture file format is also used by wireshark file format definitiom in c#

1445982
qstring	qchar
since you have mentioned qt you can try to create a qstring from the wstring and verify what chars are spaces with qchar isspace

1445987
memcpy	strcpy
of course you could always extend that to incorporate a function call to do the operation so supporting memcpy or strcpy or similar would be trivial

1445992
vim	textmate
i m trying really hard to learn vim after using textmate for the last few years

1446038
subtraction	addition
edit for a range of hours you want a timespan object which is automatically the result of addition subtraction of datetime objects

int	boolean
2. when you re performing boolean math with int

1446066
octree	quadtree
dividing the world up into a grid quadtree octree and rejecting any object that you know is within a zone that you have already determined is currently invisible or more commonly a combination of both

1446070
vim	textmate
not sure if you were referring to vim s own tabs there or pining for textmate s

1446071
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
it works perfectly in firefox but doesn t seem to do anything in ie google-chrome and safari the only other browsers i tested

1446077
lisp	scheme
lisp and or scheme

1446084
brainfuck	lolcode
lolcode and brainfuck are both small and fairly simple-esque

1446149
dmz	was
i don t remember if layer 3 and 2 were physically separated been a while but essentially layer one was fairly thin and just threw the requests over the dmz to the inside service

1446177
ocamllex	ocamlyacc
i have a parser and lexer written in ocamlyacc and ocamllex

1446206
uiview	subviews
it s useful to have the rects you want as final targets set up as subviews as a larger uiview or subclass where you expect all these related hits to occur

1446206
uiview	subviews
for example you could add the subviews as uicontrol objects which is a subclass of uiview that adds some useful methods for catching user touch events and call addtarget action forcontrolevents to specify some method to be triggered when the user does something in the rect of that uicontrol

1446308
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
it works in google-chrome firefox safari and ie8 no-compatibility

1446317
folder	directory
i want to write one of these files for each folder or some way of executing all of the folder in a directory

1446327
mouse	keyboard
is there an operating system neutral way for ruby to send keyboard and mouse events to the underlying operating system

1446353
min	max
as toaomalkster suggested choosing the min max slope is naive

1446361
jdom	xerces
you can use jdom which requires xerces saxparser

1446393
octree	quadtree
couple that with an octree or quadtree depending on whether your game is 3d 2d so you dont need to check every single game object against the frustum

1446438
for-loop	loops
i seem to recall that for-loop index variables stay in scope after loops ends

1446524
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i tested the result in ie 6 7 8 firefox 2 3 3.5 opera 9.6 10 safari for windows 3 4 and google-chrome

1446530

i ve really never used regsvr32 with .net assemblies rather i use the regasm with the codebase option

1446556
ready	each
be responsible for an orderly call methods of each module and all are called in one event ready

1446559
google-chrome	firefox
i have gone through all sorts of ideas i could come up with to make this look exactly the same in ie6-8 firefox 3.5 and google-chrome but all ideas result in the text being one or two pixels off at best

1446575
httphandler	httpmodule
the httphandler msdn will tell you a lot about httphandler and httpmodule

1446597
freebsd	linux
for example at my freebsd box i got einval and erange values and under linux the same happens where the standard referrers only to the erange errno value

ubuntu	linux
i experienced this same problem on ubuntu linux

1446712
pop-up	dialog
customize the look of dialog and pop-up screens

1446720
addclass	removeclass
i did some testing with ie ff and discovered that including the element s id in your stylesheet ul#menucnt prevents jquery from overriding that style - at least with the methods i employed toggleclass addclass removeclass etc.

1446750
versioning	upgrade
as someone who s been stuck at the older versioning of delphi and upgrade to d2010 lately i figure i still use the language rtl and vcl features from the d5 era and refrain from using these new features as the documents on those are somewhat decentralized around the blogosphere

1446793
g++	gcc
most of my gcc g++ use has been a while but i also recall using a macro to take advantage of the fact that gdb knew the members of some opaque data i had the library was compiled with debug

1446813
cpu	processors
cpu in linux use proc cpuinfo file windows check registery hkey_local_machine system currentcontrolset enum acpi search for the one with class processors

in google-chrome if i change the value to enable the next input then press tab the focus jumps like in firefox

1446832
firefox	safari
it works in safari broken in firefox 3.5.3 osx

1446841
cout	cin
i don t like having to type cout and cin unnecessarily 9 sequential times

1446849
post	get
currently dataurl generates a get but if one pulls the code from github the get can be changes to a post with no apparent side effects

1446891
ubuntu	linux
server ubuntu 7 to 9 damn small linux xp - protocol cifs samba various versions of smbclient - client same as server with no luck

1446983
firefox	safari
none of the above did the trick but here s a simple workaround to automatically focus the target element tested in firefox safari

1447055
converter	multibinding
this code fails at at startup because the values array in the converter that is called by the multibinding is not filled with booleans but have a value of dependencyproperty.unsetvalue

1447081
uiview	calayer
if all you are worried about is caching your drawing that is done for you by the calayer that backs your uiview on the iphone

1447082
put	get
projects get to control when they want to bring in new versions of libraries - the developers get to choose when they want to put in the effort of testing their code with the new version and when to take the pain of fixing any build issues the new library introduces

1447129
post	get
it s retrieving the variable from get post parameters

1447140
tunnel	vpn
if you do then you will need ssh access and a tunnel or some other sort of vpn solution

1447150
post	get
it retrieves either the submited form values post or the submitted querystring values get

1447155
post	get
to have things more explicitly you normally use for getting values from the querystring so when a get request has been done and when a post request is done

1447174
post	get
write a new method in your web framework that reads get or post

1447192
serializable	deserialization
of serializable deserialization can

1447208
yslow	pagespeed
last if you haven t looked at it one of the best tools out there is firebug and some plug-ins for it pagespeed and yslow

1447208
yslow	pagespeed
firebug s net panel can quickly give you a quick breakdown of your page load-time and pagespeed yslow can offer some good suggestions to help

1447217
vim	emacs
what tools and tricks are you aware of that can make bash perhaps in conjunction with an editor like vim or emacs a more powerful development environment to work in

1447229
jobs	cron
you can easily create cron jobs every 2 days with the second creating row

1447232
vim	emacs
plugins for vim and emacs

1447242
rational-numbers	base	rational-numbers	floating-point	floating-point	fixed-point	fixed-point	rational-numbers
by the way decimal and binary are number base while fixed-point and floating-point are mechanisms for approximating rational-numbers

1447242
floating-point	fixed-point
the two are completely orthogonal you can have floating-point decimal numbers .net s system.decimal is implemented this way and fixed-point binary numbers normal integers are just a special case of this

1447270
children	parent
for example abc001 is the parent while abc001-small and abc001-large are the simple children

1447274
bash	zsh
grails bash completion and or autocomplete grails script names in bash zsh

1447387
keydown	keyup
there are 4 events fired keydown keyup keypress and change

1447468
tabcontrol	tabitem
the converter simply creates a new collection from the tabcontrol s items collection that contains the string-ized header object from each tabitem

1447470
sequence	permutation
permutation of the initial sequence

1447486
width	height
isn t it just that width height can t be negative

1447487
spaces	delimiter
i found this class to take a spaces delimiter file and if there are multiple spaces they will be treated as a single separator

1447487
typeerror	traceback
typeerror traceback most recent call last

1447489
draggable	droppable
if you drop the draggable div into the droppable div this code will work

1447496
width	height
also i think you need to give the cells a width and height in the css

1447497
mvp	presenter
the way i did this was to use the mvp pattern to separate out the model view and presenter

1447518
nsurl	nsstring
weâ ve used elsewhere in this assignment to populate the array nsstring nsurl nsprocessinfo

1447532
converter	multibinding
the problem has nothing to do with a multibinding or your converter

1447533
spaces	delimiter
the class expects a spaces delimiter contents in the file

1447537
microchip	avr
avr is just an integrated circuit microchip made by atmel

aspose has a pdf417 encoder decoder for both .net and java but it is not open source

1447545
xsl-fo	xslt
i have an xml document that i am transforming with xslt into an xsl-fo document

1447598
uiview	calayer
coreanimation works just fine on my uiview based objects without having to use calayer

1447635
ienumerable	iqueryable
the following works fine with ienumerable types but is there any way to get something like this working with iqueryable types against a sql database

1447651
filesystems	ntfs
ntfs filesystems has junction points i think you may use them instead you can use python win32 api module for that

1447700
udp	tcp
if you don t have a special reason to use udp you could also use tcp by specifying socket.sock_stream instead of socket.sock_dgram

1447729
free	malloc
the problem that arises then is when you have to pass allocated pointers between the dll and its hosting app since most of the trouble with mixed runtimes comes from having more than one implementation of malloc and free in a process

1447729
perl	tcl
given the recent rise in popularity of dynamic languages such as lua perl tcl and python that often can be easily bound to libraries implemented in c it can also be greatly appreciated by those user communities if you can supply bindings to those languages along with binaries compiled against the local custom for choice of crt

1447733
spaces	delimiter
you are running into inadvertant use of the default spaces delimiter

1447742
children	parent
parent.objects.all i get both the parent and the children

1447796
free	realloc
if realloc fails you asked for way too much memory and it couldn t allocate that much then the original memory is not free

1447805
versioning	upgrade
running pear -v gives me versioning 1.7.2 when i run pear upgrade pear it says my versioning is newer than the current noe which is 1.9.0 if ran pear upgrade -f pear to force an upgrade it downloads the files and installs successfully but i still have versioning 1.7.2 and cannot install phpunit

1447836
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
have you looked at sorteddictionary or sortedlist

1447884
stdout	stderr
you php can read and write to stdin stdout stderr

1447922
setinterval	settimeout
the difference between setinterval and settimeout is that settimeout triggers expression only once whereas setinterval keeps triggering expression again and again unless you tell it to stop

1447930
hide	show
then after you add the segment control you can hide or show the tableview based on the state of the segment

1447933
firefox	safari
from the cursory tests it seems that some browsers firefox 3.5 and safari 4 actually put these elements into head when creating a document tree

1447993
integer	fractions
you have to first see if the integer fits in your x.y type make the equivalent fractions type and proceed

1448012
setinterval	settimeout
also the first parameter to settimeout setinterval is expected to be a function which suffers from the same problem here as your window.onload did it calls settimeout undefined 10000

1448012
setinterval	settimeout
a side note - setinterval and settimeout both allow passing strings that get eval ed at runtime but i would suggest against using that method which looks like this

1448061
post	get
to retrieve each of the key value elements of the post or get associative array and create variables with those names and values

1448085
portrait	landscape
first time then i run scene with this view this view orientation is landscape but next times is portrait i can t resolve this problem

1448102
dictionary	map
java actually uses the term map as well as dictionary -- map was added later when they realized dictionary should have been an interface but since the name was already used they had to come up with a new name.

1448108
pop-up	dialog
customize the look of dialog and pop-up screens

1448169

maven	m2e
i d suggest using maven along with the m2e plugin

1448208
subtract	add
these functions add or subtract one from the index ++ means add one and -- means subtract one

1448208
minimum	max
this function determines if you ve scrolled past the max number of slides too far down or below the minimum too far up it then sets the number appropriately to equal the maximum or minimum position

1448210
division	multiplication
at least for for the x86 platform multiplication is slow division triply so and floating point may take ages

1448250
pascal	delphi
is there any alternative to register my 64-bit dll compiled with free pascal from my 32-bit application compiled in delphi

1448254
post	get
most interactions including different http request types post vs get different encoding types or binary data allowing your app to handle each packet as it arrives hooking into http-level redirects setting a custom timeout etc

1448280
matplotlib	scipy
to get a matlab-like image processing experience with python get numpy scipy matplotlib and spyder

1448353
post	get
if i get something working i ll post it here later

1448419
freebsd	linux
that is why apple chose freebsd over linux as the kernel for osx

1448430
getter	setter
active record has setter getter methods for you

1448446
fink	macports
in general macports or fink help when there are complex libraries etc that need to be installed

1448471
salt	md5
just use something like this pseudo code sha1 salt + time + mac-addr + another salt + some other random data crc32 or md5 would also work inestead of sha1 and store it in a database and then isvalid checks the db if the key exists

1448489
getter	setter
you don t need attr_accessor as getter setter are already defined for model attributes

1448495
post	get
to make it short you do not really know about the encoding character set used on the variables that are passed to your php script via get or post especially get is a problem here

1448595
put	get
since the dataset is more or less a 1 1 copy of your database you could in theory put an orm on top of that to get objects from it - but what s the point

1448597
lisp	smalltalk
but smalltalk isn t a modern language in many ways it s a dialect of lisp so its heritage is 1950s even though it only arrived in the 1970s and the improvement is made to the implementation not the language

1448597
int	double
it s just that it s a lot of work and very error prone to wrangle a 12 double and int arguments in and out of a function in c

1448605
rss	feed
the rss feed should be formatted like any other with enclosures

google-chrome	firefox
just take a look at the sticky footer i m using on one of my sites link in sticky footer not clickable in firefox and google-chrome

1448622
google-chrome	safari
my ajaxform request is not working properly in safari and google-chrome

1448622
opera	firefox
works fine in firefox ie opera

1448645
min	max
if you get the loop overhead low enough it might make sense to do it in separate passes one to get the sum which you divide to get the mean one to get the sum of squares which you combine with the sum to get the variance and one to get the min and or max

1448673
spaces	delimiter
the following operators delimiter by spaces can be overloaded as non-member functions

1448699
button	checkbox
for instance tab button are actually checkbox

1448699
button	checkbox
however i require four modes of a list item simple text only with icon with a checkbox and with a radio button a radio button is derived from a checkbox and iradiobutton interface

1448700
submit	submission
try using an ajax based submission process that s triggered by clicking a normal button not a submit button it s really easy with jquery

1448781
versioning	upgrade
one way to go would be to develop a single module each system would install it locally and decide which versioning they wanted to use and when they would upgrade

1448782
button	checkbox
i.e. you re saying that a list item is-a checkbox while the natural state of affair is that a list item has-a checkbox and similarly for radio button

1448782
inherited	subclassing
if you re forced to operate this way by the design of the widget engine then it s not surprising that you end up with the need for multiple inherited -- but that can add its own complications and in any case subclassing leads to strong coupling and low flexibility while containment and composition are better in these regards

1448783
merb	ruby-on-rails	ramaze	merb
are the same unit testing frameworks used for different web frameworks - ruby-on-rails merb sinatra ramaze and desktop frameworks - shoes

1448804
int	chars
how can i convert a nsstring containing a number of any primitive data type int float chars unsigned int etc.

1448822
windows	wow64
your delphi programs will run on a 32 bit layer wow64 - windows on windows 64 of windows 64 bit which is close enough to the real 32 bit os that you do not need to care about it unless you work very closely with the lower system level

1448853
width	height
is there a generic way to get the height and width of a video and other metadata like the timestamp when the video was taken etc. using .net

1448856
rpm	yum
i m the one who answered the other question on systems that use rpm packages you normally use yum to install things the package is named sqlite3-devel

1448859
pugixml	rapidxml
the nicest thing about pugixml is the xpath support which tinyxml and rapidxml lack

1448859
pugixml	rapidxml
quoting rapidxml s author i would like to thank arseny kapoulkine for his work on pugixml which was an inspiration for this project and 5 - 30 faster than pugixml the fastest xml parser i know of he had tested against version 0.3 of pugixml which has reached recently version 0.42

1448859
tinyxml	xerces
low memory consumption and fragmentation the win over pugxml is 1.3 times tinyxml - 2.5 times xerces dom - 4.3 times 1

1448865
gentoo	ubuntu	gentoo	linux	ubuntu	linux
that s entirely dependent on what linux distro you re using -- is it fedora suse ubuntu gentoo mandrake or which other one out of the dozens out there

1448925
std	ostream
error declaration of c function â std ostream operator std ostream const meminfo â conflicts with| previous declaration â std ostream operator std ostream const speedinfo â here|

1448925
std	ostream
error declaration of c function â std ostream operator std ostream const analyzed_result â conflicts with previous declaration â std ostream operator std ostream const meminfo â here|

1448956
superclass	subclassing
in java is it possible to override member data in a subclassing and have that overridden version be the data used in a superclass s implementation

1448976
subtract	add
but if we do the same conceptual transformation in our head that we perform every time we add or subtract numbers we can easily rethink the above as this

1448986
jar	manifest.mf
either by modifying the manifest.mf in place or by wrapping that in another jar and specify bundle-classpath metaball.jar in the manifest

1449139
width	height
this object s shape is 3 by 3 which correspondingly 3 pixel height by 3 pixel width

1449145
opera	safari
so far only safari 4 and opera 10 seem to support it

1449154
width	height
the silverlight object tag or javascript is using a 100 height and width div which doesn t work in firefox unless all the parents have height and width set

1449154
width	height
if so you can either specify a pixel height and width or you can make sure height and width are set for all the parent elements for the silverlight object

1449154
width	height
you may be setting the height and width before they re available

1449169
post	get
it would be nice to get report for total transferred data total post requests per second time per request transfer rate and response time per request

1449201
uiview	calayer
in my benchmarks uiview and calayer provide about the same level of performance on the iphone

1449267
folder	directory
make the images folder a virtual directory

1449319
vim	emacs
vim is without a shadow of a doubt the best editor in the world come get me emacs guys

1449341
min	max
if you do this then you can shift the wave to center on the x-axis by subtracting or adding the average value and determine 1 min max values which provides an amplitude and 2 x-intercepts which provides the period

1449363
gridview	onclientclick
in the rendered html for the code below the btnedit in the gridview has the correct javascript in the onclientclick parameter onclientclick javascript webform_dopostback...

1449391
post	put
i put this together figured i d post it just in case anyone else needed an inline solution-

1449401
strtok	strcmp
i am having a bit of trouble using strtok with strcmp

1449437
virtualenv	setuptools
virtualenv comes with setuptools pre-installed i believe

1449437
virtualenv	setuptools
this should install the newest version of setuptools on your virtualenv

1449465
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
in ie 7 8 opera the 100 height of the tags is interpreted as 100 of the page where as in firefox google-chrome safari the entire table takes up the entire height of the page and instead the table rows fill in the remaining space that they are given

1449467
msg	eml
aspose.network supports accessing emails from exchange server inbox and save to file in eml or msg format

1449490
salt	md5
should i md5 the current timestamp and salt it or will php s uniqueid function be sufficient enough

1449504
hash	md5
to clarify confusion created by my naivety consistent with the comments made below md5 like most useful hash by their nature are not injective so their output is not guaranteed to be unique for all inputs

1449504
hash-collision	key
if hash-collision are an issue in this case they are using this technique will require checking after hashing whether an identical key has already been generated

1449511
memcpy	strcpy
the only way you can fill arrays is by using strcpy memcpy or similar manual copy

1449549
cgpoint	cgrect
yet when i option+click common symbols like cgrect or cgpoint i get

1449552
haskell	ocaml
ghc is a large project written in haskell and of course the ocaml compiler etc. are written in ocaml

1449566
distutils	buildout
to make it easier i created a distutils package that you can easy_install and or include in buildout

1449575
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
the following markup renders similarly against internet explorer 7 firefox 3.5.3 google-chrome 3.0.195.21 and opera 10 and last but not least safari 4.0.3

1449620
int	boolean
in particular i m unsure how best to convert an nsdictionary which might hold int strings boolean or all of the above into a format that i can then pass on to python as keyword arguments

1449622
serializable	deserialization
i ve used it on a couple of projects and it makes json serializable and deserialization a lot easier

1449642
lisp	scheme
i came from a heavy java background with lighter amounts of c++ and also some lisp scheme as you have - i ve been doing iphone application development full time since the sdk release

1449648
google-chrome	firefox
to see what i mean look at in both firefox and google-chrome

1449648
google-chrome	firefox
the difficult panel in question is title system construction area - the teal colored border in firefox sprays itself everywhere whereas in google-chrome it displays properly

1449660
google-chrome	safari
things work fine in google-chrome or safari there is no space with no some space with 1 more space with 2 etc..

1449670
maven	m2e
on newer versions of m2e you can also automatically download sources by going to window- preferences...- maven then selecting the download artifact sources option

1449702
accessor	properties
the properties and synthesize directives simply setup accessor for you instance variables so you can set them by doing self.ivar somevar

1449702
accessor	properties
to setup accessor methods on that same properties you need to do both properties and synthesize

1449740
build-helper-maven-plugin	pom.xml
if you go for pom.xml packaging you can use define the war war execution in a profile to allow you to package it but you ll need to use the build-helper-maven-plugin attach-artifact goal to attach the war to the pom.xml

1449740
jar	war
the lifecycle bindings for war packaging are listed in the introduction to the build lifecycle see the default lifecycle bindings - packaging ejb ejb3 jar par rar war section

1449750
width	height
for a 2-d array of width w and height h you can represent it as a 1-d array of length w h where each index

1449765
maven	pom.xml
in this case the dependency does exist on the central maven repository you can simply search for artifacts using the sonatype public repository btw so you can simply add this dependency to your pom.xml

1449771
getter	setter
property is the way of telling that you are going to write getter and setter kind of enforcing it but you can write getter setter without setting them property

1449771
getter	setter
synthesis will in actual implement getter and setter if you dont synthesis but you have set them property you have to implement those getter and setter by your hand

1449773
rss	feed
multiple google searches tell me how to bind a yahoo rss feed to a gridview or provide various obscure details on using directives

1449812
decimal	ieee
the latest revision of the ieee 754 2008 standard does indeed define hardware decimal floating point numbers using the representations shown in the software referenced in the question

1449812
decimal	ieee
the previous version of the standard ieee 754 1985 did not provide decimal floating point numbers

1449840
post	get
sadly when i search the web for something like libcmtd i just get post on forums from people having problems with their code

1449863
post	get
change the method of your ajax call to post instead of get

1449897
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
i have a method in a uiviewcontroller of my iphone application inside a uinavigationcontroller that is called whenever a row is selected in the table in the viewcontroller s view

1449910
nsmutablestring	nsstring
it s legal to retain an nsstring as in this example but it is often considered good practice to use copy instead of retain since an might actually point to an nsmutablestring object which may later change when your code expects it to stay the same.

1449910
getter	setter
declaring a setter and getter method in the class s interface and

1449910
getter	setter
indicating how the setter and getter behave

1449910
iboutlet	ibaction
what iboutlet and ibaction do

1449910
iboutlet	ibaction
iboutlet literally becomes an empty string when the compiler looks at it and ibaction becomes the void return value

1449910
getter	setter
with the dot notation you re calling the setter or getter if there s no afterwards and these two lines are the same

1449910
getter	setter
they can still use the getter and setter to access it if you declare a property for it

1449910
getter	setter
now when you get around to actually implementing your class synthesize says something like make sure the getter and setter get implemented for this property. it does not say implement both of these for me because the compiler is polite enough to check for your own implementation first and only fill in the pieces you ve missed

1449910
getter	setter
you don t have to use synthesize at all even if you use property out the wazoo -- you could always just provide your implementations for your setter and getter if you re into that sort of thing

1449910
getter	setter
the point here is to understand that a property declaration is really just about declaring a setter and getter method which usually corresponds to an actual instance variable -- but not always

1449975
button	checkbox
i had previously thought the implementation was for the add button to function almost as a checkbox with on and off

1449982
getter	setter
as you are using the shortcut for properties you can only access the properties through their setter and getter

1450038
activemq	rabbitmq
i ve looked into rabbitmq and activemq but i m thinking that there is a better solution for my use case

1450047
margin	height
for a quick and dirty i have updated the margin on the checkbox to 4 3 0 0 on a row height of 20

1450074
division	modulo
divide by 10 the modulo is your next digit repeat until the result of division is 0

1450129
google-chrome	safari
in every browser but safari and google-chrome the third box is 200

1450129
google-chrome	safari
in safari and google-chrome it is almost the width of my screen

1450178
width	margin
since the right margin extends almost to the right edge you get the larger outer width

1450198
onkeyup	onkeydown
you may also want to look at onkeyup and onkeydown events

1450226
freebsd	opensolaris	freebsd	linux
there may be major differences between how linux implements ld-linux and how the linkages are done under opensolaris freebsd and so on

1450254
hide	show
jquery tells the browser to show hide the loading div

1450254
hide	show
jquery tells the browser to show hide the loading div

1450254
hide	show
if i tell it to hide one element and the show it again it will simply ignore the command because the final result will be the same as do nothing.

1450257
stdout	fflush
after your final print statement you could probably call fflush stdout

1450257
stdout	fflush
to fflush stdout to the screen

1450258
stdout	fflush
you need to fflush stdout

1450258
stdout	fflush
fflush stdout should do it added after the print

1450259
stdout	fflush
try flushing fflush stdout after each print input

1450281
stdout	fflush
fflush stdout causes the buffered data to be fflush to output stream which in this case is stdout

1450306
super	extends
i have the id annotated field as part of my mappedsuperclass and i am letting all my entities extends the mappedsuperclass.now how do i override the super class id if i have to define a composite primary key for my entity...ie.how do i ask my entity to use its composite primary key annotated as embeddedid instead of the id annotated field inherited from the mappedsuperclass

1450318
multiplying	add
for example in scala you can replace the operators so now it can add or multiplying your matrix

1450318
multiplying	add	multiplying	addition
why should generics be able to do addition when it isn t obvious how to add or multiplying

1450355
pull	push
you get into the neat stuff when you want to merge your changes with other people s work with git pull and git push and related commands

1450368
perforce	cvs
version control systems like cvs subversion mercurial git perforce etc

1450368
robocopy	xcopy
examples include rsync robocopy and xcopy mir on windows

1450373
width	height
wouldn t it be nice if you could say that some text fields should be one width and height and some should be another combination

1450400
onchange	onkeyup
assign the function onkeyup and onchange to the textareas you want to reflect each other

1450416
accessor	properties
for a properties you can either provide accessor implementations yourself or ask it to synthesize accessor for an instance variable

1450417
postgresql	mysql
in rails model the object id represents the unique id from database which never can be 0 i speak for mysql maybe there are exceptions with sequences and serials in postgresql

1450420
gitignore	hgignore
hg hgignore syntax glob is the same behaviour as git s gitignore

1450425
width	margin
now set the left margin and right margin of the line which will be the button and style of the button you have created as i have mention above to the half size of the columns width and set the columnspan of the line button to 3

1450445
gtk	cairo
i have gcc installed in c programfiles also set as a path variable and i have all the necessary files for gtk from glib gtk pango atk and cairo

1450457
put	get
i need to make a down down list in the item add page but i can not find a good way to get all of the values from another table into an array to put into the page

1450532
folder	directory
if you have directory level security set perhaps only certain roles can access a specific folder in the web application that will work etc

1450579
onresume	onpause
you could save all the values you need into the preferences inside the onpause of each of the activities then restore it in the onresume

1450608
google-chrome	firefox
the traditional square-and-multiply method is much slower it uses maximum 4096 modular multiplications. doing so speeds up the modular exponentiation by a factor of 6 in firefox 3.0 and by a factor of 4 in google-chrome

1450612
apache	nginx	apache	lighttpd	nginx	lighttpd
if i plan to have a number of other dynamic content that may time some to execute involving images and the like would i be better advised to host it with say nginx over lighttpd or apache using fastcgi mod_wsgi etc

1450618
rss	feed
is it a good idea to have a website that is setup with basic functions like posting tutorials and registering or wait until to you have a rating system commenting system rss feed and much more

images libjpeg libpng libgif

1450692
zlib	libz
compression libz zlib libgzip libbz2

1450714
ws-addressing	soap
in your example that s soap ws-addressing and schema for the custom namespace myservice

1450714
ws-addressing	soap
the schemas for soap and ws-addressing are available from the url that s also used for the namespace but that s just convention not a requirement

1450726
rss	feed
also subscribe its rss feed

1450735
hash	md5
to respect the people s privacy it is recommended to always store passwords one-way encrypted with hash functions like sha-256 or md5

1450755
ftp	telnet
the first one is about policy files and the second is an example of a telnet so no ftp here client

1450777
ready	each
instead of using a selector in the usual way where for each ready channel a message can be determined and sent i d like to choose whichever connection is currently ready and send a message there

1450822
innodb	myisam
the only reason that myisam innodb might be different is that the order the rows come back could affect how sorted the data are already - myisam could give the data back in more sorted order in some cases and vice versa

1450839
versioning	upgrade
it then can manage the database and upgrade it to any versioning from any versioning

1450846
post	get

1450890
unicode	ucs
i generally use 8-bit ucs unicode transformation format which works perfect for any well most languages

1450896
allocator	stl
so my question is has anybody used this kind of allocator scheme in combination with stl would it just completely blow stl apart as i suspect

1450896
allocator	stl
i can see std list intrusive_ptr working at the intrusive_ptr level but what about the allocator of the stl list nodes themselves is there anyway to override the next prev pointers to be intrusive_ptr s themselves or am i just going to have to have a standard heap allocator along side this more dynamic one

1450976
allocator	stl
for stl containers you can customize the allocator but it still needs to return fixed raw memory pointers

1450998
rational-numbers	fractions	rational-numbers	integer	integer	fractions
the reason for the exception is that an integer does not hold rational-numbers basically fractions

1450998
int	double
the way java casts a double to an int is done by removing the part after the decimal separator by rounding towards zero

1451033
stdout	fflush
with the n in the format you don t need to fflush stdout

1451062
width	height
there are 3 blocks the right and the leftmost ones are divs containing an a element with display block fixed width height and a background image

1451062
opera	firefox
the problem with this code is that it doesn t quite work on firefox and works even worse on opera

1451086
folder	directory
i would like to do test-driven development so i need the folder structure to have a test directory

1451100
int	chars
strip the last 2 chars off your timecode turn it into an int and build your include from that

1451103
integer	unsigned
if we want to make sure that a given type is an unsigned integer we can use

1451148
jquery	scriptaculous
i ve worked with prototype scriptaculous jquery didn t enjoy that and dojo

1451161
int	double
if you are okay with external libraries you can have a look at microfloat specifically microdouble.tostring double d int length

1451256
accessor	properties
as other have mentioned this is done with properties accessor operators - and

1451257
imagemagick	minimagick
i m running windows xp and i ve got minimagick and imagemagick installed latest versions

internationalization	localization
i can t claim to be an expert in java internationalization - all of my work which cared about localization dates back to when we had to do all that by hand

1451363
rsa	aes
here s an example of using aes in c# that generates a symmetric key and iv and uses rsa with a self signed certificate to store the aes key and iv in a file

1451388
post	get
this query almost works as it will get all of information for topics that have post

1451388
post	get
i m sure that the query is inefficient and wrong since it makes two sub-selects to the post table but it was the only way i could get to the point i m at

1451399
multiplying	add
to add numbers use itertools.chain to multiplying use itertools.product

1451423
post	get
to ensure you get results for topics without post you ll need to use left join instead of join for the first join between topics and the next table

1451434
isnull	nvl
other databases have other functions for that isnull in sql server nvl in oracle etc. etc.

1451452
post	get
first get the most recent post per topic with associated user information

1451452
post	get
then get the counts of post per topic in a separate simpler query

1451463
folder	directory
i would like to set up a subdomain where the file folder is just another one in the main directory that is able to use the img folder but it doesn t work

1451576
jstl	taglib
struts provides taglib for i18n bean message but you can also use jstl fmt message

1451652
getter	setter
i would suggest using an property and synthesizing the setter getter

1451702
cvs	svn	migrate	upgrade
they migrate from cvs to svn only 2 years ago taking the obvious upgrade path

1451777
mouseleave	mouseenter

1451846
lisp	scheme
so generators in common lisp can be written in pretty much the same way as scheme generators

1451861
width	height
should create array of zero width and zero height

1451861
width	height
we re required to provide another constructor which indicates the height and width of the array

1451861
width	height
but what does he mean by create array of zero width and zero height

1451871
folder	directory
i m looking for a command that will compress every folder within a directory separately with the name of each archive reflecting the original folder name

1451888
rss	feed
i have seen other apps that do things like automatically publish rss feed to a user s profile so it does seem to be possible to have similar apps where the only interaction is a one-off install and configure

1451890
width	height
with such a default constructor the class should create an object that acts as if it has zero width and zero height

1451894
rss	feed
in a nutshell i m reading an rss feed programatically from google news

1451894
rss	feed
on my first attempt i have the urls from the rss feed and i simply follow them and scrape the html from that page

1451894
rss	feed
i don t want to write a parser for every website i come across i need the unpredictability of accepting whatever google provides through the rss feed

1451902
getter	setter
you usually punt on getter and setter or implement them as macros

1451905
qsort	bsearch
you ll find a lot of c apis such as the standard qsort 3 and bsearch 3 take function pointers as parameters

1451909
haskell	sml	haskell	ocaml	ocaml	sml
if you ve used an ml-like language sml ocaml sml and f# to some extent or haskell reference types are non-nullable

1451932
pop-up	dialog
pop-up a dialog when the app re-opens asking the user if the call went through

1451946
rss	feed
assuming the rss feed contains the opening words of the article you could use these to locate the start of the article in the dom

1451963
implements	extends
when i instantiate the class which is defined and implements in foo but extends a class bar from core in another project not a lib i get the following linking error

1451997
x86	64bit
on my system i found a .net sdk redist.txt file in programfiles microsoft.net sdk v2.0 64bit i assume the folder is called v2.0 on x86 systems

1452010
hide	show
then maybe show an example of the best method to show hide the menu div on click and how to hide it when clicked outside of the menu area

1452013
hide	show
edit ah i forgot i had applied position relative to the div.item element can you try toggling that when it show up and unset it when you hide it

1452050
width	height
so i call the helpers with a few basic parameters eg title width height and an array of data passed in from the controller and the helper does the rest

1452154
post	get
in other words in my connection didreceivedata method i have 2 paths through the code depending on whether i m handling a response from a get or post request

1452154

1452382
fadein	hide	fadein	fadeout	hide	show	hide	fadeout
would i replace the hide and show with fadein fadeout

firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
if you look at actual benchmarks there are many out there it seems like google-chrome firefox 3.x and safari are about even in terms of javascript performance ie8 lags just a bit behind and ie7 quite a bit further behind although imo ie7 is still fast enough for most things

1454226
multiplying	transpose
just a simple copy to temp and copy-back transpose as you go using pointer-stepping to avoid the multiplying in address calculation and the inner loop unrolled

children	parent
if you wish nhibernate to pick up on the changes to the relationship whenever you add children to or remove children from the parent s collection you must set on the collection

slower browsers still run at acceptable speeds but google-chrome safari and ff3.5 are extremely fast and responsive

1454882
google-chrome	safari
at the moment i would say that google-chrome and safari seem to be the fastest browser for our app but at some point it comes down to a lot more than pure js speed

1454923
versioning	upgrade
on windows you can t build phonon with a stock versioning of mingw - you need to upgrade to gcc 4.4 and apply some patches

1454926
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
obviously if your application relies on javascript to be fast for your end users you must test it on all platforms and make sure you meet rational performance targets- but a fast javascript browser eg google-chrome opera firefox 3.5 makes life a much more pleasant experience while in heavy development

1455580

1456114
appendto	each
if that s the case pushing string construction and appendto logic to a different method may be a little better since those objects would get freed up after each calling and only the memory of the returned value in this case either the string markup or nothing if the new method did the appendto would remain in memory

1456141

ilist	icollection
but as a return type for a typical data access tier a count property is often useful and i would prefer to return an icollection t with a count property or possibly ilist t if i think typical consumers will want to use an indexer

1456394
versioning	upgrade
what is your process when you decide to upgrade to the newest versioning

1456440
os.path	shutil
therefore i d say the modules os and os.path are probably the most important and also mention glob fnmatch and shutil

1456547
yacc	bison
nowadays you d use bison instead of yacc

1456550
put	get
put -1 -1 in for the xpos ypos to get it centred on the screen

1456610
spaces	delimiter
then make sure you have double-quotes around line so that a parameter isn t delimiter by spaces

1456633
portrait	landscape
the screen shows up with a landscape status bar but all the controls are still in portrait mode

1456695
integer	fractions
so that a 32bit integer will have a signed 16bit integer part and a 16bit fractions part

1456695
subtraction	addition
fixed addition and subtraction works with the built-in + and - operators and their variants

1456701

i want to get selectet item value dropdownlist1.selectedvalue.tostring from ddl and put in some variable this.ccc and after that i want to call label with the same id

1456732
cassini	iis
i ve already tried deleting temporary asp.net file but without success i m using cassini as web server did not tried iis yet

1456733
distance	polygons
assuming you have your polygons stored in some format like a list of adjacent vertices do a o n check to calculate the perimeter by iterating through them and computing the distance between each point

1456743
disk	ram
beyond a certain point all the database cares about is mapping and copying pages of data from disk to ram and back again

1456785
ironruby	ironpython
but others such as ironpython ironruby delphi prism etc are also relevant

1456891
websphere	ibm
this was the case but ibm has since release websphere application server tools edition and has donated a server adapter to the eclipse market place

1456901
maven	pom.xml	ant	maven	ant	pom.xml	maven-antrun-plugin	pom.xml
i know how to call ant targets from maven using the maven-antrun-plugin but i m not sure how to setup the pom.xml in this instance

1456901
ant	maven
i don t want maven to actually generate an artifact but i do want it to pull the artifact that was built by ant when the maven deploy goal is run

1456901
ant	pom.xml	maven-antrun-plugin	pom.xml
the pom.xml will use the maven-antrun-plugin in the package goal to call the ant target at the appropriate time to build the .war artifact

1456901
maven	pom.xml	ant	maven	ant	pom.xml
a i am creating a .war file but it is created via ant not maven so having a war packaging type in the pom.xml doesn t make sense

1456901
ant	maven
b how do i cause maven to pull the artifact from my ant output directory for the deploy goal

1456901
ant	maven
c if there are no good answers to a and b then are there ant tasks that replicate the maven deploy functionality for getting my .war artifact into the shared repository

1456906
ienumerable	iqueryable
if you use iqueryable as your return instead of ienumerable than there is no cost of doing

1456918
inherited	properties
if you are inheriting from one of these controls you should see the inherited events in the properties window

1456927
unicode	ucs
usepackage ucs unicode functionality

1456967
apache	nginx
do web frameworks and web servers apache nginx django handle these requests differently

1456976
maven	pom.xml	ant	maven	ant	pom.xml
if you specify your project with packaging pom.xml maven will not conflict with the ant build

1456986
nsbuttoncell	nsmatrix
create an nsmatrix instance set its cell prototype to an nsbuttoncell set

1457005
button	checkbox
clicking the push me button causes the checkbox to gain focus

1457005
button	checkbox
i know this because the checkbox becomes checked if you hit the spacebar after clicking the button

1457040
gcov	lcov
if you take an instrumented build of your app for a spin in the simulator then run gcov on it you can see what code was executed by using a tool like coverstory a fairly simplistic gui or lcov perl scripts to create html reports

1457040
gcov	lcov
i use gcov and lcov for chdatastructures.framework and auto-generate coverage reports after each svn commit

1457045
hash	md5
the problem is following there are two sets with elements identified by some relatively compact value uuid or md5 sha1 whatever hash sitting on different machines

1457085
button	checkbox
if i first tab-selected any element on the page not necessarily the checkbox and then clicked the button the focus highlight worked as expected

1457128
kerberos	ldap
i have a tomcat configuration that uses kerberos 5 to authenticate the user against ad server and then uses ldap to obtain roles for authorization against a security-constraint

1457128
kerberos	ldap
perhaps there is a way to access ldap to obtain roles using the kerberos ticket instead of the serviceuser servicecredential info

1457142
spaces	delimiter
this will use spaces as the delimiter and select the complement of the second field

1457153
spaces	delimiter
this takes a file considers fields delimiter by spaces and outputs the first third and following fields

1457154
nstextview	nstextstorage	nstextstorage	nstextattachment
you will need to create a custom nstextattachment for each token and insert it into the nstextstorage for your nstextview

1457167
post	get
you shouldnâ t use them because you cannot distinguish the source of that variable values since they can come from any source of the egpcs variables environment get post cookie server

1457168

but i have no idea what conditions to put to get correct date

1457213
min	max
maybe some max or min functions can be put there but i have no idea

1457237
width	height
you should be able to use skin code like this skinwidth and skinheight are exposed inside the graphicborderskin so you don t need to override updatedisplaylist and specify additional local variables for width and height

1457237
width	height
and for the canvas you need to specify a width and height setting for it to draw

1457248
pull	push
will i have to add mojombo s repo as a remote to my project and then pull it in merge resolve conflicts and then push to my forked project on github

1457306
set	bag
i have a set of documents that are each basically a small bag of arbitrary words

1457319
postgresql	mysql
it seems that each server implementation postgresql mysql etc. offers api libraries for various languages my code is in c and c++ though solutions for java and python would also interest me

1457326
ant	maven
ant if you use maven it s arguably

1457347
solaris	aix
according to those tests only aix and solaris completely passed a thread-stress-test

1457360
versioning	upgrade
i m thinking start the msi and if the installer versioning is too low then upgrade it and use a customaction return asyncnowait to run the newly installed versioning on the same msi

1457393
rss	feed
it sounds like you are saying that you will be getting a bunch of links from somewhere rss feed content or something

1457479
pbx	ivr
the company i work for is looking for an ivr implementation that is highly compatible with any potential pbx ivr or pbx combo or to provide our own hosting solution

1457500
msdn	wfp
in earlier versions of windows you need to use filter drivers the linked to msdn page mentions what technologies wfp replaces.

1457515
cassini	iis
you can always create a website or webapplication that runs through cassini instead and provide a folder path vs a iis path

1457530
libpcap	wireshark
not sure if it s before the o s but have a look at wireshark and the library it uses libpcap

1457547
src	attr
i have the following script and i can t find out how to use the value inside car 0 img inside this #img2 attr src car 0 img

1457550
pbx	ivr
can you narrow down what any potential pbx ivr or pbx combo means

1457586
nerdtree	fuzzyfinder
i use a combination of nerdtree directory sidebar fuzzyfinder textmate go-to-file like textmate s cmd+t and sessions h sessions to help me deal with large projects

1457607
rss	feed
i m parsing an rss feed and each entry has a timestamp such as this 2009-09-21t21 24 43+04 00

1457634
folder	directory
it says that you have to create a folder with your test-case m-files in it then make that your working directory using cd

1457692
mouseover	mouseout
it ll give you greater control of the behaviour of the mouseover mouseout events by configuration

1457717
subtract	add
to do it around a point you have to subtract the center value first making that reference point the center origin then apply the matrix and add the original center position back

1457766
hide	show
the best way to accomplish the effect that you are looking for would be to arrange hide show any objects that you don t want to be visible in a fullscreenevent.full_screen event handler

1457766
width	height
if the scalemode property is set to noscale while the application transitions to full-screen mode the stage width and height properties are updated and the stage the resize event

1457813
onchange	onblur
i am curious how i bind an onchange or onblur event to the input box that this combobox uses

1457849
google-chrome	safari
when an html element is focused currently selected tabbed in to many browsers at least safari and google-chrome will put a blue border around it

1457893
sorting	filtering
fwiw i find that code more difficult to understand than a simple call to datatable.select which also allows filtering as well as sorting by parent or child tables if needed

1457894
rss	feed
libxml since rss feed are just xml

1457900
subtract	addition
instead i had to subtract the lower value from the initial addition to compensate

1457930
cout	cin
however i don t understand why you still want the cout to go ahead - if the cin call didn t succeed you will only be printing the old contents of the string - you do not clear it anywhere unless you do so in other code which you haven t posted here

1457935
yacc	bison
the problem with grouping them like that is that you lose the precedences on the rules -- you only have one rule that has different precedence depending on which mathop it is which bison yacc cannot handle

1457958
ant	maven
you can actually wrap an ant project with maven by using multiple ant run goals as i wrote in a different question

1457958
ant	maven
assuming your existing ant project has clean and build tasks this might be a useful way of wrapping the project so you can use maven goals and have it map to existing ant code

1457959
folder	dir
i have a number of gifs in a folder on my web server dir subdir bla.gif etc

1458088
put	get
i know that i can put them in a cell array and get 90 of what i need

1458166
mp4	h.264
iam writing an application which will do conversion from avi to mpeg wmv to avi wmv to mpeg or h.264 avc video avi to mp4 rmvb to 3gp etc

1458223
formview	detailsview
if you are really after binding a single record and you don t want to go the simple route of just using 2 methods that set get values from the controls you can use a formview full control or a detailsview table layout yet you can have custom html

1458223
formview	detailsview
i used formview and detailsview for some time in some projects

1458225
rss	feed
i m writing an app that retrieves rss feed on a scheduled daily basis and saves the contents of each feed as xml data in a sql server 2005 database

1458236
rss	feed
personally i m a lot more comfortable in c# than in t-sql so i d do it in linq to xml and indeed i ve done exactly that for an rss feed before now

1458240
komodo	notepad++
i ve heard people reference komodo intellij idea as good solutions but i ve always just used notepad++

1458249
post	get
then when the user taps on a row get the array of post associated with the selected category and pass that to a new view controller

1458277
superclass	subclassing
you could set the subclassing to be superior to the superclass see discussion above such that concatenating objects of the two classes will always cause the superclass objects to be converted to the subclassing

1458300
mbunit	mstest
i like it but it seems that unlike mstest or mbunit etc.

1458332
ironruby	ironpython
what are your thoughts on using ironpython or ironruby at the viewmodel and model layers in mvvm apps compared to c#

1458339
width	height
i want to know how to control all property of gridview from the css.......like column width height

1458384
width	height
you can specify height and width in settings to set the textbox to specific height and width

1458403
httphandler	httpmodule
generally i would say an httphandler and turning off the httpmodule you don t need should be a very effective solution

1458417
division	subtract
the clever parts seems to be that they are only using the division operation for the first digit a1 and avoid having to use the other a x s in the same way by applying them in the next step by subtract their product against the partial quotient from the interim remainder

1458417
division	subtraction
this allows greater flexibility in the timing of the application of each digit to the operation like for instance deferring the application of the secondary digits of the divisor a x 1 until after a partial quotient is created from the prior step s division by a 1 which in turn allows them to be applied as a product subtraction rather than a division operation

1458423
post	get
please note i dont have any design page aspx page where i can use form tag and get post method

1458452
worldwind	jogl
there is a large and active jogl community in nasa worldwind - a very neat jogl based app

1458525
actionscript	mxml
i have written a blog entry on how to setup eclipse + axdt + flex sdk to prepare your mxml actionscript as3 development environment on linux

1458526
int	chars
given that you could use the hexadecimal representation of an int which gives you a 8 chars string

1458549
cvs	svn
that means branches are emulated through tags for cvs directory copies for svn

1458551
min	max
i ve read a number of posts recommending the use of min and max so i tried

1458575
imagemagick	magick++
some people in our office are using magick++ an imagemagick library to make screenshots

1458579
hide	show
basically i was changing a class on a parent element to hide some elements and show others

1458593
subtraction	addition
with 16 byte alignment it can be used directly with simd load instructions where you d load it up into a 128 bit registers that allows addition subtraction dot products and all manner of vector operations

1458627
hide	show
it seems that the simplest way to do that is to create two uitableviews for each purpose and show hide them according to segmented control value

1458670
centos	linux
i have linux centos 5.3

1458716
decoder	encoder
write your own encoder and decoder which can be very simple like return __dict__

1458750
jvisualvm	jstat
the tooling provided with the jdk jstat jconsole jvisualvm is much more reliable

1458761
postgresql	mysql
among the paid generic alternatives i ve liked ems tools which has a version for sql server mysql postgresql and firebird and dezign which supports 12 databases

1458767
post	get
the page correctly redirects but instead of the response having a get as the request.httpmethod it has a post instead

1458884
implements	extends
back2dos has mentioned the approach you should use what i did was extends the movieclip class and implements all kinds of functions that i use on daily basis but are not part of the movieclip class

1458885
dictionary	map
why not go with a dictionary map type whatever java calls it nowadays i think it used to be hashtable

1458896
freebsd	linux
linux and freebsd would have been much more popular if it wasn t for all those pirated windows versions that are roaming around

1458906
google-chrome	firefox
the problem is that in firefox and google-chrome it orders the first column when clicked by url not the content of the link

1458963
bazaar	git
maybe it helps but bazaar and mercurial are both using dulwich for their git interoperability

1458988
post	get
have you tried switching post for get

1459006
hex	binary
i m searching for a python compatible method in c# to convert hex to binary

1459013
width	height
an example in the api can be found at css height and width height val

1459048
pop-up	dialog
the code is very simple below and i find when file.copy throws exception path not valid no permission etc. the service will crash and pop-up a dialog to let me debug

1459048
pop-up	dialog
why my service crashes and the debug dialog pop-up

1459050
hex	binary
but it s very easy to convert hex to binary byte by byte well nibble by nibble actually

1459135
int	boolean
but i also need to send int boolean and floats with json and can not find a way to do this in the same way

1459145
post	get
if i get time i ll edit this post so that it works but that will have to wait until this evening

1459155
treemap	treeset
for a start the treeset and treemap in the runtime are red-black-tree implementations

1459211
post	get
am i correct in believing that if i use a get request instead of post the behavior will change to being a synchronous request the execution will wait until the response has been received from the server

1459241
post	get
to answer your first point no get and post are independent of synchronous asynchronous

1459265
innodb	myisam
how can i get hibernate using jpa to create mysql innodb tables instead of myisam

1459321
opera	firefox
i use this code below but it isn t works on firefox and opera browser

1459339
width	height
but that gave problems with certain images in the content that have no set height and width

1459351
pull	push
anyway the obvious way to do this assuming you haven t tried to force the push is to pull first

1459354
exif	xmp
the xmp block is in a 0xffe1 jpeg section the same as exif

1459354
exif	xmp
i did an experiment with one image saving it in two different color profiles and besides the changes in xmp and exif i noticed that there is probably a whole new jpeg section

1459354
exif	xmp
i would say that the information in exif and xmp are just metadata and that the important thing is the presence of the icc_profile section

1459374
rss	feed
the easiest way is to consume your wordpress rss feed

1459389
min	max
each pool is configured with min max open connections fact is that it will usually use 99 of the time 50 of the min number 2-3 in case of 5 min if it is using more that that this pool is mis-configured since it is opening and closing connections all the time expensive .

1459426
freemarker	velocity
velocity or freemarker

1459439
cck	ubercart
you can use cck to add fields to ubercart products as per florianh s solution but you also get things like a shopping cart and checkout for free

1459446
width	height
as a side note i find it a bit strange that your bitmap is being set to a constant height of 200 -- the normal thing would be to make the height of the bitmap equal to the height of the window as is done for the width

1459492
windows	wow64
it can run on a 64bit windows though through wow64 just as any other 32-bit process can use

1459492
mouse	keyboard
the project has a windows hook dll as well to hook keyboard mouse and other windows messages on the host

1459531
disk	ram
i d look at it from the hardware perspective ram and hard disk

1459535
opera	firefox
firefox 2+ opera 9+ msie 7

1459702
pull	push
what i would like to do is when there is a push to github i would ping my application using a webhook and i want my application to run git pull to retrieve changes

1459783
salt	md5
then calculate the passwords md5 with salt

1459783
kerberos	ldap
other topics which you might look at are kerberos ldap services but those are hard topics

1459889
translation	localization
so i created a folder named localization under content and then i create resources resx files for each language i want to translation

1459902
hash	md5
i played it safe by storing the user passwords as md5 hash

1459902
hash	md5	hash	salt	salt	md5
i should have salt the md5 hash - because it s currently possible to decode unsalted md5 hash using rainbow tables

1459923
salt	md5
decode the passwords yourself and re-encode them with a salt i recommend something a little more fancy than md5

1459923
hash	md5
although md5 is a hash and should not be decodable it can be broken using rainbow tables with probability almost one you can find a unique here s the probability string of at most say 20 characters with a given hash especially if your character set is limited say to alphanumeric

1459930
hash	salt
this will create an undecryptable hash thats salt with unique informations

1459930
hash	salt
note the userid was only picked so a unique salt for each double hash exists.

1459937
hash	md5	hash	salt	salt	md5
add a piece of code so that when someone logs in it does the normal process computes the md5 sum of the password and checks it against the stored hash and if that succeeds recompute a salt version of the hash from the clear-text password they entered and store it in the password file

1459937
salt	md5
the only wrinkle is that you ll need to add an indicator for whether each md5 is salt or not since you ll have a mix of both for a while

1459940
hash	salt
just calculate another hash from the current hash together with a salt

1459944
ant	maven
if you can t do that you could use the maven 1 ant plugin to copy the war to tomcat s webapps directory after it has been packaged

1460005
ant	maven
the point is you generally want to clean the work directory and the webapps directory and the maven 1 ant plugin does not do this as far as i know if and read from the link provided

1460010
rtp	rtsp
i m looking for a rtp rtsp library in c++

1460068
hash	salt
salt the original hash as mentioned by others

1460068
hash	salt
if someone already has a copy of your db and you rehash the same passwords with salt the rehash the old hash with salt will not work

1460085
google-chrome	firefox
when i click on the file to be downloaded in firefox or google-chrome it works fine and saves the file on to disk

1460117
vbscript	jscript
this works on jscript and vbscript activescripting host but some others scripting host does not return anything on codeobject so this is not very portable

1460122
dictionary	map
the list of built-in types in c# is quite short and not very likely to change so i think having a dictionary or a big switch statement to map these shouldn t be difficult to maintain

1460130
subtraction	addition
various subtraction -and addition methods

1460151
subtraction	addition
there are some interesting datetime extension methods especially for addition subtraction in this post post your extension goodies for c# .net

1460160
post	get
in the action to which you post you could simply prepare the get url and then redirect to this url

1460172
ubuntu	linux
typically on an ubuntu linux server it would be under something like etc apache2 apache2.conf

1460193
folder	directory
i see the bom in the library reciepts boms directory but there is no app folder with the app bundle

1460206
wav	riff
also reading wav file headers is a relatively complicated task you have to search for riff chunks and so on but writing them is cake you just fill out a header structure and write it at the beginning of the file

1460215
post	put
when i come in with a post the values i put in my form are properly mapped to these parameters

1460215
post	get
as soon as i change the method of the form from get to post everything works out fine

1460248
free	malloc
my definition of free memory is that malloc starts failing when this hits zero

1460330
stdout	stderr
i m not a java person but rather a unix one and one thing seems obvious the buffer on either stdout or stderr is filling up and then curl is blocking

1460375
mouse	keyboard
perhaps not the intended use but provides a javascript site analytics tools that can record all user mouse keyboard activity that you could correlate to the web app logs

1460443
folder	directory
the following regexp will copy all jars in the jars directory to jars_out mapping folder file .jar to folder _ file .jar

1460545
innodb	myisam
this is much more of a concern if it s a myisam table where an insert locks the table than if it s an innodb table

1460588
inherited	properties
put a constraint on your generic type define that t should inherited some kind of interface in which those properties are defined

1460614
put	get
this wouldn t normally be a get but a put

1460649
google-chrome	firefox
it worked in internet explorer but failed in firefox and google-chrome

1460694
opera	firefox
in firefox and opera the drop down menu works fine

1460697
onclick	onsubmit
or you want in javascript onsubmit or onclick and other event handling get checked radiobutton value at jquery

1460705
super	extends	superclass	subclassing
with super and extends to specify a parameter to be one that is a superclass or subclassing of a given class

1460769
button	checkbox
i don t need to show the eula checkbox during update and i also need to replace the create my account submit button text to something more appropriate when doing an update

1460820
subtract	add
the slowest thing you can do in math operations for as3 is repetitive casting feeding ints to a function that returns a number or performing basic operations like add and subtract on number instead of int

1460924
jboss	glassfish
tomcat jboss glassfish

1460925
stdout	stderr
stdout stderr operations will be

1460982
put	get
i got a simple answer i juste put my records that i wanted to insert in a dataset without any pk id and outside my dataflow i do a foreach loop that get foreach record a new pk id and insert it one by one

1461016
srp	principles
and second - if i move all methods that access file system to a single interface it will violate srp principles because serializing deserializing datasets and reading data formats from a file seems to be different responsibilities correct

1461020
tcpdf	fpdf
however outputting to excel and pdf complicate things and require the use of fpdf or tcpdf and phpexcel

1461020
tcpdf	fpdf
pdf - fpdf tcpdf

put	get
in this case just try to put the generation into the msbuild script to get rid of the dependency thing unless visual studio accepts a reference to a solution-internal non-.net-com project

1461062
firefox	safari
i need to support ie7+ firefox and safari

1461099
int	chars
using int for ip addresses instead of chars 15 is a common optimization

1461150
put	get
under this scenario the put would succeed on the server return a 200 but the client would get an application json representation

1461156
put	get
before you hire your first qa person the product manager should put on the qa hat and be able to define the requirements and get things going with an initial test framework

1461284
post	get
these actions generally respond to http get and post requests

1461325
put	get
a restful or at least http-embracing client will know not to update its current page and that it will have to do a get in order to refresh its view of the just- put resource

1461329
hide	show
in your rowdatabound event you can hide or show the button in it

1461334

note that there are multiple places where you can find ant in maven s public repository

1461340
width	height
i m required to write a function to overload the operator to compare width height and colour

1461355
charindex	substr
a combination of charindex and substr should work for you

1461376
vsto	add-in
i m working on an excel add-in vsto in .net that connects to an oracle 10g database

1461376
x86	64bit
i m running on vista x64 and have figured out that i need both the x86 and x64 oracle clients installed on my machine so that both 32 bit processes like pl sql developer and 64bit processes like an example .net console app compiled for any cpu can connect to oracle

1461387
int	chars
unicode a mapping of chars to int code points in the range 0 through 1 114 111

1461387
int	chars
codepages a system in dos and windows whereby chars are assigned to int and an associated encoding

1461387
int	chars
ascii a very common assignment of chars to int and the direct encoding into bytes all high bit clear

1461403
spaces	delimiter
classic issue - call powershell functions just like you call powershell cmdlets - with spaces delimiter and no parens

1461446
next	except
create a tempwork table with the same exact structure as the final destination table except make the pk an identity n 1 where n is the next value based on the final destination table s pk

1461451
bash	tcsh	bash	zsh	zsh	tcsh
you could also download source code for virtually any shell such as bash tcsh zsh etc

1461460
put	get
after a big of googling my working theory is that the soap issue caused my users to get errors which caused them to make more requests which put an increased load on the application

1461535
post	get
then you ll need to create a new httpwebrequest this time a regular get request not a post for that url

1461560
min	max
there we have two columns min and max

1461560
min	max
the rule is min can t be greater or equal to max

1461584
getdate	dateadd

1461598
getter	setter
please forgive the length but here are two programs both the exact same but one with and one without setter getter and constructors

1461598
getter	setter
and now for the one without setter and getter

1461637
getter	setter
getter and setter is to provide encapsulation aka information hiding

1461662
getter	setter
the point of getter and setter regardless of language is to hide the underlying variable

1461662
getter	setter
this cannot be enforced if the field is publicly accessible and modifyable - you need the getter and setter

1461662
getter	setter
writing the getter and setter now means the interface is kept consistent so existing code won t break when you change it

1461671
getter	setter
consider how you would access public data without getter and setter

1461671
getter	setter
if you just use getter and setter from the start only where they are needed you can avoid that effort and only change your code in one place

1461675
int	chars
i believe it was one of the early pdp machines in which a chars was larger than an int

1461675
int	chars
so the system would pack multiple 9bit chars into a single int so a chars contained the address in the format of int offset inside the int

1461677
getter	setter
without the getter setter you d have to change every code everywhere that acccesses a

1461677
getter	setter
milage with the getter setter you pretty much in a perfect world atleast just have to change the creation of a milage type

1461695
cos	sin
d acos sin x1 sin x2 +cos x1 cos x2 cos y2-y1 r

1461708
getter	setter
using getter and setter gives you the flexibility to change the implementation later

1461710
vim	bbedit
i don t use bbedit but in vim you can do this

1461710
post	get	vim	bbedit
if you post this to the google group vim_use and ask for a vim solution and the corresponding perl version of it you would probably get a bunch of suggestions and something that works in bbedit and then also outside any editor in perl

opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
in opera firefox google-chrome safari everything is fine but ie6 doesn t show images

1461872
packets	multicast
it seems that if i set any of the upper 16 bits of the 112-bit group id field then macos x will no longer accept those multicast packets

1461872
packets	multicast
in the doesn t work cases wireshark running on the mac shows that the mac has received the multicast packets but those packets are never passed on to the receiving application s on the mac

1461945
mp3	wav
i m interested in learning about and writing a system that will extract features from audio files mp3 wav etc which can later be used for whatever purpose

1461973
rss	feed
i m not sure about this but rss atom feed readers would use head over get to ascertain if the contents of the feed have changed

1461992
integer	unsigned
when stored as an unsigned integer a number can be expressed as the sum of powers of 2 2 0 + 2 1 +2 2 + 2 4 etc

1461992
integer	unsigned
the binary version of the unsigned integer looks like a truth map of sorts for every place there s a 1 in the binary number add that power of two to the number

1461992
integer	unsigned
so if you start at the right most digit in the binary representation of the unsigned integer and move left each digit represents a power of two

1461992
integer	unsigned
therefore to determine if a number of this format unsigned integer is odd you need only see if the right most bit is 1

1461992
integer	unsigned
the operation performed on the unsigned integer is a logical and operation

1461992
integer	unsigned
so the operation will cause all binary digits in the unsigned integer representation to be 0 except for the binary digit representing 2 0 which is 1

1461992
integer	unsigned
so the unsigned integer binary representation will boil down to 0x00000001 if it s odd and 0x00000000 if it s even

1461992
integer	unsigned
written out in binary the resulting possible unsigned integer binary representations after and ing the unsigned integer are

1462018
int	chars
it seems nhibernate is convering my chars to an int somewhere along the way

1462030
button	checkbox
i am dynamically inserting controls textboxes checkbox expression validators and button on to my page

1462037
profiling	benchmarking
use as many placeholders as you feel you need go benchmarking profiling the page code then finally optimise accordingly using whatever technique is most suitable

1462056
trie	tree
a patricia trie is like a regular tree except that branches in a patricia trie occur only when there are at least two different keys sharing a prefix that haven t been separated by a previous branch

1462056
children	parent
all children of a node share the parent s prefix

1462115
post	get
javascript disabled i get access to the following post variables

1462157
gridview	linqdatasource
i m using a gridview and a linqdatasource to view the categories table

1462222
post	get
naturally you can t make a post request using a script element the browser would fetch the result using get

1462254
required	placeholder
first of all placeholder themselves are an extremely lightweight control that generate no additional markup and required very little processing by asp.net

1462291
gif	bmp
bmp and gif formats

i want to use the ruby-way of data access that i ve come to love from products such as activerecord datamapper and sequel

1462354
django-haystack	django-sphinx
there are projects for both search frameworks that integrate them with django django-haystack and django-sphinx respectively

1462375
pem	pkcs#12
pkcs#12 certificate is stored in binary format while pem certificate is an ascii file which can be opened and viewed in a text editor

1462375
pem	pkcs#12
how can i convert a pem ceritificate of the form below to a pkcs#12 certificate programmatically

1462375
pem	pkcs#12
now i have read a pkcs#12 file and i want to convert the pkcs#12 data into a pem format again using a .net program

1462395
sys.path	argparse
as kevin horn pointed out you can use argparse installable via easy_install argparse or just grab argparse.py and put it anywhere in your sys.path

1462424
getter	setter
accessor methods setter and getter attempt to hide the details about how the data in an object is stored

1462424
tiff	png
it is time consuming to abstract the type from the specific png jpeg tiff eps to the general image document spreadsheet

1462443
int	boolean
you can use bitvector32 to manipulate bits in a 32 bit int and bitarray to have an array of bits representing a set of boolean variables

1462451
google-chrome	firefox
this worked for me in firefox and google-chrome and ie8.

1462455
getter	setter
yes all those getter and setter bloat the code and add no value in that case

1462455
getter	setter
characteristics of useful sensible uses of getter and setter

1462455
getter	setter
getter and setter only for fields for which they re actually needed - as few as possible most fields should be private and used only within their class

1462455
getter	setter
getter and setter that actually do something besides accessing a fied setter that throw exceptions for invalid values or update a last modified timestamp or a getter that computes a value on the fly rather than relying on an underlying field

1462468
versioning	upgrade
does it make sense when writing an upgrade script from one versioning of a schema to another to make use of these constraint names

1462494
post	get
sounds like you are looking to do a post redirect get

1462494
post	get
the two main advantages of redirecting a post to a get request are

1462496

portrait	landscape
i ve used this page layout successfully for iphone landscape and portrait

1462572
inherited	properties
one way to do this is to create a new class that inherited treenode and that features an enabled properties

1462577
pecl	pear
the difference being that pear packages a sets of classes written in php while pecl extensions are generally written in c and loaded as.

1462581
put	get
i m not sure why but whenever i put that line in my script i get blank screen

1462618

1462644
stdout	stderr
so my question is how might i capture stdout and or stderr from the net start command when run via runas

1462733
octree	quadtree
this visibility culling can be accelerated using a variety of data structures octree quadtree sphere trees bsp trees generally more suited to less open environments rather than landscapes etc

1462733
children	parent
some hierarchical organization of your scene will again help with occlusion culling as if a parent object is occluded you can skip tests for it s children

1462735
getter	setter
the other answers generally give a good idea of some reasons for using getter and setter but i want to give a somewhat complete example of why they are useful

1462735
getter	setter
initially you decide to store it as a string with no getter and setter

1462735
getter	setter
here are some issues with not using getter and setter

1462735
getter	setter
how getter and setter solve this

1462739
put	get
if you re committed to making it work then put some serious thought into the root of the problems you re having and get him on board with helping you solve them

1462774
move	drag
since i haven t added a handle i want the hole content of the div to drag it when you use de scroll bar the div move draggs..

1462782
postgresql	mysql
mysql does not support create domain or create type as for example postgresql does

1462788
explode	implode
implode is explode s counterpart to go from array back to string

1462797
accessor	ivar
also if you have an nsmutablearray ivar somemutablearray and you return in a kvc accessor method it can mess up kvo

1462805
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
add a div inside your div width height 100 no margin no padding and put your content there

1462811
hide	show
if you hide reshow the window after calling setwindowlong it then show in the taskbar

1462837
int	chars
the key is that chars is an int type which is why you can switch on a chars so you can use numeric comparison operators

1462887
nullreferenceexception	argumentnullexception
so nullreferenceexception argumentnullexception and the like shouldn t be caught unless they re due to a nasty api which sometimes throws exceptions which you can handle but which shouldn t really be being thrown in the first place

1462919
google-chrome	firefox
in case this matters i tried the form in various browsers ie8 ie7 ie6 firefox 3.5 google-chrome with similar results each time

1462974
bash	zsh
to delete them with some bash zsh magic

1462986
folder	directory
unfortunately itunes won t tell you where its download folder is so i ve written a function that grabs the filepath of a few podcast tracks and climbs back up the directory tree until it finds the downloads directory

1463018
ubuntu	linux
i have a large several gb berkeley db that i am thinking of migrating from windows 2k to linux either redhat or ubuntu

1463023
disk	ram
more ram will help as will using solid state disk

1463028
equals	compareto
you need to be rather careful with caching results of methods like compareto and equals

1463028
equals	compareto
if i was doing this i d first profile the application to determine if the compareto and equals methods are really bottlenecks

1463080
min	max
for example sum min max count last etc .

1463101
width	height
i wrapped both within another div and gave it a set width and height

1463142
opera	firefox
is it possible to rotate text by 90â clockwise or counter-clockwise using only css and compatible with ie6+ firefox 2 and opera

1463184
width	height
d3dxcreatetexturefromfileex allows you to specify flags that prevent any internal conversions happening d3dx_default_nonpow2 for image width and height if your hardware supports non power of two textures d3dfmt_from_file to prevent mipmap generation or format conversion d3dx_filter_none to prevent any filtering or scaling

1463254
clang	llvm
clang llvm has much better separation between the parser and the other parts of the compiler chain

apache	nginx	apache	lighttpd	nginx	lighttpd
i m curious to know what are the performance impacts of using http basic auth on a webserver like apache or lighttpd or nginx

1463310
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
the page works perfectly fine in firefox google-chrome and safari with not speed issues sluggishness whatsoever

1463339
comparator	comparable
if the set contains custom classes you have to implement hashcode to use hashset although effective java shows how but if you use a treeset you have to make it comparable or supply a comparator

1463339
treemap	treeset
i have sometimes used treeset or actually treemap for very small sets maps 10 items although i have not checked to see if there is any real gain in doing so

1463401
interpolation	splines
you can also use splines to interpolation - just search in wikipedia

1463416
jsf	seam
if you just go for bookmarkable you still have to carefully design how you link things together in your jsf pages and flows although seam 2.2 added some features to make this easier

1463423
submit	submission
i m using this jquery validation script to submit my form s but i need some help tweaking it to display the message and to show the form again after submission

1463425
getter	setter
and the habit of making the getter and setter the same function is confusing and here results in the bug.

1463468
post	get
please see my blog post to learn what it s about and where to get it

1463487
int	chars
in cobol you had to declare variables such that you actually had to say how many digits there were in a number year 99 declared the variable year such that it could only hold two decimal digits so yes it was an easier to make that mistake than in c were you would have int or short or chars as the year and still have plenty of room for years greater than 99

1463510
daemons	launchd
how can i launchd a cherrypy app as a daemons and forget about it

1463532
hide	show
can you not simply show it and then hide the original

1463550
min	max
you can use functions like max min and sum on fields to get a merged view when using group by

1463556
client-side	server-side
this could be performed either client-side less advantageous or server-side a better pick

1463566
versioning	upgrade
it may require a versioning upgrade though

1463637
stateless	stateful
our project uses the wicket web framework which allows stateful or stateless interaction

1463637
stateless	stateful
anything that s possible in a stateful application could also be implemented as stateless - you simply have to store the state on the client and submit all relevant state information on every request

1463639
post	get
if anyone finds a way to get this working without resorting to exdate please post and i ll be sure to check back periodically and mark the correct answer

hash	md5
if it matters the cached file is an md5 hash off a key value in the links table

1463746
post	put
that snippet of code apart from customizations i put in for my own app came from this post on ruby-forum.com

1463756
lapply	tapply
i m really surprised no one has posted about apply tapply lapply and sapply

1463756
do.call	tapply	do.call	lapply	lapply	tapply
remember use apply sapply lapply tapply and do.call

1463776
folder	directory
each application has to have their own folder and virtual directory and a web.config specific to only that application

1463778
width	height
resizing to a particular height and or width maintaining aspect ratio is far more common and expected by users

1463778
width	height
the ratio needs to be the square root of the file size ratios as you re applying it twice once to height once to width

1463793
post	get
you could use the post redirect get approach depending on how your application works to ensure users always land on a get after submitting their form so you always have a valid state to go back to

1463812
mvp	presenter
it s mvp wherein the presenter is a mediator

1463945
swt	swing
i ve personally ended up using swing swt + jruby

1464018
post	get
since the screens would have a get and post action with post returning a view if there was a validation error we d be duplicating code and making viewmodels larger than they probably should be

webrat	cucumber
i am learning cucumber and webrat with rails and would like some advice on the best way to test an edit form

1464118
folder	directory
i created an extensions folder in my eclipse directory and dropped it in there

1464168
vim	emacs
better integration wrt the motley collection of plugins for powerful-but-not-ide editors such as vim and emacs

1464168
vim	emacs
- and i stand in awe of my emacs er colleagues have to ack that no matter how incredibly powerful vim is emacs is a notch above

1464188
pull	push
and i want to be able to update them via git push or git pull

1464198
unsigned	short
for example even though unsigned short and wchar_t are the same size on windows i think using wchar_t instead of unsigned short shows the intention that you will use it to store a wide character rather than just some arbitrary number

1464216
post	get
you would probably get better mileage by getting a good working set of instructions on how to configure https w a self signed certs and then create your own internal post test pages

1464230
128bit	64bit
perhaps 128bit distributed-system internet-wide pointers but no more than 64bit in a system call or perhaps even a legacy 32-bit limit

1464238
daemons	systemd
this number is liable to increase and decrease depending on the virtual memory demands of the systemd services daemons and applications running on the machine

1464267
hash	md5
in the old days the last time i wrote code for this i could just store previous md5 hash and compare new ones to that list

1464267
hash	salt
well now that i am using salt hash where the salt is unique each time those comparisons are no longer possible as the previous salt are no longer known

1464267
hash	salt
to make that system work i have two choices store a history of the salt in addition to the final hash or reuse the same salt for any one given user with each password update

1464274
hash	salt
reusing the same salt means that if a user is explicitly targeted by a hacker they could produce a password to hash dictionary using the user s salt - so that even if the user changes their password the hacker will still immediately know the new password without any extra work

1464274
hash	md5	hash	salt	salt	md5
as for storing the md5 hash plus salt - presumably you re already storing the salt + hash in order to validate the user s current password

1464274
hash	salt
if you don t know the salt ahead of time when preparing a dictionary attack then in order to prepare a dictionary for all 8 character human passwords you need to hash 62 12 concatenated passwords

1464279
short	base
short of that you could still configure your tomcat server to pick up your web applications from wherever you want by specifying appropriate document base in either server.xml or your webapp s context.xml

1464294
hash	salt
another reason for using salt in password hash is to hide the fact that two users use the same password not unusual

1464299
hash	md5
firstly stop using md5 if you are using it and use sha-2 md5 sha-0 and sha-1 are all dead hash

1464326
onkeyup	onblur
why don t you use a combination of onblur and onkeyup

1464356
post	get
in contrast to classic asp.net it is harder to get the value with every post

1464356
post	put	post	get	put	get
you have to put the textbox into a every form to get the value in every post - no solution

1464357
ant	maven
you can try using ant or maven

1464374
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
my asp.net application only comes out properly if i am previewing it in internet explorer but its the ugliest thing ever if i view in firefox google-chrome or safari

1464402
google-chrome	firefox
i d advise using firefox as your development browser while testing in ie and google-chrome as well

1464412
uicontrol	uibutton
if you want to do it without uibutton say either with uicontrol or as a view then you could take a shot of your button create a suitable glow in a graphic editing app like photoshop and then add that image to your nib

1464430
hash	salt
i might be being incredibly dim here but where would you store the salt that would be inaccessable to someone with enough access to get the hash password

1464476
free	malloc
most likely malloc allocates more memory and puts so-called guard values that happen to contain null bytes or it puts some metadata to be used by free later and this metadata happens to contain a null byte right at that position

1464483
super	self
self super init

1464500
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
as dove suggests it s best to use a relatively standards compliant browser to do your development work firefox opera google-chrome or safari and then tweak to make it work in ie 6 7 8 afterwards

1464529
serializable	deserialization
from serializable api however it is strongly recommended that all serializable classes explicitly declare serialversionuid values since the default serialversionuid computation is highly sensitive to class details that may vary depending on compiler implementations and can thus result in unexpected invalidclassexceptions during deserialization

1464543
rss	feed
just wondering if someone could suggest a php library that would allow me to read the data of an rss feed and write it to a mysql database

1464564
hide	show
for eg consider a situation where you have a show hide div and when you click on the div it should opne and if you click anywhere else in the document it should close

1464581
rss	feed
once you ve used magpie to grab an rss feed you can store it in a string a save to a db as you would with any other string

1464637
pull	push
from the client end i d constantly pull from the repository make changes and push back

1464640
boost	stl
not in the stl i think the boost versions may let you do it but i am not sure

1464648
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
this is how i manually call viewwillappear viewdidappear viewwilldisappear viewdiddisappear here

1464648
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
and one of the view controllers i load this way has the following viewwillappear note that this is viewwillappear since at the point that viewdidappear is called your view is viewable by the user

1464651
hash	md5
a more secure aproach is to store some kind of hash value usualy an md5 hash of your password

1464673
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
it looks normally with firefox opera safari ..

1464737
equals	gethashcode	equals	tostring	tostring	gethashcode
however at each step after a dot intellisense pops up showing the four standard methods from the object class gethashcode equals gettype and tostring

1464749
hide	show
dpm is a function that devel has defined it creates a nice visual representation of the variable where you click to show hide the values inside arrays and class objects

1464754
luabind	tolua++
such tools already exist tolua++ luabind and possibly many others

1464767
mouseup	mouseleave
ok you want to ensure that whenever your mouseleave those images then your mouseup event fires

1464788
inherited	properties

1469286
gtk	cairo
that s just some dream code i m fine with some minimal boilerplate but i really don t need anything fancy probably the only feature i would really like would be the ability to embed in some gui that looks good on windows that rules out tkinter and is not extremely heavyweight that might rule out gtk cairo

1469318
folder	directory
would only return mail inbox this should work on and number of directory and should not return valus like that are on it so it should only return the folder that are added onto

1469731
arraylist	treeset
if we don t want duplicates just exchange arraylist by treeset and remove the extra sorting

1469786
inherited	properties
each build file imports the parent build file and each child inherited and overrides parent tasks properties

1469799
int	chars
that because you re assigning a chars pointer to your int

1469813
apache	lighttpd
i don t have thorough benchmarks but i m personally convinced that just like lighttpd can outperform apache on simpler tasks mod_wsgi gives apache the laurel when it comes to serving python web apps

1469813
apache	nginx
nginx with its own mod_wsgi seems to perform even better than apache but hey you didn t ask about that

1469923
google-chrome	firefox
only happens here and there and so far i haven t noticed anything wrong in how the page is rendered on ie7 ie8 firefox 3.5 and google-chrome 3

1469926
onmousedown	onmousemove
to prevent selection of elements in page just return false from your functions onmousedown onmousemove

i ve done several flex bison systems myself but now i d replace both with lemon from sqlite since it s one tool re-entrant and thread safe as well as having a streaming pull-based model

1470013
mouse	keyboard
i don t like listening to either keyboard or mouse events explicitly because there s more than one way to change a selection if someone is holding down shift and hitting a down-arrow you won t get a mouse event

1470063
cvs	svn
we are moving to svn and need to prevent commits to specific directories modules within the cvs repository

1470105
integer	fractions
if both are int and the result comes to be a fractions you will only see integer part of it

1470108
disk	ram
ah but even if i build a system to quickly move chunks of data to from disk ram and do some caching -to replace the db- that won t do because i still need transactions so that the rest of the server functionality can work in parallel

1470198
pull	push
i think this is just a generic argue about what is better push or pull model

1470234
dundas	componentart
nevron chart has at least as many features as dundas chart and the image quality of componentart - but is much faster

1470275
aggregate-functions	sum
you should learn how to use aggregate-functions in sql like sum and group by any book on sql should include this and also techniques of storing hierarchical relationships of entities

1470296
hide	show
when the read more link is clicked have your script show the whole string and hide the read more link

1470337
pull	push
pushing into main master repository would then via hook either push into those two slave repositories where their hooks would do git reset --hard or equivalent or go to those two slave repositories and do a git pull from master there

now we session.delete parent and all the children are cascade removed from the database but humans.myallhumans collection s cache is not updated

1470547
onclick	onsubmit
if i understand you correctly all you need is to add your own caching functions into onsubmit of all forms and onclick of all links smth like

1470574
subtract	add
i have a javascript function changetotal referer value which should determine if the product was just selected and add subtract the product price from a total

1470584
getter	setter
step 4 in the action make the getter and setter of object names of the left and right sides take strings and not string arrays

1470646
for-loop	loops
i is reset at every iteration of loops as it s not declared locally in the for-loop but globally eventually resulting in infinite loops

gridview	rowdatabound
and in the code-behind i catch on to the rowdatabound event in which i handle some links and properties inside the gridview cells

1470744
pull	push
the juniors can periodically push to their respective branches which the leads will pull and review

1470744
squash	branch
instead of including all the trivial screw ups in the history of the project the leads can choose to squash several commits together and then integrate the branch into the mainline

1470753
width	height
i have used a resizable custom component inside griditem and now the griditem sets its width and height same as custom component

1470756

i ve actually inherited the timer class to give it an index properties the eventargs as well

1470767
fast-forward	merge
after the merge should be fast-forward

equals	compareto
it explains the equals contract and how to properly override equals hashcode and compareto

1470802
firefox	safari
this works well within firefox ie7 8 safari but it crashes ie6

1470814

1470820
filtering	grouping
your where clause filtering these rows out returns null and they don t get into the grouping by

1470829

you can combine all of them into one there is not much reason for you to be wrapping each of those calls in its own document ready event handler

1470833
folder	directory
more precisely you define your output directory say bin as a linked folder then you set that directory as the official output one of your project

1470836
firefox	safari
unfortunately unless you re happy with supporting only specific browsers ie7 win safari firefox 3.5 there s no pure css solution to your problem

1470836

button	checkbox
i am having a uiwebview showing and html page that has some checkbox radio button

1470880
try-catch	exception-handling
my guess is that they didn t because db2sqlca.getmessage can throw nasty exception-handling so you must wrap it in try-catch

1471003
opml	feed
we currently have some c# code that runs and imports data from a number of opml feed and stores it in several sql server tables

1471015
pop-up	dialog
those cms are probably just calling the javascript method window.print to pop-up the print dialog

1471083

i d like the flowlayoutpanel to automatically adjust its width or height depending on number of controls inside of it

1471090
clang	llvm
for c c++ etc gcc 4.5 will allow plugins for people to write their own extensions and clang from llvm is designed for this too

1471093
vb6	vba
for the time being office products are stuck with the old vba visual basic for applications which is based on the old vb6 and earlier versions of visual basic which are based upon com rather than the .net framework

1471093
vb6	vba
because of all of this you will either need to call out to the win32 api to access the csp functions or you will have to roll-your-own encryption method in pure vb6 vba code although this is likely to be less secure

1471108
stdout	stderr
when running in daemon mode twistd will close stdin stdout and stderr

1471143
disk	ram
the cache ram hard disk is abstracted as virtual memory

1471167
min	max
min and max are special cases since they don t require scanning the whole group only the first and the last value of the aggregated column within the group

1471167
min	max
while simple max and min without group by clause use a top method if the index on the aggregated column is present min and max with group by use same methods as other aggregate functions do

1471174
pull	push
once the tcp connection is established it s a 2-way channel you can pull or push as long as your protocol allows it

put the image inside a div in the table cell and make the width and height of the div to be 100 of the td and style it to overflow auto

1471255
codeigniter	cakephp
in a full stack framework like cakephp i don t reallt know codeigniter you are locked inside

1471268
getter	setter
the only workaround i can think of is to mark the char field with xmltransient and then write getter and setter which get and set the value as a string

1471285
int	chars
when comparing int to chars mysql converts the latter to the former not vice versa

1471285
int	chars
compare chars with chars not int

1471326
codeigniter	cakephp
it beats the pants off of pretty much any other framework i ve used - zend symfony cakephp and codeigniter

1471378
int	double	int	chars	unsigned	short
well i don t know about uint32_t but for the fundamental types bool chars signed chars unsigned chars wchar_t short unsigned short int unsigned int long unsigned long float double and long double you should use the numeric_limits templates via

1471387
multiplying	subtract
subtract 0.5 giving you a new range of 0 - 0.5 then multiplying by 2

1471396
ssl	https
if your fear is that a man-in-the-middle attack between you and the user is going to leak the contents of the documents the only solution is to use https ssl

1471420

this awesome blog post explains how to get it set up quickly basically you let vpc set up a com port as a named pipe enable kernel debug mode on the virtualized os and connect to it while it is booting

1471467
actualheight	actualwidth
of course i m using a little bit of pseudo code here for actualwidth and actualheight .

1471472

1471654
hash	md5
is it possible to decrypt md5 hash

1471654
hash	md5
i have passwords stored in a database using md5 and was wondering if there was a way to reverse the hash to email the user s password to him in case they forget it

1471660
hash	md5
this means that if someone manages to get the list of md5 hash they still can t get your password

1471663
hash	md5
md5 is a hashing algorithm you can not revert the hash value

1471668
hash	md5
you don t want to reverse an md5 hash

1471668
hash	md5
reversing md5 is actually considered malicious - a few websites offer the ability to crack and bruteforce md5 hash - but all they are are massive databases containing dictionary words previously submitted passwords and other words

1471668
hash	md5
there is a very small chance that it will have the md5 hash you need reversed

1471668
hash	md5	hash	salt	salt	md5
and if you ve salt the md5 hash - this won t work either

1471668
hash	md5
user creates password - password is hash using md5 - hash stored in database

1471668
hash	md5
user enters username and password - username checked password is hash using md5 - hash is compared with stored hash in database

1471720
hash	salt
also this will not work for salt hash

1471755
for-loop	loops
you ll want to have the outer loops of your nested for-loop allocate each of the n sub-arrays

1471775
hide	show
this means you don t have to wait for postbacks and you just hide a div and show the next one

1471809
hash	md5
md5 has its weaknesses see wikipedia so there are some projects which try to precompute hash

1471822
subtract	add
subtract the time from your timestamps before putting them into the database and add the time to the timestamps when you get them back out

1471926
public	protected
if you want to access an instance of d as a b why have you inherited it as protected rather than public

1471935
super	self
it is also important that each initializer assigns the the result from the super initializer to self

1471982
trojan	virus
summary malicious users can buy a few dozen flash drives load them with an auto-run virus or trojan then sprinkle said flash drives in a company s parking lot late at night

1471998
expression-blend	silverlight
much like the way wp-coda works but i wan to do this in expression-blend which uses silverlight

1472013
put	get
that means that anything you put into there you can get to

1472037
int	chars
chars seemingly requires three int for representation 226 128 147

1472110
post	get
if they can post from different pcs you should make sure that the server says what the current time is user pcs can quickly get out of sync

1472169
coldfusion	railo
there s enough free engines railo smith openbluedragon that you can load into tomcat instances or use something like stax to put a coldfusion app into the cloud

1472173
post	get
you can get the auto_increment_id the same way as you d do to get the value for username and title of post

1472176
hide	show
in particular i want to hide the main top navigation bar the search functionality and the label that show up in the upper-left-hand corner that tells you the name of the site you are on

1472193
width	height
the july 09 source code shows the default width and height to be 8 so i m not sure setting them to 10 would make them smaller

1472241
accessor	properties
we use it to inject our own aspects persistent properties accessor construction notifiers session transaction activators etc. in dataobjects.net

1472264
width	height
i have the original image the x and y co-ordinates of where on that image i want the cropping to being and the width and height of the new cropped image

1472264
width	height
but when the image is acutally saved it s a small image of the correct height and width but is completely empty

1472271
pthreads	fork
on pthreads one of the steps involved in daemonization is fork and having the parent exit

1472340
client-side	server-side
you ll want to use the comparevalidator for that and since .nets drag drop validators provide both client-side and server-side validation you re covered

1472383
profiling	debugging
the pb call blocks until the profiling browser is exited note just closing the window with the wm destroy button doesn t seem to cause it to return - only the exit menu item seems to so your server is hung until you dismiss the window but for debugging purposes that seems like it may be fine

1472425
pop-up	dialog
so as to avoid the dialog that pop-up if the file is locked by another user

1472446
disk	ram
oh disk activity was pure writing as everything is cached in ram

1472481
mouse	keyboard
if you are in a web browser you can t fake real input events like keyboard and mouse events for security reasons

1472526
metaclass	superclass
every object has a class in a variable named isa as in â œthis instance is a snowtireâ and every class has a superclass and a metaclass

1472527
hash	md5
connect.registerusers uses i believe merely the normal md5 hash as implemented in the .net runtime

1472614
perforce	svn
you could use your source control to help you a little if it does branching easily git svn or perforce would work great

1472619
int	chars
the c is the format string for a single chars and d for a digit int

1472619
int	chars
by casting the chars to an int you ll get the ascii value

1472633
rss	feed
the idea is that it periodically fetches an rss feed and creates a toaster-popup when there are new feed

1472661
ant	maven
i think git has the ability to define pre-checkin hooks but there are also ant targets maven plug-ins and ide functions plugins that will do the automatic formatting in an out-of-your-way manner

1472671
move	drag
is there a setting to do this in cocoa or do i need to move this code to mousemoved and check the distance between where the drag started and where the mouse is currently

1472683
maven	pom.xml
now you ll need to create a pom.xml which will tell maven how to build your project

1472690
rss	feed
perfect for displaying an rss feed i am using it for a similar purpose

1472703
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
this works in firefox 3 internet explorer 8 internet explorer 8 compatibility mode opera and safari

1472766
public	protected
second it is unclear what you mean by links still work do you mean internal links that will or will not work based on the proper functioning of your application or do you mean links to public internet sites that happen to be on a password protected site

1472767
rss	feed
i m trying to parse a rss feed using c# and i need to transform it with xslt

1472794
slideup	slidedown
thanks for these application of slideup and slidedown

1472794
hide	show
an important remark it doesn t work under ie7 and ie8 if you don t set a width for the div you want to show or hide

1472803
folder	directory
basically as part of our build process we copy over a set of directory that contain a bunch of other nested directory containing various xml and data and when we move the location for that data our copy and checkin build process doesn t really work and because we are checking into another source control svn wiping out the directory and copying over isn t really an option either we d be blowing away the .svn folder

1472842
google-chrome	safari
but in google-chrome and safari the reported offsettop seems well incorrect

1472842
google-chrome	firefox
and loaded it in firefox and google-chrome

1472842
google-chrome	firefox
both browser report the wrapper span as its offsetparent but for firefox the offsettop is -8 and for google-chrome it is 2

1472850
post	get
the project is sponsored by sun and may soon get orphaned in the post oracle days

1472862
perl	tcl
expect either with the tcl or perl implementation s would be my first attempt

1472876
int	double
the server receives the pickled int unpickles it double it then pickles it and sends it back to the client

1472878
width	height
i have a uiscrollview that s around 600 pixels in height and 320 in width

1472908
public	protected
in the case of the static method php has to check wether the method can or cannot be called from the calling context public protected private

1472915
coalesce	isnull	coalesce	nvl	isnull	nvl
i already tried isnull coalesce nvl nz

1472920
floating-point	integer
i don t know why it s lowercase for long integer types and uppercase for floating-point

1472942
int	boolean
the idea that is an operation just like + except that it returns a boolean rather than an int is one of those simple but powerful ideas that have great ramifications .

1472970
decoder	encoder
mochiweb has a json encoder decoder and php has native json support

1472983
gridview	linqdatasource
i have a gridview that is using a linqdatasource which is tied to a table in my database

1472983
hide	show
in my presentation layer using templatefield in gridview i hide the foreign key value and make another call to the database to show the name of it s associated name so it s more readable for the user

1473026
clang	llvm
try using the llvm clang static analyser for details see this link

1473033
folder	directory
if it is not sufficient to completely clear the target location use defaultexcludes false to ensure the .svn folder are deleted you could try writing a custom ant task to traverse the file system below the target deleting empty directory as you move back up from each leaf

1473036
nsbutton	nspopupbutton
it s all entirely custom view code involving nspopupbutton s and nsbutton s and nstextfield s

1473049
jquery	scriptaculous
scriptaculous got it right with queue and scope where jquery on the other hand has .queue and .animate that are basically useless combined

1473049
jquery	scriptaculous
the only thing jquery is good for out of the box is pushing some style attributes around on the dom whereas scriptaculous covers the whole spectrum of what s possible with effects

1473107
sorting	filtering
i have a qstandarditemmodel with several 100 000 records of data and a qsortfilterproxymodel on top of it for filtering and sorting capabilities

1473140
std	ostream
in mingw the simplest solution is to use c++ s std ostream since that uses the gnu library and does support long double

1473168
width	height
you shouldn t need the explicit auto width height that s the default

1473265
post	get
it s getting url encoded because your request formed with httpclient may be a get request instead of a post and is missing this header

1473265
post	get
look for the httpclient setting to set the content-type header correctly and make sure your request is a post not a get and you should be golden

1473288
rss	feed
private rss feed support for security in aggregators

1473288
rss	feed
he offers summaries of various rss feed clients they may be a bit dated by now

1473297
google-chrome	safari
so the problem is browsers safari google-chrome do not show spaces in ajax-loaded html content after tags like strong em etc

1473324
pbkdf2	hash	pbkdf2	salt	hash	salt
a pbkdf2 password hash should contain the salt the number of iterations and the hash itself so it s possible to verify later

1473324
pbkdf2	hash
is there a standard format like rfc2307 s ssha for pbkdf2 password hash

1473324
pbkdf2	salt
that s the number of iterations in lowercase hexadecimal the urlsafe_base64 encoded salt and the urlsafe_base64 encoded pbkdf2 output

1473324
pbkdf2	salt
the salt should be 64 bits the number of iterations should be at least 1000 and the pbkdf2 with hmac-sha1 output can be any length

1473394
filesystems	fat
in particular usb mass-storage devices are generally formatted as with fat filesystems which do not support links

1473402
pbkdf2	hash	pbkdf2	salt	hash	salt
there is a specification for the parameters salt and iterations of pbkdf2 but it doesn t include the hash

1473402
pbkdf2	hash
since pbkdf2 is really a key derivation function it doesn t make sense for it to specify a way to bundle the hash which is the really a derived key together with the derivation parameters mdash

1473405
serializable	deserialization
compare it with what you already know - will a serializable deserialization from an xml be faster than a custom search over a binary format

1473414
hide	show
is it possible to show and hide 2 different datepickers

1473440
integer	unsigned
the code gets to the point where it does the read of the response and it takes what should be a 4 bytes and converts it to a 32 bit unsigned integer so it can be converted to unix time

1473486
google-chrome	firefox
this only occurs on https pages and only in firefox and google-chrome

1473486
google-chrome	firefox
why does it only occur on https pages and only in firefox and google-chrome

1473496
google-chrome	firefox
similarly when i try to take over the key for my own purposes it works splendidly in firefox but my event doesn t fire in google-chrome or ie8 and the default action for the tab fires instead

1473584
width	height
using yui 2 on page load i found all elements of that given classname that were either set to display none or whose height and width was 0 that s one way of measuring whether an element exists or a parent is set to display none

1473610
hide	show
use z-index to hide element under non-transparent element show it and get height

1473613
put	get
i strongly recommend that you try to get this working in a console app which will be much easier to debug than a servlet then put it into a servlet environment

1473641
innodb	myisam
does innodb support the type of query i have for myisam

1473657
hide	show
to overcome that you can create a special moss page that hide all those elements and show just the element you want to expose

1473700
getter	setter
note that there is both a getter and a setter for your compositdict object

1473700
getter	setter
this is why i also changed your registered method to get_shared instead of get_comp as you will want access to the setter as well as the getter within your consumer class

1473727
stdout	stderr
how are you consuming the child process stdout and stderr

1473727
stdout	stderr
you need to consume the output streams concurrently otherwise either your stdout or stderr buffer will fill up and your child process will block

1473745
haskell	ocaml
besides java there s groovy scala clojure a lisp dialect on the jvm jruby ruby on the jvm jython python on the jvm jaskell haskell on the jvm fan runs on the jvm as well as the .net clr and lots more and there s also an ocaml-java ocaml that runs on the jvm

save the binary in a format you are capable or willing to write a program to read intel hex perhaps or elf if they support that

1473773
svg	vml
just wondering if anybody has come across a tool or anything to make the process easier of converting vml to svg or some other modern format silverlight flash

1473773
svg	vml
would also be helpful if there was a chart to map vml markup to svg in table format as a cheat sheet or something

1473778
svg	vml
vector converter claims to convert between svg and vml among other formats

1473782
junit	jmock	scalatest	jmock
scalatest specs and scalacheck are top quality frameworks compatible between themselves and compatible with other java frameworks and libraries such as junit and jmock

you might also try running the help effective-pom plugin to see if there are any differences in the pom.xml that maven resolves

1473900
pop-up	dialog
i have to use click_no_wait due to a dialog box that ie pop-up on a certain page so that another ruby thread can close it

1473910

1473925
ienumerable	idictionary	ienumerable	icollection	ienumerable	ilist	ilist	icollection	idictionary	icollection	idictionary	ilist
judging by the source code it seems that it will bind to a model that is a generic type of ienumerable icollection ilist or idictionary but it won t bind on a model s property that is of a generic type

1473930
webclient	httpwebrequest
the webclient is a very dumbed down wrapper for httpwebrequest

1473931
width	height

1473961
int	double
a problem would be that i think the function expects the second argument distguess to be a double precision instead of an int

1473962
profiler	gprof
try a profiler gprof

1473990
hide	show
how can i make the div show when hovering over the link and hide when moving away instead of showing and hiding on click

just replace remove the click event and add mouseover and mouseout you can chain on the original element selection

1474019
jquery	curvycorners
finally if you don t want to fuss with the css or maintain your own yui jquery whatever code you could try nifty corners or curvycorners which are javascript libraries that claim to do this sort of thing automagically at least for div s

1474045
webrat	cucumber
but i can t easily access link_to from my cucumber step and i can t figure out any reasonable way of pointing webrat at the right checkbox short of kludging up a whole bunch of hyperlink code in my step which makes it very brittle

1474052
mp3	flac
a modified version of a shell script converts an audio file from flac to mp3 format

1474052
mp3	flac
this converts the flac files in the flac directory no spaces in file names to mp3 files in the mp3 directory at the same level as flac

1474054
gif	png
thanks to beta for pointing out the mess with gif png extensions

1474059
profiler	gprof
it s worth noting this is definitely not as clear as the callers profile you may get from gprof or another profiler as the numbers it reports is the number of times oprofile collected a sample in which x is the caller for a given function not the number of times x called a given function

1474066
inherited	subclassing
update 2016 as per stan s answer below modern versions of django let you set on the genericstackedinline subclassing as it inherited from inlinemodeladmin

1474077

however the onsubmit code is not executed when the form is submitted same thing with onclick handlers on the submit button

1474105
post	get
s he is redirected to login post his credentials is redirected back as get to the original page products 0332425

1474127
post	get
i would suggest unobtrusive js so if someone doesn t have js on then it will work as a link doing a get submission but if they have js then it would change the behavior to be post with no ugly url change

1474129
profiler	gprof	gcov	gprof
in addition to the aforementioned gprof profiler you may also try the gcov code-coverage tool

1474136

1474263
stderr	fflush
other than getting the actual logic worked out correctly stã phane s suggestions all good you might also want to fflush stderr after fprintf-ing to ensure your error messages make it out right away instead of being buffered

1474267
bazaar	git
you ll definitely need to start using a version control system if you aren t already - some good options are git exceptionally fast and full featured or bazaar much slower but easier to use

1474272
rss	feed
i have a model for representing rss feed that is being loaded from a url

1474286
sorting	grouping
one example i m commonly seeing is the discussion of what should the database do joins sorting grouping vs

1474289
min	max
when we use sql server this is relatively straight forward - a call to dbcc freeproccache clears all of the counters before a suite begins then at test end we run a query against sys.dm_exec_query_stats which gives us access to the execution counts and min max total time s of each cached query plan with hooks available to retrieve the parameterized sql statement we use forced parametrization in our mssql instances and the query plan

1474319
cvs	svn
i recommend either svn subversion or cvs

1474368
hide	show
once you do that the tab show hide should appear

1474442
children	parent
so this means that the children have a reference to their parent

1474505
serializable	deserialization
if the class foo is serializable as a root element things behave fine and as expected - the jeznamespace xmlns is applied to the root foo element and deserialization occurs fine

1474507
post	get
the post controller has an authorize attribute and the get part of the action checks to see if the post was made by the user

1474530
post	get
since you only get to the view on if you are allowed to edit the post at this point i would think all you need to do is check to see if the post came from your site

1474538
jobs	cron
i mean is there a programmatic way of adding removing cron jobs without stepping onto cron s toes

1474544
packets	multicast

versioning	upgrade
what kind of costs would i be looking at if my site gets big enough where i need to upgrade my database to a paid versioning and run the database on a separate computer

1474670
vsto	add-in
although your vsto add-in is technically a dll that is being loaded into excel it operates more like a top-level exe rather than as a dll library exposed to other callers

1474670
vsto	add-in
the process is discussed in detail in the article vsto add-in comaddins and requestcomaddinautomationservice by andrew whitechapel

1474756
groupbox	panel
anyhow you should just use the control that fits the job in this case a panel or a groupbox

1474758
listview	gridview
my suggestion would be to switch to a listview instead of a gridview

1474782
jar	war
the whole process of creating a jar and or war files for a single jsp seems like overkill as does setting up a whole ant build deployment task

1474881
for-loop	loops
as glenn maynard pointed out in the comment if you need to do a very large jumps such as i + 100000000 then you should use explicit while loops instead of just skipping steps in a for-loop

1474885
wordpress	phpbb
i ve seen some great frameworks for forums like phpbb and for blogs like wordpress

1474990
int	chars

note i took the liberty of removing superfluous parenthesis on your code maybe you came from delphi pascal language

1475164
django	web2py
having looked several ones like django pylos web2py wt

1475218
inherited	subclassing
it s a subclassing of db.model so your classes can inherited from rotmodel instead and take advantage of it s retries

1475222
int	chars
and use stream.writebuffer anodevariable sizeof tnode but you said that strings get go over 255 chars in this case if a string goes over 65535 chars then change word to int

1475246
trac	bugzilla
you could additionally use a nice bug tracker like bugzilla or use an integrated solution like launchpad or trac

1475272
mutators	setter
this is an idiom used in mutators sometimes called setter but i think you typed it slightly wrong

1475370

1475514
inherited	properties
then make sure your inherited properties in your master s aspx page is correct

1475574
width	height
you may be able to just set the longest dimension and skip the ratio if the width and height are not otherwise set in attributes properties or css but i haven t done browser testing to be sure if it works across the board

1475607
stdout	stderr
alternatively you can createprocess api or system.diagnostics.process and provide your own stdin stdout stderr streams and bypass the windows console for these streams but again unless the target application explicitly works via stdin stdout stderr it may not help

1475673
perl	tcl
swig simplified wrapper and interface generator is a software development tool that connects programs written in c and c++ with a variety of high-level scripting languages including perl php python tcl and ruby though it seems swig s origins are bindings with python

1475694
submit	submission
2 also if what you want is to intercept form submission for that for you may want to do this slightly differently if you can submit the form via 1 button

1475705
free	malloc
use malloc and free when done

1475717
dlsym	dlopen
in particular the dlopen 3 and dlsym 3 calls will load a dynamic typically elf library and look up the address of a symbol named by a string

1475717
dlsym	dlopen
an extension library for the interpreter written in the script can itself invoke the bare hooks for dlopen 3 and dlsym 3 and hook up to a new library that the interpreter never knew about

1475800
submit	submission
note since the jquery ajax function do not stop the execution of the script you ll have to stop the form from submission then submit the form in the ajax callback.

1475805
ggplot2	lattice
however graphics systems based on grid lattice and ggplot2 allow the graphics object to be saved and updated

1475995
width	height
so from this i would expect that the width height of the window when there are no other constraints set such as maxwidth minwidth width etc. is determined by the default style of a window

1476008
int	chars
here you declared the operator for int and you are trying to pass a chars

1476101
hash	md5
it helps you take the md5 hash of a stream

1476101
hash	md5
md5 isn t considered very secure these days - there are other hash sha-256 which are harder to attack

1476105
hash	md5
rather use sha256 and above nowadays though as md5 is not of much use anymore cryptographically other than doing hash checks on downloaded files

1476184
prepare	execute
part of the code which makes the prepare statement execute and closes the connection

1476194
awt	swing
this is a common pattern for awt and swing events

1476194
awt	swing
note that all the events in java awt and swing inherit ultimately from eventobject and the convention is to call the listener somethinglistener and the event somethingevent

1476294

1476570
junit	jmock
if you used to use junit and jmock i would like to recommend you

1476570
googletest	gmock
gmock and seamless coorperate with googletest

1476579
cgsize	cgrect
you can also use the +valuewithcgrect and +valuewithcgsize methods of nsvalue when you re trying to log say the frame cgrect or size cgsize properties of a uiview

1476594
post	put
if it does then you should be using a post put or delete request depending on the exact nature of the operation

1476607
put	get
i know enough to get oracle up and running and put in place it s automatic options for backup and optimisation then i leave it well alone

1476629
nsurlconnection	nsoperation
you could wrap nsurlconnection in an nsoperation and achieve the same thing however nsurlconnection has an asynchronous api which may suit your needs a bit better

1476685
getter	setter
zend studio has a feature of automatic getter setter generation

1476716
submit	submission
since #jquerysubmit is a form submit button you need to prevent the default action which is submission the form normally without ajax

1476777
google-chrome	firefox
i am looking for a similar solution to firefox or google-chrome

1476811
vb6	vba
if i recall correctly if the oledbcommand in ado.net functions similarly to the older ado library libraries used in vb6 vba etc. then the parameter collection does not define parameters by name only by position within the collection

1476870
notepad	textpad
notepad agrees with my application textpad shows something else

1476926

gridview	linqdatasource
the problem we have is that a control ultimately based on a gridview linqdatasource combination cannot sort correctly on the primaryaddress joined class ignores it

1476984
postgresql	mysql	postgresql	informix
most dbms have some kind of hashing function postgresql and mysql have md5 oracle has dbms_utility.get_hash_value but i could not find anything for informix informix ids 9

1477008
pascal	delphi
while the delphi pascal syntax is more text oriented begin end or and so the underscores look a bit strange as you don t expect them there

1477066
postgresql	mysql
finally i decided to use interface ole db and postgresql instead instead of mysql

1477070
margin	height
make a copy of the image and crop it to just the left-most 5 pixels assuming that there s some left margin to the text trim and find out the new height

1477073

note that a property name cannot be the same as any no-parameter method name of nsobject or nsmanagedobject for example you cannot give a property the name â œdescriptionâ see nspropertydescription

1477118
many-to-one	one-to-many
from what i know it is not possible to map it this way you have to switch to one-to-many and a many-to-one relationships with your b in the middle

1477144
zlib	libpng	freetype	libpng
i already installed zlib libpng and freetype independently

1477229
awt	swing
these are mostly intended to be used with the awt and or swing classes though and thus have features specific to that use case

1477250
submit	submission
however when i submit the form the url changes to where the form should be submission to which is fine but once it has been submitted it should send the user to a confirmation page

1477339
google-chrome	firefox
it can be done and is a good optimizing tip but as always pay attention as how it works in ie firefox and google-chrome while you are doing it

1477349
opera	safari
it worked for ie 6 safari opera 8+ and ff2+

1477380

this is default behaviour as you can do multiple post s to the backend and the request won t get killed when doing another one

1477388
rss	feed
i am trying to fetch data from rss feed feed location is in c# win form

1477409

innodb	myisam
based on the current implementation of myisam and innodb yes

1477612
hash	salt
don t explain hash salt or use words like plaintext

1477647
prop	each
the alternative of course is to create copies of the original data within each thread stored in an array and use this private copied data in the call to prop

1477655
free	malloc
you can use malloc free for any type of data not only null terminated strings

1477669
hash	salt
using a salt is absolutely required because otherwise an attacker can use existing precomputed tables to simply look up hash for all short or dictionary passwords your users have used

1477669
hash	salt
combining hash could have a similar effect but should not be used for that purpose without a salt because it s still possible for a precomputed table to exist for that combination

1477669
hash	md5
however the combination and repetition of hash has a value of its own by increasing the time it takes for an attacker to do a dictionary attack applying md5 ten thousand times still takes a fraction of a second and is feasible as part of the login process

1477687
maven-assembly-plugin	pom.xml
it is possible however to use the maven-assembly-plugin to construct the war in this case you have much finer grained control over the contents of the artifact and can omit the pom.xml

1477757
onclick	onfocus	onfocus	onblur
this is working on most pages but on one for some reason the onfocus and onblur aren t working at all - for example if i change it to onclick it triggers no problem

to answer klochner both seems quite popular but ruby is not a language that i am familiar with and django seems more heavy and complex to me than web2py

1477860
mbunit	nunit
you can use testing frameworks like nunit xunit mbunit to playback your tests

1477867
folder	directory
change your output directory to your web-inf classes folder

as sprites get touched their z-order is being changed by me to put them on the top of zorder

1477944
hash	salt
the salt is prefixed to a password which is hash with sha and stored in the databse

1477944
hash	salt
with a per user salt however you need to get the salt before you can compare it with the stored password hash

1477944
hash	salt
so to avoid having two queries 1 to get the salt and another to validate the input credentials i decided to get the salt and the hash password in a single query based on the inputted username

1477944
hash	salt
and then in the serverside code php i concatenate the salt with the inputted password hash it and compare it with the password already taken from the database

1477995
hash	salt
yes it is reasonable to simply collect the salt and the salt hash password for the user name in a single operation and then generate the sha result of the provided password and the salt in php comparing it with the retrieved hash password value

1478004
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
edit ie firefox safari opera have all supported it for years.

prepare	execute
and there s no other way besides prepare statements to execute dynamic sql in mysql 5.x

1478151
width	height
the sensible thing would be to classify monitors by width to height proportion

1478151
width	height
if you can get the width then you can probably get the height

if the data were stored on disk it s obvious why that is so but of course in ram it s the same principle

1478299
g++	gcc
because of this i ve mostly been using geany to write up my code then fireftp to send it off to a faraway unix machine then using gcc or g++ to compile my code

1478447
toolbar	docking
there s a codeproject article a simple c# toolbar docking framework that looks to be a more light-weight option than dockpanel suite

1478526
jar	war	liferay	web-inf
we stuck the dependency jar files in the liferay war file in web-inf lib and it seems to be happy with that

1478526
liferay	web-inf
the answer is again in the liferay war file in web-inf classes

1478526
folder	directory
the concept of liferay home directory variable being one folder above the server home is something i m still wrestling with and it is causing me to have errors every time an http request is sent relating to opt ee license

1478599
superclass	subclassing
in oo languages i can create and extend an engine superclass to obtain pistonengine and rotaryengine subclassing

1478607
printf	getchar
personally i would put the printf just before the getchar

1478622
post	get
instead of seeing the normal post or get preceeding the action page url i see options

1478633
folder	dir
iterate over every file in the client javascript folder that match dir command and for f are totally unneeded here though and only complicate things especially when file names contain spaces commas and the like

1478644

1478680
post	get
but if i try to access with a post i get a 403 forbidden

1478693
free	malloc
when i initialize a pointer in this function using malloc seg fault occurs possibly because i did not free it before leaving the function

1478693
strcpy	strncpy
how safe is strcpy compared to strncpy

1478784
hash	md5
some token that only myself and the other website operator knows concatenated to something identifying the user like their user name then hash that with a checksum algorithm such as sha256 you can use md5 or sha1 which usually are more available but they are much easier to break

1478805
strcpy	strncpy
you ve added an additional question about strcpy strncpy

1478832
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
i have detailsview which has few dropdownlistfor and checkbox

1478839
for-loop	arrays
the only wasteful aspect here is that you have to generate an arrays of length n-1 for the for-loop which isn t ideal but it s probably not a giant issue

1478923
getter	setter
how does one get a reference the the getter and setter functions in actionscript 3

1478943
subtract	add
thus a shift is just an add subtract of that one index no modification of the data

1478982
imperative	declarative
workflows are a declarative way of writing programs by linking together pre-defined activities rather than an imperative programming model of writing lines of code

1478988
post	put
imo it would be a cleaner practice to treat headlines as post but wouldn t it put serious penalty on performance if mysql searches through every post to catch the headlines

1479005
getter	setter
the getter and setter methods are actually built around the idea that you shouldn t be able to and they therefore function as a property

1479005
getter	setter
i was able to do this for the regular methods but i m trying to extend this to getter setter as well

1479005
getter	setter
since getter and setter function as a property and not a method it would make sense to test to see if it is a property and then simply assign it a value directly

1479067
rss	feed
something similar to rss feed when you click them you can select use google reader

1479073
getter	setter
the getter setter of your object would reference those two vectors to access data in your real matrix and you would have methods like horizontalshift ... and verticalshift ... that only swap values in your two vectors like you suggested

1479099
codeblocks	codelite
codeblocks and codelite are two good options if you re sticking with c++

1479099
notepad++	scite
then you can go with notepad++ or scite

1479173
getter	setter
your getter and setter will work on the attr properties only

hash	salt
secure hash and salt for php passwords

1479234
hash	salt
all they would have is the hash and the salt

1479241
hash	salt
if you used a secure hash access to the hash salt and algorithm will still leave a lot of work for a would-be attacker

1479261
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
just ran into this problem myself and tested this solution in ff3.5 ie6 ie7 ie8 safari 4 opera 10 and google-chrome

1479277
fortran	ada
build a complete c compiler and other front-ends such as c++ fortran ada whatever if you want them

1479307
versioning	upgrade
the solution is to reinstall all ports because i upgrade to a new os versioning 10.5 - 10.6

1479316
pbkdf2	hash	pbkdf2	salt	hash	salt	scrypt	pbkdf2	scrypt	salt
as a side note from what i ve read key derivation functions pbkdf2 scrypt bcrypt are considered better more secure #1 #2 than plain salt sha-1 sha-2 hash by crypto people

1479320
versioning	upgrade
the solution is to reinstall all ports because i upgrade to a new os versioning 10.5 - 10.6

1479365
hash	salt
if you have just a hash no salt then once they know your data and algorithm they can get your password via a rainbow table lookup

1479365
hash	salt
if you have a hash and a salt they can get your password by burning a lot of cpu cycles and building a rainbow table

1479366
subtract	add	multiplying	add	multiplying	modulo	multiplying	subtract

1479457
pop-up	dialog
a save dialog should pop-up

1479490
for-loop	loops
the idea is that the species variable first line of the for-loop e.g species bear becomes the object bear last line of loops which in conjunction with a str method and the print bear command would give me the bears attributes

1479517
allocator	stl
its a very tiny bit of work to give it static state without violating stl allocator rules

1479552
getattr	setattr
also the rules for naming of python variables are much stricter than the possible set of animal names -- you can t include spaces in a variable name for example so while setattr will happily store the value you d have to use getattr to retrieve it

1479561
selecteditem	selectedindex
use selectedindex or selecteditem or by changing the value of the property to which those properties are bound

1479612
redmine	gitorious
depending on whether you want a feature-for-feature clone of github or just somewhere to view git repositories alongside an issue tracker wiki etc. i d recommend either using gitorious the github clone or redmine

1479651
firefox	safari
what s weird is that my front-end validation works fine on firefox ie and safari for windows

1479663
folder	dir
i have a folder with three files and want the equivalent of dir s b in powershell

1479666
cvs	svn
scm server svn git cvs - central source repository usually

1479673
accessor	properties
i could define my own custom accessor but that again requires special treatment at assignment since they need to be used like methods setx val and not properties

1479696
jar	war
one way to solve this is to have the module build a jar and then use the assembly plugin to build a war file with the jar in web-inf lib of that war

1479696
jar	war
you d be better off having a jar project and a war project with a parent project building both modules

1479719
cvs	svn
in larger projects or in organizations development tends to be done locally on a programmer s computer or with the aid of source repositories svn cvs vss etc. a copy of the work is done locally

i was suspicious that there were some kind of attributes for the width and height properties or even the class itself but could not find anything from reflecting the button control

1479794
wav	aiff
wav and aiff often usually

1479794
mp3	aiff	mp3	wav	wav	aiff
audio file services to read the mp3 format and write aiff or wav

i was surprised the first time i found out that pcm must be little-endian in a wav big-endian in an aiff

1479823
min	max
how can i use a min max boundary instead of a length value

1479827
accessor	superclass
if you access myviewcontroller.view before you call loadview then the superclass accessor is smart enough to call loadview for you and viewdidload immediately thereafter

1479836
put	get
if i ever need any arguments to the message then i use the list tool i ve put in the context to get an array from the list of arguments i ll typically create right there in the template

put	get
you can also put them in cte s or views to get the same effect

1479880
pull	push
and even if the pull worked will the heroku remote get confused about a push that originated from some new git repo

1479958
postgresql	mysql
while mysql postgresql and other open source db s are easy for us to test on since we - the developers - all use these daily testing those products is easy

1479963
squash	branch
just create a new branch and do all the squash there

1479993
x86	64bit	int	double
however x86-64 gives you more than just a 64bit address space and 64bit int registers - it also double the number of general purpose registers which on a register-deficient architecture like x86 can result in a significant performance increase with just a recompile

1479996
iboutlet	ibaction
i mean old iboutlet and ibaction still shows up

1480014
width	height
i ve seen things like this happen when something is filling a container at 100 width and height and that container has overflow auto

punctuation	words
this will partially fix the space-stripping issue although words at the end of a string or followed by punctuation can still cause issues

1480086
width	height
namely the height width and constrain proportions parameters

1480086
width	height
in the resulting file the resolution is correct but the height and width are calculated using the pdf s original height and width multiplied by the resolution and the image is constrained to the original proportions

1480086
width	height
i thought it might be a collision with specifying the resolution and the height width in pixels so i tried omitting the resolution but then it just defaults to 300

1480096
versioning	upgrade
with the recent browser update the wii has flash lite 3.1 upgrade from flash 7 which has support for h264 adobe flash lite versioning comparison

1480148
vbscript	jscript
batch files powershell vbscript jscript ruby perl python c# whatever

1480148
vbscript	jscript
powershell and higher end stuff will give you more control but you could even do this with the windows script host with vbscript or jscript

1480148
vbscript	jscript
folder management with vbscript - this has quite a few good examples of using the wscript filesystemobject jscript is just different in syntax

1480308
strsplit	substr
so strsplit . will split str into substr separated by a single literal . character

1480313
hash	md5
it s simple to precalculate the md5 hash of a few billion potential passwords words names the same with a- 4 i- 1 o- 0 substitutions words doubled or with a 1 tacked on the end short random strings etc. and store them indexed in a table with the passwords that generated them

1480313
hash	salt
if you re doing this for security look into the possibility of storing hash salt passwords as a start

right now i have all that logic in the code behind because more often than not i need to have values from other form controls and or underlying datasource to determine if switching tabs is allowed or whether i disable toolbar buttons or i display error message etc

1480376
post	get
most asp.net sites the one you referenced included will actually post their queries back to themselves using the http post verb not the get verb

1480377
inherited	subclassing
think of it as oo programming you would not put methods that are used only in subclassing b that inherited from class a to that parent class a and in the process make that method available in all classes inheriting from a while they will never be used there or even worse be misused.

1480380
openssl	m2crypto

1480417
put	get
and in second pass i get the values for all the data and put it in the database

1480448
ordinals	difference
re your comments and clarification okay so your difference is not simply by value but by ordinals position of the row

1480459
integer	unsigned
variable types classes there are a number of numeric classes both floating point and signed unsigned integer types that variables can use

1480459

i am using an int field in the db to represent collection of boolean in order to save some space

1481021
int	boolean
the int is used in my business logic and transformed into collection boolean attributes

1481021
int	boolean
i v now decided to add admin section to the site using dynamic data feature and i am wondering whether there is an option to show the boolean that represent that int

the __ function is a language localization function which takes an english language literal string and returns the a translation string for an application-defined locale

1481114
post	get
the get and post data is the data that my script is receiving

1481132
lisp	scheme
the reason this process is associated with lisp is because of the highly lucid paper the art of the interpreter which shows several metacircular interpreters based on scheme

1481132
lisp	prolog
this is also vastly easier to do in a homoiconic language a language whose code can be manipulated as data at runtime such as lisp prolog and forth

1481132
scheme	prolog
in scheme or prolog it s often less than a page of code

1481133
slideup	slidedown
it does the background-position change but not the slideup or slidedown any idea why

1481139
width	margin
i m setting the width of the table so that it should extend the margin of the page

1481174
int	double
because 1.0 has type double and compiler really doesn t know what type to choose between int and float so it asks you to give it a hint

1481231
folder	directory
contained the full path to the application models directory and therefore loading is faster since ci doesn t have to look in different folder global application

1481257
getdate	dateadd
e.g select dateadd hh -1 getdate

1481265
hide	show
if you mean it show intermediate packages org org.apache org.apache.junit etc. you can restore the eclipse filters to hide empty parent packages and hide

if anyone can extend the damn simpletest plugin to include phpunit i d like to hear about it

1481322
ubuntu	debian
since it doesn t happen for everybody i can only assume the ubuntu debian have added something to python to auto load modules

1481381
ienumerable	icollection
so many times we have a function that accepts an ienumerable or icollection as a parameter

1481381
ienumerable	icollection
but i wonder is there a more elegant way to create the required ienumerable or icollection

1481381
ienumerable	icollection
and the compiler would create the most abstract possible collection that would satisfy the needs of ienumerable or icollection depending on which one the function accepts

1481381
ienumerable	icollection
anyhow how you would pass o1 o2 and o3 to an ienumerable or icollection parameters

1481392
ant	maven
there are also maven tasks for ant though they are not as fully featured

1481392
ant	maven
you can also use the mercury tasks to deploy to a maven repository using an ant build file

will have different results based on the localization internationalization

1481411
maven	m2e

for example if i put a log statement at the beginning of responseforpid and at the end i get output like this

1481456
for-loop	arrays
instead of just iterating through an arrays with a for-loop which is damn near to instant we will gracefully handle each load by themselves

1481487
ssl	https
proxy using basic auth over https is not secure when the ssl is tunneled

1481518
gmail	hotmail
and web-based like yahoo hotmail gmail .

1481532
int	boolean
and generaldata someobject and someotherobject all have a mix of various types of parameters strings int boolean datetimes. it is very likely especially during initial development that i will build the json on the client side incorrectly

1481536
getter	setter
by default eclipse generates getter setter according to javabeans regular properties style

1481536
getter	setter
as of j2se 5.0 javabeans specification allows indexedpropertychangeevents which have a different getter setter naming scheme for arrays

1481536
getter	setter
how can you configure eclipse to generate getter and setter which follow this style

i ve got this code that works in the latest version of firefox opera and i m not sure if in ie8 but it doesn t work in google-chrome safari and ofc ie7 and 6

1481617
opera	firefox
as i wrote before the code i have looks different but i need to start a function after i click on the and it only works in firefox opera .

1481618
firefox	safari
i ve managed to hammer together the effects i want and everything s working fine on firefox safari

1481622
qobject	qsharedpointer	qobject	qscopedpointer	qscopedpointer	qshareddata	qsharedpointer	qshareddata	qsharedpointer	qscopedpointer
many qt classes are derived from qobject and while some of the built in smart pointer classes are related to qobject or qshareddata the qsharedpointer and qscopedpointer templates appear to allow pointers to anything

1481624
qabstractitemmodel	qstandarditemmodel
the more effecient approach would be implementing your own model with qabstractitemmodel interface instead of using qstandarditemmodel

1481641
xna	slimdx
you could use xna or slimdx or another direct3d wrapper

1481674
put	get
in this instance i d put a flag on the employee to signify who is the owner and sort by this column to get the right record 1st

1481696
hide	show
i have all the html code figured out using jquery to show hide divs

1481723
cldc	midp
and as well i would think they would be included in cldc 1.1 midp 2.0 so if you find them there we can conclude that their footprint is negligible plus probably implemented in an optimized built-in thus being of virtually no cost to use them

1481740
width	height
insert the image element into your page and specify the width and the height and the browser will scale the image for you

1481740
width	height
if you want to avoid this then you probably do want to use javascript load the image into your page detect its natural height and width then either use simple arithmetic to scale to something that will fit within both the width and height or scale so that at least one is and display the image inside a div with a fixed width and height and a style of overflow hidden to crop

1481762
width	height
to force layout you can give the element a width or a height or use the old zoom 1

1481839
int	chars
i really don t get it why would i want to implicitly convert chars to int

1481872
hide	show
i have a button on click of which i want to either show hide a content which is places in a div

1481889
comparator	comparable
one is as noted comparator vs comparable and don t forget equals

1481890
freebsd	opensolaris	freebsd	linux	freebsd	netbsd	openbsd	freebsd	openbsd	linux	openbsd	netbsd	opensolaris	openbsd	opensolaris	netbsd
the freedesktop group has a specification for an xdg-open command which works on all freedesktop-compliant graphical desktops be they linux freebsd netbsd openbsd dragonflybsd opensolaris or otherwise

1481898
post	get
i ve only watched the video on that page so far but it looks like you ll be able to get edit and post feeds to your google accounts

1481929
windows	wow64
i would not be surprised to see wow64 as an install option as early as windows 8 as more software migrates to 64-bit

1481945
int	chars
studing the code in schaum s c++ book i saw a lot of code using chars int etc

1481945
int	chars
i want to know what is the difference between a chars and a pointer chars - int and a pointer int

1481954
int	chars
a normal variable for example a chars or an int contains the value of that datatype itself - the variable can hold a chars or an int

1481958
int	chars
with a chars or int the variable value is the actual assigned value - a or 42

1481958
int	chars
with a chars or int the variable value is the location in memory where the actual assigned value is saved

1481970
int	chars
when you have chars or int or long or anything like that then memory is set aside to hold the value so a chars is 1 byte of memory for storage

1481975
hide	show
- is possible to have more granular control over jquery ui dialog widgetâ s show hide method

1482007
versioning	upgrade
edited to add if you want to download a versioning of xcode that actually will install on the versioning of mac os x that you have if you can t upgrade for some reason you might be able to find older versioning on developer.apple.com but they re kind of hard to find

1482084
cvs	svn
svn or cvs is a must have so you should always get access to your co-workers parts and can see the existing interfaces and the description

1482131
regasm	gacutil
added it to the gac using gacutil then registered it using regasm and created a type library tlb file

1482140
nsstring	nsdata
perhaps convert an nsstring to a c string and use its nsdata representation as the post variable value

1482149
aggregate-functions	sum	min	max
use group by and aggregate-functions sum min max etc to collapse the many rows into the output row set you want

1482169
int	chars
at one point many languages did distinguish greatly between chars and int but since they always had to have conversion functions it didn t actually block very much and it did just become a big pain

1482169
ord	chr
no one really wants to go back to the days of chr n and ord c all over the place

1482169
int	chars
once c came out with chars s really being int s it rocked and we ve stayed with that even in much more strongly typed languages

1482170
int	chars
for me it does make sense - the set of all chars is included in the set of all int s and therefore applying my own guidelines for using implicits the conversion should really be implicit

1482170
int	chars
edit actually if you have a good look at the scala api chars does have an overloaded + method which takes an int argument

1482170
int	chars
also note that the example i have gave you had nothing to do with allowing adding int s to chars s

1482170
int	chars
the more subtle point is that when you add an int to a chars you get an int

1482170
int	chars
also note the more theoretical answer i have given - chars is a subset of int

1482261
for-loop	loops
loops backwards over the collection using a regular indexed for-loop which i believe is not an option in the case of a hashset

1482295
hide	show
i m specifically looking for a elegant way of letting javascript handle the hide and show after php initially loads the page

1482325
superclass	subclassing
my goal is simply to isolate a method in the superclass from overriding in subclassing which would break the other base methods

1482326
post	get
there s a great tutorial on setting up windbg here and in some of the comments on the post there are instructions on how to run your .exe from within windbg and get an immediate dump

1482367
linefeed	delimiter
the only solid delimiter is the cr linefeed

1482370
background-color	transparency
javascript - much like the coloured boxes below layer 1 place a further element layer 3 over the rounded corners image layer 2 but making the background-color transparency for those interactable boxes then referencing the javascript to move the 1st layer boxes as well as the 3rd layer boxes

1482372
crossover	mutation
next we design the crossover operator as usual one- or two-points crossover and mutation as well flip one bit at random

1482383
put	get
also i put this into my ipython and get this

1482422
rdf	owl
i m looking for a graphical browser for examining large networks of owl rdf instances

1482450
libtiff	libpng	libjpeg	libpng	libjpeg	libtiff
when i remove the files starting with libgif libjpeg libpng and libtiff from opt local lib the problem goes away and java -version works but the ports that depend on those files break

1482470
post	get
bonus question can you change a get to a post while redirecting

1482506
savefiledialog	openfiledialog
see the openfiledialog and savefiledialog classes in particular

1482509
post	get
however neither post nor get alone are more or less restful - both are strings of data just in slightly different parts of the request

1482539
objectdatasource	formview
i have an objectdatasource that i m using with a formview and it works fine but i want to change one small thing

1482541
toupper	uppercase
simply convert the relevant character to uppercase with toupper and then you can recognize both a and a as hexidecimal 10

1482565
width	height
the 0 0 are supposed to specify the new width and height of the window in pixels

1482582
getter	setter
back in the 2nd level have getter setter

1482590
post	get
post get live and so on have those issues

1482610
udp	tcp
two are tcp and the other udp

1482610
udp	tcp
for instance when i receive a large amount of data from one of the tcp ports i don t want my udp stream interrupted.

1482630
freebsd	linux	freebsd	solaris
on windows this is io completion ports on mac os x and freebsd kqueue 2 on solaris event ports on linux epoll on vms qio

1482640
doc	rtf
or if your doc is going to be used in template-like manner you could create the rtf file by hand in wordpad and save it with special strings that you invent like your_name_here

1482676
libevent	epoll
but at scale you d want to use select poll epoll libevent etc

1482677
accessor	properties
are you using properties and synthesize or are you writing your own accessor

1482677
accessor	properties
the declared properties section of the objective-c 2.0 programming laungauge is a good resource for rules of declaring synthesized accessor

1482689
mouse	keyboard
i need no editing no selection no dynamic resizing of columns no default cell drawing behaviour no effects when the mouse moves over things no keyboard shortcuts

1482703
folder	directory	svnadmin	visualsvn
for example if you installed visualsvn you will need to use the svnadmin located in the bin folder of the installation directory

1482711
boost	allocator
also this doesn t help you with the non-crt memory allocator functions heapalloc globalalloc localalloc virtualalloc etc though boost almost certainly uses the crt functions

1482766
vbscript	jscript
another possibility beyond powershell which is a good one is to use wmi with jscript or vbscript to access the software store

1482781
int	chars
this method first writes the length of the string as a utf-7 encoded unsigned int and then writes that many chars to the stream by using the binarywriter instance s current encoding

1482781
int	chars
this method first writes the length of the string as a four-byte unsigned int and then writes that many chars to the stream by using the binarywriter instance s current encoding

1482792
versioning	upgrade
upgrade to restlet 1.1.5 the latest versioning

1482799
actionscript	mxml
mxml is not rendered directly it is first compiled into actionscript 3.0 and then into a typical swf.

1482811
pop-up	dialog
but a user name and password dialog box pop-up and i have no idea what to type in

1482821

some server implementations have strange ways of loading the post and get variables i believe this is the case

1482823
gif	png
after installed it reads gif with no problem however for jpeg and png i keep getting this error

1482831
pull	push
push the recent changes from the new git repository to heroku then switch to the old repository and pull from heroku

1482865
vmware	virtualbox	virtualbox	parallels
the harder one is to put up a linux server - perhaps as a guest under windows using virtualbox free or vmware or parallels pay and then follow one of the many sets of instructions google will lead you to

1482898
pascal	delphi
do you know any online code beautifier and formatter for delphi or pascal syntax

firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
looks fine in firefox safari 4 google-chrome

1483035
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
this code works fine on its own tested in safari mac firefox mac opera mac ie7 and ie8 so you may be able to shoehorn it into your existing html

1483066
google-chrome	firefox
have you tried different browsers such as ie firefox or google-chrome

1483073
gif	png
i tried using png jpg gif with and without transparency

1483078
equals	gethashcode
operators to get the expected behaviour - and when you override equals it is important to override gethashcode too otherwise you break usage as a key - why is it important to override gethashcode when equals method is overriden in c#

1483096
integer	unsigned
you mean like bigint unsigned integer math library

1483148
vbscript	jscript
for jscript i have tried to but i am not able to find the equivalent to the 2 methods specified in the vbscript class or the class itself at the above location and these are stringify converting javascript data structures into json text and parse to turn json text into object

1483226
realloc	malloc
realloc to extend a malloc ed array

1483227
iframe	prettyphoto
i am using jquery prettyphoto 2.5.3 and i was wondering how i can get the light box to display in the parent window of an iframe when an image link inside the iframe is selected

1483294
webclient	httpwebrequest
like i was using webclient however it seems it can t handle the gzip bit need to drop back to httpwebrequest

1483302
touchesbegan	touchesended
solved it turned out that there should be also touchesbegan and touchesended implementations in my case having empty methods helped in the tile otherwise the gesture started propagating to parent views and they were intercepting the gesture somehow

1483331
post	get
feed not in the actual sense but you know like those little reports you get on facebook eg when someone post a picture you get a simple report saying in your main page that - so and so added a picture or so and so added a comment

1483344
move	drag
and each time i use mouse mouse drag c b and c will move together

1483347
puts	gets
i have made it so when the user gets a high score it puts the score they got onto the label but i would now like to know how i can save it so that when the app is opened again it will still have the high score this is my code for detecting when a high score is made

1483350
atoi	strtok
use strtok and atoi

1483354
vim	emacs
also unless you re talking about the command line editing modes vim and emacs handle their own keyboard mapping

1483368
ubuntu	linux
i am trying to port an objective-c application to run on linux ubuntu at the moment

1483403
stringstream	fstream
i think this question is applicable to all kind of stream types in c++ also like fstream and stringstream

1483441
ostringstream	std
note that although the logging class in that article uses c++ stream syntax it does this via a std ostringstream object that is created and destroyed for every logging event and so is not shared between threads

1483448
width	height
i loaded paint and found the first man starts at 16 pixels across and 0 down and has a width of 16 pixels and a height of 16 pixels there is a black space on the left of the image

1483454
entities	entitymanager
it uses standard jpa annotations to define entities but exposes a much simpler api no entitymanager or any of that attached detached entities crap

1483456
division	modulo
the ones that use modulo and division operations

1483456
post	get
now i think that you could get all the possible binary search trees of size n by permuting just the integers 1 to n but i m not entirely sure and attempting to prove that is a bit too much for this post

1483479
dictionary	map
that is if you have a route like specific edit 5646-0767-... it will map the guid into the route value dictionary with key id regardless of what the parameter on your method is named

1483515
getter	setter
scalas getter and setter may also relate to your magic

1483525
wordpress	joomla
possibly using joomla or wordpress

1483538
apache	lighttpd
assuming that you re building a web-browser i d suggest using your own computer as a server using apache lighttpd whether windows linux or mac

1483549
fgets	strtok
it basically uses an fgets loop to read each line in and strtok to separate that line into fields

1483554
post	get
if it s okay for the button name to be get rather than post data in your boxy callback append it to the form s action as a query parameter

1483558
instances	transient
this code throws an exception when transaction.commit is running and the exception is object references an unsaved transient instances - save the transient instances before flushing

1483562
put	get
this means that when you put something into ets it is copied into it and when you take it out you get a copy in your process

1483562
put	get
so when you look things up in it you get a reference to the exact same value you put in it

1483581
viewdidload	viewdidappear	viewdidload	viewwillappear	viewdidappear	viewwillappear
none of the viewdidload viewwillappear viewdidappear methods of the associated view controller uitableviewcontroller are of useâ here as they all fire too early

1483581
viewdidload	viewdidappear	viewdidload	viewwillappear	viewdidappear	viewwillappear
when restoring the scroll position using scrollrecttovisible animated i need the table view to already have sufficient data in it or else the scrollrecttovisible animated method call does nothing which is what happens if you place the call on its own in any of viewdidload viewwillappear or viewdidappear

1483598
instances	transient
your detail instances is transient which means that is has not been added to your nhibernate session

1483611
ironruby	ironpython
i would have hoped at this point in time that more work be done on creating such an environment with ironruby ironpython

1483646
int	chars
chars constants are of type int so it s equivalen to plain 0

1483669
put	get
however i want to test the call in wsf windows script i put the code below in a file called test.wsf when i run the code i get an error

1483670
min	max
i wish to get a random date time between two date times min date time and max date time

1483670
min	max
meaning all 100 items will have random date times between the min max date time period

1483698
nsstring	uifont
through trial and error you could use nsstring s method - cgsize sizewithfont uifont font to find out the maximum width allowed on a badge

1483728
mp3	wav
convert the mp3 to a wav

1483738
factors	matrix
you have to consider multiple factors so decision will be lying in a matrix and you have to feed multiple things and you will get your answer i would enlist some feature

1483744
getter	setter
getter setter related

1483788
addition	multiplication
it requires only a few decisions followed by a multiplication and addition and can approximate any curve

1483801
mxml	haxe
haxe will also compile on the server but is much less resource intensive than mxml .

1483819
pull	push
i m looking for a cross-platform tool to support performing an operation on multiple repos at the same time tag pull push commit etc... essentially i m looking for the repo script that google wrote for android but for hg instead of git

1483828
cpython	ironpython
the three that are certainly solid mature and complete enough for production use are cpython ironpython and jython

1483828
jython	pypy	cpython	ironpython	cpython	pypy
cpython ironpython jython and pypy can all run django other implementations might also be complete enough for that but i m not certain

1483845
google-chrome	firefox
i recommend playing with mozilla firefox and google-chrome if you want to see tabs at their finest. br

1483888
width	height
further proof the definitions of width and height

1483888
width	height
the width and height classes only

1483905
width	height
in your scenario element should probably not inherit from width and height but instead width and height should be data members of element

1483905
width	height
it s composition as opposed to is-a since arguably an element is-not-a width or height but is composed of a width and height and probably some other stuff too

1483915
lotus	sametime
i have been trying to develop a plugin to be executed inside lotus sametime

1483941
integer	unsigned
this union allows me to access the unsigned integer byte or word-wise

1483947
button	checkbox
if the report header looks to be suppressed you need to check the section expert for the suppress checkbox associated with the report header section it can be set conditionally - kill the button next to the suppress checkbox to see if there s any code

1484045
serializable	deserialization
serializable and deserialization fast and small

1484071
children	parent
have the parent process create the file streams with tmpfile so that both the parent and children share the files

1484071
children	parent
there are some minor coordination issues to handle - the parent will need to seek back to the start before reading what the children wrote and it should only do that after the child has exited

1484071
children	parent
you are still faced with the problem of getting file names from children to parent

1484071
children	parent
consequently you need to ensure the parent reads all the pipes completely bearing in mind that the children won t be able to exit until all the data has been read strictly all but the last buffer full has been read

1484080
debian	linux
i m on shared server environment dreamhost.com uses linux debian

1484153
redmine	trac
i m the author of bugtracker.net which like many other bug trackers trac redmine fogbugz integrates with svn

1484153
cvs	svn
edit i ve taken a look at one attempt at github-fogbugz integration but even the author of that says it s fairly obvious that fogbugz was written for a more traditional cvs svn scm system in mind

1484228
width	height
but in my program only the high threshold image is getting copied.the low threshold valid pixels are not getting drawn.moreover this code is working for larger images not smaller images i really cant understant y because i have nowhere hardcoded the values of the width and height

1484254
superclass	subclassing
to retrieve an object from the database the superclass and subclassing tables are joined

1484254
inherited	properties
all properties including inherited are mapped to the table of the concrete class

1484343
cdr	cons
cons x cdr n

1484347
min	max
it s trivial to write a function to determine the min max value in an array such as

1484358
int	chars
it has two private helper methods one of which determines the max value in an int and the other returns the occurrences of a chars in a string

1484359
g++	gcc
consider using g++ instead of gcc which automaticaly sets the correct settings when compiling c++

1484373
dictionary	map
there also comes a point where assuming that the map is pre-built mapping types to methods with a dictionary will be faster than traversing a linear list of types which is essentially what using a bunch of if blocks gets you

1484410
subtract	add
in other words whenever you add or subtract to it then check if it s greater than 90 and set it to 90 or if it s less than -90 then set it to -90

1484421
int	double
i m thinking of precalculating in milimetres which means the key could be an int the value would be a double

1484447
post	get
you can get your most recent post as json so you can have a bit of javascript which would get the most recent post then apply some extra css magic

1484457
post	put
in the first post in the according type block block text block photo etc.. put custom css that overrides the default style and you re done

1484459
put	get
you get the idea that all you care about is being a and you put less emphasis on the actual implementation

1484473
postorder	inorder
the complexity for this algorithm i believe is o n o n for inorder postorder traversals the rest of the steps again being o n since they are nothing more than simple iterations in arrays

1484474
hash	salt
in this case you will hash the password with some salt and you ll store the username salt and hash password in such a way that given the username you can easily find the other two values

1484474
hash	salt
first off that means that salt and hash are not relevant

1484474
hash	salt
this is as safe as the application password which is stored in the original salt hash format

1484494
min	max
here s a utility class providing min max methods for primitive types primitives.java

1484579
debian	linux
as i commented above all your examples are working as you expect on my linux box debian lenny python2.5 processing 0.52 see test code below

1484598
sudo	passwd
you need to login as a superuser sudo su and type your passwd then try that command

1484639
post	get
as for get post request via links

1484688
post	get
you can t alter anything inside of an iframe which is not in your domain assuming you are trying to get rid of the javascript code in the yahoo iframe from your other post

1484694
post	get
if i ever get around to writing some kind of proof of concept i ll post here what i learn

1484733
realloc	malloc
since your function cannot tell ahead of time how much space is needed certainly not for the pipe or terminal inputs you have to be prepared to deal with dynamic memory allocation - malloc and realloc

1484761
accessor	properties
the data class precious which is used to hold the properties accessor and operations that affect a single member of the class

1484803
firefox	safari
tested in firefox 3.5.3 safari ie8 chrome.

1484807
spoofing	traffic
problem traffic is about 80 folks who will work to be sure they do not do work - every site that i have seen that stays up uses some sort of human-has-to-think authentication ipv4 is a constant source of spoofing intrusions and news reports which you want to stay out of ipv6 approaches the matter with engineering-grade work

1484813
sorting	filtering
the sample is very basic since it only works for paging but could be easily extended to include sorting and filtering

1484819
getter	setter
b if you do map onto properties getter and setter do not need to be public

1484887
phpunit	simpletest
i haven t worked in php before but from what i ve seen you may want to consider simpletest or phpunit

1484909
width	height
i need to edit the width height parameters in both the and tags one having a px suffix and the other not having one at all which is totally random some codes have it in all cases others do not

1484909
width	height
firstly i m trying to find out the width height of the existing video..

1484909
width	height
and then replacing the existing values with the new values width 640 and height xxx which is based on the aspect ratio of the video

1484915
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
tested in latest ie firefox opera safari google-chrome

1484934
width	height
here s how to get the width and height

1484950
cout	cin
however most of the programs we are writing make use of cin and cout for input output

1484950
cout	cin
cout works fine as output as you can see what it puts out in the application output but there is no way to provide to cin as if it were on a console like visual studio uses for its c++

1484986
accessor	properties
you ve set up your properties to retain the value but then you re not using the accessor methods but set the instance variable directly instead

1485018
stdout	stderr
you can use glib.io_add_watch to watch for output on the pipes connected to stdout and stderr in the subprocess object

uiview	calayer
and don t worry about the memory impact of a uiview that s 320x480 pixels it won t consume any significant memory because the calayer doesn t have any meaningful content

1485051
gridview	sqldatasource	gridview	repeater
here is the code from my example - nothing tricky here just bound a string array to a repeater and bound the gridview to a sqldatasource with the select and delete commands specified

1485052
google-chrome	safari
browsers like safari and google-chrome animate this without any glitches

1485073

i would think of a library of functions as say the set of math functions that exist in most modern languages sin cos square root and so forth

1485091
width	height
dnn5 iframe module is fairly good at resizing height not width

1485127

1485382
hash	salt
hash and the salt

1485390
vb.net	vb6
at present the current method is to develop the usercontrol in c# and then have a vb.net usercontrol which inherits from the c# version and host the vb.net control in the vb6 form

1485437
phpunit	simpletest
one interesting idea i ve heard regarding this topic is to use test driven development tdd where you write the tests using phpunit or simpletest and then hand that off to the development team

1485446
submit	submission
i am trying to insert row into table 1 get the id-a to insert in table 2 along with the id-b that is auto-generated in table 3 when i submit each string c all in one submission to db

1485447
hide	show
i can selectively hide show each pane as i move off-screen to the next pane

1485454
memcpy	memmove
usually memcpy and memmove have been highly optimized already for your compiler s clib

1485461
return-value-optimization	nrvo
since it s returning a potentially large vector by value this depends heavily on your compiler implementing the named return-value-optimization nrvo but 1 the worst case is that it does about what you were doing before anyway and 2 virtually all reasonably current compilers do implement nrvo

1485480
mktime	strtotime
i am thinking of using the date strtotime mktime and time php functions

1485500
expander	grid
i ve extended the grid control with a simple method that fires when the expander is expanded i would call this

1485568
hash	salt
all they would have is the hash and the salt

1485568
hash	salt
the basic idea of hashing passwords is that the attacker has knowledge of the hashing algorithm and has access to both the hash and the salt

1485568
hash	salt
by selecting a cryptographic strong hash function and a suitable salt value that is different for each password the computational effort required to guess the password is so high that the cost exceeds the possible gain the attacker can get from guessing the password

1485568
hash	salt
in general this is true but when it comes to securing passwords by storing them as hash you should still assume that the attacker has full access to the hash and design your system accordingly by choosing an appropriate hash function and using salt

1485568
hash	salt
however if a unique salt is used to compute the hash for each password a precomputed table becomes useless as it is different for each salt and cannot be reused

1485581
distutils	buildout
the most useful resource that i found so far are the videos from pycon 2009 on setuptools distutils and buildout

1485585
children	parent
yet the classic tree data structure i was taught in school has a root and is implemented with single pointers from parent to children in other words a diagram of it would look like what you are calling an arborescence

1485712
vb.net	vb6
i ve come across a couple of issues - particularly with code converted from vb6 to vb.net where the 0 indexing of collections has meant that bugs have been introduced into code and am therefore wary of them

1485782
folder	directory
copyitematpath topath error will copy an entire folder to a new location if the atpath is a directory

1485787
vb.net	vb6
since you ve mentioned them it sounds as though you ve inherited some vb6 code that was possibly converted to a vb.net project

1485787
vb.net	vb6
otherwise if it was a new vb.net project i see no value in using the vb6 methods

1485787
vb.net	vb6
i ve been on a few vb6 to vb.net conversion projects

put	get
also itâ s give the information i want but i don t how to put in list or dictionary or in class so i can get data by passing parameter as a country name

1485958
put	get
in short first it must put all data in list or dictionary and then you can call list or dictionary get data filter by country

1485980
mouseover	mouseout
of the mainstream browsers only firefox supports mouseover mouseout events on options so you should probably abandon the first part

1486001
ftp	telnet
you could look at the expect command this is a scriptable solution for running telnet ftp etc on remote machines

1486005
pop-up	dialog
i need the running first instance to take some special action pop-up a dialog in this case but for the secondary instances to terminate

i ve written a little application for consuming memory either on disk or ram

1486108
cart	oscommerce
have a look at zen cart or oscommerce

1486142
stdout	stderr
your in-application logging is useful but you should be logging any output that goes to stdout and stderr as well you don t define the platform your app is running on but this basically applies to all of them

1486147
pascal	delphi
even though the underlying code is that same if you call it from delphi you always have to make a mental switch between the pascal and c++

1486171
superclass	subclassing
this is because on the superclass you can t express that subclassing are either leaf or branch

1486191
profiling	debugging
then i created a simple .cmd file which uses the commmandline tools of visual studio to build this solution with their respective debugging release profiling configurations

1486296
width	height
ie8 just seems to ignore my width height left and top of every element that is created

1486307
int	double

1486562
pull	push
they might choose to keep some private pull only the branches from the remote that they are interested in or push a new branch to the remote tracker

1486567
stdout	stderr
another option is to use native win32 calls like attachconsole to manually create the console and attach it to stdout and stderr

1486650
post	put
so you can uncomment the calls to this code and follow the instructions in the other post to put the class files on your project classpath

1486656
stdout	stderr
you can redirect stdout stderr quite easily make a class that derives from std basic_streambuf and overloads xsputn and overflow then use eg std cerr.rdbuf instanceofyourredirectclass to redirect all stderr ouptut to a callback function you supply

1486720
prepare	execute
4 execute the prepare statement

1486802
button	checkbox
beware that this works not for regular push button but for checkbox there should be no problem

1486806
inherited	properties
the new child definition inherited most of the properties of the parent and any of those properties can be overridden

1486821

i hook onkeypressed onclick onblur and onchange events for input field but none of that is fired when user pastes values using mouse into the field

1486898
mouse	keyboard
just to reiterate i need enable submit button when correct data have been entered in input field anyway keyboard or mouse

1486947

submit	submission
i run post script at submit button click action so it takes effect before validation and i could not change validation to run before post script so now it form submission without validating

1487175
firefox	safari
at least these common applications must be supported safari firefox no applescript

1487194
superclass	subclassing
the more general issue is methods in an opaque superclass that rely on the behaviour of other methods that could be changed by subclassing and what to do in the case that you want to subclassing an object to change behaviour like this

1487195
mockups	balsamiq
my favorite mockups tool balsamiq mockups

1487207
comparator	icomparer
you ve defined a generic-comparer instead of a comparator without a type icomparer

1487208
width	height
there are different interpretations of a window height width and you should know these quirks

1487214
folder	directory
i just want to know how can i get all the names of the folder in a current directory

1487214
folder	directory
for example in my current directory i have three folder

it can use the mousewheel aswell as the links to scroll between panes and it s available for scriptaculous and jquery

1487300
installation	upgrade
are you sure you have run the new installation of eclipse after the upgrade

1487311
superclass	subclassing
you could argue that the superclass is not well-designed for subclassing at least not in the way you want to

1487311
superclass	subclassing
it s even worse - this problem can happen to you even if you don t override methods in the superclass - see subtyping vs subclassing

1487332
public	protected
only use public inheritance or protected even when other classes methods will need to know use you as-a base

1487353
qgraphicsview	qgraphicsscene
take a look at qgraphicsscene and qgraphicsview

1487377
qlayout	qwidget
you can create a custom layout class that inherits from qlayout and overload the add qwidget w function with the coordinates

1487377
qgraphicsview	qgraphicsscene
personnally i m using qgraphicsview and qgraphicsscene

1487466
expression-blend	silverlight
the best way you could possibly understand how silverlight ui works is through the silverlight ui designers expression-blend and visual studio 2010 silverlight designer

1487466
expression-blend	silverlight
so download expression-blend start a new silverlight project place a control on the design surface and start fiddling around with it

1487494
inherited	properties
its also quite reasonable for code in the inherited base class to access its count properties and get what it expects

1487550
profiling	debugging
the development tools for iphone are way more competent with a everything you need from a very accurate simulator visual debugging and very nice profiling tools

1487552
subtract	add
you can add or subtract days from date and use the dateadd function to add or subtract intervals such as months

1487556
pexpect	subprocess
pexpect anywhere but windows and wexpect on windows are always my recommendations when you need to defeat buffering and read a subprocess s output in near real-time as you put it

1487558
equals	gethashcode
you need to override equals and gethashcode so that your types are compared by their values rather then by their references

1487559
equals	gethashcode
but i think you ll need your own gethashcode and equals methods

1487583
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
i m trying to open a new window and for some reason the scrollbars will not appear in firefox or ie but do work fine in google-chrome opera

1487597
vim	emacs
as an alternative you can use vim or emacs

1487616
autocomplete	autosuggest
i m using the php code below to get results to return to an autosuggest autocomplete

1487643
getter	setter
this is transparent to the clients of this class ie. they cannot usually tell and should not care whether the property reference is handled by providing access to the actual object attribute or by means of magic getter setter functions and it can be applied later if it turns out to be required that is

1487704
map	quadtree
so far i have implemented quadtree that returns the four boundaries of my map and returns whatever coordinates are within the viewable section of the map

1487710
3-tier	n-tier
as a pattern you ll find discussions of this under headings like 3-tier or n-tier design

1487712
maven	cobertura
it s a bit hackish but the approach i m using is to use a modified version of the maven cobertura plugin which is available from their repo

1487715
profiling	instrumentation
check your memory profiling over time using instrumentation

1487724
serializable	deserialization
this is an issue due to the complexity of the task and the maintenance overhead it generates that is any change to class state requires a change to the serializable deserialization routines

1487773
nunit	mstest
mstest comparisons and the developer community seems to pretty much overwhelmingly choose nunit

1487773
nunit	mstest
what i basically have to answer to justify using nunit in preference to mstest is this is there anything that i can do in nunit that i can t do with comparable effort in mstest

1487784
superclass	subclassing
yes subclassing can break superclass in various ways

1487784
superclass	subclassing
the best you can do is to act at human level - make sure that the human that writes the subclassing understands the superclass

1487815
free	malloc
i found the issue free -ing malloc -ed memory and delete -ing new -ed memory is not safe in the same program

1487821
hide	show
however the height of the div changes dynamically as pieces of a series of nested lists show and hide themselves on hover events

1487850
firefox	safari
is there a reason firefox and safari on my mac are skipping over the element when i tab between fields in this form

1487852
valgrind	memcheck
however the first thing i do on linux if i suspect it could be a memory error is to run the program through valgrind memcheck and see what it can tell me

1487867
inherited	properties
if i don t supply any binding flags then i get about 57 properties including things like system.reflection.module module and all sorts of other inherited things i don t care about

1487884
range	minimum
since a semicircle is convex for each y co-ordinate you get a fixed range of x so each entry in your lookup table gives maximum and minimum x co-ordinates

1487914
button	checkbox
how do i loop through all the records in the repeater on a button click event and save the state of the checkbox

1487920
getter	setter
1.1 data model class a class of data elements with setter getter

1487957
apache	nginx
you probably want to serve static files straight from apache nginx whatever

1487970
actualheight	actualwidth	actualheight	rowdefinition	actualwidth	rowdefinition
when you add or remove rows or columns the actualwidth for all columndefinition elements and the actualheight of all rowdefinition elements becomes zero until measure is called

1487982
getter	setter
this.fubar.bgroup calls the getter returns a boolgroup and with .a true you are calling the setter of the a property of boolgroup

1488047
daemons	launchd
but once it is run as a in production as a system-level launchd daemons under a different user the growl messages no longer appear

1488074

a binary null character is one that s all zeros 0x00 in hex

1488097
jquery	scriptaculous
use a library such as jquery or scriptaculous

1488117
width	height
is that the .center setter could set the origin to a non-integer point when either of the width or height is of the wrong parity

1488136
profiling	debugging
it s just a program although a good one - debugging it profiling it

1488189
prepare	execute
i went ahead and ran a test where one query uses a prepare statement and the other builds the entire query then execute that

1488219
memcached	apc
it supports apc memcached file etc as backends a.k.a storage

1488276
kerberos	ldap
i know i need to use kerberos for authentication and ldap for authorization

1488327
int	chars
if you need it to be unique i d suggest creating a counter and converting the int number to hex or even better base 36 26 chars + 10 digits

1488335
mechanize	curb
i ve used curb and mechanize for a similar project

1488345
argumentnullexception	argumentexception
so you shouldn t use argumentexception or argumentnullexception

1488407
getter	setter	argumentnullexception	argumentexception
so throw argumentnullexception in the setter on null and argumentexception on the empty string and do nothing in the getter

1488407
getter	setter
replace the property by methods a setter method that throws when passed an invalid value and a getter method that throws invalidoperationexception when the property was never assigned a valid value

1488424
wadl	wsdl
do you want like a wsdl wadl for twitter s web services

1488432
extjs	mootools
lastly each browser interprets javascript differently and with the more javascript you write the more potential there is for losing cross browser compatibility unless you implement a framework that such as jquery dojo extjs or mootools that handles most of that for you

1488434
freebsd	linux
this is basically using the unix select call although both freebsd and linux provide more optimized alternatives such as kqueue

1488435
rsa	dsa
there are many possible ways to configure ssh authentication basically boiling down to either sending password securely on the net or using public private key pairs rsa or dsa -- the latter is generally preferable but you ll need to check with system and network administrators about this issue.

1488440
post	get
if the login is incorrect and some text is filled in the username textbox after the login i receive the wrong username or password message which is good but if i fill in the form again no matter wheather it is correct or not i get you are not authorized to access that location. if i try to log for the third time the login works but i am redirected to users post instead of post the value for the redirect page which is stored in a session is still post

1488445
getter	setter
or hit alt + ins inside the surrounding class and you ll get all the options for generating getter and or setter you can think of -

1488472
getter	setter
when is it appropriate to throw an exception from within a property getter or setter

1488480
folder	directory
let ftp users access a folder outside of your web directory and then provide a mechanism for retrieving the file contents

1488488
accessor	properties
essentially they recommend that properties getters be lightweight accessor that are always safe to call

1488488
getter	setter
for indexers microsoft indicates that it is acceptable for both getter and setter to throw exceptions

1488498
getter	setter
it is almost never appropriate on a getter and sometimes appropriate on a setter

1488514
int	chars
i am unsure because the prototype of er_get_type has int for the type field whereas the ei.h file defines chars the above constants

1488527
versioning	upgrade
i want to know which dependency i ve got to rebuild with the new versioning of another library that i upgrade

1488529
mp3	wav
unfortunately only streaming of very simple audio content wav more often than mp3 if any is usually supported over a network connection and more often than not a call to createplayer string aurl will throw an exception if the url doesn t begin with file

1488558
integer	unsigned
you can avoid checking for non-negative quantities by using an unsigned integer

1488570
put	get
but it is also generally considered to be a good idea to design your classes such that it is simply not possible to get an invalid object initially or to put it into invalid state via normal means always ensure full initialization in constructors and try make methods exception-safe with respect to state validity and class invariants

1488584
strtol	atoi
the atoi function has been deprecated by strtol and should not be

1488584
strtol	atoi
i would use the strtol equivalent just for that reason but i doubt you have to worry about atoi being removed

1488585
ubuntu	linux
my code lives on a linux box running ubuntu of some fairly recent version but i use a macbook as my main computer

1488601
profiling	instrumentation
i a profiling my iphone application on target and according to instrumentation 65 of the time is spent in mach_msg_trap

1488632
firefox	safari
while on safari and firefox i get a list that renders properly on ie it just displays a paragraph

1488633
post	get
try seeing what you get from the selectedtext field and post your control creation function

1488664
strtol	atoi
the description of atoi has one very important point in relation to the similarities differences to strtol

1488675
inline	inlining
methods that contain exception-handling blocks are not inline though methods that throw exceptions are still candidates for inlining

1488676
submit	submission
what i ve taken to doing for controlling the ui and support functions of my games screen flow score submission level advancement is to place a series of static functions in a main game controller class that handles all the logic for showing hiding game screens advancing an iterator through a leveldata array and handling all the server side submit from one central location

1488731
django	turbogears
turbogears 2 is the built on top of the experience of several next generation web frameworks including turbogears 1 of course django and rails

punctuation	words
by the way you have to delete the punctuation marks in order to find the words in your database i think one of your first lines should before the explode be similar to this

1488771
kerberos	ldap
as a sort-of-workaround because active directory supports gssapi and because of how kerberos works you ought to be able to use the user s credentials to request a kerberos ticket for accessing ldap then store that ticket as your state session

1488771
kerberos	ldap
this kerberos ticket would only be valid for accessing ldap and would auto-expire so this would avoid the pitfalls of storing the user s credentials in the session

1488772
implements	extends
assume i create a bll layer and then provide some additional interfaces which consumers could implements to extends bllâ s build-in functionality

this example will work if the target type is int short long or unsigned variants since the input string represents a non-negative number double float or decimal

1488803
public	protected
i prefer to check for null for all reference types parameters of public protected methods

1488805
public	protected
unless you re using code contracts i d say it s good practice to check arguments for any public protected member - as well as explicitly documenting whether they can or can t be null

1488806
firefox	safari
i ve seen consistent results in firefox and internet explorer that break down in safari and sometimes ie is the odd browser out

1490011
cpython	ironpython
i do not want to switch to realtimestylus -- first because it won t work on windows xp plus smart interactive whiteboard second because i can t see how to use realtimestylus in cpython so i would need to switch to ironpython and then my code would no longer run on linux mac

1490119
post	get
however as noted in the text for the 302 redirect most browsers ignore this and simply change the post to a get instead at which point your parameters are gone

1490147
getter	setter
an operation that reads the variable increments it and then writes the incremented value back to the property might need to be locked but locking the individual getter and setter would be totally inadequate

1490151
accessor	properties
user data can be retrieved by extracting and decrypting the forms authentication ticket then using the userdata properties accessor on the decrypted ticket

1490154
cpython	ironpython
but in implementations other than cpython jython and ironpython to name two there is no guarantee just when a destructor will get called so something more proactive needs to be built into your method

1490165
children	parent
also if you hide a parent element the children are hidden too so you probably want to do that.

1490168
apache	nginx
if production i would recommend running the mochiweb instance on a different port so it can run as a user and then using a proxy like nginx or apache to listen on 80 and forward the request

1490185
post	put	post	get	put	get
it s been a while but istr having to use get and post for everything when using these no restful put and delete

expression-blend	silverlight
i m building a prototype using expression-blend 3 and sketchflow a silverlight sketchflow application to be specific and it consists of multiple screens that i want to share state between

1490225
getter	setter
do you recommend using getter and setter or accessing the member variables directly

1490225
getter	setter
this is simple contrived example to discuss using getter setter vs variables

1490227
put	get
to get backup and put file with status

1490236
post	put
two tables can have different sets of columns so if there are columns meaningful for one type of post but not the other you can put these columns in the respective table without having to leave them null when not applicable

1490240
post	put
for example i would not put post and replies in the same table because they are different entities

1490248
getter	setter
discuss using getter setter vs

1490248
getter	setter
you shouldn t write plain getter setter because they are as bad as exposing the variables them selves

1490253
getter	setter
calling virtual functions in ctors is a bad idea but setter and getter are unlikely to be virtual

1490253
getter	setter
benefits if the setter getter does something complicated you re not repeating code

1490253
getter	setter
for immutable classes of course you don t have setter and you don t need getter as const members and references can be public as no one can change reseat them

1490263
getter	setter
same with setmystring if the answer is yes you are better off with access methods since you don t have to change your code in zillion places but just modify those getter and setter methods

1490282
stdout	stderr
i m pretty certain that stdout even if it s not line buffered like stderr will autoflush if you attempt to read from stdin at least in most environments i ve used which is a few

1490294
pop-up	dialog
i have implemented the pop-up using show modal dialog javascript but i still cant get the parent value into the child form

1490305
accessor	properties
the simple fact is that most accessor and mutators are simply a formality so much so that c# now has automatic properties and are not necessary

1490330
getter	setter	mutators	getter	mutators	setter
as it s written right now with no qualification of the input or output your getter and setter accessor and mutators if you prefer are accomplishing absolutely nothing so you might as well just make the string public and be done with it

1490330
getter	setter
this gives a real improvement over using a setter and getter in a surrounding class

1490330
getter	setter
first and foremost when you put those in a surrounding class it s easy for code inside that class to bypass the getter setter losing enforcement of whatever the setter was supposed to enforce

1490330
getter	setter
using a getter and a setter forces you to write code that s just plain ugly and hard to read

1490330
getter	setter
but look what happens if that string is part of a class that forces us to go through a getter and setter

1490331
mouse	keyboard
however i m trying to use it now in another app where i have a secondary window that pops open and gets initialized with the view and while i get mouse moved evets i don t seem to get any mouse click or keyboard for that matter events whatsoever

1490331
move	drag
when i click and drag on the view the entire window move which im guessing has to do why i dont get any mouse events

1490338
postgresql	mysql
you can import or query your data into any of these programs from your db and most of these programs include routines to let you query a lot of dbs directly sql mysql postgresql and therefore enabling you to automate the process of extracting data mining and visualizing graphing your data with impunity

1490340
getter	setter
an object isn t simply a bag of setter and getter that other code does stuff to

1490340
getter	setter
if you follow this approach to oo then carrying meyers advice to the extreme as you did hurts encapsulation rather than helping it you end up exposing all of the class s internal implementation variables via getter and setter instead of hiding them so that only the class s methods the code responsible for doing stuff on behalf of the class which is the only reason you have a class to begin with can get to it

1490342
cakephp	kohana
that being said you might want to look into kohana and cakephp - they re not overly bloated imo and they will definitely save you time should you decide not to write your own

1490343
gtkmm	glibmm
i also like gtkmm s glib ustring but that only works if you re writing a gtkmm or at least glibmm application

it s really a new generation of gui api like swing was for awt nice graphical components new easy ways to manage layouts really nice features to build dynamic interfaces bindings timers to build animations etc

1490460
int	chars
you don t specify the programming language or the language of the strings is it ascii latin1 utf8 utf16 etc. but basically your compare function would need to either sort the chars in each string and then return the result based on comparison or sum the ordinal values of the chars in each string and return the result of an int comparison between them

1490474
lxml	beautifulsoup
i am trying to learn lxml after having used beautifulsoup

1490480
pull	push
let everyone push into the staging repo and let only the buildmaster pull approved changesets from staging into auto-build when s he is happy with them

fadein	hide
no fadein is done because the #message element is visible hide it add the content and fade it in

1490627
unsigned	short
if you really really need to have identical binary information you ll need to create bitfields with bitmasks - you use an unsigned short 16 bit for message and then make things like versionmask 0xe000 to represent the three topmost bits

1490630
httphandler	httpmodule
you could write an httpmodule ot httphandler that wraps the 7zip compression library and handle this in code

pop-up	dialog
so far i never came close to discover a way to open a modal dialog not a pop-up but the floating div that appears on top while blacken fading the background on top of the parents page

1490812
int	chars
if you are sorting the utf8 chars alphabetically you can convert them to 32-bit int utf8 chars are 1 to 4 8-bit values and then do a radix sort

1490812
skip-lists	tree
there are many ways to match the signatures but i would use a hash table o 1 on average or a o lg n structure such as red-black tree or skip-lists

1490818
extjs	mootools
how different is extjs from others like jquery and mootools

1490848
profiling	debugging
but they are very scenario specific enc profiling debugging and should not be used in general purpose programs

1490854
division	modulo
you may have to use the modulo which returns the remainder of the division of two numbers for example 93 20 equals 13

1490863
division	modulo
the modulo gives you back the remainder after performing the division

1490865
stdout	stderr

sorting	filtering
of filtering searching and sorting

1491028
folder	directory
the script itself works perfectly on my local apache setup and goes into each directory and downloads every single file and folder

1491054
equals	gethashcode
a base class for the class you are writing has already provided a equals and gethashcode method and has marked these so that you can provide your own implementation if needed

1491054
equals	gethashcode
this tells the compiler that whenever someone calls equals or gethashcode you want your implementation to be used instead of the one provided in the base class

1491138
nsdocument	nsapplication
i will certainly use coredata whenever i can but nsdocument and normal nsapplication work with coredata so i m not sure if this is relevant to my question

folder	directory
in this directory i have git - which is the folder storing my repository - however when i try

1491334

1491970
perl	tcl
swig is used with different types of languages including common scripting languages such as perl php python tcl and ruby

1491972

the reason you want to do this is that you will need to deploy the application using wsadmin jacl jython interface to was and you need the was classes on the box to make this work

1492014
jar	manifest.mf
you will need to add a manifest.mf file to the jar for your application under the meta-inf directory - if you use the jar command line tool it will make sure the file ends up in the right place

1492063
put	get
fortunately there is a simple approach to get around this put links on the page to translate it into the other languages based on a querystring parameter

1492080
google-chrome	firefox
the above code works perfectly for ie 6 7 and 8 from firefox 2.0 onwards and also in google-chrome

1492120
pull	push
it s possible to have a pull connection open that effectively allows you to push content to the browser but the polling idea is the simplest

1492142
boost	allocator
if for some technical reason dynamic allocator is out completely you might want to try using boost pool as your allocator as you know you can specify a different std library memory allocator if you don t want to use the default one

1492159
coldfusion	railo
coldfusion 9 will allow you to specify the where to search for application.cfc files just like railo

1492202
post	get
i tried sending get head and post

1492202
post	get
get always produces end begin and post produces begin read

1492219
openssl	libcrypto
you can compile libcrypto openssl for windows but i wouldn t recommend it

1492340

then you can hide whichever image is set to visible using jquery and get the next image and show it.

1492348
decimal	ieee
which means it probably uses an ieee 754 double-precision floating point representation which only gives about 16-17 decimal digits of precision

1492415
telerik	radcombobox
if so i suspect you may be looking at a custom set of controls the telerik controls will allow you to template a radcombobox for example but i don t think there are any standard controls that will allow this

firefox	safari
it displays in ie 6 firefox safari but not ie 7

1492444

1492549
mantis	bugzilla
the mantis version used is 1.1.8 and the bugzilla one is 3.0.1

1492601
fgets	strtok	atof	strtok
in c you might use fgets to read one line at a time and strtok or similar to process the lines and atof or sscanf to read the numbers

1492602
bash	zsh
if you have absolute control over the user s environment then put a variable in their profile check the manuals for bash and zsh for a file which is always read at startup

1492602

1492747
typedef	struct
typedef struct key_state key_state

1492748
typedef	struct
if you do not want to write struct all the time you can use a typedef declare key_state similar to device_extension

1492774
typedef	struct
you could should typedef the struct so that you don t need the struct keyword every time you will declare a variable of that type

1492778
google-chrome	firefox
on the first day i thought all was good and well firefox google-chrome showed it precisely as desired then the users came and saw everything was wrong in their explorers center aligned headers

1492783

when you use device_extension you don t have to do use struct because you are doing a struct definition and a typedef in a single compound statement

1492840
folder	directory
to sum it up without rewriting the document you can allow access to the directory that you wish either through .htaccess files in those folder and .htaccess files can be placed at any level in your directory tree

1492886

1493247
bazaar	svn	bazaar	git
if you are restricted to svn keep reading if not you sound like a prime candidate for dvcs like mercurial git or bazaar

1493251
ant	maven
ideally you would have a standardized build tool maven ant etc. and a build scheduler hudson cruise teamcity etc.

1493254
public	protected
in practice onloginused does exist and when the identifier is changed to public protected everything works just fine

1493262
postgresql	mysql
i m converting a db from postgresql to mysql

1493262
postgresql	mysql
since i cannot find a tool that does the trick itself i m going to convert all postgresql sequences to autoincrement ids in mysql with autoincrement value

hash	md5
you can t use a hash function as hashing functions are typically meant to be one-way only given a md5 or sha1 hash you should not be able to decode it to find out what the source message was

1493589
getter	setter
why do you need getter and setter at all

1493589
getter	setter
another reason to use getter setter is not relying on implementation details

1493589
getter	setter
in such a case it might help to use setter getter - but that s not the general cas

1493776
comparator	icomparer
no you can write your custom sorting with comparator and icomparer

post	get	hide	show
personally i would do it as a single get post and utilize some basic jquery to show hide divs containing the necessary inputs as noted in the first link

1493796
comparator	icomparer
what you will need to do is implement a custom icomparer for the class you are trying to sort and use that comparator when sorting your collection

1493797

1494052
mp3	flv
ianal but i think it says that as long as you use the mp3 from inside the flv or swf then its free

1494064

1494138
disk	ram
yes windows and most modern os s keep recently read file data in otherwise unused ram so that if that file data is requested again in the near future it will already be available in ram and disk access can be avoided

i would definitely go with ldap although i cannot put myself in the shoes of a man that might get fired for choosing a directory server solution to match a directory server problem.

1494142
punctuation	words
i would have read your valid words characters until you his a space or punctuation

1494176

1494219
post	get
is post more compact than get since get requests have to be url-encoded

1494220
filesystems	ntfs
previously i stated that you could provided that you allowed yourself to make use of the xml http request object which is available in most browsers javascript implementation and that you allow that some filesystems information could be inferred by identifying the server software that is running on the server if it s iis it s probably ntfs if it s appache it s likely ext3

1494239
post	get
moreover in case of multpart form-data encoding which is required for file uploads but in this case get request is not an option anyway post will be more verbose

1494240
put	get
and i m not a fan of views especially views that get put on top of views as they can kill performance when they can t be properly indexed

1494242

1494266
post	get
post has one more letter in it than get so it s less compact

1494266
post	get
the semantics of post and get are different and http is not optimised for compactness

1494269
post	get
you might want to review the following information regarding get vs post usability

just a quick note according to yahoo yui team and yslow when using xmlhttprequest objects ajax post almost always uses two packets while get will use one content length permitting

1494400

is javascript the only option for client-side scripting that will support server-side communication

1494466
client-side	server-side
is it simply javascript client-side script interacting with server-side resources data remote functionality exposed through web services

1494511
client-side	server-side
ajax is generally the interchange the runner if you like of data between client-side and server-side and of course visa-versa

1494511
client-side	server-side
ajax isn t simply a client-side script interacting with a server-side script though

1494526
width	height

1494529
onkeyup	onkeydown
you can try to handle onkeydown and onkeyup events but you ll have to update the bound property yourself

1494544
interbase	firebird
you can use newest version of interbase of the fork of interbase open source named firebird

1494550
tabcontrol	tabitem
i believe you will need to define a custom control template for the tabitem maybe even one for the tabcontrol

1494550
tabcontrol	tabitem
you will still need to add that as a style resource and reference it from your tabcontrol - tabitem

1494557

1494996
kde	gnome
as you point out the desktop environment you re using gnome kde whatever may implement this

1494996

1495407
width	height
are there any css3 rules that would allow the height to change according to the width while maintaining its aspect ratio

1495431
post	get
ideally the solution would work for both post and get submissions.

1495450
post	get
read from the specific collections where you want the data from the request.form for post and request.querystring for get

1495480
for-loop	loops
i do suggest changing the while loops to the more idiomatic for-loop and handling exceptions

1495482
postgresql	mysql
in postgresql the absolute fastest way to get bulk data in is to drop all indexes and triggers use the equivalent of mysql s load data and then recreate your indexes triggers

1495486

getter	setter
in python you typically don t write getter and setter unless you really have a non-trivial implementation for them at which point you use property descriptors

1495697
post	get
also you could potentially use post instead of get but that s kind of ugly too depending on what exactly you re doing

1495702
centos	linux
this is gdb v6.8 on linux centos v4 32bit

1495740

1496320
width	height
in the animate function change the width and height to your desired one

1496328
put	get
what the static does here many programmers do not like this type of allocation is that the strings get put into the data segment of the program

1496353
free	malloc
another alternative would be to use malloc to allocate the string in the heap and then free on the correct locations of your code

1496396
google-chrome	firefox
edit2 ok i got it to work in ie but it s obvious now that the corners are made by a bunch of div s and the background doesn t match up - it looks fine in firefox and google-chrome

1497002
width	height
i think it s reasonable to assume that the height and width properties would do the same

1497002
width	height
if you don t want this to happen for your window then you must explicitly set either the width and height or the sizetocontent property of the window element depending on your requirements

1497019
innodb	myisam
autoincrement will use the next available id for both innodb and myisam tables but you can manually change it s next position in the following way

1497309
int	double
i have a family of classes that contain only variables of the following types std string int double

1497328
operands	decrement
the second operands is 9 because first term caused a to be decrement

1497332
maven	cargo
if you are strictly following automated smoke tests with selenium cargo testng and maven please note that the author is not really covering the multi-modules project setup i m not saying he s not doing it i m just saying he s not covering that part but only the functional testing project setup

1497332
maven	cargo	maven	pom.xml
he always launch maven from the functest directory never as a reactor from the parent pom.xml and the webapp deployed by cargo in the step 7 is treated like an external dependency

1497355
int	double
now if you want to differentiate a string from a non-string number in this case you can prepend every packet item with a byte code say 0x00 for int 0x01 for double 0x02 for string and branch a switch off depending on what the code is

1497355
int	double
this way you can even write the int double as a byte so you won t lose precision and you ll also end up with a smaller easier to read file

1497360
for-loop	loops
loops through the column names in a cursor for-loop and add them to a string

1497445
rss	feed
rss feed news ticker-type text on a page displaying content from an external source

1497478
int	double
if that s the case then int math.log x+0.5 math.log 10 will be more stable - but realize that double s have only 53 bits of precision so around 10 the 15th double can no longer represent int exactly and this trick won t work then

1497494
maven	pom.xml
i m using maven s exec java to run jline for one of my projects current pom.xml attached below

1497498
post	get
one without parameters for get requests and one with for post

my impression is they write the url to a database then use the integer id of the new record as the short url encoded base 36 or 62 letters+digits

1497544
awt	swing
the reason it s ambiguous is people generally don t mix and match the light and heavy-weight frameworks put awt components within a swing component

1497545
filtering	grouping
for the life of me i can t figure out how to work with the values returned by the linq query to be able to then filtering all of the grouping that were returned so that i only have the grouping that have more than one item in them

1497705
getter	setter
for obvious-purpose methods like getter and setter it will also generate good enough comments getx gets x etc.

1497705

what you ll need to do than is to complete the javadoc comments for the classes and methods that are more sophisticated than getter setter or default constructors

1497715
maven	pom.xml
you ve already said this doesn t meet your needs but for others who have a similar problem it is worth noting that you can use the maven scm api to invoke arbitrary scm commands against the repository configured in the scm section of your pom.xml

1497723
post	get
maybe it will help to post what error warning you get when removing sign nil

1497728

i have looked in the chapter about xmlui in the extending flash mx 2004 book but all the properties listed there under targetlist are id height width class and required

1498227
vbscript	jscript
it s worth taking the time to get used to creating .wsf files which use an xml-based syntax rather than just running .js jscript or .vbs vbscript files - .wsf files offer much finer control over modularity and allow for better in-file documentation and usage explanations and also allow scripts written in several different languages to be combined which is handy if you find a vbscript that does 40 of what you need and don t want the hassle of converting it to use with the 60 you re writing in jscript

1498229
mouseleave	mouseenter
what if you use the mouseenter and mouseleave events

1498229
mouseleave	mouseenter
mouseenter sets it to underlined and mouseleave reverts it

1498627
getter	setter
worse you completely replace the backing store in your derived setter so your getter is checking a completely different variable than the one you set

1498627
getter	setter
as for the first question when overriding properties in vb.net you always need to override both the getter and the setter even if you just replace it with an identical implementation

if you need the event to trigger but don t want to use onclick use onfocus or onblur

1499099
pull	push
if i understand your problem correctly and you control the content of all the frames and all the frame content is from the same domain you can trigger an onload event on the bottomright frame to pull the data from topright rather than trying to push it

1499099
pull	push
bottomright can even invoke a function in topright and ask it to push the data which in my mind is still a form of pull

1499101

however you are not using myisam since this is important data you are using innodb which needs the alter table statement quoted above

1499501

if i expose student as a resource my question is whether i should always return the parent school and the children classes along with that student or whether there should be parm that the user includes to indicate such

1499513

1499590
width	height
you could also do a pillarbox but then you do the exact same as above except that width becomes height and height becomes width

1499590
width	height
edit actually you resize the one that is the biggest if width is bigger you resize that and if height is bigger then you resize that

1499619
google-chrome	firefox
with multiple versions of browsers ie 6 7 8 multiple brands ie mozilla firefox google-chrome in use. whatever you try you cannot get the best in everything

1499926
hash	md5
scons uses md5 hash rather than file mod times to determine if a dependency needs to be built

1499926
hash	md5
and that would force scons to build all files depending on foobar.h whereas just typing scons would do the regular build using md5 hash for dependency checking

1499933
