8700043
swt	swing
both the netbeans platform pure swing but good looking and adaptable look feel and eclipse rcp swt do

8700050
autofac	castle-windsor
then you should definitely consider using a di ioc container like structuremap castle-windsor autofac or unity

8700073
jdk1.6	jdk1.5
i encountered a difference illustrated below when drag-and-dropping an url from a browser onto an application which needs to support jdk1.5 jdk1.6 and jdk1.7

8700079
jboss	glassfish
i don t know about glassfish but jboss uses an embedded tomcat so you might get comfortable with it somewhat easier

8700083
versioning	upgrade
also upgrade or post upgrade issues may occur if these files are not available in the new versioning environment

8700128
superclass	subclassing
am i going to use super in the subclassing to get hold of the content of the constructor of the superclass

8700128

since subclassing only inherited datamembers and method from the superclass and not the constructor i m curious how to do this right

8700142
awt	swing
awt - don t use it at all swing was designed to solve issues with awt

8700142
swt	swing
swt is claimed to be faster than swing although in modern versions swing is also fast enough

8700151
swt	swing
there are significant differences between swt and swing

8700151
swt	swing
back for your question swt is also portable like swing but for each platform you have to use a different library which uses the platform s native implementation

8700169
awt	swing
since it is very confortable using predefined objects and drag and drop them from a palette and in most cases it is so hard to override basics methods then you need to add another custom api for basic methods that are implemented by default in awt swing

8700169
awt	swing
all the java custom frameworks are based on overriding methods that comes with awt swing

8700211
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
the arrow of each combobox is displaced in all browsers i tried firefox google-chrome opera

switching	screens
plays even with the screens locked and with the ring silent switching set

8700259
division	multiplication
let s redo interaction 2 but with division instead of multiplication

8700278
sequence	permutation
an additional problem occurs when the fisherâ yates shuffle is used with a pseudorandom number generator or prng as the sequence of numbers output by such a generator is entirely determined by its internal state at the start of a sequence a shuffle driven by such a generator cannot possibly produce more distinct permutation than the generator has distinct possible states

8700291
folder	directory
as the asset directory is read only because android .apk file is read-only so you can t write anything in asset folder file you have to first copy that sqlite database file into your application s internal storage directory then you can modify your database file

8700317
hide	show
alternatively you may want to have the fragments listen to an event of sorts which tells them whether they should show or hide the layout in question

8700347
gtk	gjs
i am writing a gtk app using gjs gnome javascript bindings

8700386

in gettarebybarcodeform which extends the actionform the following getter and setter methods are there

8700396
pull	push
as i switch between machines i will push and pull changes to keep the two dev machines in sync

8700430
put	get
cache can be implemented as an actor so that interaction with it put get operations would take place through message passing

8700432
gridview	rowdatabound
but i can t get it to add a row i tried it on rowdatabound and then databound event but they both aren t working here is my code if someone could show me how to dynamically add a row to the end of gridview not footer that would be cool anyway here is my code that doesn t work

8700438
post	get
and controller has the classic post and get functions compatible with json to call and update the page

8700453
inherited	properties
or you can set the basedir-path of the root in a properties so it will be inherited

8700510
jasmine	qunit
also if you re using resharper you might like to look at their integration with qunit there s every chance they ll integrate it with jasmine too

8700628
atomikos	bitronix
if i use a different implementation of the transaction manager such as bitronix tm or atomikos and not the default provided by the container is it just enough to inject the new tm into usertransaction object

8700654
put	get
ideally you want to put all your code inside a scoping function so you don t create global symbols and if we do that we can just get the element once and then use it in the event handler because the event handler we ll create will be a closure over the context of the scoping function don t worry closures are not complicated

8700683
stateless	stateful
i currently have a working stateless webapp with form-based authentication using spring security which makes it stateful by storing auth stuffs in session perhaps

8700768
glulookat	glrotate
i tried to use some other function instead of glrotate glfrustum glperspective glulookat applying skewing matrix but i couldn t make them work properly

8700796

always returns maximum unsigned integer value

8700798
jobs	cron
the path i now chose is easy to understand i end up with a list of resolving domains and - when needed - i can check those using curl on demand or using one or more cron jobs on interval

8700879
getter	setter
if you want to assert if setter getter or methods have been called use instead

8700907
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
from my computer using my account and my sister s account firefox google-chrome - we both see all of them in opera without login i also see all of the applications

is it correct when i don t use property in example for uilabel uiimageview uibutton when i create objects by code

8700941
nsmutablestring	nsstring	nsmutablestring	nsdata	nsstring	nsdata
something always nags me that it s best to use an nsdata vs nsmutabledata or nsstring rather than an nsmutablestring

8700942
setinterval	settimeout
javascript s settimeout or setinterval can do this for you

8700945
inherited	subclassing
as friend relationship are not inherited you don t have to worry about b s possible subclassing

8700966
post	get
i guess there s an easy sql query to get a list of authors and post per month for each of them

8700967
folder	directory	folder	dir
of course on the second computer net dir is pointing to the right directory in the shared folder

8700967

if i use share folder and run both program my and original on the same computer and configure bde to use the shared folder connection from c# to paradox database can t be opened

8700972
getter	setter
property is a key word useful to create setter getter methods automatically for that field

8700977
post	get
ok i have a rails 3 application and when i try to do a .post request to a rails action i get prompted to relogin ...this might be related to the authenticity_token or the way rails 3 handles post or remote true ...but honestly i really dont know why its not working...here is my code

8701013
inherited	properties
because at sometimes if your class makes a reference to some other class or inherited from other class that has the properties with same name you need to avoid name clash by using this

8701020
children	parent
problem is collection mapping on a must filter children based on checking if one of two a associations is the parent one

8701025
versioning	upgrade
i would strongly suggest to upgrade to a recent qt versioning though if the project allows it

8701037
google-chrome	firefox
then it doesn t work at least in google-chrome ie and firefox

8701089
width	height
then i want to double the image width and height

8701107
hex	binary
you should almost always use base64 or hex to represent arbitrary binary data in printable text

8701119
google-chrome	safari
this works in ie8 and up as well as google-chrome and safari however in ie7 it just ignores the nth-child bit and therefore doesn t apply my css

8701121
hide	show
other searches on google show the same approach you hide somehow the div and you load the content into it again and display it by chaining the operations needed

8701122
mouse	keyboard
you can also ask the user if possible to apply some random keyboard or mouse input

8701162
put	get
put the index of image view to get the image view object

8701173
hide	show
i want that exact effect to show and hide my div

consider fadein and fadeout methods

8701214
getter	setter
i would like to manually type out the accessor getter setter for msomeint but when i press space after public above the caret jumps to the beginning of public myclass

8701274
width	height
note before the fade in your s height width should be both 0 to see the effect

8701281
lightopenid	hybridauth
i have not used lightopenid only hybridauth

8701284
width	height
when the div that triggers the animation is clicked we grab the current height and width of the window to figure out the initial starting position for the growing div as well as the position it should animate to

8701319
maven	pom.xml
with tycho all you need is a pom.xml and you usually will not change this information which is generated via maven

8701328
hide	show
button to show hide the right view and window resize accordingly

8701328
width	height
left one main always-on and non resizable in width it can resize in height

8701328
width	height	hide	show
right one show hide can resize in width height must have always a min width

8701328
width	height
when right is hidden main window min width height equals the left view

8701331
postgresql	mysql
for your db you probably don t want to use sqlite for the scalability problems you mention - instead mysql or postgresql maybe

8701359
ppl	tbb
you can find easy implementations in tbb and ppl

8701365
viewmodel	caliburn.micro
as you can see it is bound to a viewmodel using caliburn.micro but i think this is unrelevant

8701417
put	get
i know it is possible to share variables through shared memory is it possible to put a function pointer to a shared memory from process a and from process b get it and call as function

8701425
submit	submission
one thing to look for event handlers on your page s bound to elements or to things that cause form submission tags with type submit or submit elements and other things like that

8701434
versioning	upgrade
you need to provide explicitly or hidden in your code db upgrade mechanism and - thus implement something like db versioning chain

8701459
rss	feed
alright so i m trying to get the next feed page from a feedburner rss feed

8701460
google-chrome	firefox
but firefox and google-chrome is working fine

8701462
width	height
jquery has width and height properties available for the object you select

8701471
google-chrome	firefox
however as pointed out by max and erturne in the comments when javascript is written as part of an extension add-on to the browser the regular rules about same origin policy and cross-domain requests does not seem to apply - at least not for firefox and google-chrome

8701516
width	height
use element instead and the key is to give it proper width and height

8701516
width	height
put the correct image width and height and it should work fine

8701517
int	chars
the int is represented by a array of unsigned chars

8701517
integer	unsigned
in my case this is a problem because the variable base10 is of type unsigned integer of 32 bits

8701534
width	height
set a height and width to your image

8701539
daemon	cron
every time your code gets any kind of control over the machine check if your cron daemon is running classic pid file and start it if necessary

8701590
selecteditem	selectedindex
when the selectedindex is updated selecteditem remains the same and vice versa

8701601

8701666
wadl	wsdl
cannot determine if the service is of type wsdl or wadl

8701698
children	parent
an arbitrary program such as your bash program cannot change the working directory of the parent process as that would pretty much break all existing processes that spawn children

8701763
trie	dawg
clearly either a trie or a dawg would be ideal to store these

8701763
trie	dawg
i would suggest therefore you implement a trie dawg and use it to store all of the hashes in the first array

8701767
int	chars
so far what i have done is turn the string into an array of chars and then convert the chars into int by using

8701767
int	chars
taking the first element of the new chars array and converting it to a int

8701829
versioning	upgrade
assemblies that have been upgrade to 4.0 from previous versioning have level 2 transparency by default

8701832
parseint	stringtokenizer
you can also use stringtokenizer to split the string into substrings and then use parseint to convert them into integers

8701908
union	distinct
you should to union both columns and then filter for distinct values

8701908
union	distinct
after test union operator and reread mysql union operator documentation by default mysql filter for distinct values

8701910
folder	directory
if you haven t changed the server path and it thus defaults to eclipse s workspace metadata then the tomcat s work directory is not in tomcat s own installation folder but in the path as shown in the above screenshot

8701926
implements	extends
just store string s in a sortedset may be extends treeset and provide implements your own get int i method where you iterate till the ith element and return that element

8701927
wadl	wsdl
i tried it with new soapui project wizard and putting that urls in initial wsdl wadl

8701949
uilabel	uitextview
i ve a storyboard with a uiscrollview which contains two uilabel a uiimageview and a uitextview

8701954
union	distinct
in mysql union selects distinct rows by default

8701967
x86	64bit
it s called program files on 32-bit windows systems but on 64bit systems it s called program files x86

8701974
google-chrome	firefox
this sample rate might be lower as only google-chrome and firefox are supported

8701992
post	get
but basically you want every method to be called through a post instead of a get and you would send a soapheader with every http call

8702019
entity-relationship	diagram
from a logical design point of view do i still need to record the relationship on the entity-relationship diagram and implement it within my rdmbs even if i m not going to make any use of it

8702049
versioning	upgrade
there was no upgrade notification and market only displays the old versioning

8702051
ssl	https
the app works great under ssl but when i change the schema from https to http using a response.redirect the request get a timeout i am stuck with it any idea is welcome

8702054
hash	md5
i m attempting to use the microsoft crypto apis to compute an md5 hash but i m getting incorrect hash

8702059
jar	manifest.mf
i d recommend that you open the jar and verify that the manifest.mf appears and does indeed say what your ant build.xml does

8702091
folder	directory
instead create a folder elsewhere and use your web server to disable directory browsing on that folder

8702091
folder	directory
in the end if the user can see the image they can access it one way or the other but disabling directory browser means they can t just traverse the folder like you can in windows explorer for example

8702135
getter	setter
my second idea is to extract an interface of the needed getter setter of the entities

8702151
int	chars
each of those converted int now get covered to a chars with chr

8702155
punctuation	words
well if you want random text then you can use a dictionary with the words and another dictionary with the punctuation and then generate the return string with random elements from the words dictionary with a certain probability of random elements from the punctuation dictionary

8702236
fadein	fadeout
do a fadeout first so that the fadein will be noticable

8702245
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
it renders perfectly on all mac based browsers firefox safari google-chrome but when i try and view it on any windows based browser firefox google-chrome safari of course ie i get a very strange blob on the top of the letter d when it is capitalized

8702296
globalization	localization
i cant use the following code in master page for globalization localization

8702364
arraylist	treeset
the real symptom as the op stated in a comment is that it takes 700ms to put the strings in a treeset and another 700 ms to copy that treeset into an arraylist

8702364
arraylist	treeset
in fact the program below running on my ancient thinkpad takes only 360ms to create 100 000 random strings put them in a treeset and copy that treeset into an arraylist

8702440
mouse	keyboard
i would prefer an option that silently runs in the background doesn t take or require focus like mouse and keyboard controlling software java robot

8702467
post	put
the form_for used put method while in routes i specified post

8702467
post	put
changing post to put made everything work

8702491
google-chrome	safari
safari up to and including version 4 and google-chrome up to and including

8702511
int	chars
why are c chars literals int instead of chars

8702516
post	get
note that you wouldn t need a post for this a simple get with url parameters would be sufficient since the nonce will prevent it from being accidentally repeated

8702517
int	chars
because in c chars constants have the type int not chars

8702517
int	chars
perhaps surprisingly chars constants in c are of type int so

8702530
postgresql	mysql
for this application i need to provide support for various database engines such as postgresql mysql etc

8702556
int	chars
a chars written between single quotes represents an int value equal to the numerical value of the chars in the machine s chars set

8702608
int	chars
so functions that return a chars from input or a file often return an int which can be compared with eof which is usually defined to be -1 but it can be anything that isn t a valid chars

8702610
unsigned	short
for scanf you need to use hu since you re passing a pointer to an unsigned short

8702610
unsigned	short
for printf it s impossible to pass an unsigned short due to default promotions it will be promoted to int or unsigned int depending on whether int has at least as many value bits as unsigned short or not so d or u is fine

8702620
uipickerviewdelegate	uipickerviewdatasource
double check that your uiviewcontroller for the view is a uipickerviewdatasource and uipickerviewdelegate or you will not be able to attach these outlets unless it is

8702666
stdout	stderr
a c++ iostream-based replacement for popen allowing i o on all of the child process stdin stdout and stderr

8702768
versioning	upgrade
the solution for us was to upgrade the jquery validate library to the latest versioning 1.9

8702774
128bit	64bit
practically every single pdt is capped at 64bit so if i ever needed to represent a 128bit integer does c++ have a built in class for that something similar to biginteger in java

8702791
width	height
you should use width and height properties instead of border

8702800
pop-up	dialog
after a modal dialog window pop-up you could accidentally click somewhere in the main application not on the dialog causing the focus to briefly change to the main application sending the modal dialog behind it in the z order

8702912
hide	show
the best way is to hide it on load and after slidedown but the div have flash show when page is loading

8702945
navigationcontroller	pushviewcontroller
if someone can help and add some code that will work to pushviewcontroller because i have the correct navigationcontroller but when i try to push the viewcontroler i get error

8702965
put	get
about getting back your images i think blobs are stored as byte arrays in sqlite so you ll have to get your inputstream convert it to a byte array and put it in the contentvalues

8703001
stdout	stderr
you can use exec and process substitution to send stdout and stderr inside of the script to tee

8703032
int	boolean
in java the primitive types int long boolean etc. are compared for equality using whereas the object types string etc. are compared for equality using the equals method

8703039
google-chrome	firefox
it works perfect with all pc browsers i tested with firefox ie and google-chrome but doesn t work on android phones and iphone

8703046
getelementsbytagname	getelementbyid
contrary to the getelementbyid function which returns a single element the getelementsbytagname function returns a nodelist of dom elements which is normal as you could have multiple elements with this tag

8703054
getter	setter
you can always prevent extensions but before doing that define setter and getter for certain properties that allow setting to values that are not callable

8703101
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
it loads up fine and works under the latest version of google-chrome firefox safari on my mac and does the same on windows 7 even in ie

8703118
uiview	subviews
to implement this by myself will i create a uiview and add this to my view controller s view as a subviews above the table view that scrolls the hours below

8703118
move	drag
to move this event between the hours the user drag the rectangle up and down

8703157
put	get
but for this case it s especially so that you can put together the text of the label which get s distributed over multiple events

8703183
getter	setter
using options will allow you to write getter and setter for each options property

8703208
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
i have found an error in firefox and opera. i m running debian whezee firefox 9.0.1 opera 11.60 google-chrome 16.0.912.63

8703559
g++	gcc
in order to do this you ll need to compile all your code and libraries with -fpic assuming g++ gcc

8703656
width	height
a combined approach is to define a line object to be a rectangle converted to a string nsstringfromcgrect cgrectmake x y width height

8703695
hide	show
all i wanted to do was rotate a button and then hide show it

8703722
post	get
if you would only post your question on google you would get the following answer

8703729

when the user rotate the screen the activity is destroyed and recreate if you want to display the notification after orientation change make a static flag in ondestroy method and check it in the oncreate method to display the notification like

8703748
punctuation	words
you can split on whitespace or words boundaries which will match between a words and punctuation

8703753
dbcontext	objectcontext
i d even go so far as to say that in its current implementation entity framework s dbcontext objectcontext resembles both the repository pattern and the unit of work pattern

8703759
google-chrome	firefox
my test browsers were both google-chrome and firefox both of which performed the same behavior

8703764
inherited	properties
this will allow you to share properties through your inherited chain without making them public

8703766
button	checkbox
you could also use radio button or checkbox for your options depending on whether multiple selections are allowed

8703781
post	get
most stuff is the same and the template project referenced in the post has been updated to 0.11.x should help get you started with a simple web project with sbt

8703798
asterisk	freeswitch
i just wanted to make that distinction. in fact the freeswitch equivalent of asterisk -r is actually an esl-based program called fs_cli - short for freeswitch command line interface

8703818
versioning	upgrade
you need the instead or to upgrade the mojarra versioning to the latest

8703834
salt	md5
you could improve the security by adding a salt to your md5 call like this

if dispose false isn t going to do anything that s a very good indication that neither your class nor any class derived from it should include a c#-style destructor nor override finalize and the disposing argument should be regarded as a dummy whose purpose is to give the protected dispose method a different signature from the public one

8716947
post	get
each browser will handle that correctly without client-side scripting and it does not break the get post semantics

8716968
put	get
plus this will get hairy deciding which slot to put the new signup in

8716995
folder	directory
unless the file should also be stored in the bin folder copy to output directory should be left set to none

i have images in a panel that are sized down with width and height and need them removed when the image is dropped

8717116
dictionary	map
once you know which way you need to map you either use the original or the auxiliary dictionary for the lookup

8717118
dictionary	map
you would have to create a separate dictionary for it and use that method to map the key values backwards

8717124
ravendb	db4o
in an app on which i m currently working i just replaced db4o with ravendb

8717135

firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
seems to work fine back quite a few versions in google-chrome safari and firefox but not at all in ie8 or even ie9

8717208
for-loop	arrays
that script needs the try block as you can see because the logic of the for-loop is very poor it will often overrun the streamitems arrays and probably has a race condition when removing the hidden-tweet class

8717239
clang	llvm
i don t think clang llvm does much but i could be wrong here

8717285
free	realloc
moreover you must update this number every time you use realloc or free

8717313
mouse	keyboard
in the situation above the parent control is a tcontrol it creates several sub controls in my example above all three have their own window handles and thus windows can display keyboard focus when you hit tab and handle mouse focus as part of windows s common controls library s functionality

8717313
mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown	mouseup	mousedown
there are more sub-tasks than this to accomplish if you wish to build a control yourself i recommend you study existing controls such as tstringgrid and tcategorybuttons in the vcl source code to see the mousemove mousedown and mouseup handling code you will need to do the things you are trying to do

8717337
screens	tablet
but for smaller displays or tablet i wanted to take advantage of the media screens queries to detach the side column and stack it under the main column

8717354
google-chrome	firefox
in my case same code worked fine on firefox but not on google-chrome

8717462
hash	salt
i wanted to know if the process of hashing a hash would help stop attacks to it brute-force i think when used with salt as well

8717462
hash	salt
from what i can work out my code would be secure because it stops rainbow table attacks by using salt and stops brute-force attacks by iterating the hash

8717481
post	put
you ll have to resort to json for example combined with the put or post method

8717488
hash	salt
in one of my apps i salt and hash the username and password together to create a unique token

8717506
margin	height

using crypt in conjunction with crypt_blowfish a.k.a bcrypt you can do input your password and salt into the function and get a finished hash after iterations and everything

8717527
post	put
if you want to post your whole query here i can refactor it but as it were you need to put the alias outside the subquery

8717566
width	height
if you dont know how to get the width and height of the mobile phone screen let me know

8717582

min	max
i used it to zoom in on a group of points and just calculated the min max points and was good to go

8717625
int	chars
assuming the structure contains member of type int and chars strings

out of this i created a script which access the ajaxscript first gets the time hash or encrypts the same time with a good known salt and password and delivers these two values to the user

8718409
post	put
i found that my page worked a lot nicer though if i put the hiding showing of the placeholders in an asp.net ajax updatepanel so the page wouldn t post back

8718450
paradox	bde
when paradox bde in your case accesses a table it places a lock of one type or another on the table by creating and making an entry in a special lock file in the table directory

on google-chrome it works fine but on ie and firefox it s not working.

8718534
debian-based	ubuntu	ubuntu	debian
this is a decent tutorial for debian and since ubuntu is a debian-based distro it should be pretty close

8718554
google-chrome	safari
right now both safari 5.1 and google-chrome 16 print out a o could be a zero

8718557
haskell	scheme
or construct new data structures and scheme based on haskell existing map and set

8718614
post	get
on the first page user would see only updated post so i thought when page administrator insert s a post i will render a .html file with updated newest post s and user s will get redirected there where all post are there and everything is fine no php execution no mysql query s against a large database

8718634
disk	ram
if you have enough ram on your machine then you could set this pretty high and maybe there is a way to get the jvm to use disk swap space so it could be insanely high but i do not know how if this is possible

8718636
realloc	malloc
just start with a decent size malloc then realloc as you go if needed

8718636

8718659
put	get	getter	setter
i have a few model classes that extend they define getter and setter which wrap the map s get and put methods

8718675
calloc	malloc

8718696
move	drag
and one day it might keep you from reusing certain windows somewhere else like in another program or just in another part of the same program since they need the windowmanager class which in turn needs all other windows so you can t move this one window somewhere else because it d drag all the other windows along

8718697
post	get
ajax calls aren t -technically- diffrent than normal post get requests and the target is always has to visible to user browser you can t make your application secure by security through obscurity approach

8718895
post	put
put your html code into a form tag and try to post data back to php page

your suggestion of using a dummy subclassing might appear attractive but such abuses of inherited invariably lead to pain and suffering later on

8719603
hid	keyboard
i m trying to write a custom driver for a keyboard hid if it matters under windows 7

8719624
gridbaglayout	springlayout
easiest way is mixing layoutmanagers called as nestedlayout by spliting gui to the parts separated jpanels with same or different layoutmanager rather than implements some most sofisticated layoutmanager gridbaglayout or springlayout for whole container

8719626
express	node.js
i m using node.js and express to handle http requests and responses

8719636

8719927
chmod	mkdir
try a chmod post- mkdir

8719947
hash	md5
in such cases i recommend using a helper field where you can store md5 or any other hash mechanism to store hash value of combining all your fields in your dedupe rule then before insert you need to generate hash for new values and check if it s already exist in your table by querying on your helper field

8719969
stdout	stderr
the batch option forces prin1 princ and print to print to stdout and message and error to print to stderr - so you can actually read and write to pipes

no malloc or free necessary

8720014
profiling	debugging
did you try to debugging profiling your parsing and code

8720103
width	height
i would like the video to be view in full size of browser window and not a given width height

8720123
width	height
you will need to rotate over a center of w 2 w 2 or h 2 h 2 w being width and h being height depending on which quadrant you re rotating to 1 or 3 and the relative height and width of the image

8720128
google-chrome	safari
works in google-chrome but safari is throwing undefined undefined nan

8720148
stateless	stateful
the workaround would be to simply have your mdb delegate to a sessionbean of any kind as stateless stateful and singleton all have requestscoped tests

8720158
width	height
i have a circle say radius of 10 and i can find the outer bounding rect easy enough since its width and height is equal to the radius but what i need is the inner bounding rect

8720187
pop-up	dialog
here you could have at least perhaps a dialog pop-up and say something on the lines of

8720196
stdout	stderr
on another note you may also redirect stdout stderr

8720239
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
newer ie and google-chrome safari opera and firefox don t seems to have a problem with this

8720248
post	put
the android end the app seems to encode the information into a url which is then added to a bundle and put in an http post

8720251
google-chrome	firefox
you could do this with event.clientx event.clienty or event.pagex event.pagey something similar to those not completely sure just did some quick research but those seemed to work in google-chrome ie and firefox

8720254
google-chrome	firefox
in both google-chrome and firefox the hover and active state css properties can only be viewed when the element is hovered or clicked

8720254

3 how to ensure that each div remains a square so the height is exactly proportional the the width which is a percentage of the width of it s container

8720386
getter	setter

8720398
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
what i m trying to achieve is to use custom made filters with controls like dropdownlistfor textbox and checkbox on radgrid that uses needdatasource event to bind the data

8720446
uiview	subviews
so i thought the simple solution would be to place the uitableview inside a uiview so that the adbanner could also be a subviews to the uiview a peer to the table view

8720446
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
i was expecting viewwillappear and viewdidappear but not only do those nslog statements never get called the ios simulator never displays my uitableview either which is reasonable given the situation

8720453
n-gram	words
the bigger problem is that those words mappings and the n-gram following each of those mappings would need to be stored somewhere which would greatly outweigh any savings of the actual compression.

8720492
portrait	landscape
he shows how to add iad banners to the top of tableviews in both portrait and landscape mode

8720567
getter	setter
the reasons are that it forces you to access the ivar via the property setter and getter or use the dot-syntax self.foo rather than directly

8720579
google-chrome	firefox
windows browsers ie google-chrome firefox are not respecting the old us daylight saving time rules for dates prior to 2007

8720579
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and firefox for osx return the correct value so it appears to be an issue with browsers making a windows api call

when that message is received hide the previously visible view randomly select the next one to show and show it

8720626
hide	show
it just show up in the imageview and when i set the animation it hide the image the fade it in.

8720725
getter	setter
this snippet also uses the debuggerstepthroughattribute so that the debugger will not enter the getter and setter but this should be removed if you don t want that effect.

8720748
versioning	upgrade
then i upgrade my azure project to versioning 1.6 and selected the latest azure os after deploying

8720794
integer	unsigned
i have found that mersenne twister mt19937 is a widely used rng that generates good 32-bit unsigned integers and that implementations have been done to generate apparently good double-precision floats generating a 53-bit integer

8720796
hash	salt
passwords should generally be hash ideally with a salt rather than encrypted so that they can not be decrypted

8720796
hash	salt
then later to check if a user entered their password correctly you take whatever they entered and use the same salt and hash function and see if it matches the hash you have in the database

8720796
hash	salt
when bob visits that url the site verifies that the reset token is valid and allows bob to choose a new password which is then salt hash in the same way as the password he lost

8720810
width	height
if you want the whole windowedapplication to scroll enable scrolling on the windowedapplication in the properties tab or add a canvas that is full width and height

8720830
imageview	viewswitcher
i ve implemented a similar effect before but i used a viewswitcher with 2 imageview rather than a single imageview

8720854
adt	hierarchyviewer
with adt 9.0.0 all those views disappeared in eclipse and apparently moved back to the hierarchyviewer

8720872
google-chrome	firefox
you won t see -moz styles in google-chrome nor -webkit styles in firefox

8720873
hide	show
one approach would be to start with a hidden drop-down in all the appropriate places and then just show and hide them based on user actions

8720931
children	parent
i know that css can select individual children of a parent but is there support to style the children of a container if its parent has a certain amount of children

8720993
screens	hdpi
however if android grabs a difference size sprite because it detects a different dpi ie from ldpi hdpi etc then the sprite will appear to be bigger on the note relative to the screens size than it would on the tab

8720996
ubuntu	linux
i m using ubuntu 10.04 64bit linux and a logitech c600 webcam

8721002

udp instead of tcp

8721016
children	parent
edit i read your question a little differently - there are a couple other ways to style the parent not the children

8721022
fixed-point	fractions
the representation itself has enough precision for at least 8 decimal places and as a fractions of equatorial arc is good for distances of around 0.14 metres so the limitation is not the fixed-point representation

8721035
folder	directory
my settings_dev.py file is sitting in the same directory as my settings.py file and my app is sitting in a folder called login

you may want to use stats-rosuda-devel to discuss rjava jri javagd-related issues there.

8721051
getter	setter
i assume your abstractentity base class is using __get and __set magic methods instead of proper getter and setter

8721085
versioning	upgrade
you can actually test the browser flash versioning in javascript so there really is no point in loading flash to tell the user to upgrade flash

8721086
cmdlet	start-job
this example uses a script block but you can also use a powershell script using the -filepath parameter of the start-job cmdlet instead of the -scriptblock parameter

8721099
portrait	landscape
i m facing orientation problem in the loading mask when i rotate my device to landscape from portrait

8721107
nstextfield	nsimageview
each cell contains several nstextfield an nsimageview and an nsbutton all of which are bound to various attributes of the objectvalue of the table cell view

8721107
nstextfield	nsimageview
the nstextfield and nsimageview behave as expected

8721175
inherited	properties
what the inherited member message means is that the custnum properties of the customer class is no longer accessible from the frequentcutomer class

8721196
hide	show
the javascipt uses jquery to hide the element but you can use the other examples show here to do it just with javascript

8721201
mvp	presenter
with mvp you have a model which represents your data the presenter which is responsible for formatting your data to locales i18n etc.. and your view which are the actual gui widgets

8721215
documentfilter	jtextcomponent
if on the other hand you wanted to check text before it has been committed to the text component you d add a documentfilter to the jtextcomponent s document

8721269
inherited	properties
the class frequentcustomer already has the properties from customer inherited even though you haven t specified them explicitly

8721269
inherited	properties
this means that you don t need to specify the properties custnum in the frequentcustomer class it already had it inherited

8721271
iprincipal	iidentity
if you don t want to implement dozens of membershipprovider methods roleprovidermethods and profileprovider methods then just implement iprincipal and iidentity and just do what you need to do

8721271
hash	salt
the sqlmembershipprovider does can at least store hash salt passwords

8721282
width	height
it works when the outer div has specific width and height set in pixels like

8721282
width	height
but it fails when the height and width are percentages like

8721350
width	height
i think that your problem is that your center of rotation shouldn t be width 2 height 2 -- it s not that simple

8721350
width	height
instead think of the image residing in the left upper portion of a large square the length of the square s side will be the image s width or height whichever is larger

8721465
width	height
based on the fact that you have width and height of 100 declared i m going to assume that you re not expecting anyone to have to scroll here

8721561
portrait	landscape
i also have to make sure that the values take into account left landscape and right landscape device orientations portrait is the default so no calculations would be needed for it

8721566
udp	tcp
however a if you have reliable deliver requirements you might ends up reinventing a portion of tcp ip s wheel and b keep in mind that certain networks corporate firewalls tend to block udp ip while allowing tcp ip traffic and c even udp ip won t be exact real-time

8721670
multiplying	add
this is pretty simple thanks to the fact you can add and or multiplying lists

8721711
put	get
if you put date first then the data is still ordered properly but the rows needed to satisfy the query are likely spread out across the datafile s which would require more i o to get

8721788
versioning	upgrade
i do not think it is necessary to upgrade to a newer versioning of the server for streaming 16 9

8721800
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i m using normalize.css in html5 boilerplate and noticing firefox 9 on os x renders fonts differently than every other browser i m testing with google-chrome 16 safari 5.1.2 opera 11.6 all behave the same

8721807
post	get
or post it here and get an interpretation

8721823

i have tried to replace boolean with bool bit tinyint 1 but it doesn t seem to make any difference

8721834
folder	directory
when you update the application anyways you ll lose what was in the original .exe folder but you can migrate the data directory over to a new version of the app

8721848
equals	tostring
now the class demo has implemented interface and has not implemented the equals and the tostring

8721865
equals	tostring
the class demo just inherits the equals and tostring implementation from object

8721865
equals	tostring
in the case of your code that implementation comes from object since all the classes implicitly extend object which provides default implementations for equals and tostring among other methods

8721865
equals	tostring
also it s completely unnecessary to declare equals and tostring in an interface so you re better off with this definition

8721913
subtract	add	multiplying	add	multiplying	subtract
the computer had a built-in square-root instruction and we built a simple program to demonstrate the computer doing 16-bit add subtract multiplying divide square-root on a tty

8721931
filtering	grouping
a having clause is used to filtering based on aggregated non-group values not to filtering the rows involved in the grouping

8721939
puts	gets
since puts doesn t yield to the block you end up writing the string representation of your enumerator to and the block never gets called

8722008
free	malloc
actually malloc and other c runtime heap functions are module dependant which means that if you call malloc in code from one module a dll then you should call free within code of the same module or you could suffer some pretty bad heap corruption and this has been well documented

8722008
free	malloc
using heapalloc with getprocessheap instead of malloc including overloading new and delete operators to make use of such allow you to pass dynamically allocated objects between modules and not have to worry about memory corruption if memory is allocated in code of one module and free in code of another module once the pointer to a block of memory has been passed across to an external module

8722014
hide	show
is there any reason you can t just use hide and show

8722016
equals	tostring
object defines equals and tostring so you can use override with them but not with say the function show

8722018
hide	show
you can use hide and show to achieve the same effect but the elements will stay in position

8722067

first you should convert your string to nsdata to use jsonkit to parse it then you can find the value of the key you want finally jsonkit can convert it back to nsstring

8722167
filtering	grouping
can any one please help me how to use .not or filtering while selecting all divs that starts with grouping or some other solution

8722191
tpagecontrol	tframe
i have a tpagecontrol with 3 tabsheets each containing a tframe

8722215
width	height
it seems that when the view displays the layer it resizes the layer to the width of the browser view so what i put in width for bounds made no difference to the result however it does honour height

8722299
hide	show
if you are using jquery to show and hide things it has no bearing on seo

8722318
width	height
one of the common reasons for the web page to appear crumpled in mobile is because they are designed for browser width and height and not mobile versions.simple example see the difference in facebook page on browser and on phone

8722383
std	ostream
std endl is grossly overused and does something different than most people think it does in addition to inserting a newline character n it also flushes the std ostream

8722389
glut	glew
i used the makefile provided to compile and tried to run the file i had many problems with including the libraries glew glut glm but i fixed them after putting the libraries in the cygwin directory

8722389
glut	glew
people on other sites have said to initiate glut before glew but i couldn t find where init glew was run

8722389
glut	glew
after all the library issues had been fixed it threw many issues about multiple declarations and also undefined references to gl glew and glut commands

8722774
button	checkbox
the checkbox is actually a button with an image overlaid on it as an icon

8722816

8722845
stdout	stderr
for stderr and stdout to go to the logfile

8722864
folder	directory
define your xml the following way and place it in your drawable folder under the res directory

8722875
post	get
my guess is that you dont have any file browser apps which can handle get content intent on the emulator though if you post the log can come to conclusion clearly

8722897
int	double
js only has one number type floating point numbers ieee-754 double so generally speaking no distinction is made between int and decimals

8722898
postgresql	mysql
i am using sqlite mysql and postgresql

8722917
getter	setter
you should use setter and getter for the hashmap

8722921

this means declare fptr_t as pointer to function int returning pointer to function double returning float fptr_t int â double â float

8722927
versioning	upgrade
upgrade your intl extension with a newer icu versioning 4+

8722966
post	get
note avoid using the last option getvar 2 because it first checks the post data and then also checks the get data looking for your specified parameter

8722966
post	get
it should only be used when you are not sure wether the parameter is coming along the get or post request data

8723008

8723200
children	parent
when adding a child object i can use that strategy to reset a property on the parent object to get the parent s view to refresh - which i want to as it shows an aggregate count of its children

8723202
inherited	properties
the arrayadapter simply calls super to avail the inherited properties and both methods getitem and getcount

8723203
portrait	landscape
basically when you load the site in either portrait or landscape it auto scales to fit in the view

8723203
min	max
this is using default behavior as i don t currently have a max min scale size set in viewport meta

8723211
int	chars
i believe the reason you see false is because the toast errors out when you supply an int instead of a chars sequence

8723216
division	multiplication	onkeyup	onkeydown
if we pressed the division symbol and multiplication symbol in android soft keyboard then the onkeyup and onkeydown in android is not working

8723248
portrait	landscape
problem here i facing is if i first change the orientation to landscape and click on textfield its working fine but if i first click on textfield in portrait mode and then changed to landscape left right its not working

8723249
hide	show
instead add both of your views as subviews of the controller s root view and hide or show then as needed

8723252
switching	screens
i assume you re saying that if you scroll down switching cell gets scrolled off screens and then you scroll back up switching cell gets scrolled back on screens then the state of the switching isn t preserved

8723253
jobs	cron
did you make sure that the cron jobs are running

8723253
jobs	cron
emails are sent as cron jobs in moodle

8723266

when rotated from portrait to landscape it layouts the view in a very different manner from the portrait layout with a fancy animation

8723293
jobs	cron
for setting up cron jobs have a look at this link

8723305
pthreads	fork
update i recently had reason to do this in a pthreads way with minimal fork which lead to this script the last printf there outputs the command line used to invoke the script which you should be able to copy-paste in order to invoke it with equivalent arguments

8723308
width	height
if this is indeed the case i was planning on using a byte width height explicitly supported and then just perform necessary logic on the user end

8723350
width	height
i ve tried setpreferredsize and setsize but for some reason the joptionpane is sticking with the same width and height

8723423
portrait	landscape
so if you first click on textfield in portrait mode and then changed to landscape this method is invoked first

8723474
post	get
into the state_n.phtml pages use the following code to get your get or post variables

8723476
nsurlconnection	nsoperationqueue
use synchronous nsurlconnection api with nsoperationqueue

8723476
hide	show
the idea is to show the network activity indicator start a network request let the main thread s run loop spin and hide the indicator when the request is complete

8723477
subclass	abstract-class
i disagree with your stipulation that it s not a good idea to create a concrete child class just to test an abstract parent. i do this quite often when testing abstract-class and usually name the concrete subclass after the test to make it clear

8723511
iboutlet	ibaction
in a non navigationcontroller based application i have take a uibutton and the ibaction and iboutlet are properly defined and connected

then to present a new uiviewcontroller you want to push new it onto the stack of your uinavigationcontroller

8723755
superclass	subclassing
you might be able to subclassing uigesturerecognizer override the target-action methods to save the registered pairs in a collection you can then expose to users of the class and then call the superclass implementations of those methods

8723760
xslt	xquery
i think you would find the xml easier to process not just with xsd but also with xslt and xquery if you changed the design to

8723841
for-loop	arrays
i m trying to create a for-loop that does the exact same thing as this code quests is an arrays

arp	tcp
the important parts are mibopen which opens dev arp and pushes the tcp streams module onto it and mibget which actually requests the connection information

8723892
moq	typemock	moq	moles	typemock	moles
maybe try a mock object framework like rhinomocks moq or typemock isolator for example or an isolation framework like microsoft moles

8723903

8724133
width	height
i tried to set a fixed width and height instead of a flex number but then the charts completely disappeared

8724141
width	height
also checkout the scope of variable width height you are using it inside the resize function but it isn t readable there...change your code to something like this

8724220
csv	tsv
i have used linq to csv library in several projects to load and manipulate csv tsv etc files

8724231

portrait	landscape
you need to return yes to supported orientations so in your case you want to return yes if interfaceorientation is landscape there s a helper function for checking landscape vs portrait by the way

8724356
min	max
you can either transform your list and apply said algorithm or slightly modify the algorithm itself min instead of max or minus instead of plus in order to work with your original list

8724370
textinput	textfield
to get round this i simply added a bindable variable which i added the selected combobox value to and added the variable as the dataprovider for the textfield on the textinput

8724374
ceil	floor
bestvalue calls bestvaluehelper after computing the array of valid split sizes between ceil n 2k and floor 3n 2k

8724378
folder	directory
the documentation is silent on how this location is to be specified - whether it should be relative to the base directory or relative to test resources folder

8724414
portrait	landscape
it runs well on my galaxy tab but when i rotate it to portrait or landscape it is going crash

8724427

with all person s properties and prototyped methods are inherited by employee which is fundamental to inherited

8724454
put	get
well i got the light from this url to achieve the above task but not able to get the expected out put

8724479
width	height

int	chars
but if i format the output in printf as int d instead of chars i get a different sound and a wrong one as far as my ears are telling me

8724647
width	height
as far as the rows and cols parameters that you expressed concerns in your question about you could simply use css to set the width and height of the textarea

8724663
google-chrome	firefox
this worked with firefox 3 but nothing is happening with firefox 9 or google-chrome - on ie drag and drop is not working at all but that s another question - i just want this working on firefox 9

oncreate	setcontentview
in the oncreate method of an activity you normally call setcontentview and pass it the layout you want to use in this activity

8724698
setcontentview	findviewbyid
the setcontentview method builds up the defined layout as objects and with findviewbyid r.id.button_connect you get a reference to a button object from this layout whose id is button_connect

8724773
qstring	qiodevice	qstring	qbytearray	qstring	qfile	qiodevice	qfile	qfile	qbytearray	qbytearray	qiodevice
you can t be loading this much information for user navigation or manipulation so if as i suspect you are simply acting as an intermediary between having the file on disc and sending the file somewhere else then use a mechanism which treats the qfile as a qiodevice instead of loading it all completely as a qstring or qbytearray

8724818
viewdidload	viewwillappear
generally you should create the view and self addsubview in viewdidload viewwillappear of the parent view controller if you want to show the view all the time

dbcontext	objectcontext
moreover dbcontext doesn t offer access to state of the relation so you must convert it to objectcontext and use objectstatemanager

8724870
slideup	slidedown
however your code looks like it should work unless a is modified elsewhere which is entirely possible since it s a global variable if you wish to continue to use slideup and slidedown try correcting the scope of a and possibly giving it a more meaningful name like so

8724898
width	height
try to give height and width to table row tag remove android stretchcolumns 1 from tablelayout and put weight of edittext to 1 you can using this layout after modify

8728552
awt	swing
you have override paintcomponent graphics g for swing jcomponents instead of method valid for awt paint graphics g more in tutorials 2d graphics and performing custom painting

equals	gethashcode
when my domain model have a composite key in the database i will get an exception when forgetting to override equals gethashcode

8728960
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i think you problem is that uitabbarcontroller and uinavigationcontroller are those kind of controllers that cannot be handled the way you are doing

8728960
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
so if you are simply swapping views you can do it right in one of your viewcontrollers but swpaping a controller with another uiviewcontroller with uitabbarcontroller should be handled in a higher level app delegate

8728962
pull	push
it s okay for gitolite-admin repo i can pull and push

8728972
maven	pom.xml
i am getting a missing artifact org.springframework.security spring-security-parent jar 3.0.7.release compile error in the pom.xml when i add the maven dependency for spring security but when i remove that dependency the error disappears

8729037

8729129
instances	transient
hibernate throws an transientobjectexception with the message object references an unsaved transient instances - save the instances before flushing tag

8729130
client-side	server-side
if both url s return the same content then you will have duplicate information in your caches whether server-side intermediary or client-side and these can get out of sync between the two resources especially if they are cached at different lifetimes

8729133
equals	gethashcode
when you have a single primary key property in your domain nhibernate will use the value returned by the property as the key value calling gethashcode and equals on the value using the primary key much like you would use it in a instance

8729133
equals	gethashcode
if you haven t overridden equals and gethashcode on your type to use your composite key values it does not reflect the equality used by the data-model two rows being equals if they have the same primary key and nhibernate cannot be certain it is tracking the correct entities

8729208
min	max
however if you are trying to find the min max of a single array and break up the work amongst multiple threads then you probably wouldn t want to instead have the main process the results from each thread for the overall answer

8729214
free	malloc
to allocate arrays dynamically you can use malloc and to free them use free as follows

8729218
width	height
where the image width and height are stored

8729235
onmousedown	onmousemove
i created a teventobject to provide onmousedown and onmousemove events for twebbrowser

8729320
getter	setter
create a custom setter getter

8729337
coalesce	nullif
coalesce will leave the result of nullif unchanged if it is not null otherwise 1 will be returned

8729339
width	height
the reported textview width and height are a lot bigger than the actual text

8729339
width	height
one would expect the textview width and height to be tightly wrapped around the text

8729344
width	border-box	box-sizing	border-box	children	parent
as i need the children to have an exact width 50 from the available space taking regard for the padding of the parent div i use box-sizing border-box

8729344
opera	google-chrome	box-sizing	border-box
this works fine in opera but in google-chrome the box-sizing border-box or even -webkit-box-sizing border-box is silently ignored

8729344
width	height
the two red boxes should be square and the blue box should be 200px in width and height

8729395
int	chars
chars fgets chars dest int size file stream

8729395
int	chars
int scanf const chars format ...

8729412
super	implements
if the class has many initializer one of them is chosen as designated and all the other should be implements by calling it not the super

8729469
getter	setter
also make sure you have either synthesize d the ivar in the implementation or have provided both a getter and a setter for the ivar

i m injecting keyboard and mouse events which are comming over the network into my qt application and use qcoreapplication postevent for this

8729564
int	double
dividing an int by an int and storing in a double always stores the rounded int first

8729578
width	height
it does however also prove that you can t determine the width and height for m based on m only the aspect ratio which in the long run for this application is fine as it s mapping from an arbitrary resolution to another arbitrary resolution and the absolute size is not important

8729601
post	get
your controller could determine if it was accessed via get post and handle it accordingly but that doesn t feel right

8729611
int	double
double can represent every possible int value without a rounding error

8729631
folder	dir
but in that install dir there is no whoosh folder

8729665
post	get
pressing on next previous buttons user gets another 5-10 controls which is dynamically built and added to the survey page - trivial asp.net get post and data entered selected on previous bunch of controls page is saved to database

8729665
button	checkbox
type of user controls radio button list checkbox text box etc

8729665
button	checkbox
the number of asp.net controls inside user control number of radio button inside radiobutton list which in its turn sits in user control number of checkbox inside user control etc

8729675
put	get
i would like to put a breakpoint in the file without having to break the code with a deliberate error and i thought it was possible to get up a list of currently loaded dynamic files and put a breakpoint in one of them but if i search on such things as dynamic and cshtml i get nowhere

8729679
int	double
the type of the expression is determined by the arguments before it is stored so as other answers state an int divided by an int yields an int which will only then be stored as a double

equals	gethashcode
i would actually say that for any struct one should always manually code an override of equals and gethashcode along with implementing if it s at all likely that it could be used by someone as a key so i certainly wouldn t use it just to avoid doing so

8730289
equals	gethashcode
tuple.create makes it easy to compose them and the overrides for equals and gethashcode are pretty reasonable

8730289
equals	gethashcode
in some cases it can also be suitable to use anonymous classes as keys only within the context of a given method of course and here the overrides for equals and gethashcode are pretty reasonable too

8730293
coalesce	isnull
you should fix this using coalesce or isnull

namedtuple	dictionary
namedtuple instances do not have per-instance dictionary so they

8731315
int	double
12 is resolved to an int not an int - and there s no implicit conversion from int to double

client-side	server-side
is the pagination happening client-side or server-side

8731989
client-side	server-side
it internally handles things like paging and sorting so you wouldn t have to worry about reconciling your client-side and server-side code manually between otherwise mutually exclusive plugins controls frameworks

8731989
client-side	server-side
the main thing to keep in mind is to have a clear line of separation between the server-side code and the client-side code

8731989

have a separate server-side handler for responding to ajax requests and treat it like a web service used by the client-side javascript

if the child forms display the purchased_date and purchased inputs - and you want to set the values of those inputs based on the input values in the parent form - you re going to have to script that on the client side javascript jquery so the children s values get set in response to the parent input s change event or similar

8732016

8733550
nsubstitute	moq	nsubstitute	fakeiteasy	moq	fakeiteasy	moq	machine.fakes	machine.fakes	fakeiteasy	machine.fakes	nsubstitute

8733663
glut	glfw
isn t glut glfw already an extension

8733689

indexneeded doesn t meet that description and it s a poor name for an int - it sounds like it should be a boolean

8733713
post	put
i saw a different stackoverflow post saying that i shouldn t put those images into my app assets images folder

8733720
firefox	safari
it works fine in firefox safari with an iphone browser agent as well as on an iphone

8733729
width	margin
but that shouldn t be the issue since they are both small enough width padding margin to fit

8733749
google-chrome	firefox
o yes just using ie 8 and not firefox or google-chrome

8733756
hide	show
i used jquery show here to get the links on my page to show hide 3 different divs as seen here

8733760
apk	dex
additionally there is the possibility to ship with two dex files in a apk

8733760
apk	dex
this also solves many problems because most restrictions apply to the dex files not the final apk

8733764
google-chrome	firefox
i checked this in google-chrome and firefox and it worked very well

8733851
gtk#	monomac
you can then write whatever gui you like monomac gtk# to drive the app directly

8733927
division	modulo
where the operator represents integer division the quotient and the is the modulo the remainder -- i m using python syntax here

8733987
maven	pom.xml
so the idea i had was to somehow pull version information from the maven pom.xml file and concatenate this value onto the default namespace

8733992
printf	fgets
don t use string functions printf strcat fgets etc they will choke on nul characters

8733995
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
it should work with ie6+ firefox google-chrome safari

8734014

8734149
hide	show
i ve got some code that uses toggle to show and hide a div but now i want to do stuff based on which state it s in

8734149
hide	show
i think i need to separate the toggle out into show and hide separately

8734175
hide	show
create both your child forms similar to this then just do show on the one you want to display and hide on the other

8734187
post	get
i ll try some experimenting and post any results i may get

8734190
portrait	landscape
all i need to do is to get the correct bearing in portrait landscape mode

8734211
glut	glfw
i also prefer glfw before glut mainly because glut isn t maintained actively

8734225
glut	glfw
libraries like glut glfw etc are libraries that abstract all of these differences

8734225
glut	glfw
isn t glut glfw already an extension

8734240
children	parent
the problem here is you also have to create a parent that doesn t clip it s children so the view can draw outside its own bounds

8734259
multiplying	multiplication
you re reducing the number of multiplication by a factor of 5 since you won t keep multiplying 5 numbers but 2

8734274
implements	extends
unless the interface for moderators and admins is different in which case they should both extends or at least implements behaviours in a new item privileged user

8734312
google-chrome	safari
how does the html5 file api in modern browsers determine file types more specifically google-chrome safari

8734324
super	extends
admin member implementation class will extends admin interface which by default gets all operations from super interface

8734331
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i ve tested it in safari firefox and google-chrome

8734344
implements	extends
so a can be converted to a reference because implements but that does not mean that implements extends

8734393
implements	extends
admin extends moderator extends member implements usertype

8734396
width	height
i d like to have an nswindow which has a 2 1 width to height ratio while it is open but allow it to have any ratio when full screen

8734413
for-loop	arrays
i then want to be able to call that arrays with a for-loop or something similar so that i can display that information at a later time

8734419
inherited	properties
i suspect the proxy inherited and the supported properties but i don t know how to correct for it

8734432
spaces	delimiter
also -f will change the delimiter to a colon rather than a spaces

8734468
firefox	safari
however while this worked for me in safari mac it did not give the correct results in firefox

8734503
width	height
i found a number of ways to do this however the li tags within my ul tag have php code in them that gets text from a database and this causes the length of the text within the li tags to vary in length significantly causing vertical sifting within my div which has a fixed height and width

8734537
getter	setter
note however that as long as your are forced to create a static class to do this why not go ahead and make the actual array variable private instead of public then add static public getter and setter methods

8734568
octal	hex	octal	decimal
not long ago if at all it would have been decimal and octal instead of decimal and hex or maybe octal only no decimal

8734584
put	get
by using the search method on the koala api object i get a lot of results that i put in a results variable

8734586
rss	feed
an easy way to understand this is to think about an rss feed - each entry on the feed is like a section

8734586
rss	feed
if you would add it to an rss feed or it would make sense in that context then it s probably a section

8734586
rss	feed
if it s just a column on a footer then you wouldn t put it on an rss feed so it s probably not a section

8734587
width	height
i made a separate stylesheet for less than ie9 and in it i have declared width height zoom positioning used all the filters that work in ie..

8734620
width	height
if the image is already in the cache same width height and person as the request it returns that as a byte array

8734653
.htaccess	httpd.conf
you should change the following line in your .htaccess or httpd.conf

8734698
width	height
the naturalxx properties contain the original height width of the image before modifications through html css attributes styling

8734698
width	height
note that you can t use the standard width or height properties since those will return the size of the notfound placeholder image.

8734733
qtableview	qtablewidget
something like qtableview or qtablewidget

8734733
pop-up	dialog
when ctrl +p is pressed or file-- print is selected system printer dialog should pop-up allowing you to print the invoice that can span multiple letter sized pages

8734823
ubuntu	linux
i moved an application from an ubuntu 11.04 natty narwhal server to a red hat enterprise linux rhel server over the weekend

8734832
doc	rtf
issue when mac users dont inlcude extensions on their uploaded files i am testing for postedfile.contenttype to determine the file and or appropriate extension allowable files rtf txt pdf doc docx it seems like the contenttype comes back as application octet ...this makes some sense to me w o an extension as required by pcs but

8734857
int	chars
if you are only handling ascii chars in the range 0-255 it would be a simpler to just have an int or maybe a long array 256 then read the file in effect a chars at a time of course you d use buffering or nio for speed and increment the appropriate bin

8734859
versioning	upgrade
the upgrade software platform can be installed in parallel to existing versioning on the same server

8734871
getter	setter
check out the variant that supports failure here and build your lens by passing a setter and getter that do some validation on the datatype to the lens function

8734876
rss	feed
i am trying to make a request to an rss feed that requires a cookie using python

8734904
int	double
your problem is that bluewidth and len are both int and their result will be an int which is then converted into a double

8734914
pop-up	dialog
however in other cases most notably google sign-ins redirects cause the intent handler dialog to pop-up multiple times

8734916
setinterval	settimeout
then use setinterval or settimeout to execute that function after a specified timeout

8734936
width	height
my nodes are rectangles with defined width and height in pixels

8734936
width	height
how to specify nodes rectangles width and height before using gvlayout

8734936
width	height
important i don t want to use text-based interface get parameters as text i want to access mentioned parameters width and height of node splines of edge coordinates of node... directly as a data variables

8734967
setinterval	settimeout
my previous example used settimeout even after you mentioned setinterval

8734979
client-side	server-side
configure the client to use that client-side certificate to identify itself and only accept the one server-side certificate you installed on your server for that part of it

8734985
min	max
the nice thing about this way is min and max x and y give you the bounding rectangle so initialiiy you just draw that and get your scaling resizing sorted then draw the points and decorate based on the scaled coordinates

8734985
min	max
just loop through the points for min and max y you already have x as they are order so it s just first and last

8734990
qobject	qwidget
edit note that qwidget inherits qobject

8735014
gridview	formview
you are binding the imageurl attribute in your itemtemplate in a gridview or formview probably

8735017
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
even inherited is implemented by copying declarations into the subclassing rather than branching and searching the superclass scope

8735074
viewdidload	viewwillappear	didselectrowatindexpath	viewwillappear
this can be what you call in your didselectrowatindexpath but by moving the actual logic outside of that method you will be able to call in other places such as viewdidload or viewwillappear

8735153
int	double
int is implicitly convertible to both float and double so both candidate methods are applicable

8735153
int	double
however the conversion from int to float is better than the conversion from int to double according to section 7.5.3.2-7.5.3.5

8735159
setinterval	settimeout
one thing to consider is that if you are making asynchronous ajax calls then the setinterval settimeout will continue to run regardless if the previous ajax responses have been called unless if you call settimeout in the response function then the ajax request and response calls will run synchronously

8735164
pop-up	dialog
webtrees uses a lot of pop-up windows and i want to replace them with jquery dialog but i don t want to mess with the core code

8735183

8735329
google-chrome	firefox
however whenever i view it in firefox google-chrome safari.

8735347
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
this check is no longer needed as these methods exist in all currently used browsers added to ie in 5.5 present in firefox google-chrome and safari in 1.0

8735396
width	height
also by making the width and height parameters of the gltexsubimage2d 0 the error is not generated

8735429
pull	push
there are multiple users with seperate unix accounts pull merge and push their own branches to

8735443
pop-up	dialog
and wanted to block user activity for the page when the above dialog pop-up

8735455
int	chars
when you then read it is being read as a string which consists of chars and you get the ascii code of 5 when you cast it simply to an int

8735473
appkit	nsimage
nsimage is part of appkit so it is in use

8735478
int	chars
the id variable is a chars and casting that to int gives you the chars code not the numeric value

8735503
background-repeat	background-position
normally when sites use gradients as background images they make it so the top of the gradient is flush with the top of the screen by setting background-position 0 0 the gradient repeats itself horizontally by setting background-repeat no-repeat and then they set the background-color of the site to be the same color as the bottom of the gradient

8735520
width	height
in the layout file .xml i set the width and height to 50dp density-independent

8735532
accessor	properties
i ve tried creating a custom properties editor to accept null values initializing it in initbinder but this only works if i create a non-primitive set of wrapper accessor

8735536
google-chrome	firefox
browser support is basically there in newer ie google-chrome firefox ios and android

8735542
width	height
the container div is exactly the height and width of one box so it will only show one box at a time

8735542
width	height
it s trickier because you don t have a specified width and height

8735546
ant	maven
3 the language s unit tests must be run natively as normal junit tests by the ant and maven junit tasks goals

8735561
sorting	filtering
you ll simply have to do either the sorting or the filtering in memory just as other databases would

8735573
nsmanagedobjectcontext	nsentitydescription
this worked fine until i added the second view controller in the app delegate im setting the nsmanagedobjectcontext for both view controllers that the tab view uses then each is loaded the same using the respected nsentitydescription and uses the same code to delete

8735650
outputstream	inputstream
there is no standard way to create an inputstream which reads from or an outputstream which writes to one but such things would be very easy to write

8735677
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
typically this is caused by projects that require case-sensitive fs and use file names like string.h which clashes with the system on case-insensitive fses which is the default on os x

8735684
rss	feed
one option i m considering is aggregating news from a variety of rss feed and showing the top headlines on the home page as well as specific headlines on more focused content pages

8735708
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
latest safari google-chrome firefox versions

8735713
cassini	iis
i know that cassini can t do this and it would be nice to be able to do this without using a full version of iis

8735713
folder	directory
what i would like to do is create a virtual directory called offsitestuff and point it to some location on my c drive like c offsitestuff and then browse to items in that folder like this

8735713
cassini	iis
i know i could do this with a folder within my site and still use iis express or for that matter plain old cassini but this folder will store images uploaded by users and i really don t want to have these images mixed up with application files

8735726
spock	unitils	spock	grails
integration testing spock grails spring and unitils plugin

8735758
width	height
the width and height of the mesh are known so it s easy to calculate the vertex indices for a given xy or vice-versa

8735761
put	get
that said -- a real device will probably not get bricked but you will need to use the recovery image to put a working rom back on to use the device again

8735815
postgresql	mysql
for example comparing sqlite postgresql and mysql all of them support much of the same syntax but there are also various differences between the bunch

8735827
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	hlsl	glsl
a wrapper called angle which safari google-chrome and firefox use can translate webgl calls and glsl to either opengl glsl or direct3d hlsl

8735845
google-chrome	firefox
i did not scale them because at least google-chrome and firefox were able to scale them to their needs and this way i did not risk messing with the information in the qr code itself

8735874
avro	thrift
if there is lot of data exchange then a binary format like protobuf or thrift or avro is better

8735882
post	get
i got the value in the textbox to be included but i can t seem to get the id of that text box into the post

8735889
google-chrome	firefox
i m not sure if firefox has one but there s one at least in google-chrome

8735904
ubuntu	linux
i m not a linux or java expert so i wrote the helloworld program and tested it on my mac before trying it in the ubuntu appliance

8735939
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome has this built in just press ctrl-shift-j to bring up dev tools or you can add firebug for firefox and ie has had a dev toolbar option for several versions now

8735949
postgresql	mysql
i m new to postgresql and i m trying to migrate my application from mysql

8736019
filesystems	xfs
i prefer to use the xfs filesystems so that d be my advice

8736037
google-chrome	firefox
testing with segoe ui which often exists in different font weight versions on windows systems i was able to make internet explorer 9 select the proper version when using the logical approach of using the font family name segoe ui and different font-weight values but it failed on firefox 9 and google-chrome 16 only normal and bold work

8736041
postgresql	mysql
it looks like heroku doesn t really support mysql and so we are considering using postgresql which they do support

8736062
postgresql	mysql
it should be simplicity itself port the ddl from mysql to postgresql

8736062
postgresql	mysql
mysql and postgresql are different identity type for mysql sequences for postgresql

8736095
cos	atan2	cos	sin	atan2	sin
i know that i can use trigonometric functions such as atan2 sin cos etc but i am pretty sure there is a faster method

8736129
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
tested in opera 11 firefox 6 internet explorer 8 safari 5 and google-chrome 16

8736133
uiview	subviews
i have a uiview which has several subviews that respond to touch

8736163
rvm	bundler
apache passenger is probably set up to use your system ruby 1.8.7-p249 and not the ruby version you are obviously using with rvm and i guess the reason you get the message that passenger cannot find bundler is because you haven t installed bundler using your system ruby

8736163
rvm	bundler
you can fix this either by installing bundler in the system ruby version or by telling passenger to use whatever ruby version you have installed via rvm

8736174
hide	show
i think what you need to do is loop through each element testing if it has any matches to the input word list and then hide or show that element as appropriate

8736177
google-chrome	firefox
i used font-face on my new site it works fine in localhost in both firefox and google-chrome

8736177
google-chrome	firefox
however when i upload it to my server i can t see the fonts in firefox or google-chrome

8736220
int	double
there won t be a loss of precision error at all because they re all int in this example - you re not actually adding any double

8736220
int	double
however even if you were adding double to an int then there still wouldn t be because the jls defines an implicit cast for these types of operators

8736221
put	get
it seems like i have to add a get and a put for each different view i want to present is that right

8736235
width	height
the user would be required to select a width then height from separate drop down menus

8736235
width	height
once they have made their selections i want an image on the same page to update based on the different combinations of width and height

8736243
put	get
you need to get the android hash key using the command below and put it in your facebook app configuration at developer.facebook.com apps

8736264
apache	lighttpd
i am in the process of converting an old legacy website to zend framework however i will be using lighttpd instead of apache for my web server and lighttpd doesn t support the .htaccess file which is where i would normally add all my rewrites i have a couple of questions

8736274
int	double
as math.random returns an double which is between 0.0 inclusive and 1.0 exclusive the variable converted will only ever contain 0 as it s converted to an int

8736274
int	double
for more on the casting from a double int see here different answer when converting a double to an int - java vs .net

8736283
portrait	landscape
so if it was landscape it would say thursday if it was in portrait it would say thu instead

8736312
google-chrome	safari
in webkit google-chrome 15 and later safari 5.1 and later try element.webkitrequestfullscreen and element.webkitcancelfullscreen where element is your player object

8736357
hide	show
basically i want to have a webpage that doesn t fill the screen vertically and yet i don t want the keyboard to cause the screen to scroll past the bottom of the webpage because that would hide the top part of the webpage and instead show the blank area below the webpage

8736369
postgresql	mysql
mysql will quietly truncate a long string to fit inside a char n column unless your server is in strict mode postgresql will complain and make you truncate your string yourself

8736369
postgresql	mysql
quoting is different mysql uses backticks for quoting identifiers whereas postgresql uses double quotes

8736369
postgresql	mysql
like is case insensitive in mysql but not in postgresql

8736432
division	multiplication
you need 64 64 128 multiplication and 128 64 64 division with proper overflow behavior

8736436
xmlhttprequest	jqxhr
in new versions of jquery the raw xmlhttprequest object is wrapped in jqxhr object which doesn t have any reference to the new upload property of the xmlhttprequest and in the documentation is not very clear how to do it either

8736478
children	parent
i have a many to many table where there are parent and children

8736481
postgresql	mysql
leap works with the following databases db2 drizzle firebird mariadb ms sql mysql oracle postgresql and sqlite

8736486
jar	war
then click on the new then select deployment profiles there u go now u can select the format u need jar war ear mar etc

8736499
width	height
however you might want to add a width and height to div.imagebuttons to prevent it size changes as the window is resizing

8736507
width	height
if you specify the width and height of cells in your html table eg 200px then you could use jquery to tell you if the cell size has changed indicating overflow

8736554
subtract	add	yacc	bison
if you re under linux check out lex and yacc or flex and bison to be precise. to do things like these it s a lot better and you can make things a lot better support parenthesis minus and plus operator instead of just add and subtract etc.

8736561
queue	fifo
if performance is an issue data exchange between a producer and a consumer thread can also be performed very efficiently with a lock-free fifo queue

8736583
toolbar	tabs
beside being static have buttons on the toolbar and be able to see the locations of other tabs what extra functionalities do they provide over scripts on a page

8736590
getter	setter
1 the generator looks at the datamembers exposed by the target class and creates one property with a getter and setter for each one

8736598
udp	tcp
setting ip_recvtos and using ancillary data works for udp but not for tcp sockets

8736649
cpu	processors
you build a processors which can handle java bytecode in the same way that if you want to execute normal x86 code you build a cpu to handle that

8736698
tstringgrid	tlistview
use tlistview instead of tstringgrid

8736698
tstringgrid	tlistview
replace your tstringgrid components with tlistview components set their viewstyle to vsreport set up their columns collections as needed and then update your code as follows

8736703
division	multiplication
for 64-bit mode code you can implement 64 64 128 multiplication similarly to the implementation of 128 64 64 64 division here

8736703
division	multiplication
for 32-bit code it ll be more complex because there s no cpu instruction that would do multiplication or division of such long operands in 32-bit mode and you ll have to combine several smaller multiplication into a bigger one and reimplement long division

8736726
google-chrome	firefox
firebug in firefox or developer tools in google-chrome chromium

8736740
stdout	stderr
if dup2 could do what i m asking this would work redirect stdout and stderr to socket in c

8736753

8740744
for-loop	loops
so you see even in the worst case where you have the while loops run n-1 times in the first iteration of the for-loop you still only get n-1 iterations of the while loops for the entire process

8740798
entities	entitymanager
if you need to restart tomcat to see changes it means that the entitymanager is never closed and reopened and its cache of entities does still contain entities that have been loaded in a previous transaction

testing whether two int are equivalent is usually faster than testing lexicographical equivalence of two strings where your program will have to compare each string chars by chars

8741709
memset	calloc
if you need a dynamically-sized array use a pointer with calloc and reset it with memset as previously described

8741747

maven definitely has better integration with flex than ant

8742257
ant	maven
even though there are popular and supported bundle of readily available ant tasks called flex ant tasks available both with the open source flex sdk and with flash builder also i should point out that ant might more also good choice if you re perplexed by maven complexity or you need build automation for simple small-to-midsize project maven turns out to be more mature and more appropriate choice

jsfiddle tested in opera ie9 ie8 and firefox without any problem

8742810
serializable	deserialization
i personally don t like it too much as in case of changes applied to the object serializable before like add remove properties change types function parameters or its sequence will lead to deserialization failure

8742835
mp3	wav	mp3	flac	mp3	aiff	mp3	ogg	wav	flac	wav	aiff	wav	ogg	flac	aiff	flac	ogg	aiff	ogg

on startup after deserialization old state check for change- files if they exist this was a crash and we have to work them up then do a new serializable and delete changefiles

8742900
getter	setter
i m trying to implement some automated getter and setter for php objects

8742905
profiling	benchmarking
and then i d do some benchmarking profiling to check if the only changed values versionn really is faster better than the update all values version

8742909
width	height
width 1000px height 70px

8742909
width	height
it gets better when i either display less controls at a time higher height or only a part of them decreasing the listview or boxview width

8742909
width	height
does this mean that this hardware is just not able to perform smooth scrolling on full screen width and height or are there any further things i can to to improve the scrolling performance

8742917
nsstring	nsdata
to be exact i used the - nsstring base64encoding from to jimmy rig it for now but i will most likely implement raw writing of nsdata bytes into bson format and see if that will cut it

8742922
post	get
edit offtopic of the question this answer is incorrect but this question has already been answered in other post so to avoid delete this one i will use this same regex other way for example in perl could be used like this to get same result as in c# increment last digit

8742956
getter	setter
i have read something about the layout of the combo box property and tried changing that also stepped through the getter and setter of the property to ensure it is not clearing down which is not as it will bind to the text box

8742967
pull	push
you push your master aka stable and typically on pull request if it looks ok you would pull into your master

8742972

now when i run cobertura cobertura on the parent project the classes that are already gone are still listed in the coverage report on our jenkins ci

8742976
ubuntu	linux
i have a question regarding shell scripts the environment is linux preferably ubuntu

8743032
apache	nginx
even better would be a frontserver apache lighthttp nginx redirecting traffic to the right server behind based upon domain names

8743056
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
this approach works with the latest firefox google-chrome safari -

8743064
getter	setter
otherwise eschewing getter and setter alltogether might be advisable

8743094
sum	coalesce
to deal with the null problem you need to wrap the sum in a coalesce

8743129
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
the issue here is the menu works fine in firefox but in other browsers like google-chrome ie safari etc the text box comes below the menu

8743146
int	double
if you use int instead of double the normalization and centering of coordinates by some fixed constant could be useful for some distances and bad for others

8743150
gridview	objectdatasource
i was wondering if the onrowupdated event only fires if you use a objectdatasource because im using my own class as a datasource and when i update a row in the gridview it fires the onrowupdating event but not the onrowupdated event so i can t test the affectedrows or exceptions can someone explain this mystery to me

8743167
httpconnection	downloading
i think you can use httpconnection to downloading and process to run it

8743173
prop	each
needless to say each product has more than one prop which is kept in the producthas table

8743190
post	get
if you post another question explaining the problem you re try to solve you ll get a more pythonic way of doing it

8743199
vsto	add-in
i want to open an excel or powerpoint document with office 2010 or 2007 with a vsto add-in

8743201
post	get
i ve been knocking my head against a wall for two weeks now poring over the net poring over stackoverflow and repeatedly testing and failing to get a script together to post an event to a fan page

8743227
post	get
i think you should get rid of the post rendering in the update.php

8743268
octal	decimal
it s probably octal notation which needs three digits to properly express the decimal values 0 to 255

8743282
put	get
what i would suggest though is that you consider rearchitecting this to use aspectj and put a cut point in your parent call to collect the information you really want before you get too low in the stack

8743304
qtip	tipsy
don t reinvent the wheel use a jquery plugin such as qtip or tipsy

8743327
hide	fadeout
also note that fadeout simply hide the element it sets display none and doesn t remove it from the dom

8743334
hide	show
or you could maybe hide the recent files then show them

8743335
children	parent
by default in resque the parent process forks and the children processes create a new connection to the database

8743335
children	parent
what would be the solution to have the children use the mysql connection of their parent

8743373
width	height
as long as i could see the design got the required images and the with and width and height of everything was written down somewhere

8743389
subtract	add
at this point all you need is to parse all durations and add or subtract them to calculate the total duration and then format it the way you want

8743401
udp	tcp
so just produce any packet tcp http or udp which will contain it

8743413
width	height
i have scrollview with width and height fill_parent and i implemented simpleongesturelistener like

8743422
std	ostream
std ostream does not have a default constructor this

8743459
int	chars
because chars and chars pointers are treated differently than int when it comes to printing

8743459
int	chars
to get the results you desire cast your chars pointer to a void pointer and cast your chars to an int

8743482
put	get
when we set opacity say p to layer 1 we can put 0.5 or 50 and get a whitish red color say color value x

8743565
queue	fifo
it would be possible to queue the requests up and processes them fifo but this would not scale well when you have hundreds of requests queue up and each request takes 100ms to process

8743580
submit	submission
and when i submit the form ajax submission it sends an http request to for example the path even if the current language is de note the part

8743624
google-chrome	firefox
this code works fine in firefox but in google-chrome it triggers the submit twice where the first time the request.isajaxrequest returns true and the second time it returns false

8743667
chown	chmod
also be sure to use chown and chmod recursively on the entire repository

8743689
button	checkbox
if this doesnt work try creating a hidden submit button and make the checkbox click it on change

8743705
width	height
your problem is that you re not calculating the width height to a correct aspect ratio

8743705
width	height
so to get a 1 1 proportions you would need a width of 134.735 pixels for a 173 pixel height

8743795
spaces	delimiter
spaces in particular make sense to forbid as spaces is used as the delimiter between the element name and each attribute

8743813
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
so i have styled my menus and they now work great with google-chrome safari and firefox but not ie i have a basic horizontal list loaded from a datasource with 1-13 items in the dynamic lists attached to them

8743813
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome and firefox now after the menu is styled the dynamic menu items are appearing properly below the static menu items

8743852
post	get
my domain object does not keep the values that are not explicitly referenced in the jsp file between a get and a post operation on the same controller

8743853
getter	setter
in your entity the column annotation should only be used on your getter not on your setter as well

8743906
serializable	deserialization
it seems that the serializable and deserialization required when transferring the entities back to the master instance hampers the performance

8743917
getter	setter
if i access the variable test only through synchronized getter setter it works as expected

8743939
move	drag
i need to exclude the thumbs from touch manipulation because currently when the user move the thumb with his finger all the shape is move instead of resizing it with drag delta at the thumb

8743972
put	get
the reason i thought it may be fixed is if from outside the testdata ptr x.getdataptr you try to put fixed you get you cannot take the address of an already fixed expression

8743990
onclick	onsubmit
try putting function call in submit button s onclick or form s onsubmit event

8744044
width	height
you can transform an a-tag as block element and give them a height and width

8744048
udp	tcp
just in case you want to have 2 ports unless its not a tcp eg udp

8744064
chunked	transfer-encoding
mode block server gse transfer-encoding chunked error errors domain global reason parseerror message parse error code 400 message parse error

8744065
packets	pcap
there was a possible simpler scenario where all packets from pcap file are read into memory but this could lead to problems with large capture files

8744097
pop-up	dialog
in the past i set an application as default launcher on my android phone when the dialog pop-up up for selecting the default application and now i have forgot which application it was

8744112
width	height
setbounds methods are called afterwards with a width or height less

8744166
folder	directory
if you don t see the app directory either you didn t install correctly or your in the wrong folder on your system

8744191
tiff	png
i am attempting to use ghostscript to convert psd tiff pcx...files to png file

8744219
client-side	server-side
you appear to be confusing server-side client-side scripts here

8744284
cgpoint	cgrect
i would suggest looping through the buttons and check if the cgpoint is within the cgrect of the button

8744285
mousemove	mousedown
i tested a few events and it isn t picking up mousedown events but it is picking up mousemove events

8744288
many-to-many	one-to-many
the relationship may be one-to-one one-to-many or many-to-many - one student is enrolled on many courses and similarly one course has many students

8744309
google-chrome	firefox
this code works fine on google-chrome but doesn t on firefox and ie

8744309
google-chrome	firefox
once again it fails only on firefox and ie google-chrome does submission plus redirection fine

8744338
min	max
what we re using here are called aggregate functions. in this case it s sum but it could be max or min or avg or whatever

8744348
public	protected
it works fine with public methods but not with private or protected methods in the same class protected because i have some standard pre built methods to add to the base class

8744369
free	malloc
i don t see why malloc free and or vector types wouldn t work either

8744376
gif	png
i tried to upload jpg png gif file types but codeigniter always shows that the type is application octet-stream

8744413
inherited	properties
the msdn says that the textbox dependency properties isreadonly is defined with the metadata flag inherited

8744413
inherited	properties
so now the question is why is the isreadonly properties flagged as inherited but can t be inherited

8744419
folder	directory
i don t want end users to see the first 2 folder in my directory since they re not used often anyway

8744568
hash	salt
so i m talking about the passwords used to connect to the database not the passwords in the database which for clarification i have hash with salt and pepper

8744568
postgresql	mysql
if someone has a suggestion from the database perspective having the ability to restrict users to select insert delete update etc and not allowing drop and truncate as examples my primary concern is making sure i am sql neutral as i plan to eventually migrate from mysql to postgresql this may or may not be relevant though if it is better to mention it

8744602
hide	show
but it is better to hide the errors from being displayed as it show some vital information about your setup not just the home admin part

8744643
getter	setter
lastly .net accesses properties without gets and sets so object.property is both the getter and setter compared to java s object.getproperty and object.setproperty

8744766
jquery	anythingslider
i am using the anythingslider jquery plugin with the touch events

8744798
folder	directory
i do have directory in the root folder which i do not wish to remove the trailing url but i can add a ignore rule for those

8744803
implements	extends
if your xml file is in other formats you have to make your own resource loader by extends reloadableresourcebundlemessagesource and implements your logic to parse the xml file by overridding its loadproperties resource resource string filename

8744808
button	checkbox
both pages have some input fields like checkbox radio button dropdowns

8744860
public	protected
to support this answer i have written a test program that demonstrates the invocation of public protected and private class methods

8744860
public	protected
someclass.cs - contains three methods of each of the visibility modifiers public protected and private

8744865
notepad++	jedit
try opening it in a good editor like jedit or notepad++ and see what the editor tells you it is then specify that encoding instead of utf

8744883
put	get
might not be totally relevant but i put it here so you can get an idea about what the data looks like

8744902
asterisk	pbx
it might also be that your pbx is based on asterisk - an opensource solution for pbx.

8744903
nunit	mstest
using nunit or the mstest framework you can use an attribute on your test method declaration to specify that you expect an exception

8744954
int	chars
not really chars and int are implicitly converted

8744954
int	chars
you can look at a chars in this case as a smaller int

8744954
int	chars
programatically there s no difference in this case unless the input string is very long in which case the chars will overflow before an int does

8744969
int	chars
in fact even a chars literal enclosed in single quotes for example n is of type int but is implicitly converted to a chars when assigned or compared to another chars

8744979
int	chars
the code treats c as an int variable in c chars is basically a very narrow int

8744993
int	chars
a chars is c is an integral type as is short int long and long long and many other types

8744993
int	chars
whereas an int type can usually hold values up to 2 147 483 647 but takes up 4 times the space in the machine as an 8 bit chars

8745031
int	double
actually this also works on all other datatypes like int double pointers arrays nested structures ... everything you can imagine thanks to pmg for pointing this out

8745082
put	get
if you have different data for each year you should put that in a separate table so that you get the year as data not part of the column name

8745121
i2c	spi
i2c are very different from spi and your device maybe does not support sequence read by i2c

8745129
carrierwave	fog
i used fog carrierwave to upload the image file and to call the file

8745161
flask	cherrypy

but when i add the fadein + fadeout either the images disappeared when a thumbnail is clicked or the same image fades out then back in so im sure im nearly there but need pointing in the right direction...how do i get the previous image to fadeout and the newly clicked image to fadein please

8749207
nunit	moq
after using moq to setup things i generally prefer to use nunit but you can use any other test framework

8749279
fadein	fadeout
that s because fadein and fadeout uses opacity so you image just become invisible

8749279
fadein	fadeout
or just put a fadein on fadeout i think the second is better

8749285
put	get
as soon as the user inputs something into search bar the view model calls the autocomplete api with keyword parameter to get the autocomplete suggestions back and put them into a observablecollection container

8749306
onresume	onpause
the other thing is that if i put the onresume and if i release the camera when the tab is onpause the app crash

8749316
migrate	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
the jquery migrate plugin can be used to re-introduce live in versioning newer than 1.9.0 but it is recommended that developers upgrade to the on method instead

8749380
int	double
in the class container i would like to have a vector parameter from different types int double ... or something equivalent which seems to not possible

8749433
post	get
i ve read dozens of post about this and tried as many solutions but i can t seem to get anything to work

8749459
post	get
however when i try to post using restlet i get a 401 - unauthorized response

8749471
for-loop	loops
so as a habit i never use a for-loop in my viewimplementation class but put loops in the presenter activity and call a method in the viewimplementation class to do each single iteration task of loops

8749506
downcasting	upcasting
i think that in the first case it is upcasting downcasting

8749519
maven	m2e
the error message sounds like it is coming from the maven eclipse integration m2e

8749596
capitalize	uppercase
the case i am using matches this example where my company is capitalize and the module name is all uppercase

8749640
implements	extends
on the example you give you first try to retrieve a non-existing value on the list as you do python first retrieve the third index 2 element on the list then proceed to get the element named a on that object - therefore you have to implements your automatic extends behavior to the __getitem__ method as well like this

8749643
innodb	myisam
my database contains +200 gb in innodb tables which i don t want to be stored in the ram and 10 tables 100 mb which uses the myisam engine

8749679
textview	imageview
however ultimately i would suspect that you could be successful with just a relativelayout as the outermost then the imageview and four textview as direct children

8749713
contour	imshow
here are some examples on how to use pcolor imshow and contour in basemap

8749729
centos	linux
play 1.2.3 on windows 7 local and linux centos 5 prod

8749734
button	checkbox
another solution add checkbox to each entry and use a single form with only one submit button

8749742
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
it works fine in safari firefox google-chrome and ie9 compatibility mode

8749762
htmlcleaner	jsoup
you can also use jsoup instead of htmlcleaner

8749771
post	get
as a result i just need value fields of selected options without post get sendings to php script

8749908
hide	show
if i get it right you want div element to show if you are over it and hide when the mouse is not over

8749948
post	get
the name problem will exist for both post and get so make sure that all the items are named differently

8749982
maven	pom.xml
i looked at the maven pom.xml files and i ve been reading about deployment descriptors but i don t seem to be making in progress

8749994
post	get
when making a post to subscribe to facebook facebook issues a get with the callback url with the following query parameter

8750021
google-chrome	firefox
tested this works for me in ie9 google-chrome and firefox

8750030
min	max
the device-width and device-height media query features along with their min max prefixes essentially provide the screen resolution of a mobile device

8750030
width	height
the orientation media feature is portrait when the value of the height is greater than or equal to the value of the width mdash

8750030
portrait	landscape
so max-width in portrait mode becomes max-height in landscape mode

8750083
put	get
if you think by this a website can get slow could you please tell me where exactly should i put my css images and javascript files in

8750087
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome and firefox it works perfectly but not in ie surprise

8750099
width	height
it seems that if the linearlayout containing the seekbars uses weights but for the default width or height is not specified 0px or 0dips the seekbars in the emulator slows down

8750102
hide	show
i just want to hide the other divs when i make my one selection and just show that one div

8750142
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
or see case-insensitive file.equals on case-sensitive file system

8750188
inherited	properties
another possibility is to write a new qml component that inherited from text an sets some properties by default

8750240
getter	setter
so i would make the various view-model property setter getter simple adapters on the wrapped model objects

8750244
ilist	icollection
which i can be cast to return ilist or icollection but not as a collection

8750249
rss	feed
for handling rss feed

8750252
google-chrome	firefox
using your developer console in google-chrome or firefox should be really useful in figuring out how to overwrite or determine the cause

8750288
ilist	icollection
my reasoning is that ilist icollection and their concrete implementations permit modification of the list returned from grob which you probably don t want

8750301
cherrypy	cheetah
so im doing a bit of web development and due to some restriction set by my employer i need to use cheetah and cherrypy

8750309
width	height
before i call gvlayout to calculate node coordinates i have to set node width and height for each node in the graph

8750309
width	height
i just don t want to use string-based apis like agsafeset because i m processing bunch of nodes in a loop and prefer to set width and height values with nd_width pnode and nd_height pnode or directly as pnode- u.width and pnode- u.height

8750309
width	height
p.s. i use graphviz solely for layout i do custom rendering so all i need is calculation of nodes and edges coordinates in pixels given nodes width and height in pixels

8750402
min	max
one thought i ve had is to use the h-value in the appropriate dimension to buffer the min and max coordinates of each dimension and pre-derive the extent for the kde output

8750421
inherited	properties
you can see inherited properties events and methods at the bottom of a kind s description

8750426
keydown	keyup
but i believe you can only kill the form submission with keydown not keyup

8750433
tablet	mdpi
most of the other tablet 7 inch and 10.1 inch tablet are mdpi

8750467
disk	ram
step 02 create a ram disk

8750467
disk	ram
step 05 mount the ram disk onto var lib mysql memorydb

8750471
hide	show
then the easiest way is to just hide the text box and show the dropdownlist instead

8750506
hash	salt
to that end there is the rfc2898derivebytes class which is slow and can be made slower and may answer the second part of the original question in that it can take a password and salt and return a hash

8750581
versioning	upgrade
the problem was probably due to using an earlier build of xcode or inconsistencies in xcode from having upgrade from earlier versioning over the years

8750608
touchesbegan	touchesended
the key is to override touchesbegan as well not just touchesended which is what i m really interested in

8750609
carrierwave	fog
i would only use fog if another gem such as carrierwave dragged it in

8750619

8750692
hide	show
i m looking for a java script sample or jquery sample that show or hide a div based on weather the div has value

8750736
width	height
if the element s width and height are explicitly set to 0

8750748
folder	directory
if the folder containing the interesting files are subfolders of your dated directory you can use a nested loop

8750767
subtract	add
this will perform a set difference in effect subtract input from compare and returning what is left over which we can then add to the results dictionary

8750820
jax-ws	jax-rs
i ve tried injecting the webservicecontext as mentioned here but it does not seem to work probably because it is part of the jax-ws specification and we are using jax-rs

8750848
put	get
this does put it in an array but when trying to access the first data set i get data1 instead of data1 data2

8750856
backbone.js	javascriptmvc
to look at frameworks like extjs javascriptmvc or backbone.js

8750866
partition-problem	np-complete
seems like it is np-complete and reducible to subset sum problem or more precisely to partition-problem

8750895
versioning	upgrade
likewise you can change the versioning numbers if you ever need to re-run upgrade scripts but make sure you understand the consequences of running setup upgrade scripts a second time if you do

8750897
versioning	upgrade
i would like old clients to continue to work correctly against a upgrade versioning of the server

8750916
std	ostream
actually if you want to change color using ansi escape codes you can just create suitable color manipulators and use them with an std ostream

8750923
put	get
if this is not complete enough or you can t get this code to work drop me a comment and i ll help you out or put up a js fiddle

8751029
vim	emacs
i don t know if emacs or vim are worth it since i ll still mostly program in eclipse

8751036
folder	directory
since virtual device emulator settings and configurations are written in this folder the sdk tools avd manager in this case has to be able to write in this directory

8751067
http	spdy
spdy is basically a variation of http s that accelerates web page load time

8751103
nsurl	nsstring
- you would be safer doing the objective c calls which take nsurl s or nsstring objects

8751148
ienumerable	iqueryable
the example is meant to keep the question simple in reality i have a complicated projection that i want to keep as an iqueryable prematurely converting to an ienumerable won t work

8751190
folder	directory
it will create the directory and then it places the git repo that .git folder and then checkout the master branch files into it

8751209
icmp	tcp
i don t believe you need to worry about unclean disconnects -- when the client machines are abruptly removed from the network your server will eventually get either tcp fin packets or icmp destination unreachable messages which will trigger the close event in your server and allow you to clean up

8751219
width	height
the smaller width shows up as expected but not the height

8751238
liferay	web-inf
liferay has a file named portal-developer.properties as template in web-inf classes

8751253
post	get
make sure that your ajax calls are made using post and not get if you want to keep using

8751392
dozer	jackson
jackson library not enough mature for now.so rendering model object problematic.it provide a few annotation and filter to customize rendered json but not enough.so i suggest you create new java classes for just views and map domain objects to this view class using dozer framework end return this view classes in responsebody

8751407
tcplistener	tcpclient
is it okay to be done with web service or would it be better if it is done through tcplistener and tcpclient technology or perhaps some third option

8751544
readonly	temporary
since it would be annoying to forbid the use of any and all methods on structs in readonly context--even those which don t in fact modify this --compilers instead handle method calls on readonly structs by making temporary copies of the structs and running the methods on those copies

8751544
width	height
struct fancyrect public int left top width height

8751605
google-chrome	firefox
if you open it in firefox and then in internet explorer google-chrome you should see what i mean and this is in regards to the two areas below the content view our projects and news

the following creates an off-screen canvas that is the same width and height as your image and has the image drawn on it

8751667
width	height
height to width ratio

8751667
width	height
filtering images by a height to width ratio eliminates a large percentage of junk

8751667
width	height
min height and width

8751667
width	height
filtering images based on an absolute minimum height and width that both dimensions must pass as well as a slightly larger value that at least one dimension must pass helped filter some junk

8751671
profiling	instrumentation
you won t always attach it to a running process i find that s more common to start a process in the debugger although there do exist tools such as instrumentation that will profiling a running process

8751671
profiling	instrumentation
instrumentation - profiling your application look for memory leaks

8751706
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari

draggable	droppable
i have a droppable div element that fades out when a draggable element is dragged off it

8751866
draggable	droppable
the problem i m getting is when there are two draggable elements on the droppable

8751866
draggable	droppable
how can i check if there is already another draggable element on the droppable so i can cancel the fade effect

8751866
draggable	droppable
i want the droppable element to fade only when the last draggable element is taken off

8751879
std	ostream
can t really say for sure without seeing the source code of that function but since it s a null pointer exception via std ostream i would bet that you re trying to send a null string to std cout or some such

8752008
ant	maven
note i ve seen this question but i hope to avoid using sbt even though it s the scala way to do things because we ve got a giant java codebase that s only barely converted over from ant to maven

8752026
setcontentview	findviewbyid
you need to uncomment this line without calling setcontentview layoutid using findviewbyid layoutid will return null which is why bback is null

draggable	droppable
in that case you could keep track of which or at least how many draggable went over your droppable but didn t went out

8752389
vim	emacs
if you wish to learn vim or emacs then print yourself the vim or emacs quick reference card

8752389
vim	emacs
in fact i d recommend learning vim or emacs even if you wind up mostly using a more modern editor simply because they exist when nothing else does

8752389
vim	emacs
there was an issue with bash s vi mode in which it ignored the arrow keys for ages which forced people into using vim for editing and emacs mode in bash but now set -o vi works correctly in bash

8752402

the code i have got allows me to do all this but with only one link that toggles the show and hide which isn t very useful as i need the hide link to be at the bottom of all my content now

8752806
width	height
make sure you always use fill_parent or wrap_content for your width and height attributes

8752806
width	height
in case of percentage based width s use linearlayout for your layouts and use layout_weight attribute for giving the width or height

8752806

the and send a get request not a post request

8752878
required	placeholder
this is clearer and simpler no need to know what std bind does or what the std placeholder are for more flexible it can support any expression not just parameter binding required no support headers and will probably compile a little faster too

8752881
ready	each
so the get_temporary_buffer could be intended to be a bigger-than-you-would-need chunk of memory that is allocated once perhaps there are many chunks ready for accepting multiple requests and each time you need memory you just get one of the chunks

8752891
children	parent
the trick is to then delete the parent nodes and all their children without throwing a fatal error

8752934
range	minimum
you can also specify minimum and maximum range m being the minimum and n the maximum

get requests are simply requesting a readonly version of data a post request is implying that you are making a change to a certain url so it s possible that the api allows get requests without authentication but requires authentication on the post request

8753257
post	get
you need to read about post and get processing in php

8753257
post	get
for the html side you just submit a form and specify which of the two methods get or post you want to use

8756635
inherited	properties
static classes classes with static properties and methods can t inherited ordinary instance-level methods and can t implement interfaces with static methods

8756988
hash	md5
thirdly use a better hash than md5 for passwords

8756994
portrait	landscape
you can use the same xib but have two different views one for portrait and one for landscape

8756999
portrait	landscape
if your uis for landscape and portrait are radically different then it would be a more acceptable approach

8756999
portrait	landscape
but you could easily just use a single nib with two views inside it one for landscape one for portrait instead

8756999
portrait	landscape
the accepted design pattern that apple put forward is your view controller manages both landscape and portrait orientations and either adjusts its view using autoresizing masks and also hooking into the various delegate methods triggered upon rotation to add remove animate views or replaces the view with something else

8756999
portrait	landscape
if your landscape portrait views are quite different i d recommend having a single nib with two views inside it one for landscape one for portrait and adding removing those two views inside your view controller when you detect rotation

8756999
portrait	landscape
standard practice is always quite difficult to define and perhaps some people will disagree with me but i certainly haven t seen any apps that use two nibs for their landscape portrait orientations and i haven t seen any apple sample code that does it either

you can change the show and hide for fadein and fadeout for a nicer look if you like

8758571
oncreate	onstart	oncreate	recreate
the answer is basically yes the activity is recreate and the control flows through oncreate onactivityresult onstart and so on

8758571

delphi	oxygene
this question is really about delphi xe2 capabilities but since this cross platform stuff is new especially the oxygene java i m curious if anyone has tried to target all 4 platforms from one delphi c++ code base using the xe2 toolchain

8758719
hide	show
the best workaround i ve found for client side reporting would be to set column s width in code or use multiple columns and show hide them based on string length condition

8758730
post	get
fwiw i did manage to get this done with gd - wasn t as complicated as i thought - will post the script if anyone else needs it

8758756
client-side	server-side
first you need to decide if you need to test the client-side iphone app the server-side code or both

8758775
onresume	onpause
i don t know precisely but for my opinion i think that you have to open database in onresume method of your activity and close it onpause

8758814
getter	setter
so if you have a page that displays a form an image and a login box the backing beans will have getter setter pairs for the data that needs to be exposed or changed in the view

8758814
getter	setter
would one backing bean exposing methods and getter setter pairs for all components on this page be legal and correct meaning that i don t do any wrong in the same way as making 3 backing beans

8758816
delphi	oxygene
oxygene prism is a separate product from delphi xe2 with a different albeit similar language

8758849

usually sip controls the session sdp describes the protocols used by the session and other protocols - rtp typically - send media voice text etc between the entities

8758909
fadein	fadeout
use jquery fadeout and fadein like so

post	get
http doesn t specify the format of get and post data

8759041
qmainwindow	qpushbutton

width	height
use a div with the width and height set to the width and height of the picture and use the background property to load the picture url myimage.jpg

8759201
.htaccess	httpd.conf
you can then diff the successful unsuccessful request to try to narrow down the issue if bad requests always fail and good requests always succeed when re-requested from fiddler regardless of which network computer they are issued then it is likely a server side issue .htaccess or httpd.conf setting sensitive to one of the request attributes

8759223
portrait	landscape
one in portrait and the second one is in landscape format

8759233
int	chars
i have a array of structs returned from pinvoke and it returns the array fine if the struct just contains int or float but when i try to return an array of chars it starts to get messy i have tried with returning an intptr but that has not been successfull

8759274
int	chars
so next up you have an int of 0 and then a string 14 chars in length

8759290
int	chars	unsigned	short
the chars array might also work because the chars in c# logically represents an actual single chars intended use something c doesn t really have short of unsigned int types

8759304
hide	show
are you trying to animate the show hide

8759308
arcpy	arcgis
arcpy is used for customizing mapping and geoprocessing solutions within the arcgis 10 software

once the flash player is installed the get flash player button disappears now that the object has width and height set to 0

8759531
conio	ncurses
i wrote it using the windows conio library but i m fairly sure this should be applicable to ncurses

8759535
min	max
unfortunately linq does not have a min max operator for strings so although the sql might support this linq does not

8759542
jobs	cron
however the data will always be more real-time compared to cron jobs

8759560

i m not sure if i understand you but if your cancel button does a redirect it should end in a get and your submit button does a post that s how you should difference both request

8759578
implements	extends
you could create your own dictionary extends or better composing it and implements ibindinglist interface then you should be able to bind the derived dictionary to the datagridview

8759608
hide	show
if table2.tem is not null then hide table1.org else show table1.org

8759617
int	double
so if you re creating a arraylist of int float double etc

8759650
equals	gethashcode
as a rule of thumb if you override equals you need to override gethashcode as well but this is not necessary in your case as the default is what you are looking for

8759679
equals	gethashcode
if you only want references to the exact same instance to be equivalent you are fine and need do nothing but if you are using your type as a key and you want equivalent instances to be considered equals your class must implement equals and gethashcode

8759679
equals	gethashcode
for example in this case mytype does not need to override equals or gethashcode because it is only used as a value and not as the storage key

8759679
equals	gethashcode
your custom type is the key and thus it would need to override equals and gethashcode

8759679
equals	gethashcode
the gethashcode is used to determine which location it hashes to and the equals is used to resolve collisions on the hash code among other things

8759739
stdout	stderr
if the process will produce too much 64k on some linuxes for stderr and or stdout program will be blocked

8759748

i m developing on api v.2.3.3 testing on nexus-s with android version 2.3.6

8759935
oncreate	recreate
after doing this i got some extra logs don t know why but i guess this is not that important and saw that when i m returning to the first tag the activity gets restarted onrestart is called whereas in the other two cases when scanning the second and the third tag the activity is recreate oncreate is called

8759941
decoder	encoder
i have written encoder decoder for tobjectlist you will have to do the same for your objects and embed the class name somewhere

8759961
hash	salt
i currently salt and hash the email and password into 1 40 char token

8760002
viewdidload	viewwillappear
your problem seems to be that your using the viewwillappear method instead of the viewdidload

8760002
hide	show
this will cause multiple imageviews because your adding a new one every time you hide then show the viewcontroller it s presented in

8760040
cos	sin
strange foreign terms like cos and sin are looming on the horizon

8760051
spaces	delimiter
that ingredients in the steps are delimiter by spaces

8760052
post	get
why is it set to post even though i have used httpcon.setrequestmethod get

8760090
hide	show
i m using jquery mobile to generate a select menu which hide show columns of an html table

8760105
getter	setter
on the other hand in my practice it s not a good thing to use built-in as getter and setter with a syntax of function set somevar value void

8760105
getter	setter
it hardens refactoring very much because when get in many time by just not knowing that some variable is a setter or getter

8760105
getter	setter
of course because it s not a common use in as community such ide s like flashdevelop doen t support such getter and setter generation

8760106
for-loop	loops
alternatively you could just iterate over the part you want with a for-loop instead of a foreach loops

8760109
udp	tcp
i have this tcp server running because udp server was able to accept large packets but isp blocks my udp packets even i have public ip and static services

8760109
udp	tcp
but now decided to change it to tcp but i have a large stack now to replace with udp to tcp

8760109
udp	tcp
none is allowing me to handle large so that i can switch from udp to tcp

8760118
keystore	jks
openssl is capable of producing a pkcs#12 file .p12 which the default java security providers should be able to use as a keystore directly although keytool in java 6 and above is capable of converting them to a jks store via -importkeystore

8760130
nsdateformatter	nscalendar
i found a way to adjust this to make sure we are using the gregorian calendar with nsdateformatter and specifying an nscalendar with the first date of the week to be monday like the following

8760130
nsdatecomponents	nsdateformatter
however to be honest i wouldn t like to use that along with nsdatecomponents i would rather use the nsdateformatter but overall it would be cool to fix the first example which gives me a false weekdayordinal value

8760165
for-loop	loops
to be much more specific i need a for-loop or an idex to loops first over all rows and per row over every collumn.

8760169
udp	tcp
tcp and udp are different

8760174
lgpl	maemo
they also say that usually the lgpl version is ok for symbian maemo or meego development

8760182
gridview	objectdatasource
rather than using an objectdatasource and then binding a gridview to the objectdatasource that works but i need more freedom to customize the form

8760206
equals	gethashcode
anonymous types provide overridden equals and gethashcode methods which are defined in terms of the equals and gethashcode implementations of the properties

8760257
put	get
i get my answer put it here for anyone have same asking.

8760274
rss	feed
i have a custom django-command that reads and rss looks for new feed and if any new feed is found i push it pusher.com to my webapp hosted in heroku heroku.com

8760294
google-chrome	safari
this happens in google-chrome safari but when the window is resized the .news-item elements retain their original width rather than adjusting it to fit the resized images

8760313
codeigniter	yii
if you want to develop your own mvc framework you can but i strongly suggest you to first learn the mvc frameworks which already available with lots of options i.e codeigniter yii etc

8760318
post	put
you could download the page with atlassian cli and parse out the section of html you want to modify put that in your wysiwyg and then inject it back into the downloaded html and post it back

8760352
implements	extends
since the interface extends ienumerable you have to implements the methods declared on both

8760362
maven	pom.xml
i suspect you need to add the libraries to your maven pom.xml file

8760377
ienumerable	ienumerator
the other comes from ienumerable and returns ienumerator

8760412
width	height
the width and height of imageref are actually w 768 h 780 so the ratio should be max 0.781 0.769 0.78

8760412
width	height
dividing the width or height by the desired size as in cgimagegetwidth imageref 600 etc. fixed the problem

8760418
hide	show
you could add a dependency property to the user control that you want to use as a data template a dependency property named type for example and depending on that property you can change the layout of your user control data template - for example you could have multiple grids inside your user control and you could show and hide them depending on the type

8760442
oncreate	onstart
suppose there are two activities a and b and activity a calls activity b through startonactivityresult intent 200 then your activity goes to background and activity b is called oncreate onstart onresume depends on what you have overridden

8760442
oncreate	onstart
in this case now ie activity a the call will be onactivityresult - onstart - onresume but your oncreate will not be called as it is only called when you call a certain activity

8760465
google-chrome	safari
i m looking for something more updated to include safari 5 and google-chrome

8760474
maven	pom.xml	ant	maven	ant	pom.xml
i ended up writing an ant task that modifies the pom.xml and changes the version in the file before maven script is triggered

8760489
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome firefox and ie9

8760547
tiff	png
try using a grid or tiff file instead of a png

8760550
opera	firefox
firefox leaves offsety undefined and opera sets it to 1

8760603
udp	tcp
you don t mention if you re using udp or tcp however i suspect you re using tcp in which case it will handle any interruptions on its own -- provided the connection doesn t get torn down

8760619
submit	submission
if on event add on end return false ajax works but this way form dont submit how delay a bit execution so ajax end and after continue form submission

8760654
opencv	vlfeat
according to this so answer to a similar question you should look at opencv and vlfeat

8760668
archetypes	dexterity
dexterity arguably has more better documentation than archetypes see plone.org products dexterity as well as my book professional plone 4 development

8760670
typeerror	traceback
traceback object or none a typeerror exception is raised

8760684
udp	tcp
if you are talking about on the same network you could use a udp broadcast which is picked up by the device which contains the remote ip which then sends a response to the android handset with it s own tcp ip address

8760747
profiling	instrumentation
i found this paint app and used the profiling zombie instrumentation on it

8760760
pop-up	dialog
other modes including the default mode wmode window wmode direct and wmode gpu require us to hide your flash object when dialog pop-up chat tabs and ticker flyouts occur

8760807
google-chrome	firefox
i have a flex application that when i update on the server i can see the changes in both firefox and and google-chrome but i.e continues to show the application before the change.

8760828
uitableview	uisearchbar
the only problem is that if i search and then click on cancel without deleting the text from the uisearchbar and then go back to previous view controller and then go to that same view with uitableview and uisearchdisplaycontroller it crashes with this being written to the log

8760848
uilabel	uibutton
when i run the same code with a uilabel instead of a uibutton i can see the label

8760857
spaces	delimiter
is there a way to use spaces as delimiter but have the number of spaces be a variable size

8760887
spaces	delimiter
in awk by default the delimiter or field separator is spaces one or more

8760916
folder	directory
i also tried deploying my application via the tomcat-manager and it says that the application was deployed correctly but it doesn t come in the tomcat application listing but the folder is also created in the webapps directory and when i try to access in the browser i get the same error that before

8760923
int	chars
create hashmap with keys as a chars and int count as value

8760945
cvs	svn
if not 1 would this be a worse situation if there actually were modifications locally and more generally 2 how robust are git svn cvs in general to a fail-to-write issue like this

8760949
int	chars
you could parse the string and create a so that the int value in the map represents how many times the chars c the key in the map appears in the string

8760972
squash	branch	squash	merge
a squash merge performs the merge then records it as a regular commit without the merge branch as a parent

8760972
squash	branch	squash	merge
looking back at the first diagram after you do your squash merge have all the private contributors reset to that point rebasing any other branch they might have

8760974
width	height
i chose an array as opposed to a list arraylist or some other container because once the width and height of the playfield are set they do not change

8761014
int	chars
a simple but intuitive way that i have done this in the past is to cast the chars as int and then just use an array

8761034
openni	kinect
this being said you can t use openni and kinect for windows

8761072
getter	setter
to make a derived provider that stays up to date with changes to grapharray you can either add listeners to grapharray or if the grapharray is only set and not modified you can get away with breaking the variable out into getter and setter something like this untested code

8761083
int	chars
so sizeof array will give you the size of the pointer pointing to the first member no matter if the array is int float or chars

8761088
put	get
that way you only have to put the string format logic in one place and it will get applied to all of your views

8761093
profiling	instrumentation
you probably need to use profiling - leaks instrumentation for detecting leaks

8761110
getter	setter
this makes sense since the property declarations syntax sugar are compiled into a field plus getter and or setter methods add remove in my case which reference the field

8761117
textview	imageview
wrap the imageview inside relative layout and add textview on top of it | bottom right

8761151
folder	directory
my problem is that i want to make a script in php which will list all files recursively from specyfic directory in users home folder

8761161
inherited	properties
i just ran into a similar issue and my answer was to make a new control which inherited from hiddenfield and gives it a cssclass properties

8761175
int	boolean
i use the casting of the isactive field from int to boolean as an example

8761194
hide	show
so my code just creates inline-diff on a per-word basis of a string using html tags so css can hide show that which was removed added

8761211
mp4	webm
so for some bonus points the method now accepts a string which you pass the video format you require mp4 x-flv or webm

8761213
treemap	linkedhashmap
hashmap linkedhashmap treemap all implement map

8761278
put	get
either put c properly into namespace a by moving the namespace to the header file and fix c.cpp to use that namespace or get rid of namespace a

8761290
gridview	sqldatasource	gridview	rowdatabound	sqldatasource	rowdatabound
i am using visual studio 2010 and sql server 2008 and populating my gridview with sqldatasoure .and inside itemtemplate of gridview there are some dropdownlist which are again being binded with sqldatasource and on rowdatabound event am assigning selected values for these dropdownlist

8761382
width	height
in other words the example you provided is a rectangular plot with the height width and the height and width are chosen to make the width-of-one-change height-of-one-box

8761425
width	height
consult the plug-in doc-o and pay special attention to the dimensions section height width etc. and consider specifying a value of 100

8761460
multiplying	multiplication
then you multiplying them in a specific order order matters in matrix multiplication to transform your model as you wish

8761514
vbscript	jscript
you can even mix legacy vbscript and new jscript code in your existing classic asp apps if you re mindful of a few quirks

8761514
vbscript	jscript
n.b. i m only interested in comparing vbscript and jscript

8761557
vbscript	jscript
not many people use jscript for classic asp most prefer vbscript

8761632
google-chrome	firefox
below html displays menu in same line for firefox latest version google google-chrome browsers but in ie9 it it show them in separate lines

8761632
google-chrome	firefox
i am not sure what i should do to fix this i tried several properties but didn t work as it works in firefox google-chrome

8761633
portrait	landscape
all fail to consistently get the drawing area especially when switching from landscape to portrait layout

8761633
portrait	landscape
printablearea does not seem to ever change when you switch from landscape to portrait

8761633
width	height	portrait	landscape
in a preview it always shows portrait width height so i have to check if it is a preview and i have to manually swap the width height when it is a landscape

8761646
google-chrome	safari
ply use google-chrome or safari

8761666
filtering	grouping
how do i use the grouping filtering in ssrs to further filtering my mdx results i can t do the filtering in the mdx itself

8761706
integer	unsigned
when we say hash function i find it means converting a sequence bytes of keys to 32bit or 64bit unsigned integer in most articles for example see this

8761722
int	double
the second suggestion is this - what about about creating a custom class which wraps an int array to handle this which uses a similar double algorithm or quadrupling to generic to handle resizing but starts at say size 256

8761722
int	double
you could add object int id s to this out of order as fast as you like and it won t double too often

8761725
rtp	sip
i m trying to evaluate a tool called ohrwurm which claims to be able to corrupt rtp traffic between two sip endpoints

8761725
rtp	sip
for those packets which are sip grab the rtp port numbers out

8761725
udp	rtp
for those packets that are udp and between the two rtp ports grabbed earlier fuzz the rtp contents

8761730
hide	show
i also have a function set up that hide the photo description when the mouse is inactive but show the description when the mouse moves

8761787
vbscript	jscript
instead of switching the page language to javascript i leave it at the default vbscript and then use a block for my jscript code

8761793
mouseover	mouseleave
i created a .slidedown .slideup effect on a div based on mouseover and mouseleave

8761837
imperative	declarative
but is declarative about a piece of knowledge not imperative

8761837
imperative	declarative
so if we were giving imperative instructions to our waiter we might turn our declarative information about peas earlier i dislike peas but i ll sometimes eat them in salads into a command waiter if entree has peas in salad then serve entree else if entree just has peas then don t serve entree

8761863
punctuation	words
you ll need to do something about punctuation though if you don t want those attached to your words

8761890
hide	show
it would be cleaner to create a panel object with an internal reference to itself and a set of show and hide methods and then attach that to the namespace - at least then you don t have to worry that the problem is the scoping of your closure

8761891
client-side	server-side
you should always perform adequate server-side validation on inputs regardless of client-side validation

8761928

this can be quite a confusing issue because itunesconnect will show a landscape-oriented iphone screenshot in landscape orientation but when you view it from the iphone app store application the screenshots will be forced to portrait orientation

8764344

so when viewing screenshots on the actual device iphones and ipod touches switch any landscape-mode screenshots to portrait mode and the user must rotate their phone to landscape mode to see the screenshot correctly

i would suggest checking security software norton mcafee siteadvisor that inject and remove stuff etc to see if they are modifying pages or if a corporate intranet firewall is modifying since https is encrypted end-to-end and cannot be modified

8764453
ubuntu	debian
on debian ubuntu sensible-editor and sensible-browser and sensible-pager will do the lookup for you including looking at the right environment variables

8764874
width	height
is your autoresizing set correctly to dynamic width height and fixed borders

8764881
width	height
another question along these same lines is do you know of a more robust iframe portlet that will let you set the width and height of the portlet or will dynamically re-size itself based on the contents it s loading

8764909

i would suggest using post instead of get for your ajax request instead

8764943

google-chrome	safari
they look great then i add content inside one of the divs and all the sudden they don t line up any more in google-chrome and safari

installing apt-get install libtidy-dev on ubuntu and emerge app-text htmltidy on gentoo solved it

8765062
direct3d	stretchblt
in a non-game business application where frequent resizing windows was an important part of the ui i worked around this issue by creating the direct3d device as a memory device at the detected full-screen resolution then used stretchblt in the cwnd ondraw ... to resize the memory bitmap as it was being written from the backbuffer to the screen

8765081
notepad++	textpad
i prefer notepad++ myself after using textpad for many years but always keep textpad on my system for multiline regular expressions and a few other things it does well

8765091
serializable	deserialization
one reason for using non-standard checkbox serializable that isn t addressed in the question or in of the current answers is to only deserialize change fields that were explicitly specified in the serializable data - when you are using jquery serializable and deserialization to from a cookie to save and load prefererences

8765116
disk	ram
i assume that by installing vs onto ram disk you mean that you ll use ntfs to map the expected program files microsoft visual studio folder onto ram

8765116
temp	tmp
and if you decide that you do try mapping just the tmp temp folders onto ram and then starting up vs with that and seeing how it works

8765190
min	max
however you ve got data at different resolutions - crucially max min values are at a higher resolution than the averages the reverse is not a problem

8765198
width	height
if the height of your page is less than 1024px and the width is greater than 768px the native zoom functionality does not work as expected

now i tried to add cross-domian policy to the header but i cant get it to work because most likley i am doing it incorrectly.i am not familiar with perl if it were php then its pretty easy adding a header. in terms of me understaning where to put it

8765231
google-chrome	firefox
also instead of using document.write to debug use alert something or better yet if you are working on google-chrome or firefox with firebug install use console.log something and see the output in the console use f12 in google-chrome to see it

8765269
subclass	accessor	public	protected
you can make a subclass as part of your test package that exposes public accessor to the private methods which should then be protected

8765270
vsto	add-in
easiest way to deploy a vsto add-in is using clickonce

8765339
libavformat	mpeg
if you want to put this video in avi mpeg or mpeg-ts file you should use libavformat

uibutton inherits from uicontrol which inherits from uiview which inherits from uiresponder which inherits from nsobject

8765352
uisegmentedcontrol	uiswitch
both uiswitch and uisegmentedcontrol have the same hierarchy

currently i m registering to changes in the database and am manually managing this ugly list of nodes that contain a list of parent with each parent having a list of children i m manually adding removing each parent child as needed

8765381
children	parent
now if this was a relatively stable database it would be fine the way i have ugly and most likely inefficient but fine but the database is constantly changing with new parent being added children changing into parent or children changing parent and nodes changing states active idle and inactive

8765482
google-chrome	firefox

mongodb	bson
intermediate conversions bson - json - bson - json - bson mongodb stores data in binary bson but javascript map and reduce need to be fed textual json

8765502

8765505
slider	slidesjs
i m also using the slidesjs plugin and the client requested the slidshow stop on the last slider

8765533

ok i did a little testing and it simply is not possible for a class to override a constant set by an interface it is implements or a parent class it is extends

8765576

netty and grizzly are popular examples

8765660
superclass	subclassing
the defined in the superclass is the interesting part of each subclassing entity

8765661

8765668
put	get
so i want to get the seasons from my database and put them in this array but how to do that

8765699
put	get
if you want to get the data into a char buffer why not put it there immediately anyway

8765699
std	ostream
here is a stream class which takes an array determines its size fills it with null characters primarily to make sure the resulting string is null terminated and then sets up an std ostream to write to this buffer directly

8765730
shadowing	named
one pitfall of macros which i didn t see in other answers is shadowing of variable named

8765745
inherited	subclassing	classname	inherited
for the database use the single_table inherited strategy the default and maybe use a custom discriminatorvalue per subclassing otherwise you ll get classname in your table

8765767

8765783
width	height
controlwidth and controlheight are custom properties to calculate the width and height of the control

8765874
equals	gethashcode
the rule of equals gethashcode is from

8765874
equals	gethashcode
if two objects compare as equals the gethashcode method for each object must return the same value

8765874
equals	gethashcode
if your equals is not transitive then you can t possibly write a valid gethashcode

cloudant	couchdb
i m using cloudant to store this information couchdb is great and have granted read-only privileges to a new user created api key pass

8765896
onresume	onpause
onresume will be called when the activity comes to the foreground and onpause will be called when the activity is pushed to the back stack of activities

8765912
inherited	subclassing
note that if i m mistaken and you really need an entity inherited using instanceof at least with hibernate will cause problems because you might have a proxy to the base class which doesn t know yet the exact subclassing the foreign key is pointing to and which is thus not an instance of any of the subclassing

8765916
postgresql	mysql
for some reason i m using mysql locally and have postgresql on my heroku app

8765955
decoder	encoder
get it to fully work in software with added white noise and when the encoder s and decoder s sample rates are somewhat different hint you ll need a sample rate converter here but some audio editors are able to resample wave files and you can do that by hand

unless you feel like writing a daemon service etc. cron would be your best bet

8766093
equals	gethashcode
to be able to use a dictionary or hashset you need an equals and a gethashcode method that meet the following properties

8766099
jobs	cron
well cron jobs is a solution

the spring roo appfuse seam are all great but they do come with a certain amount of.

8766202

stateless	stateful
... stateful and stateless session beans do not have to be coded as reentrant

8766552
stateless	stateful
one implication of this rule is that an application cannot make loopback calls to a stateless or stateful session bean instance

8766567
width	height
the width and height are pulled from the client to the webmethod and passed into the function so the image is scaled to fit the browser inner dimensions to avoid any scrollbars

8766647
for-loop	loops
below is where the issue is...when a bullet object is erased the program exits with a segmentation fault...now i understand why this is happening since the vector size is changed while it s in loops but i can t figure out how to fix it...i added the break thinking that it would solve the problem since only one bullet can be 0 at a given time anyway but it doesn t...i initially had the if statement in the last for-loop after the update function but i put it in its own for-loop so i could use the break

8766669
width	height
from other posts here i ve also adjust height width maxheight maxwidth and none of that helps

subtract	add
if the sign bits match then we are going to actually subtract if they dont match then we add

8767315
subtraction	addition
computers perform a subtraction by using addition logic inverting the second operator on the way into the adder and asserting the carry in bit like this

8767315
subtract	add
if you are writing a program to synthesize the floating point math your program can perform the subtract you dont have to do the invert and add plus one thing over complicates it as we saw above

8767315
subtract	add
3 being a subtract operation if the sign bits are the same then you perform a subtract if the sign bits are different you perform an add of the mantissas

8767315
subtract	add
5 normalize the number shift the answer to the right or left the answer can be 25 bits from a 24 bit add subtract add subtract can have a dramatic shift to normalize either one right or many bits to the left until you have a 24 bit number with the most significant one left justified

if you don t set a uinavigationcontroller then you can put a uinavigationbar in your view through programmatically or visually editing your aboutviewcontroller.xib in xcode

8767352
free	malloc
and you should delete and free all blocks previously allocated with new and malloc otherwise you ll leak memory and probably make your program unstable it will fail to allocate more memory at some point and exert unnecessary pressure on memory in the os possibly slowing down other programs or making them unstable as well

subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition	addition	multiplication
although i am getting the right result from the calculator and printing properly for addition subtraction and multiplication i am just printing the

8767794
setinterval	settimeout
the only other solution i can think of is some sort of hacky solution of using settimeout or setinterval to check if the value has changed on some regular interval

8767831
folder	directory
i used a test folder to hold files from a directory on the localhost machine however

8767838
writetofile	nsdata
perhaps pdf_val is an nsdata containing the pdf in which case you can send it the writetofile atomically message

8767858
filtering	grouping
this is particularly problematic because i need to know what the media grouping is as a client requires that a search can be filtering by the grouping meaning the level 1 folder for each pdf in meda

mp3	wav	mp3	ogg	wav	ogg
i also tried different formats of sound like mp3 ogg wav but still there is same problem

subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition	division	multiplication	division	subtraction	division	addition	addition	multiplication
it is not clear why you always do a division even when the operation is an addition or subtraction or multiplication

8768152
getter	setter
i dont want setter methods just getter methods like getkeepscreenon etc is enough.

8768156
width	height
i believe that your confusion stems from the fact that the crop coordinates by default are relative to the original image and the width height values are the scaled size of the image

8768156
width	height
if you don t need an exact width and height you can use mode max instead

8768201
google-chrome	safari
but it does on google-chrome ie safari

8768248
filtering	grouping
you can filtering data set and grouping in ssrs report filtering after result obtained from mdx

double click on data set or grouping and on filtering tab you can give filtering expression

8768295
firefox	safari
i have done up a page for ebay i have tested it in explorer safari firefox and all is well

8768339
int	chars
a few apis primarily in the chars class use 32-bit int to represent code points as individual entities

8768381
folder	directory
for example i made a tool that downloads nearly 1000+ folder sub-folders and so on from a sharepoint document library site and at the same time it logs name of folder with the number assigned to the folder just to let you know the only reason i am doing this is because the directory path gets too long if i give folder the name they should have and i cant download them

8768388
gridview	detailsview
and i listed the possble answers as a b c and d when the user chooses one of them for example c the gridview will show the result the user s answer as a number which is 3 not as a letter while the detailsview will show the correct answer as c

8768422
int	chars
strings are utf-16 encoded and can give you 16-bit unsigned chars or code points of type int

8768448
cos	sin
and you let ios calculate cos and sin out of the angle again cgaffinetransformrotate does that

8768477
iboutlet	ibaction
ibaction and iboutlet is just used to let xcode s interface builder ib know that there s a function exist

8768477
iboutlet	ibaction
generally if you create your code programmatically without using xcode s interface builder you do not need iboutlet or ibaction anymore

8768552
setinterval	settimeout
settimeout or setinterval are easy and probably the most obvious ways

8768555
switching	screens
the problem is that sometimes if you move fast among screens some sprites are not being rendered sometimes they are it depends on how fast i switching between scenes

8768583
post	put
by redirecting from one to the other you allow a put post or delete request to invalidate the cache of a single canonical uri

8768583
post	get
use 307 instead of 302 so that historic clients don t change post to get

8768616
x86	64bit
nowadays i always write code with 64bit portability in mind and therefore i d replace those with the get setclasslongptr and get setwindowlongptr macros which automatically resolve to the correct function call depending on if you re compiling for x86 or x64

8768616
children	parent
the win32 model is such that parent always own their children and it is thus their responsibility to handle events

to avoid reflows use the width and height attributes for the rows and columns to ensure the browser renders the container table correctly to begin with

8768851
width	height
this also means setting width and height on the img elements

8768860
width	height
from my experience background images tend to load faster altough images with height and width specifed can load faster but i don t think you have that option

8768887
int	chars
returns the result of interpreting leading chars in str as an int

8768897
decoder	encoder
you should use indyutf8encoding instead indy implements its own utf-8 encoder decoder to avoid the decoding bug in tencoding.utf8

textarea	textbox
triggers can be images or links and each trigger must refer to an input field textbox or textarea with

8768918
children	parent
the initial expression b will be executed in every children and parent process running at this level

8768918
children	parent
at level 2 due to fork â b executed by m and c1 we have m and c1 as parent and c2 and c3 as children

8768918

8768986
int	boolean
the value 0 is an int type and the false is boolean type hence the data type does not match here and condition will be true

8768999
google-chrome	firefox
you would need to use an activex control or browser plugin firefox google-chrome etc to check if the client is installed

8769024

superclass	subclassing
you can put all your shared stuff together in the superclass and use them in the subclassing simply calling the methods on self

8769124
onmouseover	mouseout
it s hard to implement such menu using pure js because onmouseover onmouseout events are fired when mouse move to the child element in menu when your mouse moves from main element to submenu mouseout will fire

8769124
mouseleave	mouseenter
you should look for some implementation of mouseenter mouseleave events

8769147
ubuntu	debian
on debian ubuntu

8769148
setinterval	clearinterval
i guess it should even be possible with a do while without the setinterval and clearinterval

8769176
int	double
it takes int s and double s

8769202
portrait	landscape
i defined dynamically all gui components.when the cntrl+f11 is first pressed the layout updates correctly to from portrait to landscape

what persistent does is to make a transient entity attached to the entity manager

8769369
strdup	malloc
solution allocate memory using malloc or strdup

inherited	properties
it ã s however possible to add classes with the same properties names as long as the second is inherited from the first.

8769536
ant	maven
i would also suggest using some kind of build tool ant or maven ant is already suggested and is easier to start with or an ide that handles the compilation eclipse uses incremental compilation with reconciling strategy and you don t even have to care to press any compile buttons

8769536
ant	maven
the drawback is that it has a steep learning curve and if maven plugins like to suppress errors - another thing is that quite a lot of tools also operate with maven repositories like sbt for scala ivy for ant graddle for groovy

8769563
client-side	server-side
i am now in the position where have have two .php files one for the server-side validation and now one for the client-side

8769808
pull	push
i am trying to build something that enables to push to ftp so you at least pull and push to ftp

8769826
xslt	xquery

8769827
public	protected
in all cases a member can be injected regardless of its java access specifier private default protected public

8769833
stdio	fflush
this is os-specific but typically on modern platforms open files will be closed and their in-process stdio buffers fflush

8769853
padding	overlapping
that way you can put a padding on the li to stop the a from overlapping the arrow

8769884
button	checkbox
when we click on any of these three button there should be contacts along with a checkbox for selecting multiple contacts

8769894

for-loop	arrays
a common approach is to store the size in a variable and use it as upper bound in your for-loop often functions that expect an arrays have an additional parameter to get the size of the arrays

8770618
width	height
p.s this example is not perfect.it is just a sample of how to use a custom icon.preferably for the icon use dimensions 18x18 which is the dimensions of icons used in jqm framework .in that case you dont have to override the width and height styles

nsdatadetector	nsregularexpression
i cannot tell you how it works â the fact that nsdatadetector inherits nsregularexpression may suggest that it uses a set of regular expressions but i honestly doubt that the detector for date-types uses information that is sprinkled throughout longer blocks of text so that it appears more likely that there is some natural language clustering and processing going on under the hood

yes if it would have used unsigned integer it will use 32 bit to store it as you don t need sign in that case but as it supports only signed integers a 32 bit systems will have 31 bit for value and 1 bit for sign s0 maximum signed integer range is -2147483648 to 2147483647

8771064
addition	multiplication
since php handles the integers signed internally however you can only use bit arithmetics but not addition multiplication etc

8771069
jlabel	jtextpane
as an alternative to jtextpane use a gridlayout of jlabel

although human intuition says that ambig signed long ought to be preferred because your input is a negative integer which cannot be represented as such by an unsigned long the two conversions are in fact equivalent in precedence in c++

8771433
int	chars
the rank of long long int shall be greater than the rank of long int which shall be greater than the rank of int which shall be greater than the rank of short int which shall be greater than the rank of signed chars

width	height
for this purpose you can use the shape and draw lines inside the shape and also you can set the height and width of the shape

8772413
google-chrome	firefox
though this is not a standard way to achieve this but you a kind of create a div around the file element give a box shadow to a div and use width to get around this but again this will work only for firefox since google-chrome has a different way of presenting the file upload element

the jscript engine is as realiable as the vbscript engine

8772814
vbscript	jscript
being well versed in both vbscript and jscript i thought i would give jscript on the server ago since of the two javascript is my prefered language. what i found was i easily got confused between code that was to be running server side and code to run client side it all looks the same

8772814
vbscript	jscript
the real killer reason to avoid jscript is that vbscript is designed to work with com ole automation objects whereas com ole automation has had to be shoe-horned into jscript

8772814
vbscript	jscript
also code that is quite succinct if vbscript yeah i know you didn t expect me to say that becomes more cumbersome since jscript doesn t understand the concept of a default property as vbscript does

8772814
vbscript	jscript
vbscript is a much more natural partner for adodb that jscript

8772829

the simplest method is to use opacity on the img and if necessary a background element with the color you want to add note that opacity is somewhat browser and version dependent this example works in firefox google-chrome and i assume other webkit browsers

8773389
int	chars
however if you are really working on single chars it doesn t make any sense to compare types a single chars can only be either an int or a letter it could never be a float a float has decimals

basically the scenario is our connection string in web.config will be encrypted using aspnet_regiis currently rsa provider until i can get the aes provider to work

8782746

8783168
post	get
when receiving a post request you can receive both post and get variables through the superglobals _post and _get

8783181
post	get
for example when you add post variables to a page they get processed internally in a hashtable so if you had a massive amount of hashtable collisions ie post variables with the same name on a page it d happen here

8783193
hash-collision	key
if the form data contains key that produce the same hash code it produces hash-collision which reduces the performance of the hash table

8784047
google-chrome	firefox
this works perfectly in firefox but in google-chrome i have several problems it seemed to work correct

google-chrome	firefox
as you can see in firefox and google-chrome that is not what happens

8784405
google-chrome	firefox
both firefox and google-chrome appear to behave the same so it seems like expected behavior not a browser bug

8784432
cos	sin
certainly not a procedural generation expert - but you could try additively combining multiple randomly generate sin cos functions with different periods

hash	md5
is there a way to have objective c provide an md5 hash of the provided password so that the text in the url request is already encrypted before i submit the url request

for-loop	loops
the for-loop has .maxstack 2 but the while loops has .maxstack 4 otherwise there s a little diference in the order of operations due to the fact that the increment for the while happens at the start of loops but the for operation happens at the end of loops change the content of loops to console.writeline i and see that the while loops will print from 1 but the for-loop will print from 0 both do the same number of loops iterations though

8789679
for-loop	loops
so we can see that an optimised while loops is faster than a for-loop by 2 operations however it uses more stack space

8789706

8791701
rsa	aes
strangely the rsa java cryptoapi interop solution requires the message to be completely byte reversed in order to work with java but aes does not expect the key or the message to be byte reversed

8791716
for-loop	loops
you could also use a regular for-loop you can iterate lists that a for-loop uses within loops itself unlike a foreach loops

8791721
switching	screens
switching to 2.2 framework which has better compatability with screens resolutions and densities

8791771

the only time to access the ivars directly are in init dealloc and getter and setter

8791888
width	height
you don t have to deal with that specific titlebar height and border width

8791907
put	get
your number is several orders of magnitude larger than that and as such when you try to put your input into the int variable something happens but i can tell you what doesn t happen it doesn t get assigned the value 1231231231231236

8791914
put	get
this way you can do a very nice organisation and when it comes to get one static file if you put the rules above at the very beginning they ll be filtered properly and never redirected to index.php

8791943
superclass	subclassing
it requires subclassing to have special knowledge of their superclass

8791966
int	double

current version is afaik v 3.0 - according to this in the earlier version it was ok to use post for such an operation but this is no longer recommended instead put should be used

8791989
google-chrome	firefox
the selenium webdriver classes come with several drivers one for each supported browser type ie firefox google-chrome

8791996
antivirus	mcafee
personally it was my antivirus mcafee who was using that port

8792019
persistent	transient
my intuition is that transient properties would incurr less overhead than persistent properties because they do not need to be persistent and read from the database so converting them to persistent properties will likely only make things slightly worse

8792037
google-chrome	firefox
where as google-chrome and firefox seem to work just fine

8792054
google-chrome	firefox
unfortunately there is only limited support for these in google-chrome and firefox and essentially no support of these in ie9 and below

8792061
converter	multibinding
but you could change the way you handle this by creating only one converter but passing both the original value and the selection status via a multibinding

8792063
put	get
i want to get the first and last name of any person who is special or very special so that i can then put those names into labels and wherever i like as i wish

8792067
for-loop	arrays
you could create a arrays of jradiobuttons and then use them in for-loop traversing each button one by one and then recording its answer

8792095
postgresql	mysql
in mysql for example the following would select 20 rows beginning from row 40 but this is mysql-only clause edit it seems postgresql also allows this

8792128
oncreate	setcontentview
then in oncreate test whether the notitle extra is present in the intent and make the appropriate call to requestwindowfeature before calling setcontentview

8792138

i have this treepanel and i want to call this.getid method of mainpaneltree from inside expand all button but all i get is method undefined.i tried to put scope this in config objects but no success

8792267
post	get
if using get isn t an option then one thing you can do instead is use post but save everything in a cookie or session variable for you to retrieve on the previous page if pagination breadcrumbs are used after submitting the form

8792274
clang	llvm
clang can translate cuda not complete or opencl to llvm

8792281
post	get
so yes you are correct to use post for submitting your form and get is not recommended in this case

8792303
subtraction	addition
these alus will complete integer addition subtraction and or comparison in a single clock cycle cache misses will of course take longer but depend only on the size and memory layout of the data not signed-ness

8792308
min	max	width	height
as a side-note here though the radsplitter control relies on the radpane s to have a specific size set hence the min max height width etc. and you might want to look into just having a regular element as the top panel and then only use the radsplitter on the bottom half

8792312
pop-up	dialog
dialog pop-up i click on the browser click back on dialog and dialog disappears behind the browser

8792320
hash	salt
you should only be storing them as salt hash

8792327
onclick	onfocus
i know this can be done easily with js but i m not sure what event i should call it on onfocus and onclick won t work because the user might simply click on the sibling name field but not enter a value fill in something but later on clear it out etc

8792341
int	double
nowadays the optimizations made on chip look out what superscalar out of order processor with speculative execution means and by the compilers make those kind of differences assuming they exist which i don t really for signed unsigned comparisons but optimizations like value range propagation and strength reduction may have an influence so context dependant that a measurement in the desired context is needed as it will have an influence on the result i ve had code where putting some int variables as double make it performs better on some machines worse on others

8792349
vb.net	vb6
does anyone know some uml tools for vb6 or vb.net that can do this

8792363

8792399
integer	unsigned
the comparison instruction cmp on x86 32 64 is the same on both signed and unsigned integer data types

8792399
integer	unsigned

8792508
debian	centos
on debian i don t know centos off the top of my head assuming apache2 the location is

8792511
monodevelop	sharpdevelop
you can use monodevelop webmatrix visual studio express but i suggest sharpdevelop its open source

8792613
folder	directory
instead of returning the new name of the folder to the program the dialog returns new folder directory

8792642
i2c	spi
i have developed small drivers on wince and worked on spi i2c interface from application opening reading and writing driver

in the public directory i have a few folder that need to serve js files as the index

8792766
folder	directory
i also have a directory folder with many picture in .jp2 format xxxx.jp2

8792805
hide	show
winforms uses a trick to still support hide it actually destroys the native window and re-creates it when you call show again

8792815
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
this is the code but it s not working on ie8 7 ie9 google-chrome firefox safari opera are all ok

8792852
children	parent
the background is i have to scale a parent usercontrol and its children and at the same time trying to avoid the too-smart-for-me xaml

8792852
width	height
from the new and previous size both provided from the event parameters i calculate the ratios for width and height and apply them to each child element thus resizing them

8792852
width	height
at this point the old height and width are both 0 or nan respectively

8792863
google-chrome	firefox
ie10 looks like fully interoperable browser so if you deliver ie-specific code you should probably stop doing that and treat ie10 the same way as firefox or google-chrome

8792871
png	ico
but while this works fine for any text files it fails completely for any binary files png ico etc. i also don t like having to specify the mime-type like that

8792872
mousemove	keydown
i think this is as close as you ll get add mousemove focus keydown and scroll listeners to your body element and expect the page to be visible for another x second timeout where i have no idea what reasonable values for x may be

8792919
width	height
try setting your iframe height width to a percentage

8792947
post	get
i ve implemented a simple mechanism whereby i hash the user password sent as post get parameter and store it in a database

8792947
hash	salt
i ve read about several mechanisms starting from simple http authentication using a salt hash which i m using implementing access tokens to the seemingly complicated oauth authentication

8792965
google-chrome	firefox
this behaves normally in desktop browsers firefox google-chrome however on an ipad the screen is resizing before this window appears and everything appears shifted to the top left of the screen

8792974
content-disposition	content-type
in order to suggest that a browser download a file rather than displaying it you can leave content-type text csv and add the header content-disposition attachment or to change the filename in the save as... dialog

8793006
post	get
what i want to accomplish is get all the post but one for every user postedby column the date must be the latest and of course show the comment

8793014
actualheight	actualwidth
i m not sure of the best approach to your question but you might find the actualwidth actualheight properties useful

8793016
button	checkbox
when a button is clicked first all data in the table is getting deleted and for every checkbox that is checked the id is inserted in the tabel again

8793016
button	checkbox
if i check a few more of the checkbox and click the button again all all rows are getting deleted and then my thought was that the checkbox that is visible false

8793057
ssl	https
a number of browsers support pkcs#11 for https authentication that is using pkcs#11 for client-certificate authentication as part of the ssl tls connection as part of https

8793059
overlay	z-order
intuitiveness will drive you to z-order your prioritized view after the less-important one in the xml - but as i ve said previously the first one to grab the pixels stays so make sure you define the smaller view first and then overlay it with the bigger one

8793071
folder	directory
i also have a directory folder with many picture in .jp2 format xxxx.jp2

8793131
public	protected
with this approach you are keeping the external public interface separated from the internal protected interface intended for child classes

8793181
google-chrome	firefox
it works great in firefox and google-chrome as well as ie8 but does not work in ie9

8793191
integer	fractions
in case you don t know returns the integer part of the given number and sends the fractions part to the address given as a 2 argument

8793225
google-chrome	safari
sometimes in google-chrome and safari navigation drops out of the header

8793243
put	get
i know one way to pass information to another page in javascript is to use a get request and put everything on the url

8793257
ssl	https
the facebook oauth2 implementation requires that you use ssl https which means that other people cannot see that token unless you explicitly give it to them outside of the browser itself or using an evil plugin as noted

8793291
width	height
what if i don t know the old width and height

8793312
profiling	debugging
just use profiling to see what data ef sends to stored procedure and use that data separately to test debugging only stored procedure

8793313
width	height	portrait	landscape
here i only set the width and the height is taken care of by vflexbox and changes depending on the orientation landscape portrait of the device

8793314
width	height
to avoid that you would have to specify the width and height for the input in absolute units for example pixels

8793320
width	height
you will have to set a fixed width and height of the input as well and keep it the same no matter if the input has focus or not

8793320
width	height
if your doing it all with javascript you could get the initial calculated width and height of the input and assign it as inline css

8793323
width	height
you can assign width and height style properties to the input element

8793323
google-chrome	firefox
firefox 9 and google-chrome 15 which suggests a fair degree of compatibility

8793323
width	height
same principal but if you want to query the width and height and now that you ve told us you re using jquery

8793323
google-chrome	firefox
live example - as with the one above works in ie6 firefox 9 and google-chrome 15

8793451
accessor	properties
what is the simplest code to implement changeselectorreturntype assuming selector will always be a simple properties accessor such as

8793453
singleton	facade
i m working on a project where one of the co-developers and previous developers use a singleton facade for just about every page of class that has a lot of method calls inside of it but that don t actually maintain the data

8793453
singleton	facade
now i have certain issues with the naming convention and the fact that they have the singleton inside the same class as the facade and the fact that the facade isn t really a facade

8793479
int	chars
warning format s expects argument of type chars but argument has type int

8793516
for-loop	loops
would it be better to parallel the outer for-loop so that the code within is run for multiple learners at a time as opposed to parallel the code within loops so that the different windowing approaches are paralleled for a single learner

8793540
charindex	substr
using some creative substr float and charindex logic i came up with this

8793564
stdout	stderr
you should redirect stderr and maybe also stdout from your subprocess to the parent process or to system.err system.out

8793610
setinterval	settimeout
settimeout and setinterval are not particularly kind to battery life and cpu consumption

8793621
gmp	bigint
all solutions i did already found are either painfully slow fgint bigint mybigint ubigints i386 cpu specific sdpbigint or implemented in c mpir gmp

int	chars
int is 4 bytes varchar size depends on the chars encoding

8793677
width	height
you can use php available functions in php to determine the image resolution height width

8793690
post	get
i ve tried just posting there but i get a 301 moved permanently header and if i set curlopt_followlocation to true the request follows but seems to lose the post data - i get nothing at the far end using this file_get_contents php input

8793706
post	get
you can execute show table status to get a better idea and probably post it here so we can analyze it together

8793740
getter	setter
what the compiler ends up doing there is implementing a new getter setter pair for the subclass

8793740
getter	setter
this is distinct from the previous getter setter pair that were implemented for the same property in the superclass

8793740
ivar	subclassing
here viewforrootvc is the ivar from the subclassing

8793740
superclass	subclassing	ivar	subclassing
the superclass is setting its ivar called viewforrootvc not the ivar with the same name generated in the subclassing

8793740
ivar	subclassing
this in turn uses the ivar in the subclassing and so everything works although i think this is not ideal.

8793740
getter	setter	ivar	subclassing
and because ivars are by default protected that ivar is also visible in the subclassing so both sets of setter getter end up using the same ivar

8793740
getter	setter
the right fix imo is let ivars be private to a class synthesized ivars are hidden and therefore effectively private and have subclasses reference the property getter setter as needed

8793781
jboss	glassfish
application servers such as tomcat jboss or glassfish we re running clustered jboss.

8793809
google-chrome	firefox
this doesn t seem to be browser dependent either as i tried ie8 firefox 9 google-chrome 17 on the windows xp computer and ie9 firefox 9 and google-chrome 16 on the windows 7 computer and the outcome is the same on all of them in that it works on 7 but not xp

8793818
post	put
i m not sure how you want to implement this though you could put it in the post template or perhaps make a shortcode to use it

8793823
mouseup	mousedown
when sending two messages at very close interval think 30 - 40ms for example sending a message at mousedown on a button and one on mouseup the two messages arrive at 200 to 300ms of interval on the server

8793830
post	get
it s the type of http requests being received by your controller which defines whether it s a get or post operation

8793830
post	get
the model used to populate a view for a get or capture form data for a post will be the same type either way

8793903
bindparam	pdostatement
this means you will now have a pdostatement object on which you can call bindparam and execute

8793904
regasm	regsvr32
i read online that i had to register the dll i ve tried doing this both with regsvr32 and regasm

8793905
chmod	mkdir
normally you can create a directory with mkdir mermissions to chmod 777 so you can delete this directory from ftp without a root user and this dir will bee fully writable via php

8793915
rss	feed
choose a rss feed

8793915
rss	feed
then the items in the rss feed that s all in a nested list

8793936
jtable	jlabel
the default string renderer in a jtable uses jlabel so this should work

8794018

the code seems to work fine in both firefox and google-chrome but not in safari

8794089
xlib	xcb
i found some tutorials using xlib however i would like to use xcb

8794125
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	safari
while other browsers like ie8 opera 11.52 safari 5.0.4 and google-chrome 16.0.912.63 don t have this issue and every page opens normally

8794178
draggable	droppable
from my research i see that jquery ui has draggable and droppable which do the work at 80

8794178
draggable	droppable
can it be done with the existing draggable droppable plugins from jquery ui

8794215

i have two servers debian squeeze 32 and ubuntu 11.10 server 64

8794253
ubuntu	debian
update 2 i m not sure if this may apply but under debian i m working in a regular console while ubuntu is being accessed by ssh

8794303
setinterval	settimeout
the simplest way to do this is to use settimeout happens once after a delay or setinterval happens every so often

8794306
hide	show
it show the proper way to do this by implementing the dialogbox.caption interface and then adding an event handler to your caption implementation for the included close button that hide the dialog box

8794329

x86	64bit
i am loading the 64bit visual studio tools c program files x86 microsoft visual studio 10.0 vc bin amd64 using invoke-batchfile in my powershell profile

8794400
quad	uniform
i don t know if a geometry shader only if it feasible of course would be the best approach the cost of drawing a line strip using a single quad would be the shader uniform setup for each line composing the strip

8794403
mdpi	hdpi
but if it too much of a hassle then it might be worth to just save png copies of your graphics in a few different resolutions and use them in the ldpi mdpi hdpi folders

8794407
yacc	bison
you re the one programming yacc bison actions for the rules and also the error handler

8794435

i did order a new processors that will move the cpu benchmark from 1700 to 7800 according to cpubenchmark.net

8794450
installation	upgrade
i have an openerp 5.0 installation with a few custom modules that i wish to upgrade to openerp 6.0

8794450
installation	upgrade
what are the guidelines or best practice in order to upgrade an openerp 5.0 installation to 6.0

8794464
x86	mips
this code happens to work on mips because the jal instruction does not push the current value of the program counter to the stack unlike the x86

8794465
haskell	scheme
most languages with closures scheme haskell ml and so on close over the values in the lexical scope

8794483
public	protected
keep in mind that this is still a public tweet provided that the authenticated user is not protected

8794506
projectile	angle
i have made a pygame physics simulation-- a projectile motion but it lacks interactivity like accepting angle of launch speed etc

8794517
serializable	deserialization
the reason is for serializable et deserialization

8794517
serializable	deserialization
because when deserializing a class that was serializable it would have to go through the constructor which is impossible in deserialization process because it s not part of the usual code path

8794529
for-loop	arrays
initially i was thinking of iterating through the results arrays using a for-loop but this was not working due to the fact that the results were not loading in time before capturing the screenshot of the chart

8794557
accessor	properties
to do what you propose i suppose you override the accessor for the delegate properties so that you could intercept any calls to -navigationcontroller willshowviewcontroller animated and resize the child view controller

8794634
integer	unsigned
mysql has an unsigned qualifier for integer types

8794701
plot	heatmap
as joaquin mentions in the comments you can also simply plot imshow hist to see the full range of values heatmap rather than 0 or 1

8794712
tablet	galaxy
i m maintaining a sencha touch 1.1 application and i m trying to resolve an issue that we ve noticed on android tablet specifically the samsung galaxy tab s android 3.1

8794713
gridview	objectdatasource
i have an objectdatasource that is binding to my gridview just fine

8794763
google-chrome	firefox
i have a menu div that appears just fine in ie9 and firefox but in google-chrome and ie8 the contents of the div are not following actual div itself when the div is moved

8794784
int	chars
i have a table with structure id int pk entryid int date int region chars location enum views int

8794800
folder	directory
since in your case news is a directory the second rewritecond isn t being met therefore it simply attempts to access the folder and gets a permissions error

8794801
intersect	contains
the different only matters if you have a path that intersect itself or contains multiple closed subpaths

8794835
post	put
put the code on the header of single post only no landing pages or about pages p

8794896
button	right-align
in you case here if you want to right-align that green button just change the one div to have everything right-align

8794897
google-chrome	firefox
after dumping everything in the object i could see that google-chrome was getting different data than firefox

8794909
google-chrome	firefox
the weird thing is that this error occurs on ie 9 and google-chrome 16 but not in firefox 9

8794914
innodb	myisam
i don t think that switching from innodb to myisam will increase the speed if the innodb is not misconfigured

8794939
implements	extends
that was a lot of code but the good thing is that new types can be added without affecting existing functors just extends the shim as long as the functor was implements with a template

8794942
width	height
for simplicity i have not shown them above but div #container has css width height properties generated on the server side to precisely wrap img #picture

8794942
width	height
#image_label is assigned this same width but has no value assigned for height

8794972
nsstring	nsdata
maybe my google skills are garbage but i couldn t seem to find how to convert nsdata of html to nsstring

8794989
client-side	server-side
if you don t want to use javascript on the client-side then you are ultimately bound to do it on the server-side

8794992
direct3d	gdi
you must call the id3d11devicecontext omsetrendertargets method on the device prior to direct3d rendering after gdi rendering

8794992
direct3d	gdi
you can not use any direct3d drawing between getdc and releasedc calls as the surface is excusively locked out by dxgi for gdi

8794992
direct3d	gdi
however you can mix gdi and direct3d rendering provided that you call getdc releasedc every time you need to use gdi before moving on to direct3d

8794996
versioning	upgrade
i ve got a new database here and it s an upgrade versioning from oracle 10g to oracle 11g - the main problem is with lob columns and everytime any function returns a lob as result the new database won t return strings like the old one did

8795009
getter	setter
the user class - a pojo - has a attribute with getter and setter and a public method user#removefriend friend f

8795111
rss	feed
i was asked to make a view that would display a rss feed of certain parts of the website and i don t understand how to do this

8795156
post	put
just put that whereever you need it within the individual page or post template and it should pass the numerical value of the month

8795170
cgpoint	cgrect
i have a a set of cgpoint s which represent a shape which is a bit like an upside down t shape now i want to convert those points into a cgrect which fits inside the shape so to create a cgrect which encompasses the entire shape i just loop through and work out the lowest x and y for the top left and the highest x and y for the bottom right which is great but leaves white areas outside of the image how could i figure out the largest rectangle without white areas so the final shape is more like an | shape

8795185
min	max
there is a requirement to enforce min and max width of the leftbarbutton on navigation bar

8795207
google-chrome	firefox
if by chance you were using ie to test the first case and possibly firefox or google-chrome to test the second case then that may be the cause

8795237
width	height
since it is an iframe setting the width height of the outer div will not reset the iframe width height

8795237
width	height
you have to explicitly set the width height of the iframe

8795237
width	height
also the player inside the iframe has its own width height set when iframe loaded so even if iframe is resized the player will not be resized

8795237
width	height
due to domain constriants you can set the players width height

8795241
screens	tablet
i would like to make a web application with a responsive design to post back to the server the javascript screens resolution and make decisions based on that information but the question is can i rely on window.screen to always supply the correct laptop tablet smartphone information

8795246
post	get
the blog post looks a little outdated but you should be able to easily modify it to get it working with whatever version of codeigniter you are using

8795261
jobs	cron
3 what about things like cron jobs or administrating a mysql database

8795282
multiplying	add
so you have to multiplying the left value by 2 32 and add it to the right value

8795282
multiplying	add
here we would multiplying by 10 3 to add them together this is a mathematical fact not a guess so trust me on this because it would look like this

8795282
multiplying	add
multiplying b by 2 32 and add to a

8795348
gif	png
it supports resizing cropping padding rotation png gif jpg output borders watermarking remote urls amazon s3 ms sql amazon cloudfront batch operations image filters disk caching and lots of other cool stuff like seam carving

8795352
subtract	add
by that i mean is it acceptable to add to or subtract from semaphores

8795380
maven	pom.xml
really you need a separate tool from maven to adjust the versions so you don t depend on the pom.xml file to run correctly

8795415
post	get
i don t know why you get that exception and the post is hard to read due to the bad format but if your problem is the line

8795431
min	max
and i want to be able to change the min max and the value for which the two handles are on based on the results of an ajax call

8795431
min	max
where my min and max are contained in two hidden divs with the class start_price and end_price

8795494
min	max
also to set the value of the slider you have to use the same syntax which you are using for setting min max values

8795572
int	chars
operator does not exist chars varying int

8795579
onmouseover	onclick
you could also get screen properties via the screen object and if it s a smartphone attach the dropdown state to the onclick event and if not to the onmouseover event

8795600
qtreeview	qstandarditemmodel
i have a qtreeview 100 rows with qstandarditemmodel 10 columns

8795626
strstr	substr
since strstr stops searching its first argument when it finds a nul byte and you re sending nul bytes with your client it s likely the last recv is putting something like 0 0 0end in your buffer so strstr considers it a zero-length string and doesn t find the end substr

8795656
range	infinity	division	multiplication
however in expressions of the form where the multiplication produces a result that is outside the double range but the subsequent division brings the temporary result back into the double range the fact that the expression is evaluated in a higher range format may cause a finite result to be produced instead of an infinity

8795700
post	get
i have found only one previous so post that seems related to mine though i dont even get the one debug after an eclipse restart that went unanswered

8795713
floating-point	integer
so even if the underlying value is a float if there s no actual non-zero floating-point numbers it ll print like its an integer

8795734
jerkson	jackson
i ve not used jackson scala module but the behavior is the same in jerkson so i ll hazard a guess as to what s going on

8795734
jerkson	jackson
i m fairly certain there s not a way to get jackson scala module or jerkson to return deserialized json with native scala collections

8795806
rss	feed
i am reading this tutorial on fetching rss feed using php simple xml

8795889
post	get
took me a couple of hours to get this working so i thought i d post my solution so it saves someone else some time in the future

8795894
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
rendering issues exist with firefox google-chrome and safari

8795894
google-chrome	firefox
i know for firefox and google-chrome there are ie add-ins that allow you to run the report in a firefox google-chrome tab

8795911
post	get
i m trying to use the cookies i get in a response to my post method using httpclient 4.0.3

8795932
int	boolean
the input parameters in the tutorials we ve found are typically scalar values int boolean or strings and not complex structures or objects

8795940
width	height
if i increase the size of the imagecontext all i get is more height and width but still starting from x 0 and y 0 where i would want it to start from x -5 y -5 or something like that

8795950
comparator	icomparer
in your case you should either create an icomparer object or have your stuff object implement comparator or if possible

8796021
hash	md5
md5 creates a hash of it

8796043
width	height
that icon that is popping up is an image tag without a valid source attribute or valid height width attributes

8796043
width	height
the most probable reason you only see the icon in internet explorer is because the other browsers don t show an icon when an image cannot be found unless you specify width and height attributes for the image

8796088
width	height
the map container requires a width and height to correctly display the map but it seems the animations are interfering with the values

8796088
width	height
the map works when the browser is resized as the width and height are correctly set and the resize event is raised

8796091
lisp	scheme
this is not out of any difficulty using clojure just in the fact that clojure is gratuitously inconsistent with common lisp and scheme

8796105
solrj	rsolr
so if you want to use embedded solr you ll have to use solrj or somehow adapt sunspot to use solrj instead of rsolr

8796116
colorbox	jcarousel
i have problems laying out the jcarousel pager which i m using along with colorbox on a drupal site

8796120
operands	decrement
the increment decrement operators can be applied before prefix or after postfix the operands

8796183
recvfrom	datagram
you are correct that a single call to recvfrom will return at most one udp datagram

8796183
recvfrom	datagram
so never assume that a sendto will necessarily result in a recvfrom and try to keep your datagram small less than 1400 bytes is fairly safe less than 512 bytes is very safe

8796220
width	height
now my image could be any kind of size and max width or height roles would resize it almost perfectly but i need image to fill image_wrapper completely now i know it sounds imposible but i saw what facebok did with their image they simply cuts out the edges and this way makes all image look perfect sized so how do they do it

8796226
freebsd	linux
you ll probably get better results if you compile your code in 64-bit mode supported on linux osx and freebsd but not windows yet since 64-bit address space is much more sparse

8796239
free	malloc
remember how much care it took to deal with malloc free or with threads

8796264
cgpoint	cgrect	cgpoint	cgsize	cgsize	cgrect
a cgrect is made up of cgpoint origin and cgsize size

8796265
post	get
i am using this to get a list of all attachments of a post in wordpress 3.2

8796287
jruby	mri	jruby	rubinius	mri	rubinius
just about every version of ruby â mri jruby rubinius macruby etc

8796370
imageview	imageswitcher
i was inflating the imageview in the imageswitcher from xml layouts but this doesn t seem to work

8796382
udp	tcp
this is one of the trickier differences between tcp and udp

8796383
for-loop	arrays
if you would move the declaration of your arrays into the for-loop all would go as expected

8796389
requestfactory	gwt
however we would like to send whole entities from the server to the client serialized by the gwt requestfactory

8796390
int	double
you shouldn t implicitly cast double to single precision float ing point just like you can t implicitly convert from long to int because you ll lose precision

8796396
udp	tcp
in tcp this is built into the transport protocol that s one of the differences between tcp and udp

8796396
udp	tcp
in udp you are forgoing the overhead of tcp but if you need reliable messaging your server is still sending something back to the client

8796401
udp	tcp
as an additional note my suspicion is that you d need to indulge yourself in some pretty sophisticated benchmarks before you could conclude that udp is actually going to have higher performance than tcp for web services

8796401
udp	tcp
i suspect that the reason udp is available as a transport binding is not because of any superior performance characteristics but to provide an alternative for the corner case of scenarios where tcp for whatever bizarre environmental reason isn t available

8796409
width	height
if your #image_wrapper doesn t need to be a specific height or aspect ratio you can take inspiration from the responsive web design movement and allow the image to scale its width to 100 of its containing element

8796451
public	protected
public protected package private and private

8796453
rss	feed

post	get
i need to get post by custom category id sort by custom field value and with another custom field if this field exists

8796504
interpolation	splines
whether splines or linear trapezodial interpolation is a better fit will depend heavily on your problem

8796554
postgresql	mysql
my first instinct is to check that the index is actually in place on the heroku side but i m not sure quite how to do that - in any case i have a feeling it s more to do with the fact that mysql and postgresql don t do things quite the same way

8796609
hide	show
loop through all checkboxes to make a list of the classes to be show then loop through the elements checking each one to see if it has one of those classes and hide or .show as appropriate

8796623
hide	show
you can then hide all and show the ones that meet the selector

8796642
range	min	range	max	min	max
it just occurred to me to make the above more efficient is to use the first table command to generate the data itself as well and not just find the max min of the plot range

8796645
integer	fractions
add the integer fractions parts of the months to get a correct value

8796667
jlist	jtree
combine that sample code with the swing jtree tutorial and a reference to the treeselectionlistener interface which is the equivalent of the listselectionlistener which i used in my answer since that code uses a jlist instead of a jtree and you should be able to complete your requirement

8796680
button	checkbox
i am using a simple prop call to change the state of a jqueryui toggle button aka checkbox using this

8796682
ceil	floor
but my problem is this k-means produce clusters of roughly the same size where i need the clusters to be exactly the same size or to be more precise i need them to have a size between floor n k and ceil n k

8796711
put	get
datetime type is not modified by mysql meaning that if you put a date in the database you get the same

8796711
integer	unsigned
by default an unsigned integer is int 10 meaning you can store numbers up to 4294967295 but it s limits are not fixed so we can easily change int 10 int to int 16 bigint

8796730
post	get
no post get values are never null

8796740
nsurl	nsstring
i declared two nsstring and nsurl variable in interface of my controller

8796742
put	get
the trend is to put most production functions in the cloud or at least start that way until you get too big or need some services they can t provide

8796779
rss	feed
i m creating an rss feed for a site

8796791
trie	tree
instead there comes a point much earlier where a trie or a ternary tree become better options

8796826
width	height
each of this images should be placed in any inline-block container which has a static width and enougn height for images to scroll up and down

8796855
width	height
the width of the resized image is correct but no matter what i do the height is 75px

8796873
rss	feed
as the rss feed reader in the sidebar is an as is component you can t modify what you would like to have is not doable

8796889
google-chrome	safari
my guess is that the more recent version included with google-chrome as opposed to safari 5.1 can do inference for constructor declarations like

8796896
width	height
this would stretch the height but you can change it around easily to work the other way and stretch the width with something like this which is i believe what you want to do

8796904
fileoutputstream	printwriter
every time i write to a file do i close the fileoutputstream and printwriter after each iteration of the loop or is it more efficient to keep them open and close them when the thread terminates

8796935
junit	testng
i couldnâ t find a way to run it as testng tc on aix env so i tried to run it as junit tc using junit runner

8796936
shadowing	named
the identifiers are derived from the generator s input so i m concerned about named collisions specifically unintentional shadowing between scopes which the generator can t detect

8796951
post	get
after our silverlight application makes it s login post the next get that we send fails with a notfoundexception

8796951
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i have tested now with silverlight 4 as well as google-chrome firefox opera and safari and ie9 sl5 is the only bad combination

8796951
content-length	content-type
notice that the content-type and content-length are identical even though

8796951
content-length	content-type
you aren t allowed to use content-type or content-length on a get

8796951
post	get	content-length	content-type
you get redirected back to the index page and that get still contains the content-type and content-length from the post and so it fails

8796969
portrait	landscape
it will be used on phone browsers so when the orientation flips from landscape to portrait the javascript subtraction needs to stay true whilst allowing the percentage widths to adjust

8797002
post	get
so thing is i want the post which contain the link to get deleted from there after a limited time

8797023
python-mode	pymacs
i install pymacs manually the python part and i use the pymacs package in the elpa s python-mode it contains pymacs.el then this two conflict i remove the pymacs in python-mode it works well.maybe you are the same error.or you should check your python version

8797042
inherited	properties
i have a very simple class that has a single properties and which inherited inotifypropertychanged

8797116
gmp	bigint
however based on your comments you might be looking for a bigint library like gmp

8797120
integer	unsigned
your question is a bit unclear but intmax_t is the largest signed integer-valued type and uintmax_t is the largest unsigned integer type

edit the reason this questions seems to arise often for opencv as opposed to other libraries is that it changes rather dramatically and fast between versions and many of the operations are not so well-defined well-constrained so you can t just rely on it to be a black-box like you do for something like libpng or libjpeg

hash	salt
i would suggest that for passwords at least you can use a one-way hash you can make it a lot hard to brute force attack the hash if you make use of a salt

8805528

int	double
i d bet that over half the usage of this method in the wild involves someone casting an int to a decimal or double in order to use it so why isn t there just an overload that takes an int as the argument

8806321
google-chrome	firefox
firefox 8 google-chrome 10

8806333

the sort being likely to be bound only on cpu and memory there probably won t be much to gain after 1 thread per core or at most 1 thread per virtual processors if hyperthreading

8806358
google-chrome	firefox
it will fail on due to the trailing comma where firefox and google-chrome will ignore the error

8806387

width	height
so i use jquery to set the width height isn t needed for most browsers at first to 50

8806978
width	height
the only thing that seems to work in safari is to set it to a fixed pixel value for both width and height

8806978
width	height
these get fixed pixel values in width and height which doesn t work for scaling in most browsers i have learned

8806978
width	height
so i have search-replaced the width and height attributes using xpath to 100 values

mouseover	mouseout	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseleave	mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseleave
it s much better to use event driven development and bind events only to the elements you re interested in knowing whether or not the mouse is over with mouseover mouseout mouseenter mouseleave etc

8817156
accessor	properties
more specifically non-abstract properties declarations are allowed to have semicolon accessor bodies

8817156

8818551
avr	microcontroller
i have some previous experience with 8bit avr microcontroller so i was hoping for a not to big transition

setinterval	settimeout
on mousedown event you store mouse position and in settimeout or setinterval you check current mouse position for example like once evey 16 miliseconds to get 60fps so it looks good

min	max
similarly you can find min max by dividing multiplying by two until you under overflow

8820062
min	max
you should then search between the last valid value and the next factor of two to find the true min max value but this gives you a good starting point

8820062
min	max
a quick test on a compute capability 2.0 machine with quick and dirty calculations for min max

8820345
uiwindow	uipopovercontroller
if uipopovercontroller causes you some kind of problem i d put the sidebar in its own uiwindow and float that over the main window

8820345

by default it will look in a folder called views from the directory the script is

8821459
inherited	subclassing
in this case i suggest having a base abstract activity and two concrete inherited subclassing

8821459
superclass	subclassing
doing that is in my opinion a lot better than having a concrete subclassing to a concrete superclass that can lead to many problems and is usually difficult to debug

8821463
spaces	delimiter
basically i have a field which contains some codes delimiter by a spaces like so abc def ghi

8821780
folder	directory
is there a way to move files in a directory we have 1.7 million to folder based upon a date

8821788
getter	setter
it works great for pod types although the declaration syntax is of course not nearly as terse as c# but i can t think of a way to have the getter return something other than the stored object type likewise the setter must take exactly the stored type

if i put try catch block i get _jsonobject def is not a jsonobject _ exception but execution doesn t continue

8822059

8822188
ubuntu	linux
if i were to cross-compile this under linux i am using ubuntu 11.10 as the host for a shared .so or even a static .a object with the armv7-a neon architecture using api-9 as a library to call with java s jni to ultimately compile as an apk for distribution what steps would one undertake to achieve this outcome

8822212
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari

hash	salt
if the data is sensitive you ll probably want to keep it server-side or hash it with a salt and then insert the hash value into the script

8822455
hash	salt
of course this hash is rather unusable client-side because you must not include your salt in anything client-side this would defeat the purpose of obfuscating the data in the first place

8822530
width	height
to fix this you will have to calculate and set the dimensions the height and width of the layoutparams of your button views calling buttonview.layout will not do this

8822541
post	get
see this post for more details and great examples on how to get started

8822551
int	chars
1 if the only values that can be stored in this field are the five specified in the query it might make sense to replace the chars field with five int fields each a flag for the specified condition - ie

8822558
hash	md5
other hash functions such as sha-1 also have hash collisions although it is much less likely than md5

8822590

now even after i delete the file when i go to localhost a page is shown which was the index page when c99shell.php was present in the folder which is different from the one which is currently on my www dir

now if i make a folder inside the www directory and then create new files then when i go to localhost folder_name i get the correct files

i understand i can try to put my json object into a query string and call my .ashx page but the json object could get large so i m trying to use the request.form of a post

if i make a post to the .ashx file from jquery and send my json object through i get a response which contains the data in a string rather than getting a .csv

8822864
put	get
to get past your current compiler error you ll need to put the directivehash.put end new endstatement

8822959

8823323
google-chrome	safari
other browsers like safari google-chrome rockmelt only show partially..i m obviously doing something not really right here s the code

8823419
memcpy	memmove
note that memcpy glibc_2.2.5 is mapped to memmove old versions of memcpy consistently copied in a predictable direction which led to it sometimes being misused when memmove should have been used and this is the only reason for the version bump - you could simply replace memcpy with memmove in your code for this specific case

8823421
width	height
note according to my code i am defining the width and height of the uitextview before adding the text to it

8823437

8828973
ostream	istream
i consider this overload to be pretty dangerous the istream one even more so than the ostream one actually consider the following

8828973
std	ostream	ostream	istream
the above example might look contrived but it shouldn t be too hard to get into this situation in generic code or when passing the to a function that provides an lvalue and an rvalue overload and stores the std ostream or std istream in different ways according to the overload

8828979

i ve tried many things here such as creating a getter and setter that passes the value onto the notepad class but have discovered that they don t work due to the setup of my program

8829078
cpython	pypy
there are several approaches for it from using numpy cpython a c extension running your program using pypy instead of the standard cpython and even take a look at corepy - what you should not do is to have a numeric intensive task running in pure python if performance is an issue there

8829202
inherited	subclassing
but the certain way he subclassing it gives us a pattern that can be used without subclassing you can define a class that holds an dictionary and an array but inherited from nsobject

8829210
int	chars
you need to scan the string to find the u part then extract the following four chars into a separate string then use integer.parseint string s int radix with a radix of 16 to convert 00c1 to an int and then cast that int to chars

ant	maven
integrate your old ant build in maven you can call directly some ant snippets or complete ant build from maven

8829435
ant	maven
this would yield you a hybrid build system which is probably not the best but still would allow you some leeway in your migration process and manage older ant scripts slowly migrating slices of functionality over to maven

8829435
ant	maven
not that it s not necessarily bad per say to have a mix of the two just that maven provides a lot of hard wired or quasi hard wired configuration convention that the ant script could interfere with

8829435
ant	maven
drive your maven build from ant you can also do the opposite that is drive the maven build process from ant thus keeping control on how you call your other system

8829435
ant	maven
by integrating the right things such as properties or filter you can ensure maven generates the necessary artifact from a specific project that you can use at later time within your ant script

put	get
so i d like to capture that myimage text and use it in my new string - then get rid of all the cid stuff and put the standard path in

8830828
getter	setter
the idea of getter and setter are to control access to variables in a class

8830828
getter	setter
if you didn t use a getter and a setter you would have to track down every use of the class and convert there

8830828
getter	setter
if you used a getter and a setter you can just change those methods and everything that uses the class won t break

i put my button in the table view cell but i can t figure out how to get it set to the proper class in the file owner

8830860

8830873
getter	setter
there is nothing wrong with using getter and setter - just be aware that by using them and making them all public you re exposing your variables and in a way violating encapsulation

8830873
getter	setter
this is what the article you mention is trying to warn of - don t just automatically generate getter and setter for all private instance variables

8830873
public	protected
think about what you want to expose to other classes and at what level private protected public so that you re exposing only as needed

8831007
for-loop	arrays
i m assuming you re setting these values by key and then trying to iterate through the arrays with something like a for-loop - but while you can set values by key because in javascript an arrays is just another object these values won t be available in standard arrays iteration and the length of the arrays will still be 0

8831007

8831022
getter	setter

8831022
getter	setter
the issue was you were solving the wrong problem with those getter setter

8840633
jobs	cron
i thought of creating cron jobs to run a message script at those specific timestamps but that seemed wrong with thousands of jobs an hour

8840650
put	get
either put your code inside the get function where you have your alert showing the correct value or make the request synchronous you ll have to look up the jquery docs because i don t use jquery

8840652
put	get
you cannot put it after the get function because it will execute too soon before the results are known

8840693

8840947
keydown	keyup
to move the selected column use the keydown or keyup if you prefer event and place your code there

8840959
public	protected
instance variables declared in the implementation are implicitly hidden effectively private and the visibility cannot be changed - public protected and private do not produce compiler errors with the current clang at least but are ignored

8841017
postgresql	mysql
i think it s the same way with .net framework you could reference an assembly of postgresql or mysql databases and build your app based with theses libs using ado.net npgsqlconnection mysqlconnection npgsqlcommand mysqlcommand etc... to do your crud operations

8841049
button	checkbox
i need to show a checkbox or radio button checked or unchecked based on a boolean value

i m trying to pass into a stored procedure a string of words delimiter by spaces and what i d like to do is to execute selects on those words such that each subsequent select queries the result set before it

8841117
min	max
the reduce phase is all about aggregation counting averaging min max etc

8841120
post	put
so as long as the digits are at the end of the column value you can easily extract the numeric value from the column as such stackoverflow will not let me put the word union in a post - replace uuu with union

8841133
post	get
you seem to be navigating by post instead of by get

8841143
for-loop	loops
surrounding this with a for-loop and for each counting the iterations of the while loops it seems that one needs to generate on average 4.5 permutations for every valid one and 6.2 if cycles of length three are not allowed either

8841158
button	checkbox
actually i want it to make it that i can have different functions attached to each checkbox that when a user selects a checkbox or another and clicks the submit button it triggers the specific functions

8841164

why has twitter have stopped using delete in their api altogether and now only use post and get for all methods

8841188
post	get
building an api that only uses post and get

8841210

when using your second regexp however with the i flag removed it gives me the results i d expect if the entire text of the tested string consists of white spaces tabulation carriage return or linefeed then that entire string is returned

8841226
jboss	weblogic
on jboss this works fine but on weblogic getresource return null in this case

8841254
inherited	subclassing
they behave somewhat unintuitively with respect to inherited if you set such a variable in a base class and set it again in the subclassing then you will change the value for all classes in the hierarchy

8841292
ubuntu	linux
shouldn t this be in ask ubuntu or unix linux not stackexchange

8841336
client-side	server-side
you would probably want to filter the results out on server-side to reduce bandwidth and client-side load

8841380
width	height
i want the width and height in the player function be inalized with the width and the height of the image when the onload function is called

8841382
clearance	devise
the best way is to use devise clearance authlogic or another gem and use the examples for them

8841382
submit	submission
submit the form standard form submission and if the password change works change what you display next time around preferable through simple flags set in the controller that control what the view shows in the view form

8841382
hide	show
submit the form ajax and if the password change works use javascript say jquery to change what the view is showing - hide the password fields and show the other fields you want again setting simlpe flag to control the display in the.

8841382
hash	md5
for other readers of this answer the op probably already knows this if the password is hash for security md5 and i ll assume it is then you can t know what it is but you can hash an attempt and compare to the hash version stored in the database and if they match the user has provided they are the same

8841423
cos	sin
is it possible to use the ce database s built-in functions such as those math functions power sin cos in wp7 s linq to sql

8841441
move	drag
you could make it so someone could just drag the mouse around and move the map

8841450

secure hash and salt for php passwords

8841458
gmail	hotmail
i made an html email which is displayed perfectly fine in gmail but with some strange hotmail errors

8841458
gmail	hotmail
this works perfectly fine in gmail but the problems occur in hotmail and since i m working on an apple without office i can t even check outlook..

8841460
hash	salt
hash values password + salt because it would take too much space

8841470
ssl	https
are there any errors with internet explorer 6+ trying to cache those files if they re sent through https ssl

8841491
draggable	droppable
to be more specific my plugin uses jquery ui draggable and droppable

8841495
ready	each
contents of each page into the dom as you navigate and the dom ready

8841499
firefox	safari
firebug in firefox and developer tools in safari also all do this i just don t know the exact terms for them.

8841541
put	get
now when i do print statements in my console i get the correct values but then when i put on my template it only shows me the last value

8841549
versioning	upgrade
what you did set is some variable that is supposed to tell the javascript script that is used to embed the swf what minimum versioning of the player is required to run the swf this has no effect on the swf itself it s only for user s information you should set it in such a way that in case users have older versioning of player they will be told to upgrade

8841553
superclass	subclassing
every instance of subclassing is also an instance of superclass

8841567
maven	m2e
i have successfully installed configured the m2e maven plugin for eclipse along with android sdk and adt

8841570
yslow	pagespeed
to clarify the terminology used by yslow and similar tools like google s pagespeed

8841574
put	get
otoh it might be more convenient to put them in especially if they sometimes require some tweaking to get working here we have all manner of problems getting the maven and webtools plugins to cooperate

8841639
daemons	systemd
yes the code will probably need a gui systemd to run - won t be a daemons

8841648
hide	show
it even uses a sliding effect to hide and show the advertisements in the bottom of the screen

8841663
for-loop	loops
why loops is not working and if it would how could i reverse the grep in the for-loop

8841671
google-chrome	firefox
it works with firefox and google-chrome without any issues but not in ie 8 not sure about other versions

8841683
jobs	cron
1 running scripts as cron at on windows jobs

8841683
jobs	cron
2 running custom executables as cron at jobs

8841688
portrait	landscape
this means they will be applied to the current page size in software and reflect the actual page dimension portrait or landscape

8841688
portrait	landscape
because these are hardware measurements they do not rotate when you set the page to landscape portrait

8841688
width	height
the two lines that determine available width and available height are what i think you were looking for in your question

8841688
portrait	landscape
those two lines take into account whether you want soft margins or hard margins and whether the print document is configured for landscape or portrait

8841688
width	height
i used math.floor for the easy way out to just drop anything past the decimal ex 817.96 - 817 just to make sure the available width and height was just inside the available dimensions

8841688
portrait	landscape
i tested this procedure in both portrait and landscape with both hard margins and soft margins on a dell 3115cn a samsung scx-4x28 and cutepdf software printer

8841688
min	max
either you can prevent the user from selecting margins outside the printable area or warn them if they do or you can enforce some min max conditions in your code when you actually start printing drawing the document

8841688
pop-up	dialog
example case if you set the page margins to 0 0 0 0 in microsoft word 2007 a warning dialog pop-up that reads one or more margins are set outside the printable area of the page

8841706
libxml2	libxslt
the obvious way to solve this is to use an xslt processor such as the libxslt c library that is closely related actually pretty much a part of libxml2

8841717
rss	feed
i m importing a facebook rss feed and many of the posts are missing a title

8841718
google-chrome	safari
instead of alert data i would use console.log data and use firebug or the js console in google-chrome and safari to see what s going on

8841719
crypt	hash	crypt	md5	hash	md5
i ve read a lot of posts on here about crypt md5 hash bcrypt etc and have come to consider using something along the lines of the following to secure the passwords better than they are now

8841719
hash	salt
i will use a combination of hash sha512 and two salt the first salt will be a site wide salt stored in a file such as .htaccess and the second salt will be created for each user

8841795
post	get
if we change this value and save post on controller we get model with the incorrect value but not which we enter

8841805
nl2br	htmlspecialchars
nl2br - htmlspecialchars

8841877
getter	setter
mdsharedprefs class just contains some getter and setter to retrieve write the pref values

8841883
submit	submission
fill out the form and upon submission .click of that form submit it will send the information and hide the div again

8841909
put	get
working xslt to count the # of complete y is so theen i put exactly what works on w3schools into my sp dataview and i get nothing.

8841960
hash	hmac
what you really need is not a plain hash function but a message authentication code such as hmac

8841970
ubuntu	linux
i just built the arm-none-eabi toolchain on my ubuntu to compile the linux kernel for arm

8841982
mouseover	mouseout	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseleave	mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseleave
i see in the jquery docs a method called hover but that seems to bind on events mouseenter and mouseleave should i be using those events instead of mouseover and mouseout

8841988
inherited	properties
in an app that i am writing i use the singleline properties of an edittext inherited from textview in order to make the view multiline by setting the properties to false

8841999
hash	md5
do not nest md5 inside your sha512 hash

8841999
hash	md5
an md5 collision then implies a hash collision in the outer hash too because you are hashing the same values

8841999
hash	md5
md5 hash are prefixed with unless you reinvented md5 hashing then your hash may be incompatible

8842007
accessor	properties
you probably don t want to declare your instance variables in the .h but instead in the .m file no need to make them visible and also have properties accessor with the same name

8842038
mouseover	mouseout	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseleave	mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseleave
for the difference between mouseover mouseout and mouseenter mouseleave see what is the difference between the mouseover and mouseenter events

8842057
setinterval	clearinterval	setinterval	settimeout	clearinterval	settimeout
you should use setinterval clearinterval rather than recalling the function using settimeout

8842076
profiling	instrumentation
everything works as expected and the video gets created properly but when i profiling my application with instrumentation i get memory leaks which i don t really know how to fix as i can t see anything in the detail view which is related to my code all the leaked objects are malloc and the responsible library is videotoolbox

8842091
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and firefox seem to be working fine

8842102
emacs	aquamacs
i use aquamacs 90 of the time to edit r files with ess emacs speaks statistics

8842108
pbkdf2	md5
if it matches password is correct perform the bcrypt pbkdf2 transformation of the password since you now have it store it in the new system and delete the old md5 record

8842140
free	malloc
fixing a leak is to figure out where the extra retain came from or where a missing call to free might need to be inserted in the case of a malloc based leak

8842142
hash	salt
many hash iterations append salt every time

8842142
hash	salt	hash	md5	salt	md5
first build a temporary function to create a new blowfish hash from the original md5 hash with a random salt and a prefix so that we can detect this later

8842142
hash	md5
now run all the existing md5 hash through this function and save the result in the database

8842142
hash	md5
it gets the md5 hash out of your database immediately

8842264
width	height
i would like to be able to inspect a uiview instance that may or may not have been rotated from its original orientation by the user rotating the device for instance and determine what the true width and height are

8842264
width	height
true here meaning if a view on a portrait-oriented ipad was 768x1024 before rotation after being turned sideways i would calculate that the new width was 1024 and the new height was 768

8842296
mouseover	mouseleave
i suggest that you use mouseover and mouseleave or the jquery.hover event which is the same to set the ui-state-hover class on the row on which the context menu will be opened

8842319
hash	salt
secure hash and salt for php passwords

8842330
getter	setter
you need to synthesize playeronecount in order to generate the getter and setter methods -playeronecount and -setplayeronecount respectively

8842347
width	height
what i gathered from your comments was that you want to be able to access the width and height from outside the player function and the problem is that you don t know when the width and height are available

8842347
width	height
since you don t know when the image will be loaded and can t have the width and height before it s loaded unless you specify them in the img tag server-side you need to use a function that takes a callback to access the player s width and height

8842347
width	height
basically if the width and height are not known yet the function just puts the callback in a queue

8842347
width	height
when the width and height are determined all of the functions in the queue get called with the width and height being passed to them as arguments

8842361
maven	m2e	maven	pom.xml	m2e	pom.xml
if i keep jsp-api in pom.xml and set it to provided or test tomcat side will fail as the m2e plugin pushes jsp-api jar to maven dependencies which is then included in my tomcat deployed lib

8842385
int	double
by adding a decimal to one of the int java will treat it as a double and not perform int division

8842390
dictionary	map
so a normal map dictionary isn t quite enough since the keys can be duplicated

8842472
int	chars
edit as pointed out in the comments it s possible that sizeof chars sizeof int

8842484
width	height
the example deals with the height but is the same using the width

8842505
int	double
and you might want to consider using double instead of int â that is

8842514
pop-up	dialog
what i d like to do is when that hyper link is clicked i d like to return in a pop-up of some kind alert pop-up jquery dialog etc the data that the info link would return if navigating to that page

8842519
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uitabbaritem	uitabbarcontroller
i suggest you take a look at the uitabbarcontroller uitabbaritem and uiviewcontroller class references and read up on the relevant properties

8842527
children	parent
the disadvantage of this way is that for existing parent the whole collection of children will be loaded into memory before a new child is added and later saved to the database

8842527
children	parent
if this is the case many and increasing number of children for each parent then the might be useful

8842590
extjs	gxt
i m trying to create a fairly simply gwt app using the gxt framework and am doing this based on the ebook extjs gwt 2.0 beginners guide

8842593
int	chars
if that chars isn t whitespace or 0 then the input string wasn t a valid int

8842598
width	height
adjust the top and left margins byy half the height and width

8842682
fadein	fadeout
fadein and fadeout are both functions

8842692
metaclass	subclassing
within one class hierarchy metaclass must be subclassing of each other

8842692
metaclass	subclassing
that is the metaclass of component must be a subclassing of the metaclass of otherobjects

8842702
children	parent
nor do you need to call dispose on any of the children as disposing a parent will do that for you

8842737
width	height
i would like to play around with coding an application that could capture a desktop or section of a screen height and width variables for resolution and stream those to an rtmp server rtmp server.com live

8842737
width	height
ability to select height width selection of desktop or entire desktop and stream live to that channel as if i was using flash media live encoder

8842766
m2e	pom.xml
instead the m2e plugin uses the configuration in the pom.xml to create equivalent configurations in eclipse

8842792
post	get
below i provide links to recent post that i believe will help you get started

8842794
width	height	portrait	landscape
the key here is that if the simulator device is in landscape mode and then you start your program self.view. frame or bounds retrieves the portrait height and width

8842814
ienumerable	ilist
ilist and list do not define their t as out while ienumerable does

8842814
put	get	ienumerable	ilist
put a simpler way you can only get back t from ienumerable but you can put in t to ilist because of this ienumerable doesn t care if you are less specific but ilist does

8842855
stdout	stderr
if you want a really whacky dirty yet quick solution run your function in from multicore - it suppresses stdout you can add multicore closestderr if you want to suppress stderr as well

8842856
int	double
or you could take advantage of the fact that all numbers int float double it doesn t matter with an exact value of 0 are treated as false other constants treated as false include or - see here

8842889
ati	nvidia
as for hardware i have dual boot ibm thinkpad 64-bit quad core with an integrated nvidia 3100m card and an intel core 2 duo imac which has an ati radeon

8842890
screens	tablet
this will allow me to pre-configure the tablet for our customers change the screens background to our logo etc

8842899
tlbimp	tlbexp
also for building in general you should be able to use tlbimp or tlbexp to create a tlb file that you can use for building assuming the point of registering is just to be able to compile successfully and not to run specific tests

8842908
google-chrome	firefox
tested with ie9 firefox and google-chrome and it all worked fine

8842921
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
i have a uisplitviewcontroller with a uiviewcontroller as master and a uinavigationcontroller as my details controller which contains an actual detailscontroller as it s rootcontroller

8842921
portrait	landscape
funny enough if i rotate to portrait then back to landscape the methods gets called properly from then on

8842957
vbscript	jscript
to let you compare jscript and vbscript code dealing with the same problem

8842957
vbscript	jscript
in .htas and .wsfs or .wscs you can mix all installed activescript languages vbscript jscript perlscript pythonscript rubyscript ... by using the script tag either inline or via the src attribute

8842991
listview	gridview
i m working on an android application with listview gridview

8842992
versioning	upgrade
the latest versioning will offer to upgrade a 2008 project to 2010 it shouldn t be terribly hard to write a powershell script to do that via command line

8843000
hash	salt
what i do is store a cookie with the client s id username and password salt and hash

8843002
stdout	stderr
basically the at the end means redirect anything from stderr which is 2 to stdout which is 1

8843002
stdout	stderr
since stdout is redirected to a file you should now see the stderr stream in the file

8843060
width	height
i use a set width of around 300px which works fine but dynamically size the iframe s height to the size of it s content a blog post

8843101
google-chrome	firefox
in browsers that support the html5 history state api firefox google-chrome this works flawless

8843158
width	height
i commented the width part of the above function as you re specifically asking about the height

8843171
listbox	icollectionview
i am binding a wpf listbox to a icollectionview which is grouped

8843185
put	get
what is more using reflection or casting to untyped list you can put any object into list and in both codes you ll get classcastexception

8843187
versioning	upgrade
however if you were to upgrade your license to pro then the pro versioning will take the files from your temp directory and re-generate the .meta files as they are seen in svn

8843213
viewdidload	viewwillappear
you might be able to do this on viewwillappear instead of viewdidload

8843226
rss	feed
i am writing an rss feed with wpf and one of the feed is a custom feed created by wordpress

8843282
strcpy	strncpy
my best guess would be that strncpy instead of strcpy would fix your problem it sounds like something has overwritten your next pointer somewhere late in the list and too long a string in in would do that for sure

8843285
nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception
note that supplying string that doesn t represent any of enum values throws illegalargumentexception but in your present code you have potential nullpointerexception at runtime enums.valueoffunction returns null if the enum constant does not exist and i suppose you are aware of it if you weren t you are now

8843315
width	height
i wonder if an issue with trying to calculate width and height

8843315
width	height
so according to the millennial documentation it is recommended that you don t set the height or width but let the sdk optimize based on the device

8843332
min	max
select ala_date min ala_date max ala_date ala_type partmsg

min	max
select ala_date min ala_date max ala_date ala_type

8843332

for-loop	arrays
i am using a for-loop to iterate through a list of arrays that all have the same name expect a different number at the end

8843369
free	malloc
i was talking with a grad student that had broken malloc free working on the largest file of genetic data ever attempted in one pass

8843381
post	get
so if you call then it will attempt to instantiate a class called newscontroller and if it s a get request then the get method of that class or post for a post request and so on

8843424
submit	submission
i am currently submission the form with jquery s submit method on the form object but the user field does not remember the login name when i load the page again

8843436
for-loop	loops
in example sendp method included in for-loop which is slower than making other loops to send packets

8843436
for-loop	loops
performance tip in python using for loops is too slow use map instead if you would like a speed like a for-loop in c ref

8843436
winpcap	scapy
if my guess is right you are sending a video stream packets in this case i would use a winpcap if i am sending an 1 mega pixel video or scapy in other cases lower size per frame

8843445
rss	feed
the method fetches some info from an rss feed

8843465
width	height
all of them have the same width but different height

8843478
udp	tcp
udp is not point 2 point protocol like tcp so using one server socket bind to specific port you can handle hundreds of clients

8843493
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i reworked the code to use fb.login and now it works in ie and not in any other broswers google-chrome nor firefox safari is untested

8843493
google-chrome	firefox
it pops up and auth goes fine in firefox and google-chrome but window hangs on

8843498
pop-up	dialog
you can allways use a simple and let the user select open in the open or save dialog that will pop-up in the browser

8843514
lxml	beautifulsoup
they are many xml parsers available in python like beautifulsoup lxml

8843526
maven-surefire-plugin	pom.xml
at first it was saying no goals needed for this project so i added the maven-surefire-plugin to my pom.xml to bind the test phase to the maven-surefire-plugin test goal

8843590
draggable	droppable
the solution i found is to extract the code which sets the draggable s and or droppable s into a separate function which can then be reinvoked by the ajax response after it reloads the relevant part of the page

8843610
express	node.js	express	nowjs	nowjs	node.js
here is an example of an app using node.js and the modules express jade and nowjs

8843610
apache	nginx
with either nginx or a node script acting as a reverse proxy in front of this script and apache

8843612

backbone.js	javascriptmvc
if not then i d write it in js but take a look at some mvc frameworks such as backbone.js or javascriptmvc etc

8843635
maven	m2e
final question shall each developer compile the code using maven through m2e or using eclipse compiler as normal

8843638
jtree	jtable
in connection with thread jtable as a jtree node i put jtable to jtree but jtree view isn t rendered correctly on start_up how can i setpreferredsize for jtable because preferredscrollableviewportsize shrinked jtable with rendering tableheader + one row one row remain hidden but after expanding node s treerenderer change and repaint the setpreferredsize to the expected dimension

8843657
jtree	jtable
2 if i put jscrollpane with jtable to the node directly without using jpanel as parent then jtree view isn t correctly rendered after start_up for more info please see my question put jtable in the jtree

put	get
where does xcode put the code for this and what do i have to remove to get back to where i started from

8843766
equals	gethashcode
in all how does an equals and or a gethashcode have a bug

8843766
equals	gethashcode
if the relationship between gethashcode and equals is not as above

8843766
equals	gethashcode
with the overrides on attribute the equals does have the reflexive symmetric and transitive properties it s gethashcode does match it and the documentation for it s equals override is

8843770
entity-relationship	diagram
entity-relationship only has 5 thingies but they re really all one needs for entity-relationship diagram

8843793
width	height
the easiest way to clear it is ctx.clearrect 0 0 width height

8843796
nsoperation	nsblockoperation
my simple workaround is just to subclass nsoperation or nsblockoperation without overriding anything and then do something like this

8843797
kerberos	ldap
besides ldap it supports kerberos 5 and the change password protocol

8843799
subclass	abstract-class
even though your myclass can not be instantiated directly because it s an abstract-class abstract is a subclass of myclass

8843812
mouse	keyboard
i m trying to place a cube on the screen using vertices...i have a camera that rotates and translates with mouse and keyboard commands...during runtime however the square surface of the cube lays flat on the screen and doesn t move while the camera is rotating...the other items on the screen appear behind the square surface...can anyone explain the process of rendering a primitive

8843825
super	abstract
i have a class that has a private member variable that is assigned when it is instantiated however if it is used in an abstract function that is called by the super class s constructor the variable does not have a value

8843854
post	put
you re using put but the share api requires post as the method

8843863
metaclass	subclassing
as unutbu puts it within one class hierarchy metaclass must be subclassing of each other

8843863
metaclass	subclassing
that is the metaclass of component must be a subclassing of the metaclass of otherobjects.

8843863
metaclass	superclass
but this should do what you want and some more - you just have to inherit all your metaclass from basecomponablemeta and call the superclass in the hyerarchy through the metaclass __superclass attribute

8843864
clang	llvm
i would definitely look at clang llvm

8843871
superclass	subclassing
the superclass constructor runs before the subclassing constructor hence it would only be natural that the statement is executed afterwards

8843884
hide	show
the list will show and hide upon focusing and blurring the input

8843892
rss	feed
i need to call an rss feed using basic authentication

8843904
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
so far i can t get it to work on safari or firefox or opera on my mac

8843904
firefox	safari
safari sits on a blank screen and firefox gives me this error

8843931
put	get
i still get an error like however since 3rdparty.ifetch is a generic type i don t think i can ever put a code contract on it specifically

8843975
profiler	yourkit
here is tree of incoming references to held object obtained using yourkit java profiler

8843980
folder	directory
so i had to manually cut paste the generated files and folder into the directory tree

8843994
moq	nmock
you can then pass your interface rather than your concrete class to a mocking framework i ve used moq but i assume nmock works very similarly

8843995
multicastdelegate	delegation
by default the c# compiler will for each event auto-define a multicast delegation field along with add and remove members which will take the passed-in delegation and add or remove them to from that multicastdelegate field

8844002
width	height
just as simple as editing the resize width height but not stored in a user-friendly area

8844007
maven	m2e
if you use m2e then the standard eclipse compiler will be extended with maven builders so you can use all eclipse compile features

8844013
gmail	hotmail
how to make the preview mode for the email-readers like hotmail gmail for the tinymce text editor

8844029
maven	pom.xml
repository references definitions urls are either in maven settings file or then in the pom.xml

8844029
maven	m2e
code can be compiled with the help of eclipse-maven plugin of which m2e is the most common using maven on the command line or then using maven to generate regular eclipse project files and then normally with eclipse

8844055
google-chrome	firefox
when i do it like this google-chrome 16 and firefox 9 return cannot read property document of undefined

8844080
hash	md5	int	chars
even if you think an int hash isn t such a good idea using a 32 chars digest sha-1 md5 should be much faster for selects than the raw string right

8844105
inherited	properties
domain project domain entities go here i ve a simple personnel class which is inherited from entitybase class entitybase class has a single properties named id

8844126
width	height
i ve got a load of non local images which i d like to render as background images for classes with a width of 500px and height of 330px

8844126
width	height
perhaps i m completely wrong in thinking that remote local has anything to do with this issue and that the background image by default doesn t take on the width or height of selector that it s a property of

8844126
width	height
if so is it possible to expand the height and width of the background property to render at the same as the selector it s part of much like how changing the attributes of height width on the tag will affect even remote files

8844128
hide	show
however i opted to write the show hide logic myself rather than rely on a subclassed tabcontrol to do it for me

8844128
hide	show
i still feel that it would be possible to improve the show hide logic

8844128
mef	prism
additionally you can control the lifetime of your view whether or not it should be re-used upon subsequent navigation requests what logic should be performed on navigation to and on navigation from events and whether or not navigation should be aborted due to unsaved changes in current view etc. note that prism view-based navigation requires a dependency injection container such as unity or mef so you will likely need to incorporate this into your application architecture but even without prism navigation adopting a di container is well worth the investment

8844129
antivirus	mcafee
in our case it was the mcafee antivirus software on the server repository stealing the file when commited via subversion

8844147
dictionary	map
since json is a parsed as a map or dictionary this should be adequate regardless of the presence of nested jsonarrays and json objects in those arrays explain why json-rpc is better or desired by anything at all

8844194
udp	tcp
if you know that it will be in a lan or something similar then you can consider using udp instead of tcp but then you need to manage way more things by yourself since it is not as reliable

8844215
rss	feed
the yahoo rss feed url format is for search term nascar

8844215
rss	feed
as an alternative you can use the bing search rss feed which have the format

8844254
filtering	grouping
this filtering grouping multiple words together

8844306
centos	linux
i am having this php script that fails to save the session variable when i hit submit in my php version 5.1.6 linux centos system

8844312
hide	show
i ve also added calls to the show and hide functions for the target and curloaded elements to ensure that the check for whether the element is visible will provide the expected result

8844314
portrait	landscape
my adnroid application works well on emulator but running on real android device softbank 003 sh when i rotate the device from portrait to landscape the application stop unexpectedly

8844329
width	height
i found the best way to float a mouse event tracking div over an area is to make the div 1px width and what ever height you need

8844338
firefox	safari
in safari omniweb firefox there s no such problem with the very same codebase

8844339
int	chars
on most platforms signed chars will be an 8-bit two s complement number -128 to 127 and unsigned chars will be an 8-bit unsigned int 0 to 255

8844376
min	max
you have an error in your schema global presentation element cannot have constraints maxoccurs 1 minoccurs 1 you d need to remove them it does not make sense to have min max for global elements those constraints makes sense in context of other elements

8844390
min	max
you d want to use max and min for the initial size of the vector too though

8844408
children	parent
the idea is to organize a tree of acos so that if you allow access to a parent all children are accessable automatically

8844455
post	get
with all the get requests everything works fine but only one call must be in post with a json string and this one doesn t work

8844488
cpu	irq
when one device generates an interrupt the interrupt controller pass this information to the cpu with the irq

8844507
versioning	upgrade
all my phone settings are the same install 3rd party apps true allow usb debugging true and i ve upgrade all my app projects to the latest sdk versioning in netbeans so those aren t the issues

8844530
textarea	textbox
how do i specify the selector so it iterates that function across all textbox and textarea on the page

8844573
inherited	base-class
you can have your functor inherited from a template base-class defined in the top-level scope and then refer only to the base class using mem_fun bind1st

8844579
chown	chmod
generally spoken as for being confronted with the site still remaining the same - after the hard core changes of last night due to my server-admin while chhanging the chown and chmod of the whole site i am musing about all the tiny things and changes i did last week i will try to go through all tiny changes i made

8844663
portrait	landscape
when rotate the device from landscape to portrait will re-create the activity so thread will stop and if any builder is running will cause a error so

8844672
ant	maven
i just finished converting one of our in-house framework projects from ant to maven

8844729
.htaccess	httpd.conf
also check that apache allows processing of .htaccess files for your document root by setting allowoverride all in httpd.conf and or httpd-vhosts.conf

8844750
hide	show
use jquery and the show hide methods

8844784
hash	md5	put	get
you can put some value in the system properties in the start of your application you can get the value from the system db and encrypt the value first like md5 which can not be decrypted easily then compare with your md5 hash written in your application

8844797
hash	md5
md5 will likely be fine in your case and will probably give you the shortest hash length

8844808
post	get
so my question would it be better to use ajax to get or post to php pages or any other options are possible

8844828
getter	setter
is there any way to ensure that 4 minus 5 is 0 and not 255 without writing an explicit setter method and only using a getter property

8844837
uinavigationcontroller	uiwindow
and i also doubt if uiwindow is the place to look for it - the nav bar is part of the uinavigationcontroller

8844837
uinavigationcontroller	uiwindow
not recommended break the entire autorotation machinery of uinavigationcontroller handle the rotation of the view controllers yourself from uiwindow like you are starting to do now

8844837
uinavigationcontroller	uiwindow
either from your subclassed uinavigationcontroller or from the subclassed uiwindow

8844845
min	max	min	median	median	max
what i want is a table for each of the stats -- min max median and the quartiles -- and their values for each group the ones in names

8844852
aptana	radrails
some days after i started using aptana radrails which created a custom project folder workspace

8844858
pull	push
have each developer clone the central repo pull from and push to it

8844860
post	get
get blogs id post id to get details of a specific post for a specific blog

8844867
width	height
if you want an easy fix for this you can try handsetdetection javascript it gives you the ability to set rules and conditions such as screen size vendor os browser display width and height for your redirection

8844870
queue	fifo
you want either a list which will allow you to implement this as a fifo queue or a dictionary if you want to delete and insert at random

8844873
spaces	delimiter
if neither g file nor c string is used then the first non-option argument is treated as a spaces delimiter list of search terms

8844878
post	get
there are not that many options when it comes to submiting data either you use ajax or use the normal http message like get or post

8844878
post	get
using get or post its usefull to let the user now here s moving along a process or when things that happen after or before are different or context change a lot when submitting

8844899
post	get
so you can work with post get receive data like text json.

8844903
ubuntu	linux
i m running 9.1 on ubuntu linux server

8844913
min	max	min	median	median	max
so the table for each of the stats is in each column belongs to a group and contains the min lower quartile median upper quartile and max

8844934
rss	feed
does this mean the person has to login first to access it or will there be some sort of rss feed that keeps getting updated that i can use and read in directly

8844942
width	height
but because the width and height are in a different table i m not sure how to span the relationship write the sql to do this

8844975
int	double
i would like to get one dimensional array from my double int pointer

8845002
pop-up	dialog
if you really want to launch an activity and pop-up a dialog you must set the following flag to your intent first otherwise you ll get an exception

8845062
aggregate-functions	sum
by appending an over clause the aggregate-functions sum is turned into a window function which aggregates values per partition while keeping all rows

8845062
aggregate-functions	sum
in this expression sum sum sp.payout over w the outer sum is a window function the inner sum is an aggregate-functions

8845073
folder	directory
the fileinputformat doesn t seem to work i get an exception upon encountering a folder - saying it is a directory

8845095
firefox	safari	pop-up	dialog
unless i ran the selenium server in multiwindow mode safari and firefox would pop-up print dialog

8845103
google-chrome	firefox
update does anyone know why the images show up in firefox but not in google-chrome

8845191
multiplying	division
i m able to multiplying fine but i m stuck on the division

8845197
for-loop	arrays
any simple for-loop that breaks when it finds an applicable item would be at most o n but would on average be less unless the latter items of the arrays were constantly found to be the matching elements

8845247
avaudioplayer	avfoundation
3 play the ringtone using avfoundation specifically avaudioplayer

8845271
udp	rtp
when udp rtp avp transport is used the packet loss is inevitable due to the nature of udp

8845271
udp	tcp
however dss also supports tcp transport and reliable udp transport which could solve the packet loss problem in the circumstances that the bandwidth from server to client is enough

8845281
post	get
right now i m trying to write my own custom rails routes for my app but for some reason when i write in non-resourceful routes i cannot get post requests or anything besides get for that matter to route to the action that i specified

8845281
post	get
does anybody have any idea how i can get rails to route post requests to this url to my transaction#payment action

8845315
hide	show
now the reasoning-- should you put an if statement in the view to show or hide html

8845315
hide	show
so in this case we rely on the controller to set the value of viewbag.search then based on that the view can show or hide a specific block of html

8845321
firefox	safari
css works fine and the #divcontainer has a top margin and is centered in firefox and other browsers but not in safari

8845334
post	get
if you want to define both a custom get and a post in one line you can use match

8845334
post	get
match photos show photos#show via get post

8845355
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
i ve seen dozens of questions regarding this problem and the answer is always that the uiviewcontroller is not part of a uinavigationcontroller

8845367
int	chars
int main int argc chars argv .

8845415
sorting	grouping
edit actually you could do that expression much better to grouping by a datetime for the start of the month rather than for a string indicating the start of the month as i just showed that would be better for sorting by etc

8845424
width	margin
..the reason is that the inner div s margin can t automatically determine their size unless the inner div has a width

8845481
ant	maven
ant and maven two popular technologies for managing a project both support doing this

8845491
tablet	galaxy
why it failed on tablet xoom galaxy lg sony etc

8845493
int	double
do you want numeric to be an abstract base class and int and double to derive from it

8845493
int	double
what about double + int

8845493
int	double
in the first two cases you can say double of course because of more possible values but in the last case that doesn t work if a double is 64-bit and a rational is the quotient of two 32-bit int you will have values in each that cannot be expressed in the other such as positive infinity and 0.3

8845536
google-chrome	firefox
after some investigation it seems this issue doesn t happen in google-chrome is related to newer firefox version 9.0.1 linux

8845541
hash	md5
however in providing multiple hash outputs you effectively remove a lot of those possibilities since for example the number of texts that can produce a particular md5 is intersected with those that produce a particular shax

8845541
hash	md5
think in terms of the md5 hash you have

8845560
rss	feed
on my node.js server i have some json that i need to convert to an rss feed

8845568
post	get
this worked as of a week ago our best bet to get this fixed is to post on so the facebook developers know how big of an issue this is

8845610
folder	directory
which has further sub folder in it.i do not want to copy the files or directory

8845610
folder	directory
if you notice the output the blank space in a directory name are treated as separate directory.which is not correct.so how can i get rid of this problem.i want to create same directory structure as present on source folder

8845620
for-loop	arrays
the second for-loop was thrown in afterwards for debugging to make sure the arrays didn t actually contain two instances of each value

8845621
junit	powermockito
when i write the junit for the method getstudent is there a way in powermockito to mock the line

8845656
inherited	subclassing
if your class hierarchy permits it a base class can define the class constant which is inherited by subclassing

8845674
width	height
the width actually changes but it forces the height to a predefined value

8845691
rss	feed
processing rss feed is more comfortable

8845691
rss	feed
as of the time of posting the only rss feed available on the site are

8845691
rss	feed
resources on rss feed processing

8845704
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
another good idea is to look in the source of css3 generated buttons usually developers only care for firefox safari google-chrome and ie but a sass generated output will be really verbose with a lot of vendor prefixes including ones for opera

8845724
folder	directory
i create a repository inside my root directory which is my httpdocs folder with the following command.

8845724
put	get
once you get mod_dav and mod_dav_svn installed you need to configure your httpd.conf file or put a configuration file under your httpd s conf.d depending how it s configured on your system for it to work

8845752
spaces	delimiter
as you noted the problem is clearly that bash is treating the spaces in the directory names as a delimiter and iterating over each word separately

8845752
spaces	delimiter
then the sed command translates the spaces in your directory names into a placeholder string ### which bash no longer mistakes for a delimiter

8845776
awt	swing
most of the swing objects build off of their awt counter parts our are completely new

8845776
awt	swing
both swing and awt are a part of the core java api so it would be best to start with the tutorial that avd linked you to the java tutorial

8845789
hide	show
i want the button to hide the last two rows when clicked and show them again when clicked again

8845845
facebook	fbconnect
i am integrating the facebook api i.e fbconnect to post message on my wall i have integrated the fbconnect api in it i am getting the facebook login screen but m not getting the post to wall dialog after

getelementsbytagname	htmlcollection
getelementsbytagname returns an htmlcollection

8845950
hide	show
when you show any one element you need to go through the other divs and hide their elements

8845976
uicontrol	uibutton
i m assuming you are using a button that derives from uicontrol uibutton

8845997
put	get
here you can build your string array in onactivityresult accordingly. i didn t get what you have done in your adapter class to show contact details so i just put strings from string array in adapter.you have to code as per your need.

8846061
lxml	beautifulsoup
while beautifulsoup and lxml both can be used to parse html there is still a big step from there to text that approximates the formatting that is embedded in the html

8846061
macports	homebrew
it can be installed easily on a macos with homebrew or macports and on other nix systems through their package managers

8846092
uiview	subviews
i have one uiimageview as subviews in uiview

uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i have a uitabbarcontroller root view controller with three view controllers once of which is a uinavigationcontroller with a uiviewcontroller containing a uisearchdisplaycontroller and a uitableview

8846181
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
when this uiviewcontroller is pushed the uinavigationcontroller toolbar should slide out and the uitabbarcontroller tab bar should remain visible

8846181
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i tried setting the hidesbottombarwhenpushed property of the pushed uiviewcontroller to true which provides the intended behavior when the uinavigationcontroller is not nested within a uitabbarcontroller

8846181
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
unfortunately rather that sliding the uinavigationcontroller toolbar out when hidesbottombarwhenpushed is set to true the uitabbarcontroller slides out leaving the uinavigationcontroller visible in the pushed uiviewcontroller as the bottom bar

8846181
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
how might slide out the uinavigationcontroller toolbar when pushed and not the uitabbarcontroller tab bar

uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
the only possible solution i can think of is rather than using the uinavigationcontroller toolbar simply add a uitoolbar to the bottom of the uiviewcontroller view containing the uitableview

8846181
uinavigationcontroller	uiwindow
this will simply hide the uinavigationcontroller toolbar before the push animation starts exposing the portion of the uiwindow that lies beneath the uinavigationcontroller toolbar

8846190
uiview	subviews
if you are not you are leaking every time you alloc-init a uiview and add as a subviews without then subsequently calling release on that view

8846190
uiview	subviews
when you add a uiview as a subviews the parent view retains it therefore you as the caller can freely call release on it without worry of it being deallocated

8846205
multiplying	add
currently i just multiplying the number of counts per second by the delta time in seconds and add this to a running counts variable and for displaying i round it down by casting to int from float

8854011
range	min	range	max	min	max
to insure that the date is in the past use a asp.net range validator and programmatically set the maximumvalue and minimumvalue attributes to the max and min date your want

8854014
public	protected
you do have a couple of possible moves make the private methods protected and then you can just use mockito partial mocking to do what you want to do here or refactor the code so that you do not have these private methods and can mock the other object and thus have full mocking control over public calls

8854028
google-chrome	firefox
but both in ie firefox or google-chrome it does not work why

8854034
inherited	properties
by convention all my vm s inherited from base vm and have isbusy properties

8854073
super	self
super creates a delegate for its second argument self which will call the next function in the list of functions to call for each name the method resolution order

8854073
super	self
you could also write super type self self .__init__ name phone but if you inherit further from this class type self may not be teenager and you could have an infinite recursion

8854078
udp	tcp
i have a .net 4.0 application that uses both tcp and udp to communicate with a server

8854078
udp	tcp
the client connects to the server using a tcp connection first and then they exchange some information via some udp packets

8854078
udp	tcp
i know that udp doesn t guarantee packet delivery and unfortunately i have no control over this protocol so i can t switch to tcp

8854078
arp	udp
i also know that windows will sometimes drop udp packets if it needs to refresh the arp cache but why does this happen consistently with 4.0 and not 2.0

8854113
super	extends
class a has a method and class b extends class a where i want to call a method from super class from a locally nested class

8854134

8854186
submit	submission
my goal is to click the submit button and have submission paused until a javascript function is executed then submit the form after that

8854366
fgetc	getline
first i implemented the fgetc and getline versions and timed them

8854366
fgetc	getline
i confirmed that in debug mode the getline version is slower about 130 âµs vs 60 âµs for the fgetc version

8854366
fgetc	getline
this was confirmed when i compared my release mode times about 20 âµs using getline and 48 âµs with fgetc

8854366
fgetc	getline
the fact that using getline with iostreams is faster than fgetc at least in release mode runs counter to the reasoning that copying all that data must be slower than not copying it so i m not sure what all optimization is able to avoid and i didn t really look to find any explanation but it d be interesting to understand what s being optimized away

8854366
fgetc	getline
when i did this i was quite surprised to find that using fstream get was quite a bit slower than both the fgetc and getline methods in both debug and release

8854366
next	except
though i haven t tested this i can t see that get does much beyond just getting the next character from the stream_buf except for these sentry objects

8854366
fgetc	getline
but the performance of fgetc improved relative to the getline implementation and became faster

8854379
post	put	post	get	put	get
i wanted to create a simple plugin to get the latest post but i can t figure out where i m supposed to put my register_widget call in order for the widget to show up so i can drag it to the sidebar of my choice

as far as i know opencv has some built in functionality to find eyes within the face - or at least some libraries using opencv do emgucv

8854748
submit	submission
basically my fear is that if someone is editing the same image and set of actions at the same time and they both submit changes or if it was edited by someone else then there s a whole series of structures that potentially will fail on submission

8854760
vsto	add-in
vsto outlook add-in

it s possible to put a uipickerview in a uialertview easily in ios 5 if so is it frowned upon by apple will be app be rejected

8854871

8856704
google-chrome	firefox
this work fine is ie6 7 firefox google-chrome

8856713
user-controls	tabcontrol
it s kind of like using any other user-controls with a tabcontrol - checkbox.ischecked listbox.selecteditem expander.isexpanded etc all get lost unless they re bound to something

8856713
user-controls	tabcontrol
if this is a one-time user-controls meant to be used with a specific view and tabcontrol which you have control over then just be sure to bind the hours minutes

8856720
rss	feed
the first table will parse items from an rss feed and will have an option for a

8856729

then if you add an additional top-level post it would get the path 3

8856799
post	get
and if you reply to the first post again you would get

pop-up	dialog
why not try and use asynctask to load the game in the background and pop-up a please wait while game loads dialog that will get dismissed at the end of the doinbackground of asynctask

8856865
arraylist	treeset
one thing you could do if the fastest possible access to the kth smallest element were really important would be to use an arraylist rather than a treeset and handle inserts by binary searching for the insertion point and either inserting the element at that index or replacing the existing element at that index depending on the result of the search

8856876
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
ie supplies this info differently than google-chrome firefox safari so probably better if you do use the lib to help cover all the bases

8856893
isotope	masonry
i recently discovered the masonry and isotope jquery plugins

width	height
if a div has no visible content in it and there is no defined width and height it won t take up any space on the page which could cause a layout to break

8857008
google-chrome	firefox
it works in ie and google-chrome but in firefox the top-parent div expands

8857056
division	multiplication
iirc floating-point multiplication is much less expensive than division so this might be faster than both

8857064
chunked	transfer-encoding
transfer-encoding chunked is specifically designed to allow sending data with an unknown body length for both requests and responses

8857067

it seems to me tinyxml and pugixml are both good options rapidxml is good as well but its interface does not seem to be as easy as the above two as i have to manage data allocations myself

8857085
isotope	masonry
to some people isotope would look very similar to the work you had previously done with masonry

8857085

min	max
to aggregate them you need to decide what function to use max min sum avg etc

8857211
aggregate-functions	sum
any column you are selecting that are not used by one of the aggregate-functions sum min etc needs to be listed in the group by clause

8857218
fadein	hide
if you want the element to keep its space in the page not totally disappear then you can just set it s opacity rather than using the hide and fadein functions

8857226

i had similar problem with textmate before and the solution was to change oakdocumentdisablefsmetadata property but i can t find anything similar within sublimetext

8857257
inherited	subclassing
it s quite simple to subclassing a uinavigationcontroller through inherited

8857259
post	get
also you ll want to be careful to sanitize any get post variables

8857297
int	chars
note that in c# due to the built-in string indexer which returns a chars along with implicit conversion from chars to int the following expression means precisely the same thing whether source is a string or an

8857297
int	chars
this is largely due to the fact that comparing int values is much faster that comparing chars values

8857339
hide	show
the show hide bit is just jquery to show or hide divs that have a login and logout button in them

8857405
google-chrome	firefox
i want my application to listen on browser activity it can be ie google-chrome firefox etc... and get all the media links images movies

8857443
post	get
which means the jsp needs to receive a post request and then do an update based on a pile of json data extjs sends read request as get and write methods like store.save are post

8857443
post	get
my plan was to add something in the java to recognize whether it is a post or get request

8857470
post	put
implement the logic in the servlets for both returning json and handling things like post put etc...

8857492
setinterval	settimeout
what you need is a setinterval or a settimeout to trigger your code to call itself a certain number of milliseconds in the future incrementing the css property each time

8857514
width	height
s screen width and height

8857516
post	get
you also need to post the console message you get when the crash occurs

try putting a height and width and see if it acts the way you want

8857562
exponent	modulo
they re an rsa key meaning that those bytes must be of a certain form a modulo that is a semi-prime and an exponent

8857578
google-chrome	firefox
on a postback it returns the original position before a postback in google-chrome and firefox but not in ie9 -- same is true for a jscript solution from mahdi hasheminezhad

8857596
margin	height
this should do the trick make sure whatever the height of div is you make a margin at the bottom of the page so stuff doesn t hide there

8857688
screens	tablet
our jquery mobile based site will be used by large screens tablet and phones

8857689
geocoding	geocode
you can also cache geocode and addresses for performance purposes and have a back-up server side geocoding using google s web services

8857751
addclass	removeclass
as i attempt to removeclass addclass or toggleclass i fight with it for hours to no avail

8857781
inherited	properties
note that in the former process there is no conversion involved you have a type that you would like to treat as another say for example you have 3 different objects that inherited from a base type and you have a method that will take that base type at any point if you now the specific child type you can cast it to what it is and use all the specific methods and properties of that object and that will not create a new instance of the object

8857807
hide	show
when you click it it hide itself and show the other component which is a standard text field with an onblur behaviour that hide component 2 and show component 1 again

8857818
width	height
it s easy enough to calculate the top left value for each table as well as calculating the width and height

8857845
express	node.js
i have a node.js express app that i m hosting on nodejitsu

8857926
lxml.html	beautifulsoup
you ll be saving yourself lots of hassle and problems if you use an html parsing module like beautifulsoup or lxml.html

8857931
width	height
also-note i don t ever use image maps so i m not sure that getting their top left width height style properties is possible if not then you can just get the coords attribute and parse it into the proper information

8857985
maven	m2e	maven	pom.xml	m2e	pom.xml
as far as i can tell since this is a maven project my first my maven pom.xml is dictating along with m2e smarts my project build configuration and dependencies

8857994
int	boolean
if a.end is returning a boolean or an int 0 1 that represents if it is at the end of the list or not then a.beg might be returning a boolean or an int 0 1 specifying if it is at the beginning of the list or not

8858005
hide	show
every time you want to set up a new hide show sequence first call .stop on that element then attach your animations

8858005
fadein	fadeout	slideup	slidedown
one other thing to note is that it s easier to pair complementary animations slideup + slidedown or fadeout + fadein

8858048
opera	firefox	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
but there is a considerable lag choppiness when tested in firefox and opera works fine in google-chrome and safari

8858073
int	chars
assuming you give ch the type int because a chars cannot represent eof

8858082
everyauth	node.js
i m using an external node.js module everyauth to handle my linkedin api authentication

8858092
hide	show
i can already make it display but when i click on another radio button it show one but doesn t hide the other..

8858110
perl	tcl
only possible and crude way i can think of is to break the huge number into smaller chunk perform your math and join them again or better yet use perl php tcl bsh etc scripting languages that are more powerful than awk

8858126
width	height
your chart clip must fit on a page a4 dimension in pixels should fit in width 559 x height 842

8858126
width	height
to scale a movielclip you can use scalex or scaley but changing the width or height of the container works better for me because pixel values are easier then calculating the scale

8858127
int	double
the conversion may be representation changing like int to double or it might be representation preserving like string to object

8858149
hide	fadeout
alternatively you can use hide instead of fadeout if you would like them to hide immediately

8858351
min	max
i was also confused about how grouplayout.default_size and grouplayout.preferred_size are used in grouplayout.sequentialgroup.addcomponent component c int min int pref int max even after referencing the grouplayout section of the java tutorials and a java.net article titled getting to know grouplayout part 1

8858351
min	max
any other negative value for min pref and max besides default_size or preferred_size are errors and hit asserts

8858351
min	max
the interplay between the sequentialgroup.addcomponent min pref and max sizes wasn t immediately apparent to me from the tutorial

8858360
spaces	delimiter
i am trying to read words and numbers from a spaces and tab delimiter text file

8858362
youtube	vimeo
if not - how would i do this by uploading video to youtube or vimeo

8858363
post	get
however when i try to post comments to the user s wall i get a http 404 error

8858386
pthreads	epoll
epoll 7 summarizes it succinctly epoll scales well to large numbers of watched file descriptors. however poll is a pthreads standard interface so use that when portability is required

8858389
jasmine	qunit
chutzpah runs jasmine or qunit tests in the headless phantomjs browser from the command line

8858395
strncmp	strcmp
you need to use strcmp or strncmp to do that

8858395
fgets	strtok
editorial - you really do probably want to use fgets and strtok or one of its relatives to work through this stuff

8858405
google-chrome	safari
-webkit-calc available in the google-chrome 19 dev build should be available in the next safari

8858420
opera	safari
current solution involves using silverlight and i wish to go plain-js on modern browsers safari mobile safari ios ie 9 opera 11 etc

8858430
oncreate	setcontentview
this should be used with setcontentview r.layout.menu in oncreate

8858495
folder	directory
open a command window and change directory cd to the phonegap-android folder

8858502
google-chrome	firefox
for me on google-chrome and firefox the scrollable div .mid-col-main only becomes scrollable upon resizing the window maximize drag from corner etc

8858547
cvs	svn
it would appear that the days of centralized revision control systems such as cvs and svn are numbered and the overhead of running them seems especially unjustified for a small group or short term project

8858547
cvs	svn
it s fairly easy to setup one server to act as an authoritative repository if you would like to mimic how cvs and svn work

8858571
post	put	post	get	put	get
when for your resource the api always returns the full object event on post put so that when you create a new object you can get the created id on the same request

8858580
portrait	landscape
but when i rotate from portrait to landscape it seems to maintain the same width at least until i touch the screen

8858580
portrait	landscape
after rotating from portrait to landscape

8858583
width	height
how can i get the width and height of the current instance of carrierwave

8858583
width	height
i need to specify the width and height of the images it is required on the jquery plugin i m using

8858592
libevent	epoll
in terms of portability - as epoll is linux-specific i would suggest checking out libev and libevent libraries

8858638
ddms	hprof
you can click dump hprof file under devices tab in ddms and get info graphical charts of your heap information

8858654
put	get
first thing i would try is put a try catch block around it and try to get a clue about any possible error code

8858662
oncreate	setcontentview
you have forgotten to call the setcontentview in your oncreate method so your listview is not referenced yet

8858666
apache	nginx
your choice of webserver apache nginx etc do not affect them

8858683
integer	unsigned
lets say i have 1300 seconds in a unsigned integer i would like to take the current date and time subtract 1 300 seconds from it and end up with

8858704
subtract	add
hence to subtract 1300 seconds you need to add -1300 seconds

8858754
x86	64bit
as an example the platform might not support 64bit cas for x86 that was added with the first pentium iirc so it would not be availible when compiling 486 compatible

8858778
memcpy	memset
when debugging i frequently stepped into the handwritten assembly implementation of memcpy and memset

8858799
hash	salt
for privacy reasons you shouldn t send the mac address itself to your server but a hash of it preferably with some salt

8858809
stdout	stderr
when tracking down the close-on-exec details for ikegami s curiosity i think i found that all you need to do is close stdin stdout and stderr yourself if you are simply executing another process

8858811
kerberos	ldap
with ldap nfs and hadoop all supporting kerberos you should look at this solution

8858814
nsstring	nsjsonserialization
is it possible if i have a nsstring and i want to use nsjsonserialization

8858878
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome has a very nice one and firefox has firebug last incarnations of ie are also quite decent

8858893
g++	gcc
statement-expressions are a gcc g++ extension to avoid repeated evaluation of macro arguments

8858893
g++	gcc
and typeof is a gcc g++ extension also.

8858895
std	ostream
the std ostream objects all have overloaded functions

8858895
std	ostream
can only work if it returns a std ostream class or something derived from it

8858909
post	get
because is all ready an input control and you make a post normally you can get the value by using the request.form in your case this parameter gets your value on code behind

8858916
nsdata	nsjsonserialization
note however that nsjsonserialization is ios5 only so you might be better off using a library like touchjson or jsonkit both of which let you work directly with strings anyway saving you the step of converting to nsdata

8858919
nsstring	nsdata
you need to convert your nsstring to nsdata at that point you can use the method

8858946
spaces	delimiter
what i need to do is automate the task of writing to a new text file that is comma delimiter instead of spaces delimiter extract a few columns from existing data reorder the columns

8859025
mouseleave	mouseenter
note that the .css method accepts a map of multiple properties so you can set them all with a single call - i ve shown that syntax in the mouseenter but not the mouseleave so that you can compare

8859030
width	height
the flowdocument model based on frameworkcontentelement not frameworkelement does not inherit such goodness as visibility height and width settings

8859053
cpu	processors
not only is it more expensive in terms of developer costs designing a cpu is vastly more difficult than writing user-space assembly code but it would increase the transistor count of the processors

8859053
memcpy	memmove
basically the glibc folks say that memcpy behaves exactly as advertised in the standard and some other folks are complaining that memcpy should be aliased to memmove

8859069
xmlhttprequest	jqxhr
no you don t you can use any format you wish except for binary since it comes back as textual data available in jqxhr which is a superset of xmlhttprequest so you can retrieve its response.responsetext property

8859120
ssl	https
what applies to signing also applies to encryption if the middle party the user isn t meant to see what s in the saml message and or if the connection between the user and the sp or idp isn t over ssl tls usually it should be over https

8859146
dictionary	map
what about an object which is used as a map dictionary for certain data types what about a two-dimensional array where the first element of an array defines other data then the rest etc

8859150
ubuntu	linux
i was attempting to setup git-daemon i m on a linux ubuntu setup but i am not having much luck

8859171
google-chrome	firefox
or google-chrome and firefox because they have bigger market share together

8859189
google-chrome	firefox
i know the support for this even is patchy but right now it d only be used as a google-chrome extension firefox to come soon after so i d have to tinker with it so it should be okay for now

8859235
getter	setter
think of them as a related pair of getter and setter methods for subscripted elements

8859266
maven	pom.xml
i already asked the opposite question but now i m growing fond of maven and would like to set compiler warnings in my pom.xml that are actually mapped to the eclipse project enabling eclipse to mark wrong lines with warnings

8859269
nsstring	nsdata
first you will need to convert your nsstring to nsdata by doing the following

8859277
width	height
you can change the width of the window and scroll the lower itemscontrols surrounding scrollviewer both horizontally and vertically -- but as soon as you change the height of the window the layout will flip for several seconds

8859282
oncreate	setcontentview
1 you forgot to call the setcontentview method in your oncreate method

8859282
oncreate	setcontentview
since you d see an error in eclipse if the id was bad the most likely cause is that you forgot to call the setcontentview r.layout.some_layout_xml_file in the oncreate method of your activity

8859322
uiview	calayer
what s not apparent on the surface is that uiview does implement calayer s delegate drawlayer incontext

8859332
mp3	ogg
of those three ogg would usually be smaller than mp3

8859338
ubuntu	debian
on debian or ubuntu you could create your own service script by copying etc init.d skeleton into your etc init.d iccubedaemon and edit that file appropriately then symlinking it as etc rc2.d s99iccubedaemon etc.

8859345
post	get
this is typically just a matter of sending some parameter in get request arguments or post data but it could be more complicated

8859355
width	height
use your bitmap width and height to set up the new rects

8859381
getter	setter
i figured i could write some standard routine that has a setter getter that you always use to set get client variables

8859390
mp3	wav	mp3	ogg	wav	ogg
wav files are very large and ogg is regrettably not supported universally so mp3 is probably your best bet

8859393
uiview	calayer
it will show you how to use calayer with uiview to create the pinch zoom effect

8859407
powerpc	i386
i have successfully built sdl framework for powerpc i386 and x86_64 using the following diff

8859408
serializable	deserialization
you could wrap this serializable deserialization in a cfc that you house in the application scope as you suggest above

8859432
put	get
you re calling a webservice to get some info in essence and no apple does not put any restriction on this

8859472
memcpy	memset
in embedded systems it s common to have specialized hardware that does memcpy memset

8859475
httpwebrequest	networkcredentials
i tried to perform a post using a httpwebrequest instance to a web url that requires an authentication an asp.net mv3 standart decorated action method with build-in membership system but providing login and passowrd as networkcredentials in httpwebrequest didn t do the trick

8859477
profiling	instrumentation
run your code through instrumentation start with time profiling

8859486
globalization	localization
these analyses support a novel form of lightweight closure conversion that eliminates most closure slots using techniques such as variable globalization and localization compresses the static backchain and usually eliminates most closures from programs

8859499
getter	setter
you can do this by defining getter setter methods instead of closures

8859503
kerberos	ntlm
among others this includes basic and digest http auth ntlm and kerberos

8859526
inherited	properties
i have a couple of issues with ef 4.2 and the fluent api with code first design approach and base class properties inherited table per concrete type .

8859621
ssl	https
the https connection as always if configured with suitable cipher suites and if the client verifies the server certificate properly will protect the communication and will prevent replays of the http request since the actual http request won t be visible and since another client wouldn t be able to replay the exact same content because it would have a different ssl session id

8859623
hide	show
i can t help but feel that this is all a horrible and unneccesary hack though and you d be better off hiding the scrollbars and implementing them yourself using the delegate methods to determine when to show and hide your custom scrollbar view and the contentoffset property to determine where to position it

8859631
avr	microcontroller
the program is compiled with avr studio 4.18 under windows 7 targeting an atmega 32 microcontroller

8859652
width	height
modified your height and width feel free to change these as you please

8859677
width	height
you must add display inline-block in the element and include the css unit px when setting the width and height

8859688
width	height
instead it looks like the zoom in function only affects the img tags on the page so i d say that probably they are just dynamically modifying the width and height attributes for those tags

8859688
width	height
increasing the width and height of the container div

8859740
packets	pcap	lte	traffic
i m analyzing the tcp traffic behavior in lte network and need to find out those tcp fast retransmission packets in a large pcap file

8859759
superclass	subclassing
main would still need to assign to test using the right subclassing but test itself would be declared to be the common superclass

8859822
rar	zip
i ve created two identical binary files and compressed them using zip bz2 rar and 7z

8859825
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
this was working in firefox but google-chrome safari seems to bunch all the elements on the right side of the screen on load and then animate right to left

8859840
for-loop	arrays
when generating a jlabel in an arrays you use the for-loop and say

8859841
uiview	subviews
in order to be more efficient with regards to memory usage and to get smoother scrolling performance you should create a custom uitableviewcell subclass which contains a custom uiview as subviews of the uitableviewcell s contentview

8859897
imei	udid
the udid used to be sha1 serialnumber + imei + wifiaddress + bluetoothaddress

8859905
feof	fread
additionally it seems like this behavior propagates itself into higher-level apis such as fread and feof in c -- and creates a lot of confusion about how to use feof correctly

8859908
google-chrome	safari
on google-chrome safari and internet explorer they re both the proper 15 pixels tall

8859916
onfling	gestures
the gestures recognition went well it toast the right result but the gestures detection onfling won t show the result it won t appear whether in the textview or in the logcat

8859932
multiplying	multiplication
the basic secuential multiplication algorithm takes o 1 space since it multiplying and sum one element at a time

8859969
mouse	keyboard
however any mouse move before a keyboard entry destroys the font settings

8859989
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
it works well in google-chrome and safari however it doesn t work in firefox

8859990
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
this is working in firefox google-chrome safari and ie 6 7

8860021
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
viewwillappear and viewdidappear will be called when the view controller becomes visible

8860030
children	parent
the idea that i am trying to do is have a parent record which can have children records without having another table with a foreign key relationship between them

8860077
button	checkbox
i am using a jquery plugin for styling html checkbox radio button

8860098
hash	md5
although md5 is probably safe enough for this purpose i would still try and avoid the use of this broken hash - just keep with sha1 or move to sha-256

8860112
min	max
take the rectangle defined by the min x y and max x y values complexity o 1 as the values will be at known locations in the sorted dataset

8860134
ember.js	sproutcore
in most ember.js and sproutcore apps and examples i have seen controllers are instantiated at app initialization

8860145
width	height
1st parameter is the image path 2nd is the width and then the height .

8860145
width	height
height and width are optional

8860160
hide	show
deciding whether to leave elements in the dom and hide show them or to create destroy elements on demand depends on the usage patterns of the app

8860160
hide	show
if you expect the user to move quickly back and forth between views hide show can make sense

8860165
filtering	grouping
and simply filtering them as you display the grouping

8860194
spaces	delimiter
that is because the used with cin will only capture the hello phrase and will stop at the first delimiter in this case a spaces

8860232
put	get
they have strictly defined the x12 documents and will be responsible for all of the get put s to an ftp site

8860383
unicode	ucs
i guess the codepoints of ucs and unicode are the same am i right

8860383
unicode	ucs
in that case why do we need two standards ucs and unicode

8860395
devise	cancan
i m using devise 1.5.3 cancan 1.6.7 and rails 3.1.1

8860396
width	height
the resolution height and width returned by screen includes the full multi-monitor sizes combined width and length of the displayer buffer used to render multi-monitor setup

8860396
width	height
i ve not check of the mm millimeter width height calls returns the actual physical sizes but if it report combined physical sizes then the dpi computed from dividing one with another would be meaningless to draw a box on screen that can be measured using a physical ruler

8860469
unicode	ucs
from the wikipedia entry about the differences between unicode and iso 10646 ucs

8860489
hide	show
once the user checks-in i want to hide the check-in link and only show up check-out link.

i am trying to capture an image of a uiview with renderincontex but it does not fully capture all of the subviews

8860510
spaces	delimiter
uses split to separate the string into smaller text chunks using a spaces character as a delimiter

8860524
implements	extends
otherwise you will need to implements your own remove method and have you custom adapter extends baseadapter

8860541
integer	unsigned
it is a classical symptom of overflow - for example a 64 bit integer or a unsigned 32 bit integer assigned to a 32 bit signed integer

8860577
hide	show
in ie you ll just get a straight hide show effect but in all other modern browsers css opacity fades will be smoother and faster

8860600
innodb	myisam
so the storage engine of the initially created table was myisam but the tables created by django were having storage engine innodb

8860600
innodb	myisam
this link helped me to find out what was the storage engine for my table and then i changed the myisam engine to innodb using the belwo given command and it is working fine

8860626
innodb	myisam
the older tables were created using phpmyadmin and the storage engine type for the table was of myisam however the new tables created my django had a storage type of innodb

8860663
valgrind	callgrind
analyze your code with callgrind part of the valgrind suite

8860679
bellman-ford	dijkstra
it is wired you specified to use backtracking algoritm in fact dijkstra spfa or bellman-ford algorithm will be perfect to solve your problem

8860722
google-chrome	firefox
it s a css transitions framework and although i don t do ios development lea verou mentions that she test it on firefox and google-chrome for ios

8860798
folder	directory
it s easy to setup just drop the min directory in your root folder then go to to add files to the minify url

8860800
width	height
the page s height width and so on are all databound like so

8860810
chown	chmod
try changing the script s owner with the chmod command or give the file you re trying to run more liberal access permissions with the chown command

8860859
ant	maven
it would require writing proper plugins for preprocessing files before compilation phase for ant maven build and a plugin to ide

8860862
superclass	subclassing
whenever you instantiate the subclassing the superclass constructor must be called before the execution of subclassing constructor

8860866
post	get
there s which when run in sapi mode will always contain the method of the http request get post delete head etc..

8860872
stdout	stderr
most probably stdout will be printed after stderr

8860872
stdout	stderr
now stdout will be printed synchronously just as stderr is and the resulting order of printed strings should be the intuitive one

8860872
stdout	fflush	stdout	stderr	stderr	fflush
first piece of data written to stderr causes stdout to fflush

8860882
int	double
however i am solving a slightly different problem where the constraint is the budget price in double not int

8860882
int	double
double is continuous unlike int where i can have 1 2 3 ..

8864891
width	height	children	parent
an additional side effect of absolute positioning is that the height of the parent element will be uneffected by the height or position of those absolute elements so if those elements are the only children of that #membership div it must have a declared height and width in order to take up real space in your layout

8864895

getter	setter
three20 does this within property setter and getter to work around a faulty program flow

when i detect the keyboard s presence i enable it and resize it to the views s width and the view s height + the keyboard size

8865390

note that the offsets are zero-based so if you want the first bit to be bit 1 you ll need to add subtract 1 yourself

but if you install nvidia or amd ati propriatary drivers it will be those who implement opengl on your system

8865739
hide	show
i also currently have some jquery that makes it so when you click on one of the tags_list filter button it toggles any story_list element to hide or show depending on whether or not the tags_list button is selected or not

8865739

but when you have tag_ui activated then you also click tag_database what happens is that story_li element but those two will show up and those two will hide

8865739

8865813
inherited	properties
the properties dataobjectname and dataobjectdate are already available in the new class because they are automatically inherited from the base class

8865819
width	height
you aren t setting the width and height on the element itself which means it will scale your lines in funny ways depending how what you ve set in your css

8865836
src	attr
the only problem it seems to have is that while using .ajax on success part the src attr or anything else really like .css applies for one the first time only

8865837
invokelater	invokeandwait
your main method must be wrapped into invokelater or invokeandwait that s basic swing rule to create swing gui on eventdispashthread

8865851

so basically it seems to boil down to the associated element with the rel attribute matching the filter being clicked on toggling between hide and show

8865903
put	get
is the user only put in as dependency to get something from it

8865913
post	get

8865915
postgresql	mysql
i was having issues migrating databases with mysql and decided to blow the whole thing out of the water and use postgresql

8866038
int	boolean
int32 vs int is a similar situation as is boolean vs

8866044

to do that you just have to leave away the visibility keyword public or protected

8866090
getter	setter
the state consists of a lot of information and then i need to have their getter and setter so that other threads can update the state

8866105
apache	nginx
apache probably not needed at all as nginx serves the file to the cdn and then the cdn takes over

8866108
width	height
the width and height parameters do not affect the actual width and height of the object

8866108
width	height
they affect the display width and height

8866108
width	height
this means that you can set the width and height to smaller than the contents and the contents will still be accessible when scrolling if they are bigger than the container

8866108
width	height
the children s sizes are unaffected unless their width height is based upon that of this view

8866108
portrait	landscape
if not you will want a layout file for portrait the current one and then an adjusted one for landscape mode

8866125
int	boolean
thomas proposed an int based solution that is identical to the one i have above except that it uses a trick by multiplying boolean values

8866126
post	get
you will need to get an application access token to post as an application

8866148
ceil	floor
in the end try to check all of the integer solutions - try to round each value to floor or ceil

8866190
post	get
i get the impression that with the use of pubsubhubbub although servers might not have to poll each other because subscribers also run servers hubs can post to browsers have to poll with ajax in the usual way or use comet or websockets

8866201
portrait	landscape
for example it s possible to rotate app between portrait and landscape but if you tap a text field in portrait you can t rotate to landscape until your done editing

8866217

and it will have the normally controlled and read width and height

8866247

how can i layer one of the qpaintdevice classes qwidget qpixmap qimage etc. directly above and with the same size as the qlabel for painting

8866315
uiview	calayer

8866331
put	get
and put you link in a and use the same function on the next page and access the value you have put in to get information about the photo and display it

post	get
when users comment using the facebook plugin on the website how do i get these post to post directly to my facebook page for the company instead of my profile page

int	chars
this would also allow you to use a chars for the chars rather than int

8866506
rss	feed

8866680
hide	show
i have the following jquery code that hide and show a label when user interacts with text box

8866691
stdout	stderr
stderr of the child should go to a different logfile but also to stdout of the parent

all output from the child should end up merged on stdout like with so i can reserve stderr for log messages from the wrapper itself

8866741

dbcontext	objectcontext
to change the entitystate you need to get to the objectcontext of your dbcontext like shown in this thread entity framework code first - no detach method on dbcontext

8866808
button	checkbox
the ui components such as button checkbox listviews and so on serve very different purposes and it is not the place of an activity in it s basic form to know what events those ui elements react to click long-click swipe etc simply because there is no pre-defined set of ui elements that an activity will always host

8867025
sse	avx2
sse avx2 has no 64 x 64-bit integer multiply

8867025
sse	avx
definitely not with sse or avx

8867025
sse	avx
if you expect sse avx to be able to speed up some existing bignum code without fundamental changes to the representation and or data layout that s not likely to happen

8867029
metaclass	subclassing
i have a weird and unusual use case for metaclass where i d like to change the __metaclass__ of a base class after it s been defined so that its subclassing will automatically use the new __metaclass__

8867169
range	minimum
as you know the minimum 0.0 and maximum 1.0 you only need to store the upper-bound of the range and enum value

8867209
public	protected
often you ll see this as a public get and a protected or private set

8867216
min	max
javascript also has built in max and min functions

these can be extended to get max and min values in arrays vectors

8867216
min	max

8867275
for-loop	while-loop
the contrasting capabilities of while-loops and for-loops can be seen in the example of the collatz conjecture where the while-loop cannot be easily replaced with a for-loop

8867281
post	get
you are clearly specifying that you re sending data using get in java but you re reading post data in php

i have used xmovewindow with desktopwidth - width 2 desktopheight - height 2 and it is roughly in the right place

both bundler and rvm are tools that is not absolutly necessary to use but they will help you

8869233

depending on your version of vs you will use wsdl.exe or svcutil.exe from the command line to generate a proxy from a wsdl file on your local system

8870008

one advantage of mmap over malloc i can think of is that memory is immediately returned to the os when you do munmap whereas with malloc free i guess memory uptil the data segment break point is never returned but kept for reusage

8870032
punctuation	words
i need to split a phrase into words digits punctuation marks and spaces tabs

inner height 46 inner width 186

8870125
width	height
height 46 width 186

8870125
width	height
css height 46px css width 186px

8870166
floating-point	integer
if numerator and denominator are numbers that can t be exactly represented in floating-point 0.3 and 0.1 then the result might not be an exact integer it might be 3.0000001 instead of 3

8870193
min	max
what i try to to is generate an array of random int values where the random values are taken between a min and a max

8870194

8870219
websphere	ibm
we are doing xml to copybook and vice versa conversions in a middleware system using ibm websphere transformation extender

the salt you use to hash the password is stored in the resulting hash - this means there is no need to store it in the database as it can be recovered from the hash

8870268
stdout	stderr
according to the android documentation stdout stderr output to dev null

8870268
stdout	stderr
by default the android system sends stdout and stderr system.out and system.err output to dev null

8870268
stdout	stderr
in this case the system writes the messages to the log using the log tags stdout and stderr both with priority i

8870278
fflush	gets
this create a memory leak for the one androidbuf stream which is however somewhat intentional the stream may be written to after main is exited and it is fflush when when std cout gets destroyed

8870287
google-chrome	firefox
basically flash does not send your cookies or sends ie cookies on firefox and google-chrome etc. so your sessionid is not sent with your upload.aspx request in those browsers

8870319
hash	salt
if all the passwords are hash using a common salt then the attacker can easily find people using common passwords

8870319
hash	salt
on the other hand if every password has its own salt and there are 1 million passwords in the database an attacker must calculate 1 million hash in order to check just one password so it s much more secure

8870604
mathml	tex
however fricas can export the output only as tex fortran mathml html texmacs

8870631
xml-conduit	hxt
if you want to do this for formatting purposes then i would suggest parsing the mathml with an xml parser such as xml-conduit or hxt and processing that instead

8870631
mathml	tex
the main problem you ll run into is that both tex and mathml are going to be describing the appearance of the formula rather than its semantics

8870652
google-chrome	firefox
i m trying to do a userscript for google-chrome and greasemonkey in firefox

8870652
google-chrome	firefox

8871107
maven	pom.xml
you can use github as a maven repository --this is not the same thing as directly referencing a project and that it has a pom.xml file means only that it s a maven project

8871109
post	get
the result i get as a response is not identical to the stream i see as a facebbok user many post are missing - on facebook page in the news feed i can see much more post than i get back in the response

8871129
post	get
not sure if i understand the question but if the problem is that the form data can come in either as a post or get the solution is to check whether the post data is there

8871129
post	get
if it is use post otherwise take the data from get

8871129
post	get
if the function should do different things depending on whether the form has been sent as post or get then simply make two different functions in the controller

8871152
post	get
this way the server will instruct the client to send a brand new get request on the given resource instead of using the given resource as response for the current post request as will happen with a forward

8871202
rspec	capybara
make them a part of your end-to-end tests preferably using cucumber or rspec capybara

implements	extends
t must extends fragment and implements someinterface

8871538
implements	extends
that would require an object of type t to both extends fragment and implements someinterface

i use sin cos tan but the problem is that since sin cos tan only returns an angle that is always the right side my objects never move to the left side..

8871624
bash	zsh
in your script you re using bash to run a zsh script

8871624

getter	setter
how does the setter and getter in c# implement encapsulation

8871757
getter	setter
i am not new when it comes to these setter and getter i have background with programming specifically java

8871757
getter	setter
in java you use setter and getter like this

8871757
getter	setter
how does the c# shorthand getter and setter implement encapsulation on this

8871763
rsa	dsa
generate a new dsa key with ssh-keygen -t dsa if you just have an rsa

8871808
getter	setter
the difference here is that in java getter and setter are simply methods that follow a certain convention getxxx setxxx

8871808
getter	setter
in c# properties are a first-class construct even though they are basically getter and setter behind the scenes

8871808
getter	setter
so c# provides these as a shorthand way of saying you might implement encapsulation later add behavior to the getter or setter but you don t want to break consumers of your class so you are declaring them as properties up front

8871810
getter	setter
in comparision to java where getter setter are simply methods this construct is called a property in c# and is a compiler feature

vbo	vao
first off vao only remembers the last vertex attribute bindings and vbo binding for an index buffer the gl_element_array_buffer_binding if there is one

8872464
vbo	vao
to answer the second part of your question you either can have different vaos and vbos for different parts of the mesh so drawing separate parts is easy or you can fuse all into one vao vbo pair so you need not call often and use multiple calls to draw individual parts of the mesh as seen in the code above - imagine the first gldrawelements draws the ship and the second draws the turret you just update some matrix uniform between the calls

8872473

8872792
accessor	properties
in simple terms they are referred as properties accessor

8872792
accessor	properties
the code block in the get accessor is executed when the properties is read

8872792
accessor	properties
the code block in the set accessor is executed when the properties is assigned a new value

8872792
accessor	properties
the get accessor is invoked to read the value of properties i.e the compiler tries to read the value of string name

8872792
accessor	properties
the set accessor assigns the value stack to the name properties i.e stack is stored in the string name

hide	show
you create a jquery object for the hover elements with and then use .find on it to search the children objects for the desired objects to hide show

8873020
for-loop	arrays
.each is an internal iterator and i m pretty sure the for-loop will run slower than the enumerable each method that arrays inherit

8873056

post	put
to keep my api rest-ful i left in the normal handling of put and delete and added this to the post handling

8873152
post	put
it keeps the request method as post and sends the x-http-method-override as put or delete

8873170
put	get
my plan is whenever a get fails the caller then constructs the correct value for the key does a put which does locking relative to other puts and stuffs an object into the array

as i supposed in the first place there is a different rounding from double to int when it comes to sum and subtraction

8873435
versioning	upgrade
note 1 from experiences like this i have learned to pick my gems carefully rating how popular a gem is as a pretty good idea of how mainstream and thus how likely to be upgrade for both ruby and rails versioning

bash	zsh
both bash and zsh are derived from the bourne shell whose behavior is standardized by posix so any script designed to work with bin sh is likely to work with either bash or zsh

8873878
bash	zsh
but if you re going to be using both zsh and bash it probably makes a lot more sense to have separate .bashrc and .zshrc files and use each one only with the shell for which it s designed

8873882

otherwise it adds in fill_parent for both the layout width and height when attaching to the window and forces the view to fill the content space

8876409
width	height
you will see the edittext drop down to a more normal size and your adjustments on height width will actually start to take effect

8876421
getter	setter
and i was wondering what is a virtual method call and what does it mean when it says locally using a getter setter

8876427
client-side	server-side
the biggest thing that should be considered about client-side vs server-side templating is that client-side templating will not work if javascript is disabled on the client for whatever reasons

8876431
portrait	landscape
this is example of only landscape orientation in ipad and portrait in iphone.

8876448
portrait	landscape
by checking the condition whether the current orientation is landscape or portrait you can set the frame of labels accordingly

8876494
getter	setter
using getter and setter is more expensive because first the vm will lookup the method from a virtual method table and then make the call

8876496
punctuation	words
from there i have the conundrum of generic words as well as proper nouns following punctuation

8876526
implements	extends
earlier in mx datagrid this can be achieved by extends the mxdatagriditemrenderer which implements idropinlistitemrenderer and hence datagridlistdata property is available

getter	setter
what the article is basically saying is to avoid the getter setter patten when you can get away with it

8876540
implements	modifiers
in java all methods are virtual that aren t marked with the private or final modifiers so they are saying that if your code isn t interface to be implements by other classes just access the fields directly

8876540
getter	setter
most likely the reason they point this out is because traditionally the java recommendation has been to always use the getter setter pattern so that your variables can be kept private

8876540
getter	setter
if you re creating an api that other classes will implement then maybe it s worth it to take the performance hit of getter setter

8876540
getter	setter
external classes accessing your class will also experience the same performance gain by accessing the variable directly but at some point you need to do a performance-to-maintainability assessment to see if you are comfortable making those variables public or if it s worth it to take the hit and use getter setter methods

8876591
getter	setter
create property in you action class with same name as the form fields name and provide there getter and setter

8876599
getter	setter
you would need to use details getaddress if you had a setter getter property declared or details.address to access address in the details class

8876608
rational-numbers	fractions
i suggest this instead of the more intuitive approach because if you re setting a homework for fractions it s probably for an elementary middle school class and you might not want any arbitrary rational-numbers that the obvious approach might throw up which probably might be a bit too much depending on the level

8876633
folder	directory
i forgot there were a number of file and directory i didn t want added such as my _resharper directory and the contents of my bin folder

sequence	permutation
there are many ways to systematically generate all permutation of a given sequence citation needed

8879437
sequence	permutation
to use it one starts by sorting the sequence in weakly increasing order which gives its lexicographically minimal permutation and then repeats advancing to the next permutation as long as one is found

8879437
sequence	permutation
after step 1 one knows that all of the elements strictly after position k form a weakly decreasing sequence so no permutation of these elements will make it advance in lexicographic order

8879437
sequence	permutation
reversing this sequence in step 4 then produces its lexicographically minimal permutation and the lexicographic successor of the initial state for the whole sequence

8879469

you can get height and width of imageview by using getwidth and getheight through while this will not give you the exact width and height of the image for getting the image width height first you need to get the drawable as background then convert drawable to bitmapdrawable to get the image as bitmap from that you can get the width and height like here

8881780
width	height
make sure your layout s root node has width and height set to wrap_content

8881780
width	height
next add another layout to your root node framelayout would probably work with a custom drawable for a background or use the one that the default dialog uses from the framework and width and height set to fill_parent or match_parent

8881780
width	height
the problem here is that the phony background needs to have width and height set to relative to the other ui elements so it sort of has to encompass them so it can properly measure its own width and height relative to them

you should use an html parser such as lxml.html or beautifulsoup

getter	setter
the problem here is that to enable domain class properties being automatically persistent without having to configure them fields must be properties they have to have a public getter setter pair of the same type

8882500
getter	setter
groovy does this for you when you add a public field - it makes the field private and creates a public getter and setter

8882500
getter	setter
but if you have a getter or setter already it doesn t do that and if they re not both public then they re not considered a property in the javabean sense so the field isn t persistent

it works fine in firefox google-chrome iphone safari etc

8883328
put	get
options 2 put ids into sorted set then use mget to get values out if your keys are hashes then you need to issue multiple hget but the advantage is that you can pull out specific parts of the object that you actually need instead of everything

8883345
children	parent
but since you are not following good practices here and are directly passing your domain models to the view instead of using view models you will have a problem with the recursive relationship you have between the children and parent

8883345
children	parent
you might need to manually populate the parent for each children

8883345
children	parent
but a better way would be to query your database in the post action and fetch the children that are associated to the given parent since the user cannot edit the children inside the view anyway

8883381
mouseover	mouseout
if the events are in opposite order mouseover declared first then mouseout the toolbar will only get the mouseout listener

i can see one trade off of this method being the size of the application since including mylib.h would include the code for the encoder and decoder if the encoder and decoder were separate applications

8883535
width	height
since the height width is calculated on the visible viewport the soft keyboard apparently causes the orientation to flip now that the viewport width is less than the height

8883535
width	height
this makes it more flexible across devices regardless of orientation not to mention width height is more widely supported than orientation

portrait	landscape
the problem is when i click the back button the bar where the title of the carrier and time gets displayed remains landscape for views that is suppose to be portrait

8884857
width	height
one thing that is always true for absolutely positioned elements is that they will never add height or width to their parent element

8884857
margin	height
also keep in mind that using top or bottom can give you some confusing layout problems with regard to element height and how they push each other down or up in vertical space if you don t account for the increase decrease in positioning either with extra or negative as the case may be height or extra margin or padding for it s parent element

8884945
inherited	subclassing
the only reason for declaring instance variables in interface is to allow them to be inherited by a derived class subclassing

8884956

8885027
stdout	stderr
for some reason the output from wkhtmltopdf goes to stderr of the process and not stdout

8885027
stdout	stderr
on a side note if you spawn a process from java you must read from the stdout and stderr streams even if you do nothing with it because otherwise the stream buffer will fill and the process will hang and never return

8885027
stdout	stderr
to futureproof your code just in case the devs of wkhtmltopdf decide to write to stdout you can redirect stderr of the child process to stdout and read only one stream like this

8885085

8885533
post	put
hint you should clean up your code put the jquery mobile external and post your configuration here

8885564
prepare	execute
as stated in documentation escaping string is not necessary for prepare and execute statements

8885564
prepare	execute	prepare	pdostatement
calling pdo prepare and pdostatement execute for statements that will be issued multiple times with different parameter values optimizes the performance of your application by allowing the driver to negotiate client and or server side caching of the query plan and meta information and helps to prevent sql injection attacks by eliminating the need to manually quote the parameters

ubuntu	linux
however when compiling in linux ubuntu it crashes unless i remove the updating of the count out of the constructor

8885650
width	height
i don t really understand why there seems to be no width height at that earlier point

8885656
min	max
so sqrt is of course worse than custom random function might be better for you pi should be cached in loops min and max should probably be avoided as well no idea about trigonometry and logarithms speed

8885758
inline	inlining
the benefit of inlining a function is that the calling code need not to be created and any other optimization can be aplied to integrate both the caller function and the inline function

in firefox working perfect but in ie and opera dont working

8886014
integer	unsigned
i am trying to write a function in c++ which takes two 64 bit unsigned integers and returns their difference in a signed 64 bit integer

8886014
integer	unsigned
it seems to be a bit complicated because of the overflow situation - since the inputs are two unsigned positive integers if the absolute difference between these two is greater than maximum signed value int64_max then the difference cannot be transmitted through a signed integer

8886024
put	get
the feedback form definition lives in a file called feedback.admin.inc so i had to also put a to get it to appear

8886045
width	height
transform height and width the same way

8886094
width	height
every piece of ascii art is a different height and width so therefore it is important to note that the solution to my issue must involve not having a fixed height or width requirement

8886113
rss	feed
as stated in the other answer there are a number of rss feed

8886178
cos	sin
to specify a different angle first calculate cos î and sin î

8886293
inline	inlining
if i m going to inline for performance reasons i ll profile before inlining

8886303
folder	directory
very very important because asp.net 2.0 tries to dynamically compile any classes it finds under the app_code directory of an application at runtime you explictly do not want to store classes that you compile as part of your vs 2005 web application project under an app_code folder

8886320
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome on os x 10.7 64 bit the max string length is 17740 whereas firefox seems to handle the very large string with no problem

8886320
integer	unsigned
another problem i found is that the max message length that can be sent in websocket hybi-17 is 2 64-1 or max int in an unsigned 64 bit integer but javascript can t even handle numbers that large in its number format

8886327
width	height
if you really need the height and width you ll have to get them later as you ve discovered

8886343

uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
uitabbarcontroller and uinavigationcontroller are the main examples

8886634
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
uitabbarcontroller is good if you have several screens that you want to tab between uinavigationcontroller is good if you have a hierarchy of screens that the user can go back and forth between like a browser

8886638

the second transaction to put would get the exception

8886639
width	margin	width	height	margin	height
width and height in css apply to the content box inside the padding border margin

8886639
width	border-box	box-sizing	border-box
to overcome this you can either adjust the width accordingly or set the box-sizing property of css3 to border-box

8886639
width	margin
the margin property will still affect the total width however

8886641

while logged in type crontab -e which will bring up an editor with the current cron jobs for that user

8886826
hide	show
show and hide are not animations when they are not given a duration

8886826
hide	show
since show and hide are not being place on the animation queue delay is not delaying the hide causing it to immediately hide

8886826
hide	fadeout
you can either give hide a duration even 1 will do making it nearly instant but placing it on the animation queue to now be affected by delay or you will need to use settimeout or some other animation like fadeout

8886840
put	get
if you set the plus the above code you would get a window that has a complete custom drawn title area which you can put whatever you want into

8886910

8887062
post	get
the whole reason a user likes a page is to get wall post from them

8887066
getter	setter
since the base class contains a getter for this property you would be best to remove the field and setter method and just use the getter to access the authentication manager in your code

8887092
stdout	stderr
the resulting pdf output should be available in stdout and any other messages or stats in stderr

8887116
decoder	encoder
i m just focusing on the easiest of the values in my encoder decoder methods just to test it but i m not even able to get the string value to work

8887138

8887180
ant	maven
if none of these suggestions resonate with you i urge you to get into more detail about the tools you re using and what you consider the crap every build tool or language has it s own flavor and strategy ant maven make cmake gcc flex java perl python scones quake etc etc etc.. so without additional info it may be difficult to really come up with a good explanation of how to best resolve your issue

to manually install the latest version zend framework on ubuntu debian this is what i did after downloading zf and extracting it to temp

8887724
nfa	dfa
after that it can translate the nfa to a dfa

8887724
nfa	dfa
when i parse the rgex mentioned above the parser creates a nfa with 7 states - after conversion there are only 3 states left in the dfa

short of wrapping the entire site in a ssl protocol the only other option for this would be to have the pop-up form be an iframe that points to another page with the form that resides on an https connection

8888046
for-loop	loops
of much greater importance however than optimizing how your for-loop iterates loops and breaks is modifying what it does on each iteration

8888164
submit	submission
i want to block the form from submission to a different page.now if you hit enter it submit to a different page

8888177
setinterval	settimeout

the important part being e.preventdefault which prevents the form submission when it s submit event is triggered

8888230

8888508
uiscrollview	autoresizingmask
to your second question ymmv but in my experience uiscrollview doesn t seem to pay attention to the autoresizingmask attribute of its subviews so you wil have to manually keep your uibutton pinned towards the bottom of your uiscrollview as you change its size -- wherever you set the uiscrollview s contentsize is the spot to adjust your uibutton s frame

8888524
typedef	struct
because you have typedef that defines command_stream_t as pointer to struct that means your variable ptr is actually a pointer to a pointer to a struct

8888539
put	get
- i can t get the program to figure out where to put down the parentheses correctly and i can t get it to identify the beggining and end of the parentheses using a stack

8888543
typedef	struct
if you want your ptr to have the type then you should change your typedef from to typedef struct command_stream command_stream_t

on the other hand even if one of your or the libs object has the uiview as a subviews i think your uiviewcontroller will never viewdidunload and therefore never dealloc

8888710
spy++	sendmessage
i am using spy++ and see that the control i have has the decimal that matches the hex after conversion of course in spy++ and i see the parent window matches as well so i have the intptr for a label and intptr for the form window but my sendmessage is not working to change the text in the target application

8888710
post	get
another approach may be may be to do something like this post but what is the control id and how do i get that

the cryptcat package on ubuntu and debian provide a nc 1 -like functionality with twofish built in

8888938
width	height
thus when a container only has child elements which are float ed the container will not take the height or width of its children

8888938
width	height
to make this work intuitively meaning making the container take the width and height of its children you can either float the container or use one of the several methods for clearing floats

jboss	glassfish
i have been learning gwt and hibernate together for the last few weeks and wanted to throw up a demo on a local glassfish server that is what our web app server is going to be although if i cannot find the answer to this issue i may look into tomcat or jboss

8889510
folder	directory
here s some things to take into account - i am new to hibernate as well and am not sure if i have set up my persistence.xml file correctly - it is in the meta-inf folder in the root of my src directory

8889510
jar	war
also this only happens when i deploy to the server before i do that i use a google compile i jar up my src directory and add it into my war lib directory then run an ant script to war it all up then manually deploy it onto glassfish

8889510
jar	war
i then ran the jar.sh from a command line moved the new jar file into my war web-inf lib directory exported the whole project as a war file and launched it to glassfish and it actually worked

open the rss feed and feach url and open the html dom of the page then

8895940
width	height
well using javascript you can check the width height of web-browser webpage

8895940
width	height
and if you want your images or text to be rendered according to browser width height then you should define all width height parameters of your text image in percentage

this works perfectly fine in ie firefox opera and safari but fails in google-chrome

8896117
freebsd	linux	openbsd	linux	openbsd	freebsd
you could also have only one header file .h file but 6 different .a files one compiled for mac os x 64bit one for mac os x 32bit one for linux 2.6 64bit one for linux 2.6 32bit one for freebsd and the last for openbsd

int	boolean	int	double
this method uses java reflection apis to identify corresponding property setter method names and deals with setter arguments of type string boolean int long float and double

8896175
free	malloc
c does not decide anything if you have allocated something yourself with an explicit call to malloc it will stay allocated until you free it or until the program terminates typically

8896175
realloc	malloc
you shouldn t cast the return values of malloc and realloc in c

8896198
google-chrome	firefox
with google-chrome and firefox the update event is fired but with internet explorer ie9 it isn t

8896211
realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc	free	malloc	free	calloc	free	realloc	calloc	malloc
you have to free the memory you ve malloc calloc realloc ed when it s suitable to do so

8896257
post	put
or take the form data put it into a database and then call the database entries and create post from them

8896291

but inside this window a s group maincontainer2 exists and even if width and height is in percent the s group size is bigger that the new window measure

8896296
equals	gethashcode
override the equals method and gethashcode along the way to actually check for equality of all necessary fields or properties

8896303
std	ostream	ostream	istream
but how can std istream std ostream work then

8896317
glfw	freeglut
i want to upgrade my scientific 3d application from freeglut to glfw but i worried about hidden conflicts or loss of data actually my application works like a charm with freeglut and i don t have any problem but glfw is recommended for modern opengl 3.0+ in all modern books and tutorials

8896317
glut	glfw
i look at glfw api and it looks like glut with prefix but i m not exactly sure

8896367

i was thinking to use dateadd in combination with datepart but seems very error prone besides performance issues

8896714
width	height
i have an as3 app that loads swf s with various movie clips inside with a size of 1280 width and 720 height

8896714
width	height
i would like to fit these swfs into a content box of height 885 width by 500 height

8896714
width	height
this would be easy if as3 recognised the swf being 1280 height by 720 width

8896750
oncreate	onnewintent
onnewintent is meant as entry point for singletop activities which already run somewhere else in the stack and therefore can t call oncreate

8896752
mouseover	mousedown
im doing it by detecting mouseover and mousedown over the drop zone

8896775
typedef	struct
for your second question as enable_if defines a type or not if it is passed false a nested typedef inside a struct is really the way to go

8896778
plot	heatmap
is there any approximation using r to plot heatmap with his big data

8896790
trojan	virus
i found another reason psexec and other ps tools fail - if something ...say a virus or trojan hides the windows folder and or its files then psexec will fail with an access is denied error pslist will give the error processor performance object not found on and you ll be left in the dark as to the reason

8896808
google-chrome	firefox
you can try it in google-chrome or firefox

8896840
for-loop	loops
the quick answer is to use a for-loop in place of your foreach loops

8896894
rss	feed
my end game for what i m trying to accomplish is once i log into my account i wanted to parse some folders for information and store them in a file that can be later converted in to json or rss feed but this is much further down the road with a much better understanding of python just trying to give a more clear idea of what i want to accomplish

8896897
inherited	properties
from my experience it pays to think carefully about what the properties of the problem at hand really are as opposed to those of the implementation in the case of inherited does an is-a relationship exist throughout the hierarchy

8896929
ubuntu	linux
one pc with linux ubuntu 11.4 installed 192.168.1.12

8896965
width	height
it still knows my height and width because i set it in my css

8897070
deezer	rdio
for real world examples see deezer rdio and mog who all use this design pattern

8897074
int	chars
in the above piece of code the chars s is automatically converted to int while printing due to the int type in control string but in the second case the int to float conversion doesn t happen

8897102
mathml	mathjax
the goal is to have a mathml possibly mathjax rendered output for an equation

8897127
hive	hdfs
every night a tab-delimited uncompressed textfile dump from our oracle cluster is written to hdfs to be processed by hive

8897127
disk	ram
the cluster is 12 nodes 8 core with 24gb ram and 2tb disk each configured for 8 mappers 8 reducers 6 6 on the namenode

8897142
int	chars
the chars is not being promoted to int due to the control string

8897142
int	chars
the chars is working as an int because all data that is less than 4 bytes when passed to printf is bumped up to 4 bytes which is the size of an int because of the cdecl calling convention of variadic functions the point of this is so that the data that comes next will be aligned on a 4-byte boundary on the stack

8897151
uilabel	uitextview
i altered this to contain a very long string and replaced the uilabel type with a uitextview

8897166
redmine	gitolite
i have redmine setup and am using gitolite as the git repo manager

8897166
redmine	gitolite
the plugin doesn t make it obvious how this is supposed to work and to be honest i m not even sure if this is a problem with redmine not reading the repo correctly or at all or gitolite not communicating as redmine expects etc.

8897176
background-color	transparency
background-color transparency

8897180
xml-rpc	json-rpc
protocol with json or soap as compared to json-rpc or xml-rpc that

8897189
bindparam	bindvalue
can i sugeest you look at using pdo and consider using bindvalue over bindparam if you don t need to execute the query repeatedly

8897225
free	malloc
again it s not really leaking memory like a c malloc where you forget to free that section again

8897231
int	double
int promotion rules are applied on arguments of int types and float arguments are converted to double

8897231
int	chars
s is a chars and is converted to int

8897231
int	double
now the conversion specifier f expects a double but the type of the object after the default argument promotion is an int so it is undefined behavior

8897262
opera	firefox
reproducable on firefox 9 for windows and opera 11 for linux

8897278
rss	feed
but in our case the only change to the system is new nodes got added over the time by users and rss feed

8897289
width	height
i could not use the jquery visible selector as the element has a non-zero height and width

8897289
hide	show
this absolute position placement is the way my ajax framework implements the hide show of some widgets

8897309
lxml	beautifulsoup
okay so in the comments above you said that you didn t care about what js from a site might do to the dom- so to answer the first part of the question you need to parse the html using lxml beautifulsoup or one of the other dom-producing python html parsers

8897312
uilabel	uitextview
it s possible if you just swapped uitextview with uilabel that the frame is not large enough

8897343
glut	glfw
using gtk+ you should neither use free- glut nor glfw

8897397
chown	chmod
if that solves the issue then you know thats your issue and if you want you can then alter the permissions for best security chown it to the www-data user and chmod it to suit

these chars values are just 8-bit int numbers

8897537
dictionary	map
now i need to map this dictionary to a file that looks like this

8897537
dictionary	map
using the id from the mapped_seq_id dictionary i can now map sequences to functions

8897537
dictionary	map
the reason i am using dictionary here is because the is a final step where i will need to map seq to another file and use that to extract another piece of information in order to create a final file that looks like this

8897659
hide	show
i asked a similar question here where i wanted to get a single div to show hide rather than all the divs

8897661
versioning	upgrade
and another solution is to just upgrade foo to rails 3.1.x but i d like to understand what is going wrong here since it is likely we ll have apps running different versioning in the future

8897713
mockito	jmock
i am not familiar with mockito because i use jmock but the general approach of writing tests with mocks is the same

8897713
getter	setter
the easyest way would be adding a getter and setter to set that filed in the test

8897718
inherited	properties	public	protected
you do not see properties in the ide that you cannot get or set it would just be clutter so you normally just see public ones and if you inherited from some class you also get the protected members

8897753
x86	64bit
i run the program on 64bit windows choose release platform target any cpu and choose optimize code the options only matter if i explicitly target x86 the result is sadly 48 bytes per instance

8897763
hide	show
when setting the android targetsdkversion value to lower than 14 it seems to show the menu button but otherwise it hide it

8897763
hide	show
google decided that not only that but instead the switching button is more important to be show and it s show by default no idea if it s possible to hide it but i guess not since home button no longer does anything when long pressed

8897809
free	malloc
if you re using gcc or the gnu std c library the malloc and free hooks might help

8897867
maven	pom.xml
maven also adds to your class path the sub-dependencies of your main dependencies which are those specifically declared by you in the pom.xml

8898161
folder	directory
in this directory there is a folder for each language with the strings

8898204
vim	emacs
i m not sure if that s what you re looking for but as far as i know you can open edit save changes to .tar.gz files directly with vim and emacs and probably with other editors

8898237
bash	zsh
bash zsh replaces by a pipe kind of file having a name as dev fd n where n is the file descriptor number

8898237
bash	zsh
as you may know bash zsh also runs the command cat foo in another process

8898250
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
if you do not set you can receive data from other browsers google-chrome firefox opera etc

8898314
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
inherited works well when your subclassing have well defined behavioural differences from their superclass but you ll frequently hit a point where that model gets awkward or stops making sense

8898328
put	get
put the string in a resource-file my project resources and then get it with

8898335
bmp	png
that s great and all but we ve got a project that s stuck in d2005 and we need to do a simple conversion from png to bmp

8898336
xslt	xquery
sorting an xml file can generally be done in a few lines of xslt or xquery and invoking xslt or xquery only takes a few lines of java

8898351
spaces	delimiter
use string.split on a single spaces and use stringsplitoptions.removeemptyentries to make sure that multiple spaces are seen as only one delimiter

8898355
width	height
each ul has a variable number of li height and a fixed width

8898373
strsplit	substr
you can use strsplit to create an array of substr

8898710
hide	show
a hide show event trigger based on glenns ideea

8898710

8898908
hive	hdfs
so i have hdfs and hive working together

i need to duplicate various kinds of file types change them a bit so that the original s md5 hash won t match the modified one but keep them readable and not corrupted

8899203
docx	xlsx
java libraries for modifying office documents doc docx xls xlsx ppt pptx

8899203
hash	md5
there are still file types that i need to change there md5 hash output but i don t think they are modifiable in java - media files for example executables and etc.

8899203

note list of events should be like mouseover mouseout click etc and then name of event should be replaced with some logic to detect which of those list was triggered

8899293
docx	xlsx
java libraries for modifying office documents doc docx xls xlsx ppt pptx

8899293
docx	xlsx
note that newer formats xlsx docx etc. are simply zip files containing xml

8899305
google-chrome	safari
by the way i recommend you to test whether the column width is large enough to show the sorting icons in webkit browsers google-chrome or safari

8899308
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
since safari 5+ firefox 4+ and google-chrome support xhr file uploads the fileupload plugin can transfer the files truly asynchronously allowing for a pure text response from the server

8899324
submit	submission
so if you click it then you get the page for submission an update which looks exactly like the submit new app page

8899347
for-loop	loops
when closure semantics were introduced in c# 2.0 the choice was made to put loops variable outside loops consistent with the for-loop

8899354
min	max	width	height
try to set max min height and width

8899370
httprequest	httpresponse
putting these into httprequest and httpresponse during application_beginrequest smells a little but i am dealing with a componentspace saml 2 library that takes these types as method args

8899383
firefox	safari
in a web browser firefox safari .. the 5 seconds timer is now 8 seconds

8899490
atexit	main
the first call uses the direct call to the sub dtor in c and the second call is invoked after the end of main i believe by the atexit function

8899538
floating-point	integer
also the assignment of the floating-point result of sqrt to an integer variable looks suspect

8899561
google-chrome	safari
this caches fine in desktop safari while offline google-chrome etc

8899575
hide	show
i am assuming that toggle show and hide turns a element into a block element therefore disabling the capabilities to use colspan

8899575
hide	show
as soon as a toggle or do the show hide it no longer works

8899575
hide	show
is there a jquery method out there that will successfully show and hide a table row while mainting the table cell row

8899585
implements	extends
extends my_class or implements if my_class is abstract class

8899598
redhat	fedora
but on gnuplot 4.4. running on a linux box fedora redhat in my case here is what you can do

8899700
chunked	transfer-encoding
finally if you do get this working beware that you may need to dechunk decode the transfer-encoding chunked body the request input even though you didn t have to do this before

8899745
persistent	transient	onresume	onpause
onsaveinstancestate for transient data restored in oncreate onrestoreinstancestate onpause for persistent data restored in onresume

8899745
onresume	onpause
onpause and onresume are also complimentary methods

8899766
google-chrome	firefox
this code works fine in google-chrome and firefox but doesn t work in ie9

8899773
multiplying	transpose
numpy seems to be able to multiplying a 1 000 000x23 matrix by its transpose in under a second while the equivalent clojure code takes over six minutes

8899790
superclass	subclassing
the point is that you don t want logic in the superclass that is only applicable to some subclassing

8899890
bash	zsh
to this end how would you adapt the prompt sections in this example answer to work with zsh vs bash

8899927
children	parent
this will list all of the parent who have children

8899927
children	parent
parent w o children will not be displayed

8899927
children	parent
here are all parent regardless if there are children

8899927
children	parent
here s a recursive cte which will get all of the children for the parent no matter how many children there are

8899961
udp	tcp
calling udp unreliable is a simplification which tries to put tcp as a panacea of all network ills

8899961
udp	tcp
while it is true tcp has mechanisms to attempt to ensure data is transferred many of the faults that cause the failure of a udp packet to arrive will also cause tcp to fail

8899961
udp	tcp
for example a hardware network fault will have the same affect on udp and tcp packets

8899961
udp	tcp
if the fault persists then tcp will not get through as surely as udp

8899961
udp	tcp
if your data is transient for example a reading from a sensor it makes far more sense to use udp over tcp

8899980
folder	directory
basically i copied my video folder which contains all of the html for the video pages in assets to a new video_fire directory
