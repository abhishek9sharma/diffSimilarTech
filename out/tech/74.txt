free	malloc
you can not free a address that is not allocate by malloc it will cause a problem

11102128
integer	unsigned
by using a dword_ptr and not a dword64 there was probably an attempt by the original developers to ensure later programmers view the result as a unsigned hex sequence and not as a signed integer and furthermore this type results in sizing the mask appropriately see next paragraph

11102171
post	get
no rest web services are expected to follow an object pattern where a get request to www... company would return all the companies a post to www... company with some data would add a new company to a list db a delete would delete and so on

when you cast a utf16 chars to an int it merely copies the 16-bit utf16 chars value into the 32-bit int

11102291
hmac	md5
a minor thing but if you are looking for an equivalent to hmac key message then by default the python library will use the md5 algorithm so you need to use the hmacmd5 algorithm in java

11102329

int	chars
c# can cast a chars to an int and will give you the chars code.the code above is taking a string hashstring and turning it into an array of int keybuffer

11102356
int	chars
the code above will produce an array of int one per chars in the hash string and each int will be the chars code of the corresponding chars

11102362
int	chars
to expand on jon skeet s post your decimal int values will map to the corresponding chars values like in the chart below which i have had on my development pcs for years

11102362
int	chars
so casting the int value 0 to a chars will return a null

11102392
int	chars
the code actually cast the chars normally ascii into an int not 0 to 0

11103239
google-chrome	firefox
the below snippet is working fine in firefox google-chrome .but the jqgrid related libraries is not loading in ie there by its not allowing to make normal ajax call

superclass	subclassing
if the superclass is under your control you can refactor it and use the template method pattern to pull the object into the constructor instead of pusing it from the subclassing

11104498
inherited	properties
a look at the docs shows that get is inherited and returns object whereas getproperty is a member of properties and returns the string

once you have the repository cloned you can pull and push from to the central repository same as you would if you were using the command-line

11104685
button	checkbox
moreover since checkbox can be checked and unchecked independently it may be better to check their state only at the moment when the button is pressed instead of attempting to keep track of them all the time

11104692
button	checkbox
also you did not have this problem as each selection of the radio button overwrote the previous one but you will need to remove items from the set if their corresponding checkbox is unticked

this way you create a four-byte int out of alex then you store it in a chars -- of course it doesn t fit into a one-byte chars so only its less significant byte the x gets stored which is then output

11105630
persistent	transient
jpa s transient annotation prevents a serialized property from being persistent

this is supported in google-chrome 18 and firefox and webkit nightly builds

11106047

hash	hmac	hash	salt
hash bcrypt hmac userpassphrase pepper salt

11106087
hash	salt
hash bcrypt userpassphrase salt

11106087

11106266
addclass	removeclass
you should ideally use a class and addclass removeclass

11106273
superclass	subclassing
the only reason i can think of is when you want your subclassing to void serialization while the superclass is already serializable and then you can just simply throw exception there in both methods in your subclassing

11106281
versioning	upgrade
as a side note i upgrade 4 computers in my company to the new versioning of python and arcgis and only one of them is throwing this error

then in your code just hide show instead of actually moving stuff around

using findviewbyid in an activity searches in the layout xml file that was used in setcontentview in oncreate

11106777
serializable	deserialization
on a separate note if the objects you are serializing have references to non-serializable services you would first mark those members as transient to prevent serializable but then use the writeobject to capture enough information so that readobject can re-establish the references upon deserialization

11106783
gson	jackson
you should use json streaming either with gson or jackson

11106796

tbuttoncontrol which is what tcustomcheckbox inherited from has the properties clicksdisabled

11107512

11108958
gridview	sqldatasource
i have a gridview and sqldatasource

11108969

fyi i am running ubuntu linux

11110116
jlabel	jlayeredpane
so in the following code i created a jlayeredpane and a jlabel

11110116
width	height
probably a part of my previous questions answer the label had an initial height and width of 0 before setting bounds which might be the reason setbounds is important

11110145
getter	setter
+ standard getter setter as you would expect

11110166
google-chrome	safari
the api relies on the user using a browser which supports local storage so provided your user base is using google-chrome or safari it would work on a desktop as well as various mobile platforms

11110184

pascal	delphi
i m currently trying to work with a delphi pascal translation of the ati adl structure

although as i stated in my other answer the width and height attributes do not interfere with fluid images fluid images do interfere with not-yet-loaded images taking up the proper amount of space in browsers other than chrome

11110203
width	height
however it does provide the same advantages to apparent loading speed that the width and height attributes provide

opera	google-chrome
is it possible to use border-radius on a div in google-chrome and opera so that the inner div background would also be affected

11110283
x86	64bit
64bit x86 systems know also as amd64 or x86-64 or x64 require double values to be 64bit aligned otherwise a misalignment fault occurs and the hardware does an expensive fix-up which considreably slows down memory access

11110365
post	get
i could figure it out myself this post here brought me onto the right track how to get twitter-bootstrap navigation to show active link

11110385
children	parent
to illustrate let s take a simple and completely relevant example we are all familiar with parent and children in the context of family

11110385
children	parent
children however require a parent in order to exist parent_ssn must reference to an existing ssn in the parent table

11110385
children	parent
you cannot query for an individual child based only on the name field because multiple parent may have children with the same name

11110385
children	parent
likewise you cannot query for an individual child based only on the parent_ssn field because one parent may have many children

11110385
children	parent
taking that into consideration children are partially identified by their parent hence identifying relationship

11110385
children	parent
although the parent_ssn field still references the ssn of the parent table it has no part in the unique identity of the child thus parent have a non-identifying relationship to their children and both tables can now be considered strong standalone entities

11110385
children	parent
one parent may now have two or more children with the same name whereas the entity integrity constraint in the previous model would not allow for this

11110385
children	parent
in both of the above models the parent table is considered to be the parent table of the children table

11110385
children	parent
however in non-identifying relationships like in the second model parent is only a parent table in the context of the foreign key parent_ssn because parent_ssn references depends on ssn in the parent table but does not have any part in defining the actual identity of children

11110391
zoo	xts
if you are dealing with time series data i suggest you use a time series class like zoo or xts

11110796
portrait	landscape
whenever the screen was changed either moved portrait mode or touched landscape mode the ondraw method is called

11110819
width	height
1 you can always get the current usable width height of the browser window using window.innerwidth and window.innerheight

11110830
onresume	onpause
however for some reason if you have to query for the cursor using the contentresolver on the ui thread it is better to close the cursor in the onpause and requery the cursor in the onresume worst case scenario close it in the ondestroy there could be an instance that the activity maybe garbage collected before ondestory is called

11110870
children	parent
so as cristi stated above some browsers seem to have a little trouble with clipping overflowing children along the curved border of their parent

you have to subtract the padding margins and border size in your case 9px 2 3 for the padding 2 1 for the border and 1 for the left margin to the buttons width

11118352
width	height
and each slide to have width 100 and height 100 meaning the slides inherit their width and height from body

11118450
getter	setter
either way you can use twoway binding which will be the default anyway if your view model property has a getter and setter

11118502
nsmutablestring	nsstring
easiest way to do this is to use nsmutablestring instead of nsstring and then you can do the deletecharactersinrange method where the range parameter is the range of characters you want to delete

if i m correct firefox is the only browser that supports padding height margin or any other kind of modification of the size for the option element

11118766
google-chrome	firefox
at least google-chrome doesn t allow any sort of size altering and you can t ignore google-chrome users so the solutions mentioned above work mostly for firefox and maybe for some other browsers

11118783
post	put	post	get	put	get
to help diagnose the issue i ve tried changing existing working non-nested post of sales that don t include an id to be put requests and in that case it does break the functionality and i do get a 404

11118957
postgresql	mysql
the with recursive clause that you are using is applicable for postgresql databases not for mysql

11118961
post	get
it does not use post or get global arrays to store command line parameters

11119034

i m also trying to prevent the events default behaviour so touch move doesn t drag the window all over the place

11119273
many-to-one	one-to-many
2 on the book side you need a many-to-one relationship on the shelf side you need a one-to-many relationship see in the below mapping

after that you ll be able to clone pull push from and to the repository

11119331
postgresql	mysql
will work on mysql and postgresql but is likely to perform terribly on mysql mysql won t use its indexes because of the lower function

11119331
postgresql	mysql
on postgresql you can add a functional index on lower bar but mysql doesn t support this

11119331
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
mysql will unless you have set a case-sensitive collation do case-insensitive matching automatically and use its indexes

11119373
salt	md5
how does the salt position when hashing with md5 affects the quality

11119373
hash	salt
which also cantains the salt it makes his life a little easyer trying to crack the hash

11119379
width	height

11119401
carrierwave	paperclip
if you can tell me what kind of upload solution you use paperclip carrierwave if any i can help you a bit better

11119408
post	get
i found a webpage that shows how to use some .net classes to get facebook s json-output of wall post at what is interesting here is that classes are nested inside of classes inside of other classes - so it can be done just a bit complex

11119415
min	max	minimum	max
min max sets minimum maximum axis value

11119415
min	max
pad padmin padmax defines padding around min max value

11119419
width	height
what i was expecting is the container should preserve width 32vw and height 50vh as given in the css

11119419
width	height
the outer container should be of given width and height

11119419
width	height
container width height shouldn t increase after padding

11119428
many-to-one	one-to-many
what this means is when you make a one-to-many relation in shelf many-to-one relation is not automatically created in book classes

11119480
post	get
i have to download some data from external source but i have to submit which data i want to retrieve i m using special url on website routing and i don t allow special characters in url so i guess i have to use post or get method to submit data

for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
i create a for-loop which loops through the arrays but when trying to use projection.topixels arraylist point

11119567
hash	salt
so when it comes to salting just generate a hash of a random value say mcirotime and use it to salt the password before hashing and store it in the database in a column next to the password

11119595
folder	dir
the switch added to dir tells dir to show files folder with the attribute hidden

11119602
hash	salt
if the attacker relies on finding a collision with a given hash of your database thanks to the cryptographic weakness of the hashing algorithm the salt will not have any effect i have a bunch of bits and i d like to find some input to the xxx hash algorithm which give me the same bunch of bits in the output

11119644
set	bag
what we really need is a replacement for nhibernate s generic bag list and set implementations that knows how to use the linq provider to query into lists directly

also is there any reason you re using myisam over innodb

11119660
hex	binary
the arithmetic is done in binary and then the result is printed as hex

11119663
hash	salt
the position of the salt has no impact on the security of a particular hash

11119663
hash	salt
as for the security of the hash if the user has the same email and password two different places this negates one of the benefits of a random salt in that the same hash will be visible both places

11119683
interbase	firebird
are there any conflicts if both interbase and firebird are installed on the same workstation

11119688
width	height
also if you are using and you know the size of the div you may want to specify the height and width of the chart as well

11119880
google-chrome	firefox
i know webstorm allows debugging in firefox and google-chrome but i don t see ie support

11119891
super	extends
you can only add elements to a generic collection declared with super not extends

11120058
post	get
use xmlserializer to get a source-xml representation of your svg and post that back to your server using ajax if you like

11120058
google-chrome	firefox
caveat the current version of google-chrome and semi-recent versions of firefox but not the latest currently punt on security and taint the canvas when you draw any svg preventing you from getting a data uri

11120083
public	protected
do this by extending the base class and giving public access to the private protected method property etc

11120195

firefox but not google-chrome ie or safari is for some reason displaying certain special characters such as darr with a huge line height

11120603
google-chrome	firefox
i have two tabs open in firefox say with user ff1 and user ff2 and one tab in google-chrome say user chrome1

11120615
post	get
so i added a filter in my wordpress installation functions.php according to this link in order to get that variable and use it programatically in my wp post page in the construction of my link

11120652
inherited	subclassing
normally this would be solvable with inherited and creating subclassing of mymodel maybe like this

11120656
width	height
here s the code to help out max width and height are currently 270 and 180 respectively

11120723
put	get
i am developing a web application who needs to get the folders and sub folders who is on sharepoint and put on a treeview representing the hierarchy

11120725
google-chrome	firefox
so i am now thinking of using the word object model it would have to be via javascript but most of the users use either firefox or google-chrome so would for eg

11120747
post	get
in this situation any solution will be hack-ish because you can not get total control over the swing thread and who post events on it

11120747
invokelater	invokeandwait
so you should do step 1 and 2 in one invokelater call or even invokeandwait and then post another event with invokelater to unset the flag

11120777
min	max
i then expect it to output the mean min and max values of the list of data in each file

11120777
min	max
however whenever it runs it outputs the mean min and max values for only one file

11120786
yacc	bison
have a look at yacc or bison they should be able to do this for you provided the licenses are compatible with your work

11120786
yacc	bison
and as gahcep pointed out in his answer there are other alternatives to yacc and bison as well including commercial alternatives

11120872
post	get
i can post some class such in tutotials or get any data and everything will be ok but i can t post xmldocument

to the search controller and everything works fine with safari and firefox but i get the same expire page error when i try to execute the web application with ie 8 and 9

11120996
post	get
you can get the session cookies by sending another post request first one that the browser would send when you log in

11120996
google-chrome	firefox
to see what the browser sends you could use a firefox addon like httpfox or just use the built-in features that both google-chrome and firefox have these days

11121012
min	max
each price number will represent its graphbar s height by respecting min and max heights

11121012
min	max
what i want is that graph bar s height wouldn t go below or above the min and the max value

11121012
min	max
so the min and max values from the price list will be and

11121028
screens	hdpi
this works but the value i get is multiplied times the screens density factor 1.5 for hdpi 2.0 for xhdpi etc

11121078
mdpi	hdpi
i take it you are talking about the gt-p1000 and it is the only exception to have hdpi density instead of mdpi for that size

11121109
children	parent
if your goal is to delete the children when the parent is deleted then all you need is

11121114
width	border-box	width	height	height	border-box	box-sizing	border-box
if you use box-sizing border-box the box you apply this will have the width and height you applied in the styles without problems about margins and paddings with undesirable effects on the box sizes

11121125
public	protected
instead og defining them as public you should use protected

11121158

you don t have to use virtual if you adress children s overloaded methods but you have to when you adress parent s methods

11126351
public	protected
you say you are familiar with java so then for a real world use of virtual functions think of any place in java where you would have used an interface or used override on a public protected method

11126375

inline	inlining
-o1 probably included inlining in which case even if there is a non-inlined copy of the function emitted the two calls may still be inline which gives the erroneously expected results

11126860
width	height
the other way is to hardcode the dimensions on the imageview in dp or assign its height width programaticaly after getting the screen metrics and calculating some percentage of the width height to fill although i think using just the fixed dp in the layout will be sufficient if needed you can use values dimensions to mark the size of the view

11126909
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
afaik neither opera nor google-chrome recognize the blur method on the window object so it s likely that the kiosk will use firefox

11129343
for-loop	loops
so do i need to write something about the for-loop that as soon as i find the duplicate elements i should break loops

11129359
svg	vml
i draw several paths circles and rectangles and everything seems to work fine on both ie9 svg and ie8 vml

11129379
next	except
when i try to debug with gdb everything works correctly except that the next command sometimes continues instead of going to the next source line

11129421
for-loop	loops
so do i need to write something about the for-loop that as soon as i find the duplicate elements i should break loops

11129443
folder	dir	folder	directory
basically i need to copy an item that is up 3 folder from a folder called dir into my current directory

11129447
hash	salt
futhermore it requires the use of a salt which protects against the use of pre-caclulated hash values rainbow tables

11129447
hash	salt
even if an attacker gets your password hash and salt as long as your use of bcrypt is using a high number of iterations it won t be possible to quickly find the matching password

11129476
post	put
since i have not enough room to post it in the comments i ll put it there

11129476
width	height
as soon as the zoom reach a certain level which depends on image ratio you update the css of your image with a height 100 and set width to auto

11129476

you can basically constrain width or height depending on which one is 100

11129479
pop-up	dialog
right now i have a file open dialog box that pop-up when the project is executed so that the user can select the files

also another sub question is it good programming practice to use the public properties or the private protected fields when working inside the class they belong to

11129603
post	get
you could either just get the data that you need from each table or a slightly cleaner way may be to do a union of the three tables after limiting your query to only those post by selected user and order by the date posted

11129624
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
why not use an objectinputstream objectoutputstream instead

11129629
int	boolean
first of all i m pretty sure programmers have been using 4-byte int s for boolean variables since the beginning of programming on x86

11129638
google-chrome	safari
in google-chrome safari and other browsers this works just like it should

11129641
client-side	server-side
an established connection is uniquely identified by the combination of client-side and server-side ip port pairs

11129641
client-side	server-side
multiple connections on the same server can share the same server-side ip port pair as long as they are associated with different client-side ip port pairs and the server would be able to handle as many clients as available system resources allow it to

11129665
int	boolean
the processor is 32 bit and has a special flag when it operates on a zero int making testing for 32 bit boolean values very very very fast

11129685
pull	push
beyond that they are using stuff like alarmmanager for pull or c2dm for push neither of which require you to have launched the app any more than you need to keep the gmail activity open to be able to get new email messages

hazelcast	terracotta
i know it s unfair with the terracotta guys but has anyone tried to use hazelcast in order to use scheduled jobs in a clustered environment

11129896
hazelcast	terracotta
i believe this would be a great advantage for people who already has the hazelcast since they won t require the whole dev-environment hassle by opening the terracotta stuff all the time

11129924
width	height
the horizontal fov is not the same unless the canvas is square but the width and height ratio of the line area will be proportional to the width and height ratio of the screen

11129984
sorting	filtering
i found that if i did iterate through the queryset and tacked on rank manually and then further filtering the results my rank would disappear - unless is turned it into a list which made filtering and sorting a bit of pain

11130037
for-loop	loops
starting with an empty dataframe i need to fill the dataframe as follows a for-loop generates a fixed number of values in each iteration and i need to add a new column with the values in that list and giving the column a unique name col_i where i is the ith iteration of loops

11130058

basically loop the width down until the desired height is reached

11130082
phpmyadmin	heidisql
now when importing it via phpmyadmin i noticed that i must select the database information_schema because that s how the db is exported or this is how heidisql 7 exports databases as objects to an sql file

11130082
phpmyadmin	heidisql
however that is a problem because when i import the exported file with heidisql 7 instead of phpmyadmin while selecting the information_schema database and clicking on import sql file from the tools menu it says that access is denied for the root user

i ve tried redirecting stdout stderr via

11130156
stdout	stderr
does anyone know of a way i can do a deep-capture of any print handed to stdout stderr by a function and any sub-functions that function calls

11130156
stdout	stderr
i ended up taking the method outlined in the selected answer below and writing a context manager to supress stdout and stderr

11130156
stdout	stderr
i think it has something to do with when these messages get sent to stdout stderr i think it happens after my context manager exits

11130169
rsa	aes
its probably encrypted with aes under a random symmetric key and the key is then encrypted with rsa

11130179
csv	tsv
i think that generally csv are supported more often than the tsv format

11130180
csv	tsv
the way i look at it is csv is for loading into spreadsheets tsv is

11130185
csv	tsv
tsv is an alternative to the similar csv comma-separated values format

11130185
csv	tsv
however unlike csv tsv defines no means of escaping the separator

11130199
readonly	temporary
may be implemented as a pair of pointers or pointer and length and its storage could be automatic temporary or static readonly

11130205
width	height
i think it has to do with your css width and height declarations not having px at the end of it

11130205
width	height
can you check if the elements render with a width and height in order to display the background image

11130276
width	height
you need to add px to the end of all your position height and width numbers

11130310
post	put
this post shows how you can do this with bxp which is the function that boxplot uses but you need to put your data in the right order with the first row being the minimum and the last row being the maximum

11130351

11130534
memcached	apc
i just came across jlinq a js library to query data arrays in a similar fashion to that of a relational db and it just occurred to me that a library to query data like this in php would be extremely handy to work with cached subsets of a rdbms where the cache itself has no querying capabilities such as apc or memcached

11130581
try-catch	exception-handling
i may not be understanding the problem but instead of actually breaking on the line which doesn t appear to be possible would it be enough to put a try-catch inside your expression tree and log the exception-handling

udp	rtp	udp	tcp	rtp	sip
actually tcp between pc and sip client will probably be accurate for signalling but not for media as rtp media stream is often sent over udp

11134567
rtp	sip
in my opinion the first step is to make sure that your softswitch will accept sending rtp packets to an ip address which is not the same as sip client i think most of them refuse for security reasons

11134567
rtp	sip
if it accepts and if you have no nat between your sip client and your pc you should be able to send rtp stream directly to your pc

11134567
rtp	sip
if your softswitch does not want to send rtp packets to an ip address different from sip ip address then you have to forward your rtp packets from your sip client to your pc

11134567
rtp	sip
to test whether your softswitch accepts sending rtp packets to an unintended ip address you can use sipp and specify a remote media ip address different from sip signalling ip address

i have a client that has asked that i provide a service that reads pcap files and writes the packets into their database of choice

i am using pcap.net to read the original pcap files and extract the packets

11135215

equals	gethashcode
you need to handle both because gethashcode is used by many collection implementations like dictionary in concert with the equals method

11142338
equals	gethashcode
the important thing is that if you override the implementation of equals then you must override gethashcode in such a way that any two objects that are equals according to your new implementation also must return an identical hash code

11142363
equals	gethashcode
it is necessary to provide an override to gethashcode when your custom class overrides equals

any ideas on how can i close the second window and terminate the dispatchertimer inside the navigationservice

11142971

there s no way to find the maximum minimum in the general case without looping through all the n elements if you go from 1 to n-1 how do you know whether the element n isn t larger or smaller than the current max min

11142971
min	max
if you know exactly which values change you can start with your previous max min values and only compare with the new ones but even in this case if one of the values which were modified was your old max min you may need to loop through them again

consider using the term polymorphically in two contexts without the monomorphism restriction where in one context you show div x 2 and in another you use show x 2 in one setting you get the integral and show constraints which causes you to default to int in the other you get a fractions and a show constraint and that defaults you to double so the result of the computation isn t shared as you are working with a polymorphic term applied to two distinct types

11147658

your application s heap size is 30mb device dependent but that s a good rule of thumb and a bitmap will take up width height 4 bytes in memory once loaded

width	height
in some applications those dimensions are not interchangable--you can unambiguously identify which dimension on the real-world object is height which is width and which is depth

11148142
width	height
one example might be a shipping container on a pallet where height is obvious width is the edge a forklift is expected to fit under and depth is the remaining dimension. in other applications they re interchangable which means you re liable to find duplicate primary keys like 2 3 5 and 2 5 3

also had to add a macro for the property declaration to customize the getter setter names which gets around the issue of capitalizing the name of the property

11148889
rvm	bundler
per my understanding installing libgdal-ruby via apt would install everything in the system paths which wouldn t be automatically loaded by default by a ruby installed via rvm nor your rails application using bundler which isolates gems

i have an express server that has a button that issues a post which activates a function in my node.js server

11148921
mousemove	mousedown
although i can just easily capture the mousedown mousemove event on the form itself to implement the above feature i feel like using the mousemove event to consistently update the position of the textbox is a very inefficient way of approaching this problem and will result in poor performance

11148928
entities	entitymanager
in one world i think it is better to put all the entities in one entitymanager domain and isolate them from other thread

11148930
sorting	filtering
bear in mind you ll have to mimic all the existing functionality you want to keep from the admin people page eg exposed filtering and sorting and make sure you set the access permissions on the view to ensure only admin users have access

children	parent
the thing is when pulling these child objects from the application i don t want a copy of the parent being loaded with each of the children in the collection

11149040
children	parent
again my goal here is to be able to persist children individually but not to have to store the entire parent object inside

11149462
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this appears to render fine on firefox google-chrome and safari will check ie next week plus gives you a bonus of adjusting margin-top to slightly shift text position

11149495
hide	show
a far better way of doing this is to hide the div in css which would mean the div is hidden before the document is even show

11149544

11149640
pull	push
now i m trying to push the new master to github but get errors saying that the tip of the current branch is behind and suggests merging the remote changes git pull - this makes sense to me but i don t understand how to force the remote master to be the same as my local one - hope this makes sense

11149788

i needed to add an isowner field to the association table so i changed it to a one-to-many many-to-one relation

min	max
it wasn t part of the question but i needed both the min and max from the array and that changes things a little

11149865
rss	feed
personally that s why i use sax.js -- a pure javascript sax parser -- in my feedparser library if you re parsing rss atom rdf feed please consider trying it -- comments and pull requests are more than welcome

11149865
rss	feed
and honestly when parsing something as big as an rss feed there is no discernable speed difference between sax.js and libxmljs

11149913
folder	dir
to avoid in relative path confusion case i copied compiled program folder to var www root dir with yii lib var www yii framework but nothing change

i d like set the internal width height to say 100x100 and then draw everything in those coordinates and have the canvas scale it out the same way i do in opengl

11150133
width	height
i figured out that if i set the css width and height on the canvas i can make it larger but keep the same units but i found that it actually stretches the result and it blurs and looks terrible i thought it still render like a vector nice and crisp

11150179
put	get
once you get these working they can be cut and pasted into other code or put into a personal code library so you don t have to remember how to do it

11150245
packets	pcap
how can i get these packets into a new pcap file

11150245
winpcap	libpcap	winpcap	pcap.net	libpcap	pcap.net

11150344
getter	setter
this could then be simplified to use attr_accessor instead of defining the getter setter methods manually

11150364
int	chars
which is only 1 byte assuming this to be the size of chars in size but you are trying put 4 bytes assuming that to be the size of int into it during fscanf thereby potentially overwriting the memory around it

11150388

the use of ilist and ienumerable in the getteams method look to be used just because

11150429
int	chars
if each call to fscanf works each will fill in one int but buf points to a sequence of unsigned chars s

11150429
unsigned	short
the same mistake is repeated at many other points in fill_cotp fscanf with a d directive is used to fill in temp which has type unsigned short rather than int

11150429

11150653
stdout	stderr
it is as if the verbose output is neither stderr or stdout

11150679
unsigned	short
depending on what data type word is since you haven t provided it i assume it is unsigned short the first comparison is always true since no negative integers fit in an unsigned short

11150682
integer	unsigned
it seems that word is typedef -ed somewhere as unsigned integer type so it will always be positive number

11150686
unsigned	short
i think the warning is for the comparison which is always true for hour is of type word which is a typedef of unsigned short usually which means hour is always greater than or equal to 0

11150686
unsigned	short
note that it doesn t matter whether is unsigned int or unsigned short

11150726
int	chars
in c chars literals such as a have type int and hence sizeof a is equal to sizeof int

queue	fifo
or as is common with packets you might eventually want to store them in a fifo manner which can be done with a stl queue

11150889
put	get
with the queue they come out in the same order you put them in so if you queue up packets 1 2 and 3 and later go to access two of them you will get packets 1 and 2 in that order and 3 will still be left for later

11150909
google-chrome	firefox

11151165
google-chrome	firefox
that s why as you see from the answer by kciebiera the clients that can make notifications possible are google-chrome and firefox

11151165
google-chrome	firefox
what you do is run code on the client javascript in this case that looks for something a message from the server for example and then instructs the browser google-chrome or firefox to launch the notification

11151203
hide	show
and then show hide them with an on off bool

11151699
pull	push
with this git push will update the same remote ref as the one which is merged by git pull making push and pull symmetrical

11151728
width	height
what i really want is something like the form elements input or textarea where you can simply specify the height and width by lines characters

11151807
nsdateformatter	nsnumberformatter
nsdateformatter doesn t specify a way for you to set the minimum maximum dates for the user input unlike nsnumberformatter

folder	directory
i determined that the problem was caused by a control that writes and deletes some files in temp folder that it creates near bin folder so the web directory looks like this

11151828
ready	each
another option would be to give each of these div a class then use javasript to count the number of classes present multiply this by the required width of each div then use javascript to set the page width with the on document ready event

11151830
margin	height
you still can set height margin on each div of course

11152146
16-bit	64bit
furthermore this calculation mismatch did not happen debug mode because all the variables were written to memory into 64bit double variables and reloaded from there afterward nullifying the additional 16-bit

11152153
jobs	cron
there should be a section there for adding cron jobs using the interface

11152161
submit	submission
the reason i want to switch to dopost is that it shows another panel when you click the submit button so the user knows that there submission went through

11152204
post	put
so it would be better to take the http post code from the second answer and put it inside the run method of a runnable object you could run on a background thread

11152206
cells	tablecell
i have already managed to implement this by using my own subclass of tablecell and using a webview for each cells htmleditor would of course have been another choice but my guess is that for my requirements webview should be sufficient

11152375
width	height
that would explain why when height is not the same as width you get an exception and why it flips your picture when they are the same

11152375
width	height
also a tip for you if you rewrite it as a 1-dimensional array of size height width you will get a drastic speed increase

11152382
width	height
you pass x and y values across on the command line and then ignore them and use the width and height of the screen to set your x y values

11152441
serializable	deserialization
in general a good approach would be to maintain a high-level description of your structure somehow and then write code that generates the serializable and deserialization functions

11152454
integer	unsigned
6 the type size_t is an implementation-deï ned unsigned integer type that is large enough to contain the size

11152501
inherited	properties
after that all other loggers will inherited those properties and you will not get any more messages

11152503
hide	show
thus in your situation the only solution appear to be use jquery and grab the ticks and hide them yourself just after you finish your plot - just like i show it here

11152669
margin	height
you could just apply a 140px top margin padding to the body or other container element which would make the topnav s height and offset accounted for

11152677
x86	64bit
they are in ntddscsi.h found at c program files x86 microsoft sdks windows v7.0a include on a 64bit system

wrap the socket streams by using objectinputstream and objectoutputstream to be able to use serialization

11152810
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
currently this is only implemented in firefox and google-chrome not mise don t know about safari and opera etc but it s a w3c standard so expect everyone to join in eventually

11152830
submit	submission
passing event argument here e to submit callback you can stop form submission using .preventdefault method

11152882
submit	submission
a properly implemented ajax form is exactly the same as a regular form except that if javascript is enabled a submit handler will be bound to it that will prevent the normal submission of the form and send the data using the xmlhttprequest object

11152889
keydown	keyup	keydown	mouseup	keydown	mousedown	keyup	mouseup	keyup	mousedown	mouseup	mousedown
instead of .live mouseup mousedown keyup keydown i would use the .change event which works the same way and would probably catch the ctrl+v changes too

11152899
column-count	height
the problem is that when there is some fixed height opera generates more columns than specified in column-count instead of adding scroll

11152899
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in firefox google-chrome but not in opera

11152928

google-chrome	firefox
works for me tested on win 7 - ie 9 firefox 13 google-chrome 19

11152990

always split your query with union when ever there is multiple grouping by or sorting requirement

11153286
distance	polygons
could you calculate the distance of the polyline using something like this and then determine whether the polyline passes through your polygons - using something like this - and at what points distance it crosses to then determine how much to charge

11153371
int	boolean
boolean floats int longs and strings

11153394
typedef	struct
additional note if it had been defined as a typedef struct you would not have needed to add the struct part manually

11153394
typedef	struct
but you should assume that most all pure c struct are not defined as a typedef

11153422
ant	maven
among others maven gradle ant and sbt can handle scala and i would expect every ci system to support at least the first 3

11153437
qstring	qbytearray
use qstring utf16 to get the ushort values mask out the top and bottom halves in the endianness you want into the qbytearray

11153438
maven	pom.xml
but i cant do maven install because the changed project pom.xml is red too caused by missing artifacts

11153527
children	parent
as soon as i start using floats for alignment the parent stops containing children

11153530
width	height
hence when working with a rectangle you can define width and height with corresponding values

11153599
getter	setter
i tried this approach getter and setter left out for brevity

11153635
google-chrome	firefox
will work in ie and firefox but its not supported in google-chrome

11153656
superclass	subclassing
the problem here is that scala and java allow subclassing to return more-specific types than superclass in overridden methods

11153681
box-sizing	border-box
you should apply to your div containers or html5 containers the css property box-sizing border-box

11153681
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and firefox don t use the same concept for padding and margin but using that they will all use the same

11153693
inherited	properties
the very important point is the .hasownproperty - this checks if it is a real properties of the object and not only inherited through the prototype chain

11153741
post	get
ssomeone can tell me what s the best way to get a post using it s id

11153788
wordpress	joomla
same goes with wordpress joomla - simply wappalyzer mozila addon gtmetrix finds the site platform even there is no html source

11153812
hide	show
the easiest way to achieve this is to show hide the content of the pushpin on tap instead of mouseleftbuttonup because of some performance considerations

11153814
width	height
even the width and height you see set is unnecessary boxes can adjust to their content when omitted i just added them for demo purposes

11153835
hide	show
maybe the sdk has some sort of hidden callback for the readiness of the scanner i could hide it until the scanner says it s ready and then show the scanner like .5 seconds later.

11153843
google-chrome	safari
the only problem is when i view it on my pc browser google-chrome safari it works perfectly as i designed it but when i view it on iphone ipad the timer in my player doesnt work all it can do is play and pause.

11153856
post	get
update it s the best practice when you need to get a single post by id no cicles required

11153899
children	parent
if you load the children in 1 session nhibernate will only create 1 instance of each unique parent in the database - even to the point that if a parent is one of the children you ve loaded it won t go and load it again or create a new object

11153965
post	get
the default type of request by is get you need to set it to post or use instead

pop-up	dialog
the intention is that the user click on a browse-button and it pop-up a dialog widget with a grid cgridview inside

11154994
multiplying	add
if you intend to multiplying val2 by 16 and then add val1 to the result then you need to implement it step by step you may come across addressing in the form of a+b c but a and c need to be registers and b can only be 2 4 or 8 not 16

11155099
typedef	struct
therefore you must tell the compiler that x is a struct and not a function or a typedef for a built in type

therefore it was suggested to create a wrapperproperty class that will provide a public setname -method which itself calls a therefore created setname -method in property which will be protected package view

11156096
public	protected
the problem is that i cannot make this method protected in property because eclipse tells me to add it to the interface iproperty and make it public

11156148

11156372
width	height
you shouldn t be altering the height and width of the snake when it s changing direction you need to create a second snake tail which decreases in size as you increase the first snake tail in length

11156383
width	height
if you just need to read the width and height of the file without loading it in memory you could use wpf s bitmapdecoder class

11156393
unsigned	short
and i spotted readystate of type unsigned short readonly

11156407
for-loop	arrays
ok maybe this will help i ve modified your code so it now has an arrays called which is keeping track of the new segments in the snake if you look at the new for-loop

11156429
popupwindow	pop-up
you can use custom toast massages or popupwindow for non-modal pop-up like web see these likes help u creating custom toast and popupwindow

11156485
width	height
a bitmap is simply an array of color values hence the size in bytes of a bitmap is the size of a pixel which depends on the bitmap format multiplied by width and by height which must be integer values the indices to access elements in an array are always integers aren t they

11156485
width	height
your second attempt is the right choice you only need to compute the values for width and height such as they stay reasonably low

11156549
many-to-many	one-to-many
the application will eventually have about 6 entities with a variety of one-to-many and many-to-many relationships

11156564

11156981
postgresql	mysql
i prefer postgresql over mysql but that s another debate

11156981

11163395
daemons	systemd
garbage collection is usually a process invoked by the systemd and not invoked by the user and since this garbage collection thread usually called the daemons thread as it has lowest priority is invoked as needed by the systemd and it might thus be invoked multiple times during the lifecycle of an application if it were present in ios it would lead to a very bad battery life for the iphone as gc would sap the battery life and hence we use alloc and release commands while working with ios applications

11163436

boost	stl
why does stl code seem to be statically linked into the boost dynamic libraries on darwin

11164016
boost	stl
when i build boost 1.42 1.46.1 1.49 on os x with gcc 4.6.1 and toolset darwin i find that the resulting libraries statically include a lot of stl code such as std basic_string char and std basic_string wchar_t

11164016
boost	stl
on the os x side this is how i know that stl code has been included directly in the boost library

11164206
cos	sin	cos	exp
i may be way off track here and you may already have investigated this possibility but it could be possible that there are differences between c++ and matlab in the way that the mathematical library functions sin cos and exp that you mention are implemented internally

11164210
ienumerable	icollection
same goes for the generic ienumerable and icollection interfaces

11164225
realloc	malloc
and if you can t make assumptions about line length you can use the same technique but you ll need to malloc and realloc your buffers as you encounter lines longer than your initial size

11164240
opencv	emgucv
if want to develop with c# then take a look into emgucv project which wraps opencv for c# .net

11164245

you don t need to put onfocus and onblur to clear the value because placeholder will do it for you

11164274
width	height
however i am not sure how the last two values work they are either right bottom or width height but neither seem to make much sense in the example provided

11164301
ffmpeg	libavformat
ffmpeg s mov.c in libavformat might help

11164310
min	max
since xlim always returns an ordered pair as long as xdir is not set to reverse you can access the elements directly using the min and max functions

11164310
min	max
use min xlim to access the first element and max xlim for the second element

11164310
min	max
if xdir is set to reverse max xlim will return the first element and min xlim the second

11164387
onfocus	onblur
i don t think that onblur can be detected but this is a code to detect onfocus

11164405

versioning	upgrade
upgrade to the not yet released 3.8.0 svn versioning of valgrind

11164475

the best solution would be to specify the width and height of each image inside a popup manually but if you can t determine the size a somewhat hacky solution would be something like this

11164494
versioning	upgrade
you ll notice that if you ever use nuget to upgrade to a newer versioning of nunit or fsunit your hintpaths will once again be stripped from the .fsproj file

i have many instances of msft instrument but i can use them in hashset hashmap or whereever thanks to overriden equals and gethashcode methods

11168061
equals	gethashcode
also i now can remove equals and gethashcode methods as i have exactly one instrument for each gateid + ticker pair

11168061
equals	gethashcode
when i frequently need same objects is it better to use factory instead of creating new object every time with overriden equals and gethashcode methods

11168094

are you making a server-side or client-side call to the api

11169132
client-side	server-side
if you canâ t do the api call client-side as suggested above because you require your app access token to be send for your actions to be published then iâ d suggest still doing it server-side but not via cron but triggered by the user himself by embedding an img or script element into youâ re page put out by php if youâ re directing the user to a new page or created and put into the dom client-side via javascript which has itâ s source set as the address of your php script publishing the action

i m successfully using node.js + express + everyauth to login to facebook twitter etc

11170506
express	everyauth
the problem i m trying to wrap my head around is that everyauth seems to be configure and forget. i set up a single everyauth object and configure it to act as middleware for express and then forget about it

11170531
folder	directory
i found the solution the images folder should be placed in client bin folder that is located in the website directory

11170538

11171520
put	get
it s very simple when i put an id in img and get this src very easy

11171522

11171572
postgresql	mysql
one way to get around this is to create your own interfaces interface query interface access for all the queries accesses that you plan on doing and then have a query factory which can instantiate based on the db dialect mysql postgresql etc and create mysqlqueryimpl and postgresqueryimpl both implementing the query interface

11171608
mp4	h.264
minimally you must use mp4 + h.264 with aac or mp3

11171846
int	double
file a is main.cpp while the other two contain a function each file b contains foo file c contains foo int double

11171846

int	chars
interface a has a method public int data and interface b has a method public chars data

11172179

11172186
awt	swing
don t mix swing awt components without good reason

11172208

11172344
width	height
but these image objects would perhaps only contain height width imagetype and a path to where the cached image should be

11172371
int	boolean
i appreciate that since it s within the method when such has run it s course it should get garbage collected but i like to be certain and why can t i gc the boolean when i ve done the same for int array and point within another method of the same class

11172384
innodb	myisam
although you might be tempted to use a myisam table to be able to use a fulltext index this is possible in innodb too

11172384
innodb	myisam
it will be a bit harder to implement it this way but it will combine the high-performance text searching that myisam offers with all the benefits of innodb transactions row-level locking etc.

11172386
screens	tablet
when tablet is connected by the wire charger usb the wifi doesn t sleep when the device is unpluged the wifi goes sleep and when i ulock the screens the icon of the wifi is blue but i don t have internet connection sometimes the icon is grey and i dont have internet too

11172410
google-chrome	safari
it is currently only supported as of june 2012 in webkit-based browsers like safari and google-chrome

11172413
inherited	properties
uiview it also inherited the backgroundcolor properties

11172426
folder	directory
i delete all directory in the project folder and it works

11172473
folder	directory
another very basic question also when it comes to directory in java or specifically in .jar archives are folder in a path names always separated by a

11172486
folder	directory
2 another very basic question also when it comes to directory in java or specifically in .jar archives are folder in a path names always separated by a .

11172536
inherited	properties
i m trying to create a class that inherited from listbox and adding the properties previousselectedindex to it

11172543
min	max
...the transformation for min max sliders should actually be relative to the scale not the individual markers

11172551
screens	tablet
so i ve just received the fourth e-mail today regarding support for the latest iteration of tablet with a 10-inch screens and a resolution of 1920 x 1200 pixels in one of my apps

11172570
children	parent
i assume you re using storyboards. you would have your parent view controller with two children list map

11172579
folder	directory
at the very least there will be files and folder specific to the theme located in the following directory

11172582
mdpi	hdpi
it is in res drawable and in all the other folders mdpi hdpi etc.

11172593
width	font-size
what i think is happening in internet explorer is that the font-size is being changed to 1.2em before the width of #pad is calculated

11172593
google-chrome	firefox
so the width in firefox and google-chrome is where as in ie the width is

11172617
stdout	stderr
stderr of the inner command group is redirected to stdout so that it applies to the inner substitution

11172617
stdout	stderr
next the stdout of out is assigned to y and the redirected stderr is captured by x without the usual loss of y to a command substitution s subshell

11172720
min	max
probably well after the fact but - based pretty much on what you show above respects jqm themeing min max values

11172724
imagemagick	graphicsmagick
you must have imagemagick or graphicsmagick installed

11172726
folder	directory
generate a new file by the application installer that contains paths to data directory and install it somewhere in the common app data folder

11172765
oracle10g	oracle11g	oracle10g	oracle9i	oracle11g	oracle9i

my mainactivity extends sherlockactivity to implements the actionbar on devices with lower android versions

11172811
google-chrome	firefox
it works perfectly in google-chrome firefox but not in ie

11172847
np-hard	np-complete
this problem is known to be np-hard by a reduction from the np-complete problem of decomposing a graph into cliques the clique cover problem

11172847
np-hard	np-complete
consequently the known np-complete problem of clique cover can be reduced to your problem in polynomial time so your problem is np-hard

11172851
int	boolean
other primitive data types such as boolean number int and uint

11172851
int	boolean
null to variables of type boolean number int or uint

11172903
youtube	vimeo
you could parse the youtube and vimeo links and replace it on your side with code that properly embeds their ios html5 versions

11172983
boost	stl
second i would try to check whether qt stl boost this particular version of whatever can handle strings that large

11172984
min	max
no min max blending there may be an extension for this

11172995
post	get
so for instance when you click on things it is passing in the url to get the specific relative post

11173028
qgroupbox	qcheckbox
i am designing a custom widget which is basically a qgroupbox holding a configurable number of qcheckbox buttons where each one of them should control a particular bit in a bitmask represented by a qbitarray

11173032
udp	tcp
i know few mechanisms from low-level solutions - shared memory c c++ linux pipe sockets tcp udp etc

11173066
jquery-ui-autocomplete	typeahead.js
in the demo this feature is not available either however i know it s enabled in the jquery-ui-autocomplete so i m wondering if any of you have made it work for typeahead.js as well

11173068
mp4	webm
second what do i do for all the different extensions that are supported not supported like mp4 wav and webm

11173119
addclass	removeclass
i ve tried using addclass and removeclass so it s known which to start from but still wont work

11173150
google-chrome	firefox	mp4	webm
the solution is...if mp4 is supported by ie then you will also need to have a webm or ogg version of the same video file to ensure cross-browser support of the video firefox google-chrome

11173249
width	height
however when i changed my screen orientation to landscape my appwidget s width and height changing automatically by the home screen launcher and the problem is in landscape mode my widget s height is not set properly by the homescreen launcher

11173299
gesturedetector	motionevent
i would recommend either a gesturedetector this supports double tapping and other gestures or a basic touch listener uses motionevent which doesn t have double tap but you could implement this yourself

11173302
min	max
setting the icon size and or the button s min and max sizes isn t helping

11173314
post	get
or get post that have ids greater than 9 id 9

11173338
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i am using the latest version of google-chrome firefox and safari to test this out

11173378
puts	gets
i wrote an application with c++ qt that communicates with a device to read write its variables puts gets them in a struct and presents them in a gui for both viewing editing purposes

11173378
textchanged	selectedindexchanged
besides overriding the handler functions of events like textchanged selectedindexchanged etc

11173384
.htaccess	httpd.conf
put this either in your httpd.conf or .htaccess in the root of the site

11173403
uiview	subviews	uilabel	uibutton
for some reason the mysterious reordering animation from apple cant capture simple uiview but with uiimageviews uibutton and uilabel as subviews of the custom tableviewcell the animation works like expected...creepy

11173460
min	max
to do that first convert your colors to hsv and run the same algorithm as above but with h s and v instead of rgb but keep in mind that s and v have a min of 0 and max of 1 while h is represented in degrees between 0 and 360

11173477
comparator	comparable
i m working on implementing a hierarchy which deals with comparator and the comparable interface

11173484
switching	screens
in order to prevent automatic switching to a newly created window try altering your invocation of screens to something like the following

11173530
post	put
i would not create post method inside the model although having it in the controller is perfectly fine simply because you just put code model in such a frame that is not re-usable plus less readable

11173571
getter	setter	mutators	getter	mutators	setter
you would need to write getter and setter accessors and mutators if you prefer in the library class which will allow the item variable to be read updated by other classes even though it is declared as private

11173572
mongodb	bson	hash	md5
if you re just looking for a unique server id you could take the mongodb bson approach and use the first n bytes of the md5 hash of the server s host name

11173577
uitableview	nsindexpath
public override uitableviewcell getcell uitableview tableview nsindexpath indexpath

11173602
for-loop	arrays
first uses a for-loop to iterate over the arrays of structs

11173637
atomic	compare-and-swap
for example an efficient implementation of a non-recursive mutex might be a single bit where the lock operation is implemented with an atomic compare-and-swap instruction in a loop

11173670
textview	imageview
add your layout elements in frg_alert_buttons likes buttons textview imageview and editviews as per your need

11173673
spaces	delimiter
a method which used the spaces character 0x20 as a delimiter to properly deal with browsers which create a character with length 2

11173688
width	height
i would like both boxes to be the same height but want the div width height to be determined by their content not specifying a width height in pixels

11173692
g++	gcc
the last thing that might cause issues is the version of gcc and g++

11173692
g++	gcc
long story short make sure the pointers gcc and g++ in usr bin and subsequently usr local cuda bin are pointing to gcc-4.5 and g++-4.5 can get these with apt-get since they are the most recent versions supported by nvcc

11173731
children	parent
so you can compute the children from the index of the parent node without actually needing to store the index

11173732
folder	directory
and we only want 100 files per directory it will download them to folder something like

11173741
draggable	droppable
when i drag the draggable the element containing the droppable keeps getting triggered because it s also a droppable even though it s behind the droppable and they re stacked right on each other

11173817
hide	show
to do not show this again set your cookie to never show this again check if this cookie is set when page loads and hide the noification if that s the case

11173851
subtraction	multiplication
i am flexible in the return type but i will doing a lot of subtraction multiplication using another list

11173860
inherited	properties
in the get section of the inherited properties you could throw a notimplementedexception

11173868
uniq	grep
for a file of a million entries which i pass through a grep sed combination to remove parameters - resulting in about 150 unique lines - i spend about 3 seconds grepping sedding and about 15s sorting uniq ing

11173870
cpu	processors
cpu speed dependent assume that on a ghz class processors preemption of the garbage collector is less than 1 microsecond

11173871
int	double
edit since the value can have decimal places as you ve commented you need to parse it to double round it and then cast it to int

11173882
folder	directory
assuming you have in your header search paths - the solution is just to move the boost folder to your include directory

11173897
g++	gcc
g++ is a program that calls gcc and treats .c .h and .i files as c++ source files instead of c source files unless -x is used and automatically specifies linking against the c++ library

11173897
g++	gcc
run gcc on c files and g++ on c++ files

11173897
g++	gcc
in both cases you will need to link with g++ or gcc -lstdc++

11173926
firefox	safari
you can probably do it like this works in ie8 and better in firefox in safari

11173937
quicksort	timsort
you ll likely find that quicksort isn t as attractive as the built-in timsort

11173997
superclass	subclassing
i implements this practice with the package containing the class with public methods and variables but have trouble with access of from a subclassing in the same package and from a subclassing outside the package which would be the main package containing the class with main mentioned prior my problem is this how can i have the subclassing be accessible from another package when it and its superclass can t be public to allow it to be accessed by the main package

11174007
post	get
for content running in adobe air when using the navigatetourl function the runtime treats a urlrequest that uses the post method one that has its method property set to urlrequestmethod.post as using the get method

11174046
width	height	client-side	server-side
content can then be applied to correct columns either server-side getting image height width is trivial just balance how dynamic it has to be or on the client-side w ajax before appending content

11174054
x86	mips
in place of use one of armeabi armeabi-v7a x86 or mips - depending on how .so file has been built

11174063
screens	hdpi
when i have small screens but hdpi resolution buttons fonts are going out of shape

11174063
screens	hdpi
because i have bigger font size for hdpi screens and it goes smaller with ldpi screens

11174063
screens	hdpi
but when small screens has hdpi resolution android picks font size from hdpi folder and messes up font size

11174063
width	height
it becomes big and outgrows the screen width height

11174087
inherited	subclassing
let s say that class a1 a2 and a3 all inherited from class a with some additional methods that may be unique to each subclassing

11174093
apache	nginx
many people find that running nginx as a proxy in front of apache to be an ideal middle ground

11174093
apache	nginx
in short you get the low-resource benefits of nginx coupled with the wide feature-set of apache

11174117
slideup	slidedown
just use by default it uses slidedown and slideup

11174150
g++	gcc
if you are going to compile both c and c++ you are better off compiling always with gcc it will choose the language based on the file extension than g++ will always compile as c++

11174150
g++	gcc
you will need to change your linker options to include c++ standard library and -lm if you use it as those are automatically added by g++ but not gcc

11174150
g++	gcc
alternatively a better option is to call the g++ for c++ and gcc for c files

11174152
oncreate	ondestroy	oncreate	onstart	onresume	onpause	onstart	ondestroy
implemented lifecycle methods oncreate onresume onpause onstart onstop ondestroy

11174225
post	get
for a blogging app i m trying to get a list of all months in which post have been published but find a wrong set of months rendered in the template

11174231
put	get
is get put from a non-direct bytebuffer faster than get put from direct bytebuffer

11174248
versioning	upgrade
now when they try to upgrade to your new versioning of your library they get a bunch of real errors because they can t call those private methods anymore

11174266
couchbase	couchdb
i ve been flip-flopping between using couchdb and using couchbase server for an android game that i m developing and the lack of documentation is frustrating

11174266
couchbase	couchdb
couchbase mobile - a mobile implementation of couchdb --legacy

11174286
implements	extends
to do that i create custom classes that implements some interfaces or that extends the default classes spring uses

11174307
getter	setter
and of course i created the appropriate getter and setter

11174320
min	max
setup two doubles one for min one for max

11174320
min	max
then in each iteration set each to the min max of the existing min max and the current object in the iteration

11174331
getter	setter
best practice is to make fields private and defined getter and or setter methods as required for external classes to access modify them

11174332
sorting	filtering
for many object types for batch editing you can quickly generate a script for multiple objects using object explorer details and sorting and or filtering within that view

11174336
pull	push
before you can push your local changes to github you need to fetch or pull your remote changes merge the changes locally merging is automatic with pull and then push to the remote

11174355
winpcap	libpcap
neither tcpdump nor tshark can arbitrarily choose a link-layer header type for a device as the devices and thus libpcap winpcap don t allow arbitrary link-layer header types to be chosen as informed you

11174355
packets	pcap
for example if you re capturing on a device with a dlt_ value of dlt_en10mb ethernet just throw away all packets that don t have 0x0800 or 0x86dd as the ethernet type value and strip off the first 14 bytes of packets that do have those ethernet type values and write the resulting packets out in a pcap file with a dlt_ value of dlt_raw

11174359
google-chrome	firefox
the issue should be easily reproducible using the below xul and simply entering the path to the xul in the firefox location bar given its google-chrome url similar to this

11174381
post	get
submit function updates values in a mysql database and returns the results i ve been told to use json for this but every json function i ve tried i cant get it to post the data and receive it

11174405
fadein	fadeout
inside settimeout use fadeout and fadein to create a little animation effect

11174447
children	parent
i want that the bounding box of parent includes its children s bounding boxes regardless of their position attribute

11174451
cifilter	uiimage
the original image stores absolutely fine with my code but when i try to filter it with cifilter the resulting uiimage filteredimage is 0x0 pixels in size

11174482
put	get
a direct buffer holds the data in jni land so get and put have to cross the jni boundary

11174508
put	get	qstring	qlist
how do i get some useful out put from l1 qlist and strquery qstring

11174510
mouse	keyboard
i haven t found a clear answer on google and the reason i ask is because iv e heard the preferred method of getting keyboard and mouse input is by using the window event system..

11174521
post	get
there are a number of post on how to get set the height of hidden elements this and this

11174524
submit	submission
with some hacking i did manage to get firefox to see two forms but submission the inner one submit the outer one

11174536
int	double
because youâ re trying to put a double into an int array regardless of being accessed through a number reference

11174536
put	get
get put principle

11174536
puts	gets
it only gets items from the source and it only puts items in the destiny

11174543
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
however i need to present the same view as a model and it does not have a uinavigationcontroller or need one so i just add a uinavigationbar like so

11174546
postgresql	mysql
it works fine in development on a mysql database but i uploaded it to heroku which uses postgresql

11174563
jobs	cron
i have read in blogs that passenger kills threads specifically around cron jobs

11174574
google-chrome	firefox	put	get
especially bad is that both google-chrome and firefox not only ignore put and delete but send a get request in its place exposing all the form variables in the uri

11174591
super	extends
the use of wildcards super and extends is for type arguments that is you declare them at the call site when you re actually defining the corresponding value of a type parameter

11174591
super	extends
whe you a declare a reference of type list at the call site you are allowed to provide a type argument for t which can be an invariant or a wildcard with super or with extends

11174598
for-loop	arrays
i have 2 functions running in a for-loop because i want to find the solution of the functions in random arrays

11174602
inherited	properties
so then i made them inherited abstractlistview which would in it s turn inherited from abstractview which would be the new class holding all the common properties for these tables

11174745
min	max
the biggest obstacle for me is that each variable has a different min max and step value

11174760
width	height
i have the same code for a full screen graph the hosting view is the same size as the parent uiview and its height and width are both fine

11174761
clang	llvm
apple s clang llvm distribution is customized as ildjarn pointed out.

11174762
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
a uinavigationcontroller keeps a list stack of the uiviewcontroller s you have pushed onto it and the automatic back button it displays takes you one step down in the stack

11174766
put	get
i ask for to put it on the list but if i ask for more than one all the list items get the last one

11174777
client-side	server-side
the distinction here is between server-side and client-side code

11174780
width	height
i am curious to know if someone has a way of finding the exact dimensions width and height in pixels of a html element on a given page

11174780
width	height
particularly the width because often times the stylesheet denotes the height already

11174796
awt	swing
this is done for awt but should be avoided for swing

11174800
public	protected
i have a page or set of pages that are not intended for public distribution i just make sure to make them password protected

11174862
hide	show
to hide and show controls i would either recommend using expanders as your comment says you ve done or grids and setting their visibility as needed

11174895
crypt	salt
the short answer is use crypt with a salt beginning with the characters 2a a two digit cost parameter and 22 digits from the alphabet . 0-9a-za-z

11174900
serializable	deserialization
if this is the case you ll have to add actual methods to mypoint do the serializable and probably the deserialization too

11174911
mocha	node.js
this is probably due to the fact that mocha was first meant to support node.js

11174955
folder	directory
anyway enough pretense what i want to do is take sub1.domain.com and make it automatically use another folder outside of root as the default loading directory

11174956
post	get
did i get this wrong or did every post so far here answer a question that you didn t ask

11174992
min	max
it seems from your comments and code that the sorting routine is just supposed to print the min and max values of

11174997
preorder	inorder
python 2.7 i need to print the bfs of a binary tree with a given preorder and inorder and a max lenght of the strings of preorder and inorder

11175000
lxml	beautifulsoup
try using mechanize or beautifulsoup or lxml

11175006
ubuntu	linux	capistrano	rvm
my environment rails 3.2.x with rvm passenger apache on linux ubuntu i am not using capistrano and not intending to do so for the time being

11175058
implements	extends
why hashmap extends abstractmap and implements map

11175098
apache	nginx
you probably already have apache or another instance of nginx bound to port 80

11175102
preorder	inorder
i guess essentially the question is how to get all the parent-leftchild pairs and parent-rightchild pairs of the tree from given preorder and inorder

11175102
preorder	inorder
for your example preorder abcde inorder cbdae

11175102
preorder	inorder
b is right after a in preorder and b is in front of a in inorder thus b is the left child of a

11175102
preorder	inorder
d is right after c in preorder but d is also after c in inorder thus d is not the left child of c

11175146
keydown	keyup
try to set the value on keyup keydown and blur event of the textbox

11175163
google-chrome	safari
for some reason safari can t use the tags for swapping between songs but google-chrome can

11175163
google-chrome	safari
just changing what gets loaded into the src attribute on the tag works on both google-chrome and safari but then there is the ogg vs

11175163
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	mp3	ogg
mp3 issue is to use modernizr does feature detection to load the ogg mime-type in firefox and the mp3 in google-chrome safari

11175230
16-bit	64bit
one transaction for word of size 8-bit 16-bit 32-bit 64bit or two

11175230
cpu	processors
both cache and local memory - are closer to the processors or gpu than dram main memory - whether that be the gpu s private dram or the cpu s system memory

11175265
throttling	throttle
since i assume you won t need the flexibility for the blacklist but might for the throttling use iptables to blacklist and use nginx to throttle

11175275
sorting	grouping	sorting	filtering	filtering	grouping
unfortunately there s no support for sorting a collection view in win8 nor filtering or grouping

11175301
uiview	subviews
or if there are a group of subviews that are always going to move together you could put them in a container uiview and thus move a whole bunch of them by just moving their container view

11175326
width	font-size
i think i know the drill for regular screens set body s font-size to some percentage mark your main content element with width being 70em and min-width 40em.

11175346
gridview	repeater	gridview	datalist	datalist	repeater
nested gridview or datalist repeater is what you need

11175346
gridview	rowdatabound
handle the rowdatabound event of parent gridview to bind its child elements controls

11175360
division	addition
in addition to be shown above i want to display the total number of employees in each division and the percent completion in each division too

11175378
google-chrome	firefox
this happens in firefox google-chrome and internet explorer

11175429
getter	setter
you need to add getter and setter in your java bean

11175439
inline-functions	inlining
when inline-functions are called recursively which compiler option determines the depth of inlining until it follows the normal function call mechanism

11175439
inline-functions	inlining
if the inline-functions is invoked inside a for-loop does the same depth of inlining come into the picture

11175452
put	get
where to put the select scope_identity statement if i want to get the last inserted identity i put it inside other insert into query but i get nothing

11175453
int	double
if i have a class with a property a non-nullable double or int - can i read and write the property with multiple threads

11175477
put	get
once you answer all these questions you can just write each one as a single case by pattern matching on the list and put them together to get your add function

11175477
put	get
you have to use the let statement to get the list out of the listbag so that you can put the tuple you didn t touch back in front of it

11175478
quicksort	heapsort
introsort begins with quicksort and switches to heapsort when the recursion depth exceeds a level based on the number of elements being sorted

11175485
post	get
in my post json call i get id s for the categories like this where 1 and 4 is the ids

11175485
inherited	properties
i have a custom post model object that inherited from nsmanagedobject in it i have a properties for categories like this

int	double
if i have a class with a property a non-nullable double or int - can i read and write the property with multiple theads

11175487
int	chars
reads and writes of the following data types are atomic bool chars byte sbyte short ushort uint int float and reference types

11175489
folder	directory
or do i need to copy the sound file out of my www directory and into my resources folder and access it there

11175513
atomic	interlocked
these operations are not atomic that s why the interlocked class exists in the first place with methods like increment int32 and increment int64

11175532
inline-functions	inlining
when inline-functions are called recursively which compiler option determines the depth of inlining until it follows the normal function call mechanism

11175640
quicksort	heapsort
the point at which the introsort algorithm switches from quicksort to heapsort is determined by depth_limit

11175640
quicksort	heapsort
when depth_limit reaches 0 it switches from quicksort to heapsort

11175664
quicksort	heapsort
algorithm switches to heapsort from quicksort to keep the worst case

11175681
post	put
if i put self loaddata after the line with the post the app crashes probably because the post is not yet finished and there is a conflict

11175681
nsobject	nsmanagedobject
i am using an nsmanagedobject to save the data but sending a newly created nsobject communityotherprofile back to the server

11175778

this way the user can get a post in the normal way

11175814
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
using a responsive caroufredsel works like a charm in google-chrome firefox but in safari it is suddenly producing top and bottom margins of 800px throwing everything off

11175841
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
then uiviewcontroller has a property navigationcontroller to access this uinavigationcontroller and push pop other view controllers to the stack

11175862
put	get
here s my take on it with caching of the selectors that get recalled and the obvious closure scope which is why i put the in there you will have better overall performance

11175908
free	malloc
another reason is this might try to free something which is not allocated by malloc

11175958
firefox	safari
this works in safari but not in firefox where it gives me a invalid range in character class

11175966
button	checkbox
the activity starts you disable the first checkbox one button button 2 is added to the layout you change the screen orientation and button 2 added in the onclicklistener method disappears

11175981
crypt	hash
here s how i hash my password using phps crypt method

11175995
floating-point	integer
the finite nonzero values of any floating-point value set can all be expressed in the form s â m â 2 e - n + 1 where s is +1 or -1 m is a positive integer less than 2n and e is an integer between emin - 2k-1-2 and emax 2k-1-1 inclusive and where n and k are parameters that depend on the value set

11176020
crypt	salt	crypt	hash	hash	salt
take a look at the php documentation for crypt as you are not supplying a salt value you will get strage results often ending up with the hash of one value not matching with another hash of the same value

11176068
cvs	svn
you are suffering from cvs svn habits in your work-flow and especially from the big patch mindset

11176068
pull	push
so instead of code code code code push pull merge scream you should do something more manageable

11176068
changeset	cherry-pick
if you start treating git commits as patches and branches as patch queues you ll end up with a work-flow where people can cherry-pick or merge small changeset among repositories without getting a migraine

11176071
qabstractlistmodel	qmodelindex
this is the most important thing to realize when working with qabstractlistmodel in qt mentally replace qmodelindex with int row ignore everything else it has an invalid qmodelindex has

11176071
qabstracttablemodel	qmodelindex
same for qabstracttablemodel mentally reduce the qmodelindex to int row int column

11176071
qmodelindex	qabstractitemmodel
the only time you need the full qmodelindex including its internalpointer or internalid is when you implement a tree model qabstractitemmodel

11176112
submit	submission
also for submission the form i am using a link as i have added some effect to it and if i use input type submit for this it will get formatted with uniform

since the properties do not support async await modifiers as far as i know iâ m struggling to implements a proper solution

11176387
nsstring	nsdata
this class is intended for storing only small amounts of data using the property list object types nsnumber nsstring nsdate nsdata nsarray or nsdictionary

11176431
cat	tee
assuming you can cat your input from a file or just using the tee part if you want it interactive-ish you could use something like this

11176448
put	get
is get put from a non-direct bytebuffer faster than get put from direct bytebuffer

11176450
inherited	properties
in experimenting with this i noticed that if you want to make a baseviewcontroller that implements this functionality to work for everything that inherited from it you have to attach another view on top of the uiviewcontroller s view properties in order to get it to work

11176501
foreground	tray
the former is used for something more than just an icon and in most cases which is very system dependent a background process and placed by the user into the tray bar where your tray icon is put in the system tray bar by a foreground application.

11176523
submit	submission
examples include html form submission and the jquery submit function

11176566
put	get
if you want to role-your-own the simplest way would be to simply put checks in your controller that makes sure they get redirected if they try to look at a profile that isn t theirs

11176664
uitableview	reloaddata
all fine but now i would like to change the displayed data using the reloaddata method of uitableview

11176698
int	chars
in my program i compare chars against hexadecimal int and i get different results for

11176735
int	chars
although int promotions will still happen to both operands of at least they will happen in the same way and you will not be depending on the signedness of your chars of the size of your int or unsigned int

11176735
int	chars
i believe that it is common for arm compilers to make chars unsigned which means that when xcc is promoted to an int you get the value 0xcc not 0xffffffcc

11176777
integer	unsigned
the equality operator performs integer promotions of both operands so the difference of the behavior when is considered as signed sign extension is performed or unsigned no sign extension is performed

11176784
free	malloc
malloc error for object 0x12df1810 pointer being free was not allocated

11176819
post	get
it was looking so odd simply because the cache is only parsed on get calls and ignored on post calls

11176834
opera	firefox
it won t make a big difference in firefox and webkit but will show up correctly in opera

11176863
google-chrome	firefox
i have tried see code below but of course at least in google-chrome and in firefox it doesn t work as expected

11176885

hash	md5
i have a python program that takes the md5 sha1 hash values of passwords and searches for them on the internet using google s custom search api

11177014
button	checkbox
also avoid using variable names such as checkbox label submit button etc since they would create problems which becomes hard to find

11177017
put	get
next we want to get the response and put it into an object model that makes it easy to work with

11177020
voip	sip
it is not possible because voip call pass through internet and via sip server

11177201
hide	show
in fact if i use the first syntax to hide the nav bar then i cannot use the second syntax to show it it simply won t do anything

11177201
hide	show
moreover the first syntax to show hide the nav bar always works for me while the second syntax works some times but not always

11177239
inherited	properties	inherited	subclassing
since uinavigationbar is a subclassing of uiview it inherited the hidden bool properties no way of changing it to protected or private

11177239

versioning	upgrade
i was using eclipse when it said that my versioning 10 sdk needs to be upgrade to above 17 so i upgrade to the latest vestion on sdk tools versioning 19

11177595
children	parent
i don t think it s a bubbling issue because the event is bound to the parent element and not to the children

11177643
int	boolean
as i said in my comment the reason your current example won t compile is because file.mkdir returns a boolean and comparable.compareto comparable returns an int

11177681
put	get
i get no out put

11177699
mouse	keyboard
when i physically click on the arrows with my mouse everything works just fine but for some reason when using the keyboard it doesn t work

11177864
hash	salt
is a combination of the salt and the hash

11177864
hash	salt
the remaining characters are the hash when used with the 2a algorithm cost of 10 and the given salt

11177864
hash	salt
the reason for the salt is so an attacker cannot pre compute bcrypt hash in order to avoid paying the cost of generating them

11177866
hash	salt
bcrypt stores the salt in the password hash

11177866
hash	salt
those are two different hash of the same password with two different salt

11177866
hash	salt
when verifying the passwords bcrypt will read the salt from the hash field then re-compute the hash using that salt

11177874
nullreferenceexception	invalidoperationexception
no value but no nullreferenceexception and then oops invalidoperationexception

11177885

i ve been creating a video games website in mcv 3 using visual studio and am having trouble figuring out how to pass a id from my page to a pop-up dialog to display the correct developer from my database

11178203
hide	show
when you click the button it actually hide the element at first but the event propagate up to the parent element at which you catch the click and show it again

11178204
hide	show
you should use jquery .show and hide to show hide elements

11178209
draggable	droppable
these proxy elements are made draggable and droppable

11178243
dictionary	map
if making a specialist dictionary map kind of class should one subclass from python s dictionary or from java s hashmap or treemap etc

11178248
google-chrome	firefox
i get identical results with firefox google-chrome and ie so i guess it s somethign related to the generated kml file but i have no clue what s wrong

11178257
getter	setter
as far as the second question about properties consider that the role of synthesize is to create for you the setter getter methods based on the attributes you assigned to the property

11178257
getter	setter
the advantage of this approach with respect to the default one is that you cannot confuse accessing to a property using the setter getter methods and the ivar directly that is you cannot make possible mistakes like

11178356
groupbox	panel
a label panel groupbox can contain other control like button but textbox cant

11178367
for-loop	arrays
is there any functions that produce the output return value at corresponding indices without using for-loop through each element of arrays

11178398

while on the grub menu line of the kernel you wish to boot press e to temporary edit it and delete options such as quiet and splash but leave the readonly

11178467
put	get
how you get it into a namespace i m really not sure - perhaps put it in a module then making names up now from random_testing import random instead of the normal import random

11178485
winbugs	openbugs
winbugs or openbugs can be called from within r. i will append the code to this answer as i go along

11178488
width	height
try this for variable width and height you will need to use some javascript

11178505
directx	directwrite
i m considering maybe using directwrite for a project that will be coming in a directx 11 version and a opengl 3.1+ version

11178505
direct3d	direct2d	direct3d	directwrite	direct3d	directx	directx	direct2d	directx	directwrite	directwrite	direct2d
from what understand directwrite uses direct2d which sits on top of direct3d 10.1 until directx 11.1 is released

11178505
direct3d	directwrite
this means that to use directwrite with direct3d 11 currently i would have to create one direct3d 10.1 device and a direct3d 11 device and then share the resources between these two devices which comes with some synchronization overhead it seems

11178505
directwrite	direct2d
i m not that familiar with either directwrite and direct2d as you can probably tell

11178543
post	get
you could pass request parameters as a query string in the get request url or in the post request body

11178564
rar	zip
in one of my applications a user can upload images and archives zip rar

11178582
jena	rdflib
jena and sesame are you best bets for implementations both in java but for prototyping python rocks and rdflib is the must use tool there

11178597
unsigned	short
because server sent 149 as unsigned short 2 bytes

11178597
unsigned	short
instead of this i would like to receive unsigned short ofc after restarting my application

11178625
hide	show
right now when the page loads the default drop down is show however once you hover over other menu items if they dont have a drop down menu it show the default one and hide and if you quickly go over the the menu item it will keep repeating the animation

11178652
post	get
any idea how i could get the dropdownlist selected value when a post back is being triggered click of the button

11178668
post	get
the question is how i get the post data that is sent to the action from within the authorizeattribute

11178671
post	get
render that action in your view based on the panelid and call that action via ajax to get the new html rather than doing a full form post

11178672
codeigniter	yii
my projection is to build a web service that can be read on my android apps and any web framework like codeigniter or yii but i want it to be implemented on android first

11178734
ant	maven
ant is a good start but you may also want to look at apache ivy or maven as these will help a bit with managing your build outputs and dependencies

11178736
free	malloc
of course if you malloc some pointer inside a loop you usually want to free that pointer at the end of the body of the loop

11178736
free	malloc
you could use boehm s conservative garbage collector to avoid them by using gc_malloc instead of malloc and not bothering for free -ing explicitly memory

11178763
interbase	bde
you have other installers around like interbase and bde on windows 7 or bde installer on these embarcadero days

11178771
getter	setter
there a getter and setter for string response and query have been written not showed here

11178811
width	height
finally my layout is just a textview with nothing special just width and height

11178837
width	height
and call this drawable to a relative layout or something as background also specifying its layout height and layout width in xml

11178857
jobs	cron
so what i was thinking about is a proxy script so instead of doing the above cron jobs i would do something like

11178858
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i m trying to use a php captcha to validate a contact form on a site and i ve hit a brick wall for the past few days where the form works fine on firefox google-chrome safari but not ie

min	max
i find the max and the min of the 50 images and then pass each image into the formula to normalize the image

11178925
range	max
although the range of the images is 0 1 but the max of the image is

11178925
min	max
find the max and min between them

11178972
folder	directory
the easiest way is probably to set up a project directory and within it a jni folder with an android.mk and your c sources - use the hello-jni ndk sample as a guide

11179002
awt	swing
why are you using awt components in your swing gui

11179004
realloc	malloc
a safer solution would be to use a dynamic array with malloc and realloc

11179043
apache	nginx
maybe you could through a reverse proxy in front of twisted and use http auth from the web app and delegate authentication itself to kerberos via an apache or nginx module

11179085
box-sizing	border-box
for example if your has padding you will have to account for it or use the css property box-sizing border-box

11179119
viewdidload	viewwillappear
then declare their properties in viewwillappear or viewdidload the code you wrote basically

11179130
serializable	deserialization
so i would recommend you use a proper serializable library like binary or cereal to do serializable and deserialization

11179175
ienumerator	idisposable	implements	extends
that s simple for which extends idisposable but as ienumerator doesn t the compiler inserts a check to test at execution time whether the iterator implements idisposable

11179175
ienumerable	ienumerator
as noted in comments a type can also implement ienumerable or explicitly but have a public getenumerator method which returns a type other than ienumerator

11179238
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome my article slowly grows to the new size only in firefox it instantly resizes itself with no animation is there a way to have this animate

11179253
toggleclass	slidetoggle
toggleclass will not animate you should go for slidetoggle or .animate method

11179324
vmware	virtualbox
from this iso you can create either a vmware or virtualbox image

11179358

11179395
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
i am creating a userscript and in opera it works like a charm but in firefox and google-chrome it gives the following error

11179395
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
does anyone have an idea why it works in opera but not in google-chrome or firefox

11179439
post	get
i agree to get any blame here for such incorrect using of the sending post and waiting for more then 2 hours for response

11179446
int	double
the idea is to use big int math to compute the power of the int part of the exponent then use double 64-bit floating point math to compute the power of the fractions part

11179455
post	get
first of all you don t need to use a session var one alternative to do this is passing the post id using a get argument something like this

11179496
google-chrome	firefox
userscripts in firefox and google-chrome are sandboxed the page context and the script context are completely different

11179526
pop-up	dialog
device address and channel are correct as i can tell since when running this test android pop-up a dialog asking if i allow the other device to access it s contacs

11179547
google-chrome	firefox
the above snippet works fine in firefox and google-chrome

11179635
jobs	cron
as an alternative to a cron job polling your mysql database every minute you could try using a task queue like beanstalk which allows you to launch asynchronous jobs

11179635
jobs	cron
really for this purpose if there aren t many many jobs that are going to be scheduled this way and your mysql table is relatively small it s probably simpler to go the mysql cron route

11179698
for-loop	loops
also you should probably remove the do loops as it is redundant the for-loop should be doing what you want i think

11179712
hide	show
this code just cuts more characters but i want to hide them and show in expander

11179737
folder	directory
in my rails 3.2 models directory i have a folder foo containing two classes

fadein	fadeout
try using fadein and fadeout from jquery to make things disappear progressively

11179761
width	height
instead i engineer all of my master images to have width and height dimensions that are a multiple of at least 24 - the lcm least common multiple of the integers above

11179797
width	height
setting the width or height of a canvas even if you are setting it to the same value as before not only clears the canvas but resets the entire canvas context

11179825
pull	push
push pull

11179827
alarmmanager	wakelock
in terms of the available timing methods a major consideration should be if you intend the device to wakeup from sleep to accomplish events in which case you should use the alarmmanager if you intend to keep the device awake in which case you should use a wakelock or if you are okay with your events happening only when the device is awake and your service or activity is running in which case you can use a simple timer

11179860
hide	show
iâ m letting the user show hide the statusbar at will and i want all the views to slide down up with it

11179867
width	height
text-overflow ellipsis only works if you have a defined width height constraint and overflow hidden

11179942
webkit	gecko
i guess you ll have to then set up your own service and host a layout engine gecko webkit or trident in a way it can generate page thumbnails for you

11179945
int	chars
int main int argc chars argv

11179954
x86	64bit
you need to install the x86 version if the target machine is 32 bit or the x64 version if the target machine is 64bit and your application is built with configuration any cpu

11179972
bsd	xnu
the class can be mach bsd or something else see here in the xnu source and is shifted 24 bits to the left

11179987
ffmpeg	handbrake
it seems that in my research using programs like handbrake ffmpeg it is recommend to check of web optimized there is also a similar type of setting when exporting from other types of software like imovie

11179998
air	flashdevelop
i m using flashdevelop with flexsdk 4.5.1 en air sdk 3.0

11180008
width	height
you could give the elements smaller width and height values with media queries

11180028
hash	md5
my goal is to use the result of an md5 result to index a hash table

11180028
hash	md5
when i printed the result i got a different number every time for the same md5 hash

11180028
hash	md5
the md5 hash is initially an unsigned char

11180084
int	chars
int chars ...

11180127
folder	directory
is there a way to make this directory real without adding the folder and an index file

11180140
free	malloc
note take care of null check for the malloc return value and also dont forget to free the allocated memory after printf in main function

11180141
hash	md5
an md5 hash is a 128 bit number

11180141
int	chars
given that your function takes the 128 bit hash as a chars string you need to parse that string into a series of 4 int

11180158
explode	implode
i would suggest using implode explode with a character that you know will not be contained in any of the individual array items

11180161
range	minimum
for your case double the range is 0 1 not because that s the minimum and maximum value but because that is conventional and double data types have a special representation that make this range quite reasonable

11180161
min	max
if you have data is small or larger than the min and max will be quite different than what matlab thinks is good for pictures

11180161
range	max	range	min	min	max
this should demonstrate why the matlab range is 0 1 but your min max is different----that is fine and your normalization code will fix everything between zero and one

11180176
jobs	cron
now when the cron jobs crash while working there is the risk that a time slot contains wrong data when the jobs restarts next time

11180209
spaces	delimiter
i d probably strtok each line using spaces as the delimiter then do some validation on the data to make sure it is what you think

11180235
calloc	malloc
we use to allocate dynamic memory malloc or calloc for each nodes separately

11180235
calloc	malloc
if we call malloc or calloc frequently for small small memory may affects to performance of the system

11180238
hide	show
what i m trying to do is make it so that when a main category is clicked on the list underneath it hide or show

11180249
union	distinct
the union is the merge part of your mergeanddistinctlist and the distinct ehh the distinct part

11180256
min	max
this value will between min and max which defaults to 0 and 1 respectively

11180256
min	max
you should set min max and sliderstep to what you want

11180277
stdout	stderr
the code below works for reference but relies on the fact that wget generates output to stderr and pscp to stdout

11180316
hide	show
this is the code for show hide

11180326
min	max
this selects only one random row per value i need min 1 max 8 values for each value below andomar help me a lot but doesn t seems to work and it look complicated for what it is is that the only way i could do

11180389
post	get
assuming redmine is available at i can use curl and post with params username and password and get an answer

11180395
int	double
note that this is somewhat different though instead of an array of double s followed by an array of int s it gives you an array of one double followed by one int then the next double next int and so on

11180397
sqlcommandbuilder	sqldataadapter
i only create the sqlcommandbuilder passing it a sqldataadapter

11180397
sqlcommandbuilder	sqldataadapter
from the msdn -docs i get that the sqlcommandbuilder registers itself to the rowupdated event of the sqldataadapter

11180397
sqlcommandbuilder	sqldataadapter
is it bad practice to program a class like sqlcommandbuilder where the code doesn t indicate in any way that creating an instance is doing something with the sqldataadapter passed in

11180412
google-chrome	safari
remember also to use the -moz- prefixes for your css3 declarations otherwise this is only gonna be working on google-chrome safari

11180413
post	get
as far as i m aware you can t do that and from reading other post it appears that there is an undocumented method but that would get you app rejected why not simply use a web view

11180491
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
based on what you are trying to do you would probably be better off creating a wrapper around everything with a 980px width and margin set to 0 auto then instead of forcing the header and left sidebar to be fixed just set a height on the content and make it overflow hidden and scrollable

11180516
put	get
i am easily able to get it installed and running however when i went to use it i found that i didnt have sufficient rights to put content there

11180528
oncreate	setcontentview
you shouldn t call setcontentview twice in your oncreate

11180542
move	drag
now when i drag the uipicker it works perfectly and the scrollview does not move at all unless i am clicking on that and dragging it

11180543
int	double
now how can we predict in advance if there are more than one int whose logarithm is 123456.78 up to the precision of system.double or if there is in fact no int whose logarithm hits that specific double the precise result of an ideal pow function being an irrational number

11180543
int	double
in our example there will be very many int giving the same double 123456.78 because the factor where epsilon is the smallest positive number such that 123456.78 + epilon has a representation as a double different from the representation of 123456.78 itself is big enough that there will be very many int between the true answer and the true answer multiplied by m

11180544
for-loop	arrays
i have created 5 instances of the class in an object arrays as well and would like to print the attributes out with a for-loop

11180584
children	parent
a category may have a parent and many children

11180606
rspec	capybara
i m just getting started learning rspec and capybara

11180633
int	double
for example i would like to generate the following code from the definition of the structure sensor_t that contains one int and two double

11180633
typedef	struct
the code displayed is the direct conversion of a typedef c struct to a c hdf5 structure

11180668
hide	show
is there a way i can get this to show when i click the submit button then once the page has loaded hide it again

11180686
min	max
just remember that you should be normalizing each image on its own i.e compute the min max in the formula for the image itself not from the entire group of images

11180686
min	max
if you look back at the solution i proposed the images were stored in a cell array and the computation was done using cellfun to get min max of each image separately

11180686
min	max
i should add that the type of linear transformation we performed above is called min max normalization but it s certainly not the only kind see this answer for other examples

11180783
button	checkbox
or how does the default checkbox button

11180788
int	double
linearstep is a double but your x is an int

11180791
shadowbox	lightbox
now i want to open links which are in this post in shadowbox lightbox like

11180828
pull	push
perhaps create a new branch starting at the point at which your code diverges from that on the company server then pull ranges of commits from your branch in stages and push after each range is pulled

11180863
jar	war
when zipped the jar and war into a zip then try to deploy to cloud foundry it gives me an out of memory error

11180882
getter	setter
could you provide an example of how one would represent a player class with mutable properties such as hp and position 3d vector functions such as init setter and getter

11180887
ssl	https
standard http request over ssl https

11180926
textview	simplecursoradapter
i have a simple listview with a textview and an editview that is populated using the simplecursoradapter from a sqlite query

11180930
for-loop	arrays
what is the correct way to init the entire arrays instead of running a for-loop

11180940
put	get
we can use put and get methods just like map

11180941
google-chrome	firefox
my code is perfectly working in google-chrome but not in ie9 and firefox

11180980
jar	.war
services depend on code which is currently packaged into .war file so in pom.xml for jar file i specify the following dependency

11180980
jar	.war
but to package the .war archive i also need to specify a dependency for the jar like this

11181004
implements	modifiers
...and you wouldn t need to write the ugly override modifiers when implements lteq

11181009
getter	setter
as for getter setter - just use the normal map manipulation functions

11181009
getter	setter
there is often no need for getter setter in cases when you are just manipulating standard clojure data

11181068
children	parent
since i wanted to delete all the children for a particular parent from the database i wrote the following function in childrepository

11181068
fflush	gets
our code is setup so that the fflush gets called at end of request

11181089
post	get
note you should also be able to get away without passing the post id as get_post_custom calls get_the_id id post id is not passed

11181100
post	get
if i updated the model on the first post sent it back to the view with new values should i not get that code stored in a hidden input in the view available and being able to post it back again to the action

11181113
google-chrome	firefox
but in firefox and google-chrome it actually showed an error with method 1

11181134
implements	extends
if a behavior needs to be attached to a model it may also extends from cmodelbehavior or cactiverecordbehavior which implements additional features specifc for models

11181134
getter	setter
the properties include both the public member variables and the properties defined via getter and or setter of the behavior

11181142
postgresql	mysql
though it s not essential for the question context is sometimes useful i ll be building this with django and the db backend will be either postgresql or mysql suggestions about choice here also welcome though not main focus of question

11181162
free	malloc
that said i can t find a c function that allows me to malloc and free from an arbitrary buffer

11181181
free	malloc
this allows it to detect some errors that regular free does not normally detect though the gnu c library version of malloc et al does seem to do some sanity checking that others do not necessarily do

11181198
oncreate	ondestroy
for all activities that want to use the socket connection bind your network service in oncreate then after the activity is finish ed unbind it in ondestroy

11181208
client-side	server-side
is it a good idea to use it on the client-side together with pytextile on the server-side

11181254
bash	zsh
when you install a gem with a bin directory it is automatically added to path in zsh and bash

11181254
bash	zsh
to manually edit the in the manner alluded to in the question would be platform-dependant and somewhat difficult to achieve bash vs zsh vs tsch startup files for example and windows vs os x vs linux vs environmental variables all vary quite greatly and would also be in my humble opinion slightly rude

11181319
free	malloc
itâ s so simple itâ s really silly but its performance will scream in comparison to simply using malloc and free all the time..

11181319
free	malloc
you could modify the approach above to not start with any global static array at all and use malloc at first when the user calls particlealloc but when particles are returned don t call free but instead add the returned ones to the linked list of unalloc ed particles

11181319
free	malloc
then the next caller to particlealloc will get one off the list of free particles rather than use malloc

11181319
free	malloc
any time there are no more on the free list your particlealloc function could then fall back on malloc

11181334
google-chrome	firefox
it needs to work with a userscript - a real extension is not an option since i d prefer not to maintain two different versions for firefox and google-chrome

11181351
implements	extends
however from the code you posted it looks like you are confusing extends the midlet class with implements the displayable interface

11181358
ostringstream	std
use std ostringstream as already commented with the io manipulators

11181381
boost	allocator
look at boost s pool allocator library

11181381
boost	allocator
if so the pool allocator functions from boost will work really well and you don t have to write your own

11181393
hide	show
i would like to completely hide the progress circle show during the execution of an asynctask code below - whilst showing a progress dialog

11181430
keydown	keyup
note that keydown and keyup provide a code indicating which key is

11181430
keydown	keyup
example a lowercase a will be reported as 65 by keydown and keyup

11181432
hex	binary
by dumping the hex into a binary and reading it with readelf -a because i am lazy

11181452
hash	salt
you should hash qwerty + salt

11181473
persistent	transient
i m new in the work with the orm s and this question occurred for me that what the persistent model in nhibernate and what the difference between transient object and persistent object

11181502
tcplistener	tcpclient
i have always worked with only one tcpclient and one tcplistener

11181562
centos	linux
i m using a centos 6.2 and i m actually an experienced linux user

11181608
hide	show
i m new to jquery and javascript so i made this simple script to show and hide a paragraph and to change the button texts whenever clicked

11181660
pop-up	dialog
upon completion of the required asynchronous server stuff the facebook twitter whatever auth dialog pop-up

11181661
hide	show
i m using a ternary conditional instead of an if statement to determine what the show hide text should be because in this very simple case i consider it more readable

11181679
hide	show
i tried to detect if user load page with url or in both ways i get the same direct address link so i cant detect if user view my app via facebook and i need to hide scrollbar or view it on site and i need to show scrollbar

11181731
mousemove	mousedown	mousemove	mouseup	mouseup	mousedown
i m using a combination of mousedown mousemove and mouseup to try to track the drag

11181731
mouseup	mouseleave
the drag starts well enough but soon after the mouseleave the tag it just seems to baulk and mouseup doesn t register as it should

11181731
mouseup	mousedown
the logic works as it should if i return false after mouseup and mousedown - ie

11181731
move	drag
i can move the mouse far and wide after mousedown and watch for event.y being 10 and there s no baulk - but then the code does not have the desired effect of the user being able to drag the tag

11181786
beanstalk	amazon-web-services
i used eclipse to deploy my java web application on amazon-web-services elastic beanstalk which uses a unix 64-bit environment

11181791
google-chrome	safari
this only happens in webkit google-chrome and safari

11181845
cpu	processors
based on diagnostics that you find in any of the above mentioned tools most sorted solution to resolve the issue will be to either to add more ram or add power to your cpu processors

11181875
padrino	ruby-on-rails
i have just switched to ruby-on-rails from padrino sinatra so the routing stuff puzzles me

11181923
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i m also only really concerned about the big 3.1 browsers ie firefox webkit google-chrome safari and opera

11181949
put	get
when i run it in console app i get the user s sid as s-1-5-21-670676956-2645971461-1681047478-500 but when i put the above line in a windows service i get a different sid s-1-5-18 i understand that windows service runs as a different account

11181951
cos	sin
this will preserve continuity of sin x and cos x better than modulo for high values of x especially in single precision float

11181954
google-chrome	firefox
seems to work on both firefox and google-chrome

11181970
folder	directory
i got a solution from the nb platform email list i just have to create a directory called release and copy the additional files to this folder or a subdirectory

11181975
stdout	stderr
bash being a shell has 2 streams you can redirect that output data stdout and stderr because this output needs to be redirected somewhere linux has a specific discard everything node reachable through dev null

11181975
stdout	stderr
these streams are represented by numbers 1 for stdout and 2 for stderr

11182005
setcontentview	findviewbyid
as aneal says you cannot call findviewbyid before the setcontentview the reason for this is that the xml layout has not been loaded yet and so findviewbyid will return null

11182014
int	double
you are trying to print an int with a format for double s or float s

11182082
oncreate	ondestroy
in layout b i saved everything in ondestroy then oncreate i check whether layout a s data is the same so i can rebuild the layout b again

11182084
mouseover	mouseout
i think you can bind mouseout and mouseover with the same callback closure and detect which event is inside the closure with something like

11182114
int	double
all i need is an int double of the progress which i can feed to my jsf progress bar component as a out of 100

11182116
salt	md5
i m a little confused - why are you storing passwords as plaintext and then converting them to md5 using a salt

11182120
hide	show
in my case i was using dynamic classes to show hide content iscroll can t calculate go nuts and dies until a resize wakes it up

11182134
superclass	subclassing
i m declaring it in a superclass and i want it to be useful in all subclassing

11182143
put	get
if you want to do it like this you will definitely want to put your procedures in modules because that way you automatically get explicit interfaces which are required for passing around such arrays of user defined type

11182145
put	get
this fine because if i put an uiiamgeview below table view to see if it works or not it seems i get the correct image it works

11182156
google-chrome	firefox
if you re working in two environments for example a mac side and a windows side and the discrepancy appears in the windows side only in whichever browser you try that supports web fonts ie 6+ firefox 3.5+ google-chrome 4.2+ etc

11182163
portrait	landscape
and it is only show part of the whole image s height about until half of the image on portrait and just a piece of it from top to bottom on landscape

11182163
portrait	landscape
i d like the live wallpaper to look nice and get to fit the phone s screen on both portrait and landscape mode

11182163
switching	screens
and it only keeps working when i switching screens

11182163
switching	screens
to be more specific in this issue is that when you set it it animates but stops suddenly by half of the cycle when you switching screens it keeps working a little bit more meaning it advances a little on the sequence

11182169
int	double
is there any good way to write a handler that will cast an int to an int a double to a double string to a string.

11182177
children	parent
typical problem - i am trying to save new parent object with nested new ienumerable of child objects which all have reference columns to store the parent id but i can t get nhibernate configured properly to save the children objects

11182219
apache	nginx
i m really just getting into linux and serving websites using tools like apache and nginx and i m having a hard time finding the definitive source for these issues

11182285
ubuntu	linux
i want to install ubuntu in my system and try to run the project in ubuntu with linux opengl es 2.0 emulator emulator for linux from eclipse

11182295
hash	md5
the shortest useful hash algorithm would be md5

11182295
hash	md5
md5 generates 16 bytes 128 bit hash

11182312
gridview	rowdatabound
you can also solve this issue without having to display the id field in your gridview by using the e.row.dataitem in your rowdatabound like so

11182322
children	parent
a goal has exactly one parent and an activity has one or more goal children

11182325
folder	directory
i have a rename tool that sets a folder directory however i created some jcheckbox and i want them to be able to change the directory depending on which is selected

11182337
folder	directory
is there anyway to have a bootstrapper referenced from another location - say a folder committed through svn without loosing the bootstappers stored in the default directory

11182370
opera	google-chrome
not sure if this is the evil option you were referring to but there s a column-span property though it looks like it s only supported by google-chrome and opera at present

11182390
hash	md5
shortest useful hash algorithm would be md5

11182390
hash	md5
md5 this string will be hash

11182390
hash	md5
raw md5 this string will be hash

11182411
implements	extends
implements a debug.getargumentinfo ... that extends the argument table with name key value pairs

11182429
hide	show
once i have this second class i want to hide or show other element who have that class

11182429
put	get
but i cant get this to work console doesnt show me any error and i ve put alert everywhere and it always show me what i want .

11182450
nsis	uninstaller
this is a very basic example you should look at the examples that ship with nsis for details about uninstaller and creating start menu shortcuts etc.

11182529
put	get
if you re trying to get the #sidebar and #content divs to have a background and want them to be identical in height try putting the background you d put on #sidebar on #main instead

11182535
pbkdf2	salt
i use the user supplied password and a random salt to generate a key using pbkdf2

11182551
lwjgl	slick2d
to keep it short sweet i have written an ant file that compiles my source code unjars the libraries for slick2d nifty etc zips that up into it s own jar and then copies the lwjgl native dlls into the same folder so the folder layout is something like this

11182615
oncreate	ondestroy	onresume	onpause
instead of using ondestroy oncreate you d better use onpause onresume because these are always called but a call to ondestroy might be missed here and there

11182616
google-chrome	safari
it does not work in google-chrome correctly but if you check for the browser you could just load it for safari

11182644
width	height
add table-layout fixed and you can reliably specify the width and height of the cells leaving no downside so far as i can see

11182667
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
i ve got a basic html drawing application using the jquery lib sketch.js which uses canvas works perfectly fine on ie opera google-chrome firefox on all desktop browsers

11182667
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
works fine on opera mobile google-chrome mobile firefox mobile dolphin hd android stock browser 2.2.4

11182678
int	double
you can code in support for conversions for example it might be useful to let the double handle allow assignment of int

11182696
versioning	upgrade
i recently upgrade my versioning of jquery ui though and this one particular image doesn t want to work

11182713
mouse	keyboard
for example if you or a library you use use random from an event handler for mouse keyboard or network events the nondeterministic ordering in which these events are handled could alter the sequence of numbers generated by your otherwise mainline code

11182719
subtract	add
with good consistent sign conventions on the transactions no ambiguity on whether to add or subtract - always add the values and appropriate constraints with limited number of types of transactions you can specify with constraints that all deposits are positive and all withdrawals are negative you can let the database ensure there are no anomalies like negative deposits

11182734
width	margin
masonry works best with fluid containers but i wanted a fixed width of 980px on my center main class ie margin 0 auto

11182780
put	get
i have used the following code able to get the image but when i am trying to put it on layout background linear layout the image quality gets reduced and it shows a blurred image

11182781
children	parent
i have looked around the internet and tried getchild though i am not positive symbols in other symbols mean they are children of them as well as putting movieclip parent .listname.data to try and reference it

11182812
jqvmap	jvectormap
jvectormap comes with more pre-generated maps than jqvmap

11182820
getter	setter
the model class also has some convenience getter setter so that you don t have to refer to the parameters by their row column

11182820
serializable	deserialization
adding a method to the model or adding serializable deserialization operators allows you to trivially take snapshots of the model and implement undo redo commit revert etc

11182830
cypher	gremlin
is there a way in neo4j using either cypher or gremlin to return a list of nodes that have a common set of nodes between them

11182837
post	get
i can t seem to get the post parameters to come through from an ajax javascript post

comparator	icomparer
well first off on the surface equals is a method present in every object while comparator and icomparer are interfaces

11193158
equals	gethashcode
equals is present in any class and can be overriden to provide equality testing depending on the context of the class it s a good practice to override gethashcode as well

11193158
equals	gethashcode
equals and gethashcode are usually given a different implementation in the context of searching or hashing

11193158
equals	icomparable	equals	compareto	icomparable	compareto
implementing icomparable is a more fine-grain way of comparison as it provides the compareto method which is a greater-than less-than comparison as opposed to equals which is simply a is-equal-or-not comparison

11193158
comparator	icomparer
icomparer is similar to comparator except that it works from the outside

11193161
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox

11193219
width	height
i am configuring xmonad and since i have to start a couple of dzen instances i decided that it could be better to use a function that takes the parameters for x and y position width height and text align

icomparer does pretty much the same as comparator except the logic is contained in separate class

11193257
google-chrome	firefox

11193379

for each of these difference images add all of the pixel based differences into a combined single numeric difference and store that into a 2d array sized to the dimension of x and y locations the thumbnail can possibly be placed within the scaled avatar image this will be smaller than the total avatar image size infact it will be width avatarwidth - thumbwidth and height avatarheight - thumbheight

11193752
width	height
instead you should save their coordinates width height value etc

11193760

this works for cpython pypy and jython

11195467
cpython	pypy
for c extension modules you can try pypy s cpyext but it won t run everything you might hope for because some cpython c extension modules wander into dark corners of cpython s c-based runtime

11195467
cpython	pypy
i sometimes write code that uses ctypes to interface with a c .so and then use that on both cpython and pypy because they both do pretty well with ctypes - but ctypes can be kinda slow on cpython

11195467
cpython	pypy
it comes from the pypy project i believe but it was made to work first on cpython

11195537

firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
tools like firebug and the element inspector in firefox or google-chrome safari really help with stuff like this -- you d see right away that your rules weren t even applying to the elements and then it would be a quick process of elimination to figure out that some typos were causing that

11195789
uiview	calayer

11196204
getter	setter
this would be an example for you making one player although you asked for something like an init a getter and a setter

11196204
getter	setter
i think it would unnecessary to make explicit getter and or setter because you could simply get any mutable data by dereferencing it and set any mutable data with swap

11196227
width	height
my center column should expand in height and width

11196227

set your screen backbuffer width and height to the 16 9 resolution

11196922
width	height
usually one sets up their game and their textures to work based on the relative dimensions of the current viewport or backbuffer width and height

11196922

width	margin
once we have the proper width the margin defined to auto will automatically center the cards to the desired position

11197216
int	chars
the problem is that i have declared instead of into the client and so the maximum value i can read with chars is 127...changed chars to int solved my problem

11197232
range	minimum	range	min
to set the minimum scale to the lowest value in the range use the min function

11197269
put	get
there are hacks you could put together on the receiving machine to get the ownership right -- run chmod -r apache website out of cron would be an effective but pretty kludgey option -- but instead i d recommend securely allowing rsync-over-ssh-as-apache

11197270
express	node.js
if you re trying to do this synchronously than you re defeating the whole idea behind node.js and express

11197280

double can exactly represent all int which fall in the domain of the power function

11197350
keydown	keyup
first to avoid the keypress repeat delay you have to wrap your program in a loop and make the state of the keyboard available inside the scope of that loop secondly to monitor multiple keypresses you need to keep track of individual keydown and keyup events

11197398
subtract	add
so on keypress add or subtract from x or y velocity

11197398
subtract	add

i made a very simple test form where i put a timer on it that would generate random numbers and add it to a datatable with a dataview and bindingsource and it works if all of those members are on the form but as soon as any piece of it is in a module it doesn t auto update just like my project

11197612

or you can set-up your server side controller to be able to differentiate between your store s load request read operations default to http get and it s sync requests create update and delete operations default as http post

11197612
post	get
there could be many different ways to go about doing this on the server side the way i usually do it is to have one sql stored procedure for get requests and one for post requests for any given store

11197612
post	get
i include the store name as an extra param and then my server side controller runs the appropriate stored procedure based on whether it is a get or a post request

11197615
put	get
usually you put extra info in the intent with putextras so the service will get any needed information to do its job

11197648

so i wrote a custom subclass of uiscrollview that basically displays rectangles in a 2-column grid but while the width of each is fixed to half the width of the iphone ipad screen the height varies depending on the dimensions of the picture within it

11199122
folder	directory
it is still displaying the sub directory in unicorn folder

11199145

11199175
memcached	apc
i have replaced the regular session with a singleton that stores session data in apc memcached as well as in db

11199175
memcached	apc
session data is saved in db only if i request it or if during handling of the request apc memcached stored session data indicates it wasn t written for a long enough time

11199175
memcached	apc
with this replacement you d be just forcing session save from db side fetch session ids of sessions that haven t been updated for x minutes from db fetch info from apc memcached for each of those and if there is no update info there either indicating session will end soon save it to db

versioning	upgrade

11199382
folder	directory
if you want to load from a directory you first gotta add the directory to the project with the create directory references so that in copy bundle resources you get a blue icon with the main folder name and not individual files

11199410
touchescancelled	touchesended
otherwise you need to override touchesended withevent and touchescancelled withevent

11199426
google-chrome	firefox
unfortunately the solution is only working on firefox and not google-chrome

11199465
nsinteger	nstimeinterval
i suspect that nstimeinterval values from nsdate would overflow an nsinteger

11199465
nsinteger	nstimeinterval
it looks like an nsinteger can store an nstimeinterval at least for the next couple of decades

11199479
equals	tostring
so if you want to use a default method from an interface that supersedes one of the methods from object like tostring or hashcode or equals then you have to call it explicitly with this new interface.super.method syntax

11199480

11199525
submit	submission
in fact it can be even simpler if this form is submission normally rather than being validated by javascript or sent through ajax then you can simply disable the input and not worry about reenabling it since the form will refresh or navigate away when the server completes processing the form submit

11199525
submit	submission
you shouldn t use the click event on a submit button to block form submission

11199540
gif	png
not being an expert on digital images i m still deciding on whether to convert uploaded images into jpeg or keep their original format jpeg png gif - gif will be converted into a still image in case the format gets converted

11199573
children	parent
for example here are sample parent children

11199573

the children of parent 27 would be 5944 2065 2066 2067 6248 6249 6250

11199578

for example png has better support for transparency than gif or jpeg

what i want to do is place my class files in folder within my class directory

11199591
pseudo-class	visited
use the link visited and active pseudo-class on the

11199592
gif	png
png and gif are better at compressing certain types of images basically blocky graphics while jpeg are better for photo-like images

11199592
gif	png
if your usage of the images can accept either type jpg png gif than i would suggest keeping them in the format that it receives

11199596
children	parent
why dont you change the type of where the parent is the key and the value list of ints is the children

11199641
put	get
if using queues make sure to get after you put

11199685
google-chrome	firefox
it works ok on firefox but it doesn t work on google-chrome neither wind or ubuntu chromium

11199690
hash	hmac	hash	salt
if you re wondering why i m calling the function poorly salt hash that s because this isn t a good way to salt a hash you should use a construct like hmac which is provided by the python hmac library

11199712
google-chrome	firefox
here is a screenshot of how it appears in google-chrome and firefox which is as i expected it to appear

11199712
google-chrome	firefox
so in google-chrome and firefox the yellow background of the active item will stretch past the grey gradient box

11199715
width	height
for example let s say you have an image which is width 500px and height 250px

11199718
getter	setter
the getter and setter of id is never called

11199737
uiview	subviews
the second problem is that i want these buttons and form elements to actually be added into the uiscrollview that s contained within the mdpopovercard view and not just right into the uiview s subviews array

11199740
width	margin
the selector #nav_mod_list div.current has a width of 210px as well as padding and margin where as the container is 200px

11199768

11199840
exponent	modulo
i m given public key exponent and modulo as well as the message and signature

11199840
exponent	modulo
when i list the resulting modulo and exponent from the key itself they have become reversed

11199843
width	height
in order to find the correct height and width of the picture you ll want to define a function to compare the max x and y values and update them based on the largest x y values found in the array

11199843
width	height
so now you ve got the max width and height for your image

11199863
width	margin
-the columns with medium data should be the size of their content with some margin on both sides i don t mind just throwing in a fixed width if it s too difficult to accomplish this

11199875
memcached	apc
if it is absolutely imperative that the data be generated every time that this gets called you could chunk the query into blocks of 100 rows caching the data on the filesystem or much better in apc wincache xcache memcached then on the final ajax call finalquery true loading the cache generating the pdf and clearing the cache

11199928
width	height
the imageview is inside a scrollview with only vertical scroll bar enabled which means the image should be resized with maximum width equal to that of the screen imageview in the mean time keeping the ratio not constrained on the resized height

11199965
punctuation	words
i wasn t taking into account punctuation after a words

11200325
width	height
apparently there is a maximum limit set to the height and width for an html5 canvas in ios

11200341
width	height
it s not a specific width height that is a problem it s the width multiplied by the height and the actual number is probably hardware specific

11200361

11200659
hash	salt
from my investigation it seemed that the salt is always 22 characters and the hash offset is 29 not 28 making it 31 characters in length not 32

11200659
hash	salt
this suggests that the salt portion of the returned hash is storing only significant bits so it may not always match your input salt

11200659
hash	salt
the benefit is that the hash can be used unaltered as the salt when verifying

11200659
crypt	salt	crypt	hash	hash	salt
thus you re better off only storing the complete hash returned by crypt and never the input salt you use initially

11200659
crypt	salt	crypt	hash	hash	salt
rolling your own salt is not a problem and knowing them by this i assume you meant store them separately to the hash is not necessary if you re storing crypt s output as-is

11201066
onmouseover	mouseout
i have several onmouseover events combination of javascript functions and jquery accordions but they seem to be overly sensitive to the exact location of the mouse to the point that it s making it either very difficult to trigger and or overly easy to mouseout and close the function making it very difficult to select something and or to inadvertently trigger the wrong function

the size of the object might be 16 bytes although probably implementation dependent while boolean will probably consume 4 bytes int is implicitly used

the value that you are passing is decimal 666 which corresponds to octal 01232 01210 after applying umask

11211398
inline	inlining
you can also suggest that a function should be inline using the inline keyword before a function note that it still doesn t actually force it and the compiler might decide to avoid the inlining .it s generally not such a good idea to do this manually as modern compilers tend to figure out the best possible inlinings on their own

to overcome this bug try and upgrade to the latest msf versioning 3.1

11211541
children	parent
when this transformation is applied on the following xml document containing two innerelement elements -- with different parent and at different depths -- whose children need the specialized processing

11211541
children	parent
finally we can modify the transformation even further so that it can process the children of differently named parent -- say innerelement and someotherinnerelement

11211541
children	parent
when this transformation is applied on the following xml document where the children to be processed in the required way have parent named with these two names innerelement and someotherinnerelement

11211593
superclass	subclassing
if you catch a superclass it will also catch all subclassing too

11211598
hide	show
the minimum and maximum value the domain extent are part of the domain path so one option is to set axis.ticks to zero to hide the ticks and only show the domain path

11211617
post	get
i have tried changing the post to a get returning the data in a few different ways creating classes etc. but i cant seem to figure out what the problem is

11211617
post	get
only the solution with jsonp seems to be agreed to do a correct get or post

11211669
opera	firefox
a side note firefox and opera actually throw a different more useful error message function.prototype.apply argarray is too large

11211697
min	max
i know theoreticaly that to achieve this i must enclose the placemarks in regions and set min and max pixels values but my problem starts when i try to create the region itself

11211715
hide	show
see however when i add the fields it fails to show hide with the checkbox

11211715
hide	show
any suggestions on how to show hide this div if the checkbox is checked for multiple inputs created dynamically

11211727
x86	64bit
if you need the path to the 32 bit program files folder c program files for 32-bit windows and c program files x86 for 64bit windows then you can use this function

11211734
int	double
then you would parse the string and cast it to an int or a double

11211756
serializable	deserialization
it must be transient because org.slf4j.logger is an interface which doesn t extend serializable but this means that the logger must be re-injected after deserialization

11211762
post	get
you can send data via a form get or post

11211762
post	get
post is more secure than get this is just a quick example

11211860
portrait	landscape
it may seem to work in ie7 but this is because ie7 will remember the users last selection of landscape or portrait in print preview only the browser is re-started

11211871
post	get
you do not need to use json when sending data via get or post

11211967

google-chrome	firefox
doesn t appear to be a browser issue either as both google-chrome and firefox seem to not have a cookie getting stored anywhere

11212002
width	height
i wanna place a profile picture that has a width of 200px and an unknown height inside a div container

11212002
width	height
i cannot get this to work the unknown height is messing it up since the way the img width will appear is depending on the height

11212002
width	height
- a landscape img will get a higher width to fill out the height difference and keep the img in proportion

11212006
sorting	filtering
in any way i am sure that you have to implement paging sorting and filtering on the server side

11212008
repo	egit
maybe could try this by creating a fresh test .git repo on a linux server add a php file use eclipse remote system to browse by ssh for the folder containing the .git folder use right click on that folder- create remote project and then somehow figure out how egit could be added.

11212009
hide	show
after researching the following 2 questions that were posted here here it seems google maps has issues with a tab that hide and show content from jquery or javascript and will not display a google map properly without some code in the jquery

11212051
width	height
for instance if have a gridview and your boxes need to go from 250x250 to 200x300 you can just copy the style you use for your itemtemplate tweak it so that the width and height values are correct and use a storyboard change your itemtemplate from standard250x250 to mynewportrait200x300style

11212051
listview	gridview
now if it is a fundamental change like the difference between a gridview and a listview you might just have to live with some duplicated layout code and using some storyboard s to collapse one and show the other like the templates do with landscape filled vs

11212051
portrait	landscape
to be clear i am saying your best options are to either tweak the styling properties via animations or create an entirely separate panel be it a grid stackpanel or whatever for your other layout and use an animation to set the visibility on the landscape one to collapsed and the portrait one to visible

11212060

i m trying to get the background image called splash.jpg to always have the same height as the browser window and to resize it keeping its aspect ratio and allow some of the width to remain outside the browser window

11212314

the width also appears to be in the right ratio to the height

11212314
google-chrome	firefox
at first i felt it might be some sort of browser-dependent bug - but the page appears pretty much exactly the same in both google-chrome and firefox

11212314
google-chrome	firefox
i don t want this behavior to be javascript dependent - but i don t mind the solution working only in the latest versions of firefox google-chrome

11212382

width	height
background images have no height and width their height and width is dependent on the parent s height and width in which they are applied to

2 i was thinking of adding estimation to the children components and then using that to set the height of the parent container

11212537

i have a parent container where i take the some xml and using the xml creating children components based on the information in the xml

11212541

int	boolean
your issue is that you are calling listbox.items.removeat int index and passing in a boolean value listbox2.selecteditems.tostring .equals test

11212852
int	boolean
the method could return an object that contained both the boolean and the int but that would need for the object to be created on the heap reducing the performance of the method

11212853
int	double
i mean some questions require just one answer others two anothers needs strings int double or any new struct what the developer has builded imagine that the developer is creating a math problem where uses fraction struct as answer for example

11214727
hash	salt
rather a combination of a session variable a uuid cookie and a salt hash cookie can increase integrity of authentication.

11214739
google-chrome	safari
gwt treats google-chrome and safari the same so there is only a safari agent value that covers both

11214739
google-chrome	safari
this and any other rules like it will cause the gwt compiler to create an additional permutation of the code which is mostly the same as the safari version but with your google-chrome customizations

11214860
uiview	calayer
this the main calayer defined on the uiview

11214890
int	chars
the solution is to generate the chars a simple int value at runtime and create a string with it using

11214890
unsigned	short
but if you look in the headers you ll see that nsstring stores its characters as unichar which is defined as an unsigned short i.e a 16 bits-long value whereas the unicode code point u+1f430 requires at least 17 bits

11214890
int	chars
unicode doesn t define chars it defines code points which are arbitrary int values in the range u+0000 â u+10ffff

11214902
int	chars
what you can do instead as per another answer is use the format specifier c -- not together with the uxxxx escape but on its own -- and pass in the full chars code as an int

11214902
int	chars
actually a wchar_t which is a 32-bit int on mac os x now which you ll need since the chars code you re looking for is more than 16 bits long. to put this together with a base you can just add the int

11214909
min	max
since you don t care which of the multiple names belonging to a number are returned you can use a max or min function

hide	show
the first theme will show the status bar for you if you want to hide this one also use the second theme.also i have used the attribute windowbackround to null because you will use your image as a backround for your rootlayout after that so it s better to not override the background color used by the default android theme for performance issue

for a model with say 16 groups at init time i m separating each group into a vao with each vao having a vbo for vertex data and normals interleaved and a second vbo for texture coordinates

11216721
vbo	vao
in my rendering routine pseudo code below i am looping through all the vao s i created for each group applying the material for the group to the baseeffect and then drawing it using drawarrays not using drawelements because i ve set the vbo s up so the data is already in indexed order although it s probably not as efficient as it could be on graphics memory

macports	homebrew	fink	macports	fink	homebrew
if you are using more complex c libraries python interface for mysql then it helps to use a package manager like macports homebrew or fink as the port writers will have sorted out the tricky dependencies

11217032
macports	homebrew	fink	macports	fink	homebrew
macports and fink will install a separate version of python in opt local bin or sw bin whilst i think homebrew will use apple s python

11217032
macports	homebrew	fink	macports	fink	homebrew
macports and fink were developed by people who experienced a lot of issues with different versions of software and so said that all our installs will be in a place only the package manager uses whilst homebrew trys to use as much of the apple supplied tools as possible so to add as little as needed

by all means put nginx out front but don t write off apache entirely if it suits your needs

11217048
portrait	landscape
also if you decide that autoresizingmask is not enough for example when you re moving objects with respect to each other to really fine tune the portrait versus landscape orientation i d suggest you do this layout process in viewwilllayoutsubviews for ios5 or willanimaterotationtointerfaceorientation in ios4 or earlier

integer	unsigned	unsigned	short
for each of the signed integer types there exists a corresponding but different unsigned integer type â œunsigned charâ â œunsigned short intâ â œunsigned intâ and â œunsigned long int â each of which occupies the same amount of storage and has the same alignment requirements 3.9 as the corresponding signed integer type40

11224210
integer	unsigned
that is each signed integer type has the same object representation as its corresponding unsigned integer type

11224210
integer	unsigned
the range of nonnegative values of a signed integer type is a subrange of the corresponding unsigned integer type and the value representation of each corresponding signed unsigned type shall be the same

11224210
integer	unsigned
4 unsigned integers declared unsigned shall obey the laws of arithmetic modulo 2n where n is the number of bits in the value representation of that particular size of integer

11224210
integer	unsigned
41 this implies that unsigned arithmetic does not overflow because a result that cannot be represented by the resulting unsigned integer type is reduced modulo the number that is one greater than the largest value that can be represented by the resulting unsigned integer

ilist	icollection
in addition now it s derived from ilist no icollection

int	double
because of the difference in the type the cannot refer to the double passed so a temporary was generated to hold an int initialized by ss s value

the array comes from a csv file and some columns are strings some are int and some are double

11229432
int	double
i know i could use the arrays.sort method and just create my own comparator and use a try catch to determine if the string in the specified column is an int or double but that seems a little much for something that seems so simple

11229437
int	chars
also use unsigned chars to cast instead of unsigned int and then assign it to array elements

11229732
punctuation	words
but my thoughts on how it would work are that php would generate random length words 1-6 letters each with a few don t do this rules like no two single-letter words next to each other or no three-vowels in a row or no three-consonants in a row and automatically add punctuation and capitalization after between 4 and 8 words to a sentence

11229795

floating-point	integer
the issue here is not converting floating-point values to integer but the rounding errors that occur with floating-point numbers

11229935
floating-point	integer
if you expect that exact mathematics would give you an integer results and the floating-point operations you are performing are so few and so simple that the errors have not accumulated to much then you can round the floating-point value to an integer using the round function

i think the strengths of rdf owl is that you 1 get a real query language 2 they re w3c standards and 3 you get reasoning if the triple store supports it for free more or less -- you still have to write an ontology

11232920
rdf	owl
with rdf owl sparql being standards it makes it quite easy to pick up and move to a new triple store with a different feature set should you need to your data is already in a common format that everyone understands and any application logic encoded as queries are completely portable

11232920
rdf	owl
i also think that rdf owl especially combined w reasoning and the kinds of complex sparql queries that you can create with the new sparql 1.1 really suit themselves well to building complicated analytic applications

i have an issue in angular.js with directive class ngcloak or ng-show

11249768
google-chrome	firefox	ng-show	ngcloak
google-chrome works fine but firefox is causing blink of elements with ngcloak or ng-show

11249768
ng-show	ngcloak
imho it s caused by the converting ngcloak ng-show to probably the firefox javascript compiler is little bit slower so the elements appears for a while and then hide

11249774
dictionary	map
to do this i decided to set up a dictionary and map each non-english word to it s english counterpart key see code below

11249787

both min and max have the same o log n behavior individually

11249787

but if you have both min and max in the same query suddenly you re back to an o n operation

11249798
try-catch	exception-handling
try wrapping your code in a try-catch block and see what is the exception-handling

11249817

this gets around several limitations - php disallows php input for post data but it does nothing with regards to put filedata - clever

11249830

for example in firefox when adjusting the width and height also add in

11249836

from then on doing a push pull should be using pageant and any keys you have set up in there if you also have that running

11249942

for other things such as height width and size view this stackoverflow question which has many good answers including mine d

11249980
biztalk	econnect
on the other hand econnect integration requires several other configurations so if you decided to use econnect i think you are better of using econnect along with biztalk server adapter combination set into service bus which is talking directly to econnect and your azure application is talking to biztalk services directly

11249997
folder	directory
bin directory of the php folder to your path

11250042
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and firefox are so much more forgiving

11250072

i have a case where i want to hide show views depending on a specific state and wondering if i should either move this logic at the css level via classnames or using isvisible ember logic

11250134
put	get
and it is safe to say that if you put override and virtual in a method declaration you will get a compile error in c#

11250161
opera	firefox
firefox uses the case-sensitive moztransform opera is otransform and ie9 uses mstransform

11250166

i would like the scale showing the number of elements in each bin to range between 0-50 increasing by increments of 10 for all plots even if the max number of elements on a particular plot is less than 50

11250173
ubuntu	debian
if you re using ubuntu debian i think you just need to sudo apt-get install ia32-libs and it should work

11250196

you could implement a pure virtual function in the parent structure and have the children implement it

11250232
prepare	execute
is there a way i can use prepare statements in pdo to execute all 240 queries at once using pdo prepare for php

11250255
modifiers	sealed
when an instance method declaration includes a sealed modifiers that method is said to be a sealed method

11250255
modifiers	sealed
if an instance method declaration includes the sealed modifiers it must also include the override modifiers

11250255
modifiers	sealed
use of the sealed modifiers prevents a derived class from further overriding the method

11250259
inherited	properties
i once learned that each html element inherited the style properties of its parent element

11250268
maven	pom.xml
i would add the following to your maven pom.xml file

11250282

i would suggest spreading the files in subdirectories possibly grouped by the first two or three characters of the md5 hash of the name of the cache file or just the first two or five characters of the file name

11250297
int	chars	unsigned	short
with printf i can use hhu for unsigned chars hi for a short int zu for a size_t tx for a ptrdiff_t etc

11250440
daemons	systemd
i don t think it is because it relies on a particular ondisk structure for the mysql server daemons software that is not part of the formal specification of the systemd

11250473
width	height
also if you have only text and all images have fixed dimensions ie explicit width height you may use the domcontentloaded event

11250484
min	max
to hide the element if the screen is less than 940px - means that 940px is the max not the min

11250492

11250773
ant	emma
so i wrote the following ant task to copy the files to match the naming standard that the sonar emma plugin expects

fadein	fadeout
in chrome for mac on the first page if you scroll down fadeout and then fadein the newly faded in content is off the screen - in other words missing

11250944
folder	directory
this will look for tags in the current directory and will go down recursively to your home folder if you would like it to search until the root folder or less just change for or path to root project

11250951
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the scroll bar works perfectly fine in firefox ie and google-chrome just not in safari

11250964

11251016
portrait	landscape
i have created two folders layout and layout-land with two xml files one for portrait and the other for landscape

11251016
portrait	landscape
if i login in portrait and then turn my phone landscape at the main screen

11251016
portrait	landscape
the layout will landscape turn but it uses the portrait xml for the main screen

11251016
portrait	landscape

11251070
prepare	execute
im not sure how to execute my code behind that i have prepare for the dialog button apply

11251088
exponent	modulo
however given a definite chunk of data to sign a definite modulo a definite private exponent and a definite public exponent the outputs of my signatures are different depending on devices

11251110
getter	setter
like as with getter methods you shouldn t be doing business logic in setter methods at all

11251120
put	get
you could put a pointer to the instance of the master view in your app delegate so that when one of your subviews load it can get the master view instance

11251123
hide	show
however when a user clicks a specific link button from the home page and is taken to the crm page i need to hide all grids and show a new panel of text boxes

11251123
hide	show
how do i determine if the user is coming to my crm page because he clicked one specific button in my sidebar navigation and show hide panels based on that

11251127
for-loop	loops
if the things that the 4 different for loops do don t have to happen in order you could run each for-loop on a separate thread

11251167
pull	push
i keep this backend with threadsafe false since i use a pull queue expiration deadline of 300 seconds but if i allow more than one task to execute on a single instance they may cascade down and push finishing some of the tasks over the 300 second mark thus allowing for another task to pull the same task a second time and possibly double-counting

11251188
portrait	landscape
apparently even if it only launches runs and supports landscape mode it first creates the view in portrait mode and then switches to landscape mode

11251193
width	height
height and width

11251195
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
most browsers for desktop machines are java compatible ie firefox google-chrome safari opera on windows mac linux and solaris

11251212
int	chars	unsigned	short
in a call to printf a chars or short will be promoted and passed on the stack as an int or an unsigned int so i would think that using d as a format specifier would be fine

11251221
inherited	properties
an element inherited a properties only when no style sheet sets that properties on the element or when the value inherited has been set

11251252
hide	show
by doing that of course we aim to show a friendly error page to our customers but furthermore we mainly aim to hide the stacktraces which are usually included in standard http 500 error pages

11251258
queue	fifo
also if i inherit from i would violate lsp because a priority queue is not a fifo collection

11251307
post	get
you will need to allow post and get or remove the requirement all together

11251311
google-chrome	safari
to fix the problem of the asp.net menu disappearing when trying to click a submenu item in google-chrome and safari browsers

11251313

11251361
integer	unsigned
_bool is an unsigned integer type large enough to store the values 0 and 1

11251397
freebsd	linux
a possible solution to get more relevant information would be to run the benchmark on freebsd or a linux with uclibc

11251414
maven	pom.xml
well looking at the maven pom.xml file for java-rdfa it looks like it s using a rather old version of jena - 2.6.3 whereas the version you re likely to have downloaded for your ide will be at a guess 2.7.0 or 2.7.1

11251432
apache-poi	excellibrary
using apache-poi as excellibrary is it possible to iterate over entire list writing out the string object as each row in the excel file

11251489
webclient	webrequest
i also have tried with httpclient webrequest webclient though nothing appears to work

11251498
mouse	keyboard
in order to provide a better user experience for those without the use of a mouse browsers have been developed to fire the onclick event even if the click occurs with a keyboard

ubuntu	debian
let me tell only from my limited experience as user -- python and debian ubuntu

11251631
ubuntu	debian
when i finally switched from windows to ubuntu one of the main reasons was the painless installation of almost all software that has been packaged for debian

11251639
free	malloc
i can see why the contents of what malloc returns may be non-0 from previously free d memory but why would they be non-deterministic in normal single-threaded software

11251642
button	checkbox
however i would like to change that remember me checkbox in to a button

11251658
getter	setter
the common approach is setter getter - getter only if you want to have your class immutable

11251709
for-loop	arrays
if i ve got an arrays of strings can i check to see if a string is in the arrays without doing a for-loop

11251716
free	malloc
even single-threaded code may do malloc then free then malloc and get back previously used non-zero memory

11251750
int	chars
it can be a typedef for an int as i ve mentioned it s used but is not recommend subject to bugs or chars or unsigned int or an enum and #define that s commonly used

11251778
post	put
where myaction is of type something i didn t put in the original post but should have instead of a plain action

11251832
int	boolean
keep in mind that the operator expects boolean operands...so it won t work with your int array the way you re expecting it to

11251841
getter	setter
also the method and parameter ordering of slightly off property declaration getter and setter

11251903
int	boolean
1 you cant use or || operators on int variables because the are meant for boolean values

11251911
ubuntu	debian	redhat	fedora
if python2.7 is available on yum you should use that the package management on large distros redhat ubuntu debian fedora takes care of maintaining parallel python installs for you which won t conflict with each other

11251916
onchange	onblur
the js to setdefaulttext gets called both onblur and onchange if the change results in an empty text field

width	height
i have a uiview inside a uiview m and i want the inner uiview to be always centered inside the outer one without it having to resize the width and height

11252137
width	height
looks like you have to embed several horizontalpanels into verticalpanels specify width height in everyone of them and produce a great paper of xml by this

11252142
letter-spacing	word-spacing
try adding word-spacing and letter-spacing properties

11252172
hide	show
it just sees what panel is visible hide it and then show the next panel in the code

11252199
passenger	thin
mongrel is no longer under development and constantly causes rails to crash thin has only rudimentary windows support and on my computer causes the ruby runtime to terminate itself in an unusual way passenger is linux-only.

implements	extends
java classes and interfaces form a dag based on their relationships defined by the extends or implements keywords

11252207
implements	extends
if a extends b or a implements b then b is a direct superclass or superinterface of a

11252222
hide	show
i have a bool dependency property called isshown which is used to hide show the modal content

11252222
hide	show
the showmodalcontent and hidemodalcontent methods contain the logic to show and hide the modal content respectively

11252258
superclass	subclassing
the best solution here would be write superclass that contains the common elements of both classes and then have each of your subclassing extends the superclass that way you could have a list of type superclass

11252344
width	height
if you think of the texture mapping process as wrapping a sheet of paper around the cylinder so the height of the cylinder height of the paper and perimeter of the cylinder width of the paper all you need to do is generate texcoords that change the y or x along with angle but this will go from 0-1 whereas angle goes from 0 to pi

11252357
hash	md5
determine the md5 hash value for the image

11252357
hash	md5
copy the new files to the public folder using the md5 hash value as part of the file name

jython	pypy	cpython	pypy
for one of my projects i decided to benchmark jython cpython and pypy using the project s innermost loop

11252385
xmltype	clob
otherwise in order to parse the data you re going to have to convert the clob to an xmltype at runtime

11252390
rar	zip
for instance if you had both a zip and a rar version of my-program then you could make it so you link to just my-program and the browser chooses the version it likes best

11252408
post	put	post	get	put	get
i put all post results in variables you should get into this habit it makes thing like the above work

11252466
post	get
each time you request get or post a page a new instance of the _default class derived system.web.ui.page is created and then destroyed the same happens with the contained controls

11252477
int	double
int and double are both primitive data types therefore you do not need to use a star when defining them

11252534
min	max
i ve also figured out how to determine the bounding box max lat min lat - max long min long for the determination of which zips fit the criteria we aren t going to worry about a precise radius

11252597
sequence	permutation
i need to make a permutation that looks like a sequence of 1-n with a 0 stuffed in place #k

11252649
int	chars
this is putting a chars which is an int chars code into your test array

11252653
children	parent
we have a tree structure which in jpa naturally is a onetomany relation with the children in a list in the parent node

11252653
many-to-many	one-to-many
for example we ve found that for our scenarios there s absolutely no need to expose rule writers to many-to-many relationships which proved very complicated to handle in drools - so we make them look like one-to-many instead and everything becomes more natural

11252661
int	chars
alternatively you can still use console.read which returns the int representation of the chars entered confirm that the chars is in fact a number and convert from the ascii code to the appropriate number

11252679
hide	show
in the keychain access program under the view menu select show expired certificates if the menu item says hide expired certificates then you re already showing them

11252691
stdout	stderr
however i would question whether you really want to show all stdout and or stderr to the user

11252700
inherited	properties
at the moment i don t believe there is a way while imagebrush inherited from tilebrush it s missing the important properties tilemode

opera	firefox
how can i get all borders to show in firefox and opera

11252835
hash	md5
if the actual data need never be saved locally i would only ever store the md5 hash and calculate it on the fly when checking

11252874
post	get
i used a method post instead of a method get in the form_for tag after seeing

11252886
children	parent
you need to restructure your list a little bit you want to keep the children within the parent

11252904
width	height
displaymetrics class gives me access to actual width and height of the screen

11252911
hash	md5
wouldn t the md5 hash object be aware of the internal identity when the magic __eq__ methods are called

11253161
gmail	hotmail
due to filtering systems withing gmail and hotmail when using yourself as the receiver and the from it was going directly into spam within gmail and hotmail

11253161

put	get
i would like to get data from textbox which is in usercontrol and put it to a property in which is in a main window on way it work but other not

11253165
versioning	upgrade
the only work around that comes to mind is to use the core only versioning of nservicebus that would make the code you mention in your question to work properly the development versioning of nsb has been upgrade to raven 960 so another option would be to upgrade to the ci versioning of nservicebus

11253185
ssl	https	post	get
ssl was installed on our server and our site is mostly wordpress and there are some non-wordpress pages which work fine with https and the home page works as well but when i try to access a wordpress page post i get 404 page not found error

11253291
mouseover	mouseout	mouseover	mouseleave	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseleave	mouseout	mouseenter
i can t see your html or a demo so i m not positive this will solve it but typically the result you describe is caused by using mouseover mouseout rather than mouseenter mouseleave

11253307
filesystems	fat
very large files tend not to be very dependent on which filesystems you use modern filesystems not fat

to see what happens under the hood you can also use firebug if you re using firefox or ctrl+shift+i if you re on google-chrome

11253579

i have tried some stuff with preg_match getelementbyid and getelementsbytagname

11253665
sorting	filtering
it does not allow you to parametrize table names or column names or keywords just values for filtering sorting inserting updating etc.

11253665
prepare	execute
on the contrary you have to do 2 operations prepare and execute which might actually end up slowing things down only a bit

11253674
multiplying	add
normalise this vector multiplying by d add to each point

11253676
post	get
i ve seen lots of post on stackoverflow and the asp.net forums on this issue and i ve tried to implement some of the solutions - even using javascript redirects but i still haven t been able to get this to work

11253676
post	get
here are the franchisecontroller create actions - both get and post - that i am using

11253683
spaces	delimiter
you can pass .removeattr a spaces delimiter list of attributes to remove so you don t need to loop through the attribute names one-by-one

11253732
google-chrome	firefox
document.referrer in javascript is blank from a 302 redirect from http to https using a f5 load balancer in firefox and google-chrome but shows up in ie

width	height
every time i call boundsonelement i get back a qrect that correctly corresponds to the top left corner of the text element after applying matrixforelement of course but its width and height are always zero

11253740
children	parent
i am trying to use d3.js to display a treemap where a parent s value may be greater than the sum of its children

11253740
children	parent
in particular the parent should be a rectangle on top of the children rectangles whose size is correctly proportional

11253740
children	parent
if the parent does not add any additional size the parent should still be displayed but at minimal size maybe a tiny rectangle spanning the top of the children just to indicate the parent name

11253742
inherited	properties
the annoyance is made worse by the fact that one cannot simply declare ireadablefoo with a read-only properties iwriteonlyfoo with a write-only properties and have ireadwritefoo simply inherited both

11253742
getter	setter
not that i can see any ambiguity--i can t see how the first could use anything but a getter or the latter anything but a setter but the compiler can t resolve it

11253856
rxtx	smslib
the situation with javax.comm on windows is a bit of a mess the smslib installation instructions suggest to use rxtx instead and point to cloudhopper s page for a windows version

11253883
int	chars
parseint reads as much of a string as it can that can to form an int in this case on the first two chars 1 and 9 for 19

11253898
128bit	64bit
the factor would be another int64 so i d multiply the mantissa by it such that i obtained the top 64bit of the resulting 128bit number

11253898
multiplication	exponent
this int64 mantissa can be cast to a float losing only the necessary precision and the 2 q exponent can be applied using multiplication with no loss of precision

11253923
google-chrome	firefox
for further verification that you never left the home page view net tab in firebug firefox or network tab in google-chrome

11253959
stdout	fflush
if you are the owner of the program on windows and if you can modify it you need to fflush the buffer after every output to stdout this should solve your problem i guess

11253970
put	get
and when i put some data and select it i get only some strange characters

11254010
integer	unsigned
because byte array contains signed bytes it can contain -1 which is actually 255 as unsigned byte and thus indicate incorrect end of stream so is used to convert signed byte to unsigned bytes as integer values

11254023
sse	avx
interestingly non-temporal write-combining full cache line writes avx sse work as expected they always go to fpga and fpga observes full cache line writes reads return correct values afterwards

hide	show
my plan was to include both the flash and svg animations on a page and show hide them based on a javascript detection

11254161
hide	show
my plan is to detect whether the browser supports the feature when the page loads and if it is supported hide the flash object id rotateflash and show the svg object id rotatesvg

11254161
hide	show
i ve found show hide javascripts but don t know how to implement detecting that feature with them

11254191
equals	gethashcode
in summary you must have an override of gethashcode and equals that knows how to do comparison on all properties of composite id

11254192

11254429
hide	show
i m trying to hide elements with the same class name float_form but i m also trying to use the script below to show them all of the float_form class divs are initially hidden

11254429
hide	show
without compromising the show hide id element since there is a loop with the div id as the key

11254434
for-loop	loops
outer for-loop needs to be done in order dependent on the previous step as far as i know openmp handles inner loops well so threads don t get created destroyed at each step right

11254457
hide	show
for some reason the show hide works perfectly fine on the items that are initially loaded but it does nothing when i click on the ones loaded by the ajax call

11254580

is this possible with maya or blender

11254639
avr	microcontroller
i ve installed gcc on my mac snow leopard so i can compile for avr microcontroller

11254648
int	chars
once you get into the habit of using signed chars and unsigned chars only as small usually 8-bit int for arithmetic and you use only chars when you re operating on chars data it ll seem completely natural that chars is a separate type with implementation-defined signedness and even more natural that string processing functions always use chars and rather than the signed or unsigned variants

11254652
post	get
you can t hide the form before submission otherwise the browser won t get post its hidden fields therefore you have to hide it after sumbission

11254652
submit	submission
even with the settimeout delay set to zero will execute from a different event thread after form submission has happened in the original submit thread

11254665
exponent	modulo
if you don t send your public key as a certificate you are better off just sending the modulo and the public exponent separately base 64 encoded in separate fields

11254697
viewdidload	viewdidappear
what is the difference between viewdidload and viewdidappear

11254697
viewdidload	viewdidappear
presentmodalviewcontroller works only when present in viewdidappear and not on viewdidload

11254715
viewdidload	viewdidappear
simply put you would want to create any controls or arrays in viewdidload where as in viewdidappear is where you would want to refresh those controls or arrays

11254715
viewdidload	viewdidappear
viewdidload is called once when the controller is created and viewdidappear is called each time the view well did appear

11254715
viewdidload	viewdidappear
so say you have a modal view that you present when that view is dismissed viewdidappear will be called and viewdidload will not be called

11254735
implements	modifiers
implements your own clipexpectedandactual and findmismatchposition - here are non-spacing modifiers are respected

11254738
versioning	upgrade
this may be beyond the scope of your original question but as you contemplate the eventual deployment of your app and more importantly subsequent upgrade releases of your app you might want to add some table to your database with some internal database versioning number that you can use to determine what versioning of the database the user has in their documents folder and do any modifications to that database that you might need to support the latest versioning of your app

11254753
cos	sin
these are a set of ordinary differential equations these are just for testing how to work with cos and sin as ode

11254753

11254829
iboutlet	ibaction
i know the differences between ibaction and iboutlet but i don t know when i should use one over the other

11254861
iboutlet	ibaction
an iboutlet is a connection to an object and an ibaction is a connection to a method to be invoked as a callback

11254861
iboutlet	ibaction
for example you might have ten buttons and one label but you might connect to the label using an iboutlet so you can update its value and a single function - ibaction buttonpressed id sender

11254877
iboutlet	ibaction
ok iboutlet and ibaction serve two separate purposes

11254890
iboutlet	ibaction
in your case i would create one iboutlet for the label and one ibaction for the buttons

11254890
iboutlet	ibaction
i only put in the code relevant to ibaction and iboutlet you need an iboutlet for the label in order to update the text and you need the ibaction to change the label s text to the digit pressed

queue	fifo
the observer pattern might help here but remember putting the tasks for rescheduling into a fifo queue or a priority queue sorted by start time

11255019
post	get
anyway you should either use post and face some issues with browser behavior like returning back to the page as you described or ctrl-r-ing the page or use get and have all parameters in the url

11255032
post	get
i thought i post it here where i ve come many times to get answers to a lot of questions and code-errors

11255059
post	get
as a side note even though it was mentioned earlier in this post sometimes the query won t have the and season 2011-2012 part so i must not get duplicates for the same player in different seasons either

hash	md5
the data in a file has been hash using the md5 algorithm and signed using a private rsa key and the signature saved to a separate file

11258568
children	parent
you can select the users with null parent id first and then populate their children

11258586
mouseup	mousedown
the problem is that clicks happen on mouseup and blurring happens on mousedown so the automatically resizing table changes between the mousedown and mouseup

11258586
mouseup	mousedown
for a click to work the object for the mousedown and mouseup must be the same but mousedown was made in cell 2 and mouseup was in cell 3 so no click is detected

11258586
mouseup	mousedown
if you click on cell 1 then mousedown on cell 2 blurring the previous text field then stay in the same position it will mouseup over cell 3 and a text field will be created in cell 3

11258586

11264829
mouseover	mouseout
i want to effect mouseover and mouseout but i can t do it

11264855
free	malloc
but even if we don t take that into account and talk about technological aspects the c++ runtime may not know what the length of your array is since new could rely on malloc which stores the length of the array in its specific ways which is understood only by free the c++ runtime only stores extra informations only when you have non-empty destructors

11264861

11265337
hash	md5
if you need two identical files giving you the same md5 hash why not copy one that s been created already

11265871
pcm	music
now it s easy enough to access the music file using windows.storage.knownfolders.musiclibrary and get a stream or an iinputstream along with a few other stream types but how can i convert this to an imfbytestream or an imfmediasource or just in some way decode the mp3 to a byte array with pcm values

11265871
pcm	music
i have also entertained the idea of resaving the music file in the app folder so that i can use mfcreatesourcereaderfromurl or perhaps it would be possible to bypass working with media foundation directly and use something like windows.media.transcoding to do the conversion to pcm

cpython	pypy
it is always compiled to bytecode again on cpython and pypy when it is loaded

11268004
next	except
you can turn it off via various means and program execution is not affected the tiniest bit except that the next process to load the module has to do it again

11268049
getter	setter
it doesn t seem to read off the values even after creating setter getter for the fields

11268073
width	height
when you make the call to draw the bitmap draw it at a point with it s left and top attributes set to the position minus half the image s width and height respectively

11268085
post	get
if using urllib or urllib2 the data parameter of the urlopen function will post the data to the page rather than get it

11268086
hide	show
i have three table views inside a view controller going to show hide table views to display a list of options in different contexts

11268098
for-loop	arrays
also you probably shouldn t be accessing the arrays directly from the main class instead put all the code from your main classes for-loop into a method in the truthtable class and call that method from main because you should tell an object what to do rather than asking for it s data

11268164
width	height
by the way .pgm file format if this is it has a header and it is not sufficient to read only the width height characters

11268167
ienumerable	iqueryable
take a look at wcf services but make sure you don t expose iqueryable or ienumerable instances via your service

11268167
ienumerable	iqueryable
however you must be careful if you have passed instances of iqueryable or ienumerable across your service boundaries

11268238
cos	sin
since f mv t and i just used t 1 the force applied in one direction is equal to the wanted velocity - the actual velocity the x y that s the cos sin the mass of the object

11268330
128bit	64bit	sse	avx
the cpu has no notion of type what it gets in its 32-bit or 64bit or 128bit sse or 256-bit avx - let s keep it simple at 32 registers needs to be properly aligned in order to be processed correctly and efficiently

11268330
int	chars
imagine a simple scenario where you have a chars followed by an int

11268330
int	chars
in a 32-bit architecture that s 1 byte for a chars and 4 bytes for an int

11268330
int	chars
visually - the first green byte is the mentioned chars and the three green bytes plus the first red one of the second block is the 4-byte int colorcoded on a 4-byte access boundary we re talking about a 32-bit register

11268330
int	chars
the instead part at the bottom shows an ideal setup where the int hits the register properly the chars getting padded into obedience somewhere off image

11268330
sse	avx
read more on data alignment which comes quite handy when you re dealing with fancy extensions of the instruction set like sse 128-bit regs or avx 256-bit regs so special care must be taken so that the optimizations of vectorization are not defeated aligning on a 16-byte boundary for sse 16 8 - 128-bits

11268340
for-loop	arrays
to add the view controllers to the arrays there s no need to have a for-loop

this is simply impossible and by that i mean that if you remove a or fadein fadeout or whatever you do on it you remove all of his children at the same time because its in the same container

11268925
width	height
knowing that there are still way to fake the background image like for instance a div inside the parent in position absolute top 0 and left 0 parent must be relative with height and width at 100 and z-index at -1 make sure it is behind everything

11268953

or better yet use a single sum as window aggregate-functions with a custom window frame

11269050
width	height
the strange thing is that over the course of 20 minutes or two minutes if i rotate by instead of the cube scales noticeably on the x and z axes where the scaling on those two axes is the same at all times the height of the cube never changes but the width and depth change by exactly the same amount

11269074
firefox	safari
stranger still there is near zero banding in safari firefox or ie9

11269074
google-chrome	safari
this is also true with safari however google-chrome does not have this behavior banding is more noticeable on the native side always and less noticeable on the cinema side

11269128
integer	fractions
it s straightforward to calculate the numerator you need without the fractions module -- it s just the nearest integer to -- and if you want a fractions then you can and should just say without stringifying your target number of course

11269136
octal	hex
if you use octal you ll have to split bytes across multiple characters so i d stick with hex

11269144
google-chrome	firefox
this works out fine in google-chrome or firefox

11269153
client-side	server-side
the name used for the shared memory section is derived from the service url by applying an algorithm which is compiled into both the server-side and client-side wcf code for the netnamedpipebinding

google-chrome	firefox
when i open the jquery selectors lab example page from chapter 2 i don t see any images or dom content in google-chrome or in firefox

11269258
width	height
why don t you have both a width and height parameter

11269262
hash	salt
you need to store the salt and iteration count for the pbkdf function which must not be the same salt used to hash the password

11269262
hash	salt
if you want to you can use a pbkdf hash of the password using a third stored salt as the iv

you will need to set the height and width of whichever you choose and make sure display block or display inline-block is set

11269774
hide	show
you could extend ember.containerview to show hide its currentview view like so

11269831
onfocus	onblur
i think you can do the following attach an event handler to your textfield element using onblur and onfocus attributes

11269831

if they are storing their git repos there the scope of git will stop at those directory that have a .git folder

11269891
folder	directory
the message that accompanies the folder are permission denied or no such file or directory

11269921
stdout	stderr
the funnels stderr to stdout so that both can be piped into the grep utility

11269921
stdout	stderr
if you don t redirect stderr to stdout the output of stderr to the console would bypass the rest of the command line

11270016
symfony	silex
i know to use symfony2 and i would like to know if silex is very different of symfony or it s the same thing same operation same code.

11270016
symfony	silex
moreover silex is recommanded for small php projects and symfony for medium or big projects it s true

11270022
symfony	silex
silex is based on the independent symfony2 components and isn t truly considered a full-stack web application framework like symfony is

11270071
post	get
you may consider writing in to blog sites like dailyjs or post to some mailing lists to get the word-of-mouth out but having your code on github and your package on npm is a solid start

11270072
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome firefox opera....all do

11270076
google-chrome	firefox
if you run this in a browser such as firefox or google-chrome not ie then you can inspect the network post and look at the headers

use min instead of max and grab the id then join

11270352
subtraction	addition
this suggests to me that there s an addition vs a subtraction swapped somewhere

11270365
children	parent
the other solution i like the most would be to play with div elements s css and z-index in the way that - hovering the parent we animate he content children element from underneath

11270369
rdf	owl
if you are familiar with the java rdf and owl engine jena then you have run across their philosophy that everything should be specified as an interface when possible

11270408
versioning	upgrade
you upgrade from an older typo3 versioning

11270422
qlist	qmap
i know there are certain functions in qt like qlist and qmap but both are not multidimensional and too unflexible for this case

11270424
move	drag
if the onscale event is not triggered i treat this event as a potential drag and move the displayed item around

11270463
uiview	subviews
i have a main uinavigationcontroller that loads a uitableview as a subviews as my main view i push a new uiview controller on then in that viewcontroller i add a left nav button to popviewcontroller bringing me back to the main view

11270514
post	get
actually though i imagine you will get into use text search to find data in the post

11270537
maven	m2e
so i thought that i needed to update the software so i went into help check for updates and then i guess it found a better version of m2e but now the import existing maven project is gone now

11270553
width	height
as it currently set-up they show up next to each other each taking 50 of the event width and taking as much as height as they need to represent the ending time

then you would have both the parent and the children centers on the stage

11270589
width	height
width and height set to 0

11270603
int	double	int	chars
chars and short are promoted to int float is promoted to double etc

11270603
int	double	int	chars
so that chars and short values could be passed to functions with int parameters or float values could be passed to functions with double parameters the compiler promoted the smaller types to be of the larger type

11270618
width	border-box	box-sizing	border-box
perhaps you should use borders instead and maybe with box-sizing border-box in case you can t subtract from width or padding

11270620
inherited	properties
i do this because they already inherited that properties defined in the base class fileentry

11270679
goto	break
there s no such thing as while in the command processor of course and since goto line statements break out of all loops it s not an option for iterating over some set of values for a specific duration before proceeding to the next value

11270680
folder	directory
i am currently using the code from to try and unzip the file yet all it does is create a directory called for example zipfile and then have a sub directory in it called folder which has nothing inside the directory which obviously should not be happening

11270701
jasmine	qunit
i use qunit in my example but you can easily substitute qunit for jasmine

11270748
min	max
code is here purpose is to draw stacked areas along three axes of metrics axis 1 2 and 3 .â areas map to min average and max values along those metrics

11270748
min	max
max area encompasses the average area which encompasses the min one

11270757
inherited	properties
a correct javascript inherited example that is similar in spirit to what you are doing would use object.create to create a dog with the correct prototype properties

11270764
division	multiplication
now how to make the pointers move like that even if you can only increment and can t to multiplication or division

11270782
symfony	silex
one that i prefer is silex because it promotes encourages good programming habits practices and as your projects grow you can seamlessly evolve into the more full-stack world of symfony

11270787
width	height
if the image goes out of the div a bit that s fine but i need it to resize with the div which resizes with the page both height and width

11270788
google-chrome	firefox
our solution at work involves three virtual machines running ie7 ie8 ie9 firefox and google-chrome all the time and our maven build process runs our javascript unit tests at every build

11270790
post	get
of course the challenge with one xsd is a response to a get operation - which does not require a xml from the client - will require the client to ignore the post content in the xml

11270804
for-loop	arrays
but because the string arrays is of a fixed size i need to create a new arrays and copy the prepended result using a for-loop

11270840
vtune	perf
i strongly suggest that you try them and profile the solution perf oprofile vtune etc to see if your bottleneck is really related to the locking mechanism itself and not things like cache utilization memory throughput cpu cycles io access remote-node memory accesses etc

11270844
gridview	datalist
datalist lacks functionality of pagging like in gridview but its possible to implement pagging functionality for datalist

11270863
crypt	salt
and as mark b said in his answer you should append the salt before you crypt

11270863
crypt	salt
when using the crypt function you can add your salt right in the function call

11270863
crypt	salt
crypt password salt

11270893
width	height
background-size contain scales the image to it s maximum width height so that the whole image is visible while preserving aspect ratio

11270899
cashapelayer	uibezierpath
create a cashapelayer and set its path property to the above uibezierpath

11270921
subtraction	addition
apparently one of the operations in settorotate need to be changed from addition to subtraction

11270924
crypt	salt
you crypt your password say it comes out to be 123 attach the salt and end up with 123abc which you store in the database

11270924
crypt	salt
you crypt the password append the salt and now you ve got 123456

11270924
crypt	salt
the salt must be added to the password before you run the password through crypt

11270979
heroku	openshift
i am using a mix of heroku openshift mongolab and my own web hosting

11270980

satisfy height width or width height depending on which is smaller

11271004
stdout	stderr
read data from stdout and stderr until end-of-file is reached

11271010
width	height
first you need to get the image properties and see which one is larger the height or the width then resize the image based on the div size after the window resizes like this

11271046
uiview	calayer
alright the answer for me was the calayer that underlies every uiview

11271082
getter	setter
it will save you a lot of typing as it produces all the getter and setter for you

11271096
getter	setter
you have attempted to implement your getter and setter as class methods instead of instance methods

11271101
lodash	underscore.js
note lodash an underscore.js competitor also offers a comparable .uniq implementation

11271140
width	height
2 and by overriding onmeasure you can control the width and height of your button

i m not sure how to properly use nsnumberformatter for the following case and properly keep the localization internationalization

11271216
internationalization	localization
what should i do to properly keep internationalization localization

11271219
int	double
also see this earlier article which explains that int access is necessarily atomic but not double or long

11271219
int	double
these together mean that if your int field is declared volatile then no locks are necessary to guarantee atomicity you will always see a value that was last written to the memory location not some confused value resulting from a half-complete write as is possible with double or long

11271219
getter	setter
however you seem to imply that your getter and setter themselves are atomic

11271229
hide	show
also it would be better than changing the css to use hide and show

11271261
ncover	dotcover
if you use nunit tests i would say use dotcover by jetbrains ncover or an open source version is part cover which isnt being added to new features anymore

11271261
ncover	dotcover
i use ncover and i like it i also toyed with dotcover and its pretty good also

11271262
setinterval	settimeout
there is another method called setinterval but it is better to use settimeout with a recursive function

versioning	upgrade
in case it is there then versioning 1.1 knows it should upgrade the db by copying it over from the resource directory

11275458
versioning	upgrade
in general you might store a versioning number in nsuserdefaults so that each future versioning of your app has a way to know whether it is an upgrade os a new install if the versioning number is there then it is an upgrade from that specific versioning otherwise it is a new install

11275492
spaces	delimiter
a potential issue with this in terms of obfuscation is that the strings are very clearly delimiter thanks to proper monospace fonts and syntax highlighting so i am not sure how useful raw spaces themselves will be

for-loop	arrays
as i don t want to list every bind separately i decided to put all the div ids in an arrays workarr and create a for-loop

11275573
accessor	properties
so you can store the name of a properties as value of a variable or another properties and then access the variable or properties in the properties accessor

11275573
inherited	properties
in addition it also iterates over the enumerable inherited properties which is why one solution requires the hasownproperty call

11275573
accessor	properties
because indexes are not identifiers they start with a decimal digit you have to use the bracket properties accessor syntax some people misunderstand this and refer to all ecmascript objects as arrays even call them associative arrays and the array operator

11275573
inherited	properties
if not set means that the object does not have the properties but may inherited it then you should use hasownproperty as used in mahn s solution

11275573
inherited	properties
if not set means that the object does not have the properties and does not inherited it then you should use the in operator provided that the object is not a host object because the in operator is not specified for them

11275573
inherited	properties
if not set means that the object either has or inherited the properties but the properties has the undefined value or the object neither has nor inherited the properties then you should use the typeof operator as used in bob davies and aetaur s solutions but the latter approach using array.prototype.every is less compatible as-is

is there a way to programatically add textview and show it right next to the imageview user clicked on

11276147
implements	extends
however i would reconsider to revisit your design and see if you can avoid having this - maybe you need to define another interface which will hold the methods that are always implements and extends it in another interface or provide an interface with no extension to the previous one for the methods you not always implements

11276154

11276470
width	margin
or alternatively put the width on the body with margin 0 auto

11276498
keyup	mouseup
the most resilient way to do this for non-html5 browsers would be having a setinterval constantly checking if the element s value has changed as keyup does not trigger if you select some text and drag it into the textbox - you could try .on input keyup mouseup but then it wouldn t trigger if the user uses the browser s edit paste menu

11276498
onchange	onkeyup
i ve added the onchange event to the events map so even if the oninput and onkeyup fails non-html5 browser using the browser s menu to paste data the onchange event will still fire when the element loses focus

11276757
getter	setter
i also tried to check if the browser supports getter setter

11276780

11278987
folder	directory
renamenospace r renames files in the folder tree rooted at the current directory

11278995

11279025
int	double
i am doing this homework where i am supposed to read a .txt file filled with int into a double array and then write this double array into another .txt file

altera	xilinx
the open source tools are good for development testing but won t be able to synthesise your hdl to produce a bitstream you ll need to use one of the manufacturers tools from altera or xilinx or others

11279208
nsorderedset	nsset
now let s pretend nsorderedset inherits from nsset and nsmutableorderedset inherits from nsorderedset

11279208
nsorderedset	nsset
in example 1 you wouldn t be able to pass an nsorderedset into a function expecting an nsset because the behaviour is different

11279221
google-chrome	firefox
alternatively if you just say console.log foo in google-chrome firefox the browsers do the looping-highlighting for you and give you a pretty-print of your object so you dont really need to do the looping shown above

11279247
awt	swing
following some tutorials they suggest using an awt frame instead of a swing one as swing won t support graphics acceleration which is really what i m looking for

11279252

cat	tee
if anything is acceptable other than printf echo and cat you can use many other commands to behave like cat sed awk tee etc

11279477
cifs	smb
i can t change it to use a redirected fd or a stdin because pipe does not support seek i want the file content to be streamed from a windows share cifs smb

11279477
cifs	smb
is it possible to create a virtual file on local file system with fake size and when the legacy static library access any part of the file seek or read no write we handle it by doing a fetch from cifs smb and return to the legacy library just like handling a page fault

11279718
getter	setter
logan thanks for your answer but all classes can access this field via setter getter method

put	get
generally it is considered good practice to put source files in packages directories - it makes it easier to organise them as your projects get bigger

11280303
int	boolean
your class will extend defaulttablecellrenderer and override the method gettablecellrenderercomponent jtable table object value boolean isselected boolean hasfocus int row int column

11280402
implements	extends
yes it would be a very bad idea - impossible in fact - interfaces cannot implements or extends classes

11280449
stdout	stderr
the first idea i had was something like ignoring that i need the child s stdin stdout stderr

11280449
stdout	stderr
i don t like this general approach because this shoves all errors concerning process invocation into the exit code of the child process and the stdout stderr which i need as binary streams in my application

11280475
viewdidload	viewwillappear
i never used it by myself for me it was enough to do all work in viewwillappear and viewdidload

11280503
velocity	rythm
note rythm is very fast about 2 to 3 times faster than string.format and velocity because it compiles the template into java byte code the runtime performance is very close to concatentation with stringbuilder

bindingsource	dataview
it turns out that both bindingsource objects have exactly same instance of dataview condition is true

11280692
jstl	taglib
they can be fully avoided by using jstl taglib with el which is the clean and highly recommended way to iterate your query results in jsp

11280692
post	get
for the query part leave all the processing to a java class storing the query results in a variable mylist of type list and sending it get post forward to your page which should only show the values and nothing else

11280734
portrait	landscape
lets say i am starting with portrait view then i can see all imageviews in portrait view and if it changed to landscape then view is blank

11280734
uiview	subviews
its not problem with uiview rather its with calculation of subviews positions after device rotation

11280789
bindingsource	dataview
it seems that to change this behaviour one can create two different dataview instances for datatable and assign them to datasource property of two bindingsource objects accordingly

11280794
awt	swing
lightweight swing jcomponents are behind awt components

11280794

the uiview of a uiviewcontroller is presented by a uiwindow

11281263
uiview	uiwindow	uiviewcontroller	uiwindow
when you change the uiview of a uiviewcontroller by constructing a new uiview it does not mean that it will reflect in the uiwindow

11281263
uiview	uiwindow
you might be so lucky that it works the first time however if you reconstruct the uiview before it is presented by the uiwindow everything still works but it is still a bad design that might easily break like you are seeing after the timing is changed

11281303
ubuntu	linux
i am new to linux and installed ubuntu

at the inner most level where the image tag is it s set to 100 x100 so that it fills it s container width as 33 defined in the td and height 20 defined in the tr

11281477
width	height
the div is set to use 100 of the width of the browser and 100 of the height

11281477
width	height
the td is defined as 33 width 3 columns of 33 to fill the browser and height 100 this column will fill 100 of it s parent tr which is set to 20 of the browser height

umask	chmod
apparently umask sets the opposite of chmod it was created like this back in the old days

11294312
umask	chmod
using this example umask 777 creates a file with chmod 000 umask 112 will be equal to chmod 664

11295590

nhibernate	queryover
i use c# and nhibernate queryover

11297012
ienumerable	ienumerator
an iterator ienumerator and ienumerable for c# is used to access elements of a structure in an ordered manner without exposing the underlying representation

11297013
authorization	access-control
however it took us ages to get wcf to work in a proper restful way - if we were doing the project from the start then we would probably write our own restful web-server that sits on top of http.sys instead of plugging into iis as it needlessly complicates things at times for example our service uses http basic authorization for access-control something iis likes to get in-between

11297020
typemock	moles
any mocking framework will help you with this task while moles typemock isolator and such will allow you to mock setauthcookie directly

11297026
setinterval	clearinterval
setinterval keeps calling the enclosed function repeatedly till clearinterval is called

11297064
rss	feed
basically you create another file which transforms and styles the xml document your rss feed created in cakephp to make the browser render it differently

11297069
daemons	systemd
why don t you look at it like systemd level daemons vs application level in container

11297072
firefox	safari
everything works in firefox etc but safari tries to open the file in a new window resulting in gibberish for filetypes it does not understand

11297089
cos	sin
changing float to int will not give you space savings and may complicate computations 1.5 1.5 is easy in floats while if you are using scaled ints it will require extra operation 15 15 100 and sin cos used for rotation may not work so well either

11297144
submit	submission
while submission after the first submit you could add a warning with javascript

11297158
hide	show
you could show or hide an html element using css property display none

11297189
hide	show
i wrote a script to hide and show a loader for my asp.net web application

11297194
put	get
if you put identical code into a per-call wcf service you get the 2-3 seconds delay on every call the first call and all subsequent calls

11297215
getter	setter
i m wondering what s the canonical way in ruby to create custom setter and getter methods

11297215
getter	setter
however this makes implementing a getter a bit tricky creating a method with the same name but with no arguments will just overwrite the setter

11297215
getter	setter
ruby custom getter setter

11297217
width	height
simply set width and height of the svg-container to the maximum values the image is likely going to have and you are fine

11297217
opera	firefox
only restriction is that firefox and opera yes the same two browsers that caused this mess dont work well with very big images -- dont use too high values for the dimensions

11297217
opera	firefox
the reason why this works is that opera and firefox render svgs before resizing them instead of the other way round as it is supposed to be done with vector gfx

11297251
hide	show
could someone please tell me how to make an ajax hide show toggle script also alternate between showing the contents of another element block

11297251
hide	show
and the hide show state of that iframe is controlled by this form button

11297254
textview	imageview
with the imageview above the textview the application would crash at the following line

11297254
textview	imageview
if i moved the imageview below the textview the application would run but the textview were covered by the imageview

11297268
wan	lan
i want to deploy a wcf web service but to be perfect wsdl must be accessed from any computer from lan and wan

11297268
wan	lan
the problem is that when local lan ip is used wan users accessing through the public ip can t download references import because the wdsl uses the local ip in the url

11297296
post	get
in theory i could fire off multiple .load requests but i would have to either query the webservice multiple times inefficient or delay some elements so they get the post webservice data

11297297
children	parent
the filtered model will have a mapping between children and parent with the appropiate method to restore this family

11297297
implements	extends
lastly but most important there is the need to extends the underlying treetable by implements one method and overriding another

11297438
multiplying	addition
in addition if you want to elaborate on the director object by inheritance you may do so without multiplying your hierarchy

11297438
inherited	subclassing
for example you may have an express process of building for saving time before the final construction - you can subclassing the director object or even use template method on it in itself to customize it by inherited without requiring to reimplement your concrete builders

11297464
width	height
most properties that are non-numeric cannot be animated using basic jquery functionality for example width height or left can be animated but background-color cannot be unless the jquery.color plugin is used

11297466
width	height
for example width height or left can be animated but

11297472
min	max
and i want to extract the min and max value from it so that i will only have 2 time period left

11297472
min	max
i understand that it can t work because min and max functions are only working with an array but i don t know how to tranform my in an new array

11297547
keydown	keyup
i have looked into keydown keyup events and while keyup seems to give me the current value of the input after the user has pressed a key i am finding it difficult to remove the effects of what they typed.

11297559
post	get
of course there s a small bonus in the r representational in that a load balancer can easily route the request to the right server if you have nice urls and get could go to a slave while post go to masters

11297574
min	max
like you described then you can use the explode function to turn that string into an array and then use max and min on that array

11297579
stdout	stderr
how do you wrap a bash shell session in a python script so that python can store the stdout and stderr to a database and occasionally write to stdin

11297587
google-chrome	safari
but for some reason it does not work on my iphone i have tried with both mobile safari and mobile google-chrome and all it does is open up the facebook auth page and then dies

11297600
mouseleave	mouseenter
maybe you re better to use mouseenter mouseleave events in this case

11297609
width	height
you want the density scale according to the default of 160 it is a multiplier and when you obtain the height and width in pixels you can use this multiplier in your code to correctly scale

11297629
initializer	class-method
call it in the load or initializer class-method

11297630
keydown	keyup
of note is that keydown and keyup events will return the key pressed while keypress will return which character is entered which may be better for your choice

11297634
google-chrome	firefox
it works on my google-chrome and partially on firefox

11297641
google-chrome	safari
i ve been experiencing an issue in mobile versions of webkit specifically webkit 534.46 on ios 5.1.1 as mobile safari and now google-chrome for ios which doesn t happen on any desktop browser that i ve seen

11297722
getter	setter
with jackson you can annotate properties i.e - fields that have getter setter according to java bean convention with jsonignore

11297722
getter	setter
this way you can prevent issues like recursion no matching setter or getter and so on.

11297722
gson	jackson
try to find out if you have the same at gson or use jackson

versioning	upgrade
that s why i need to upgrade my current versioning

11297762
google-chrome	firefox
this code works fine in google-chrome but does not work in firefox

11297816
put	get
i would hate to have to wait on that to get rendered simply because i put my mouse over an array in the debugger

11297827
versioning	upgrade
one of my users just upgrade to the newest versioning of chrome which has built-in native date picker for html5

11297855
post	get
first glance shows that a post against helpcenter passes the rule for the forums#index match which is encountered first so that s what you get

11297868
notepad++	sublimetext
i m trying to make the jump from notepad++ to sublimetext 2

11297869
equals	gethashcode
if two objects compare as equals the gethashcode method for each

11297881
terminate	timeout
if you are using an executor service you can terminate it with a timeout after having submitted all you callables

11297908
setinterval	settimeout
there re multiple possible ways of working around this but generally you ll have to schedule the animations to run sequentially by using settimeout setinterval animation_function total_interval delay

11297923
dataoutputstream	bytearrayoutputstream
use dataoutputstream that is initialized with a bytearrayoutputstream in order to conveniently write data to the byte array inside an implementation of rowtobytearrayconverter

11297931
folder	directory
i am trying to store an image in my database via the url image location at the moment my php code is storing the image in a folder in the directory called upload

11297945
jobs	cron
i am new at cron jobs and am not sure whether this would would work

11297955
post	put
however in reality the consumer still needs to know all the semantics of that web service call for example what method post or put to use what request parameters to use in the payload in order to make the payment etc.

debian	linux
if you install a linux distro on it debian you are ready to program on it out of the box

it seems to be different from mysql or postgresql

11298163
portrait	landscape
i enabled onconfigchanges event and properly handling when device turns from portrait into landscape

11298173
installation	upgrade
i ve recently upgrade my visualstudio 2010 installation with nuget 2.0 and it seems that this breaks the mvcscaffolding package from hanselman and kirkland

11298173
versioning	upgrade
of course the final statement in the stack dump is you may need to upgrade to a newer versioning of mvcscaffolding but i ve determined that this is appended to the end of all the errors

11298189
postgresql	mysql
it does appear to error in the mysql postgresql and oracle

11298200
pull	push
it depends what you specifically mean by backwards compatibility but you should be able to specify a --depth 1 argument to git clone as described in the git-clone man page and get something where patches can be shared although commits themselves won t be able to be shared via the normal push pull mechanism you might be used to

11298202
oncreate	ondestroy
when such a change occurs android restarts the running activity ondestroy is called followed by oncreate

11298208
inherited	subclassing
almost all classes in cocoa inherited from nsobject and you usually subclassing nsobject if you want to implement a model class

11298319
post	get
i followed a mix of the official instructions and this post since i frankly couldn t make get django to work applying either instructions verbatim

11298384
put	get
lastly if you feel you really must change the attachment name and there are certainly cases where you need to the simplest way is to get the attachment from the old location or with the document put it as the new name and delete the attachment with the old name

i create a qmainwindow containing two qgraphicsview each graphics view are displaying the same scene

11298492
collabnet	svn
well before posting this message in this forum i found many very good svn solutions for windows 64 bits such as visual svn server subversion edge from collabnet and ubersvn from wandisco

11298520
int	chars
assume that the base type of every parameter without references rvalue references pointers or qualifiers is either chars int or float

11298520
int	chars
how can i make it so that all the parameters of base type chars appear first followed by all of those of base type int which leaves the parameters of base type float last

11298520
factors	matrix
in my case the expressions are conditional probability tables and the operation is the factors product but something like matrix multiplication works suitably as well.

11298593
hide	show
that s strange for many reasons i can see the files are definitely in the correct resources folder within the app the webview doesn t disappear or hide it simply show a white background as if it hasn t loaded anything

11298613
margin	height
this would make it always be 80 of the parent object s height have a 5 margin from the bottom and a 15 margin from the top where your header could fit

11298646
google-chrome	firefox
while browsers at least firefox and google-chrome don t parse it as a paragraph they do render a simple string the same as a paragraph in quirks mode by default

11298695
width	height
as far as the html goes i embedded the applet as applet code firstapplet width 300 height 300 with proper opening and closing tags and it is located in the same folder as the java app

11298713
put	get
i just wanted to get at the very last li last item using a css3 selector its nothing major just to put some rounded borders on the hover to stop it spilling out of a container so no back-compatibility is needed since the borders on the container won t be rounded on non css3 browsers anyway

11298788
uinavigationbar	uisegmentedcontrol
i m programmatically adding a uisegmentedcontrol to my uinavigationbar as follows

11298801
freemarker	velocity
if maven resources plugin with filtering from properties files is not enough maybe you could use one of freemarker or velocity maven plugins to generate your pages

11298813
int	double
to cast a double to an int and have it be rounded to the nearest int unlike the typical int 1.8 and int 1.2 which will both round down towards 0 and return 1 simply add 0.5 to the double that you will typecast to an int

11298813
int	double
as a small note this method also allows you to control the threshold at which the double is rounded up or down upon int typecasting

11298813
int	double
that is by adding 0.8 to the double immediately before typecasting 10.15 and 10.03 will be rounded down to 10 upon int typecasting but 10.23 and 10.7 will be rounded up to 11

11298821
google-chrome	safari
i discovered a problem on the ipad that when setting the y-value of translate3d to below 16500px the graphic is not displayed anymore in safari or google-chrome it works totally fine

11298821
width	height
i thought that there might be a limit to the height width of rendering svgs on mobile safari but removing the overflow hidden from the #graphic container lets me scroll all the way down and everything it displayed correctly

11298837
width	height
i think the jquery.hover_caption.js relies on the width and height that you specified for image

11298837
width	height
it will take the width and height values and apply to the parent div that the plugin created on the fly

11298837
width	height
if you dont specify the width and height for the images the plugin will not know what height width it should put to the parent div

11298846
apache	nginx
in my experience passing css js through controllers slower than pure apache nginx request

11298887
feof	fread
if the stream is empty feof returns false while fread has not been called

11298887
fseek	fread
i can t fread 1 byte then fseek as this stream does not support seeking

11298972
equals	tostring
also override the equals and tostring methods provided by the object class

11298972
equals	tostring
however i m not sure how to override equals and tostring methods

11299010

preferences use the nsuserdefaults or cfpreferences apis instead

11299084
firefox	safari
it works fine in safari ie but not firefox

11299117
inherited	subclassing
the methods the category adds to the class are inherited by all the classâ s subclassing just like other methods

11299117
super	implements
it s okay to have a category on super and categories on its subclasses implements the same method and it ll work exactly like if they were part of the classes themselves

11299117
super	implements
though i do recommend following zneak s advice of implements a stub method on super to help with debugging if it ever gets invoked accidentally.

11299172
width	height
if you are getting 0 in the width and height then you will have to wait for the view to draw

11299192

preorder	inorder
somehow i have managed to write an algorithm for constructing a binary tree from it s inorder and preorder traversal data

11299414

if you ll configure apache nginx good it will allow executing two php files in the same while like mine

11299469
width	height
so i get the screen height and width programmatically using

11299469
width	height
but if i set the width and height of my listview with the value measured using the above code the last record of my listview is partially not visible

11299494
post	get
how do i get a custom post by its id in wordpress and show its thumbnail title and content

11299513
getter	setter
the config is used in object creation and when first used in the constructor is applied to the object itself using special methods from the extjs class system core to generate getter and setter and then initialize the component from them

11299513
getter	setter
in your example above the textfield is initialized with your config overriding the default values of the component during creation and then it generates getter and setter for certain attributes like value id and fieldlabel which need to be used instead of config objects after a component is created

11299532
multiplying	add
you can use selector attributes with modern browsers but it s longer to write in a fiddle and then you must consider text password and select element in html 4.01 and in html5 add email number tel etc that ll multiplying the length of your selectors

11299550
button	checkbox
my app is not very complex - it only has a few checkbox and one button

uialertview	uiwindow
if you want to mimic the way uialertview works you need to create a new uiwindow object initialize it properly and show it using

11299575
folder	directory
the where clause of the query uses a directory that is passed to it in order to filter for music within that folder and sub folder

11299602
ienumerable	ienumerator
foreach is not a single operation but rather several calls on ienumerable and ienumerator ienumerable.getenumerator repeated calls to ienumerator.movenext

11299661
put	get
but if i put it on the python path i just get an ugly stack trace ending in

11299672
children	parent
what happens on the terminal ubuntu 10.04 python 2.6.5 if this matters is that i see the echoed c whenever i press it but neither does the parent die in time when all the children should have exited from the job sleeping nor was i able to reclaim the terminal without killing the parent process

11299681
post	get
hopefully once i get started on the project i ll be able to come back and post more intelligent and relevant questions

11299683
ienumerable	iqueryable
you need an iqueryable to use expressions you can bring it back to ienumerable with tolist or similiar

11299719
installation	upgrade
apparently you made a fresh sql server installation and not an upgrade which would have been the recommended approach

11299723
subtract	add
this is supposed to take the address of the items pointer subtract the number of items in the list and add the index of the desired item to the address of p

11299732
serializable	deserialization
the wcf service will do all serializable deserialization for you

11299746
udp	tcp
if you want to use sockets over the internet and you want your application to be usable on every network setting including nat you will have to use a tcp holepunch called technique or udp holepunching may also fit

11299768
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome has good developer tools built in and in firefox you can install firebug

11299804
post	get
also remmeber that if you do that instead of relying on the page post mechanism you would have to use ajax to perform operations on the server otherwise you will get the invalid postback or callback argument

11299852
public	protected
also some mechanism that would allow a user of the cms to mark pages as protected public might make sense

11299854
free	malloc
you do not free the old vector when you do a malloc causing a memory leak

11299887
vpn	lan
everyone else is on the lan i work remotely and connect to the lan with vpn cisco

11299934
box-sizing	border-box
another solution is to change the box-sizing to border-box

11299935
floating-point	integer
you would have to use some alternate mechanism such as returning the value in a different type scaled to an integer in a string in a decimal floating-point format et cetera

11299935
floating-point	integer
this scales the value rounds it to an integer using the current floating-point rounding mode and undoes the scaling

11299945
ienumerable	ilist
change the datatype from ilist to ienumerable second initialize the attribute in the constructor

11299967
post	put
i saw another post recommending using a temporary table to put the data in and then drop the column but the insert machines have very low specs and the amount of data could be pretty significant on the order of 50 000 rows
