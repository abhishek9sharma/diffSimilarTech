you can centralize some of that by having each page subclassing your own application page base class instead of system.web.ui.page and make sure that your page base class inherited from system.web.ui.page

for some reason only in ie tried 7 8 jquery is performing a post request when it should be a get

2900270

2900503
children	parent
i m not 100 sure from your description that func2 is called from within the func1 thread but if func2 is run on a different thread that s started from within func1 killing the func1 thread won t affect func2 as all threads exist as children of your parent process not of the thread that they were started from

2900542
unix	bsd
i m using bsd unix

2900547
udp	tcp
windows firewall seems to allow for setting a protocol number in addition to the usual port number -- tcp is 6 udp 17 etc. but i can t seem to find a protocol number for rtmp

i m using the bowtie symbol for the join operation but when i try to put a text in subscript directly under the symbol i get the following error

2900923
google-chrome	safari
and as bradley mountford points out in a comment below it looks like you can read from webkit using the component parts too although only google-chrome seems to like border-top-left-radius where as both google-chrome safari handle -webkit-border-top-left-radius .

2900923
google-chrome	safari
in webkit tested in google-chrome safari

2900947

2900961
superclass	subclassing
these template methods can be overridden in subclassing which provides for do it mostly like my superclass but do this bit differently

2900987
children	parent
what i don t know is how to iterate inside each loop and check for parent and do that in a dynamic way so that there could be an endless tree of children

2900991
outputstream	inputstream
you should in fact get the contents of the uploaded file as an inputstream and write it to any outputstream the usual java io way

2901017
width	height
i had two identical images one with the height and width attribute and one without

2901027
uiview	subviews
in fact when i don t display the map at all by not even adding it as a subviews of my main uiview but still cycle through the addresses which changes various uilabels and other displayed info the memory usage for the app does not increase

2901032
int	chars
create class person with chars name and int age

2901052
preorder	postorder	preorder	inorder	postorder	inorder
any other operations will depend on what you intend to do with your tree although some generic suggestions are return parent of a given node find left and right child of a given node return the root node preorder inorder and postorder traversals as well as a breadth-first traversal

2901077
google-chrome	firefox
the following code executes fine in firefox and google-chrome but gives an error

2901097
x86	64bit
however with a cas cmpxchg8b on 32-bit systems and cmpxchg16b on 64bit systems for x86 -64 there is enough space in the upper portion of the register to store such a large time-stamp that aba never occurs in practice in even fairly contrived settings it would require one thread to stall for several days or weeks and then to wake-up at precisely the correct moment

2901097
queue	fifo
the papers an optimistic approach to lock-free fifo queue by edya lazan-mozes and nir shavit and simple fast and practical non-blocking and blocking concurrent queue algorithms by maged m

2901180
opencv	emgucv
emgucv is a nice c# port of opencv

2901184

the code to use a shape would be similar to how i structured the code above but you would set the top left width height and the visible property of the shape control instead of setting border properties

2901219
nunit	mstest
is there any advantage to picking nunit for unit integration testing vs the built in mstest

2901281

open a visual studio command prompt as admin cd to the directory where your dll and pdb files are typically your debug folder

2901314
postgresql	mysql
mysql does not provide an implementation of this though it can be simulated with some more or less sophistication i do something similar to the later in postgresql - it s handy for complex non-parametrized queries that are frequently used in reports and for which is tolerable to have not totally up-to-date data

2901336
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
under the hood everything is a view though i ll note that uikit has special views for view controllers which no doubt have some kind of special handling by the system uiviewcontroller has a wrapper view uinavigationcontroller has a uinavigationtransitionview or something ...

2901409
children	parent
when the parent creates the children it should also define the children s other neighbors appropriately as far as it knows them

2901448

the whole app is visible in the html page but for some reason the background colour of the flex app goes past its height and width properties

2901460

2901483
valgrind	glibc
but both valgrind and glibc are complicated beasts and you really really really don t want to do this

2901483
valgrind	glibc
the easy way to get a glibc and valgrind that are mutually compatible is to get both from the linux distro of your choice

2901499
postgresql	mysql
oracle postgresql mysql mssql and sqlite all support as the identifier delimiter though they don t all use as the default - for example you have to be running mysql in ansi mode and sql server only supports it when quoted_identifier is on .

2901512
getc	gets
a lot of time may also be being spent in your gets and getc functions which you didn t provide source for

2901523
getter	setter
this class allows a user to write their own bean method resolution code by placing another class in the same package as the class with the non-standard setter getter to override the logic of with beaninfo appended onto the classname and implementing the beaninfo interface

2901703
stackless	multiprocess
threading and stackless are both single-core and indeed stackless is non-preemptive so programming for it is quite different than programming for either threading or multiprocess

2901809
multiplying	modulo
push n sp instead of copy n modulo multiplying by the word size

2901825
post	get
do not use a get in lieu of post -- that which i suspect is what you mean by send as a query string would only buy you trouble of all sorts and is a violation of the semantics of get which should be limited to read-only queries ones with no side effects

2901828
post	put
i m having some issues trying to make a http put or post using webclient against a mvc 2 controller

2901828
post	put

it s more like those screen recorders which records your keyboard and mouse events and replay them

2901864
organization	naming
i know when i m a lead i establish a formal set of conventions for class naming and organization as one of the first things i do and then hammer it in to the front end underlings -

2901895
post	put
first you need to set either a put or post actionmethodselectorattribute

2901898
for-loop	loops
my preference is to use a for-loop going backwards this avoids conditional logic of updating loops index depending on whether or not you insert something

2901967
google-chrome	firefox
i am mainly because it has become my primary browser so all development is taking place on google-chrome then i test with ie and firefox

2901973
google-chrome	firefox
i test on google-chrome first firefox second and ie last.

2901973
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome is using the webkit rendering engine similar to safari

2901982
getter	setter
if you re using some other codegen tool i can imagine adding withx fluent setter getter methods would also be easy

2901994
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i test on ie firefox google-chrome and opera and occasionally safari

2901994
google-chrome	firefox
for debugging javascript i tend to use google-chrome for its console and sometimes firebug in firefox - they re both very helpful

2902018
range	minimum
one thing i also need to account for is that there are cases where i don t want to include the minimum in the range and cases where i don t want to include the maximum in the range

2902021
inherited	properties
use the basedon attribute to inherited the properties from the aero style

2902028
punctuation	words
basically for every non-noise words in the description discount things like and or by punctuation single-letter words and so on you get an entry in this table with the lower-cased words

2902030
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome it usually works like safari but it s good just to make sure

2902046
google-chrome	firefox
since i m working on a google maps api site i test for what they support google-chrome ie and firefox

2902053
installation	upgrade
my 2.8.1 mysql-ruby bindings had been built against libmysqlclient.so.15 and worked fine until i upgrade my mysql installation and replaced that client library with .so.16

google-chrome	firefox
users are increasingly using firefox or google-chrome even for intranet use

2902207
google-chrome	firefox
my method of development has always been to write for firefox or google-chrome and it kind of just works in ie

2902210
serializable	deserialization
the changes that will make deserialization fail are listed in the java object serializable specification section 5.6.1

2902239

websphere	ibm
ltpa is a mechanism used by websphere and other ibm products e.g lotus products as a means of authentication typically for a single sign on sso

2902326
interpolation	splines
for instance you can use a splines interpolation as implemented in apache commons math

2902332
disk	ram
furthermore think about the architecture the disk is a cache for ram ram is caching for the cpu cache and the cpu cache is for the cpu registers

2902332
disk	ram
so disk - ram - cpu cache - registers there are 3 levels of caching before you get to the registers

2902332
disk	ram
a cache miss at the cpu cache will load more data from ram a cache miss in ram will load more data from disk all this translates into reduced throughput

2902391
width	height
i don t care about dynamically resizing the image according to window size or anything i just want to take large images and resize them to a specific width and height so that the full image fits inside a specific layout

2902475
google-chrome	safari
the problem i m running into is that if you paste the code exactly as seen below using xhtml strict in each browser tested w google-chrome safari ie8 you will see a vertical scroll bar with a few pixels of white space below the div

2902475
google-chrome	safari
doing some experimenting i found that if i remove the doctype completely it works in safari google-chrome but ie gets even worse setting the iframe height to 300px or so

2902475
google-chrome	safari
if i set the doctype to transitional it works in safari google-chrome but has the same problem as in the strict case for ie8

2902488
min	max
this will make you code much cleaner and easier to add standard validation rules like valid email url min length max length etc

2902507
uitableview	uisearchbar
in that view i have a uisearchbar and a uitableview below it

2902559
hide	show
it s not really a solution more a hack but if i hide it and show it again the first time it works

2902582
portrait	landscape
does anyone know how to either lock mobile safari s orientation to portrait or to block landscape via javascript or otherwise

2902601
qtableview	qtreeview
if i replace qtreeview with qtableview in sample source memory will not be consumed

2902601
qtableview	qtreeview
so it seems that qlistview and qtreeview are not intended to be used with very big amount of data and qtableview must be used instead

2902625
switching	screens
i am working with orbited and once i switching on orbited in production mode it throws the following error on my screens

2902640
width	height
how can i quickly access the screen resolution width height as integer values

base-class	subclassing
the python documentation on __del__ warns that the subclassing needs to call the base-class to get a clean deletion but here that appears to be impossible

2902871
post	get
a modelbinder translates http get and post information to a strongly typed object but conceptually these types aren t domain objects but similar to data transfer objects

2902886
portrait	landscape
while i tested my application on an android device turning my android phone from landscape to portrait results in all the list items in my list view are disappearing

2902979
post	get
bear in mind that this is pretty inefficient since for each comment you ll be retrieving the wall post so if a wall post has 10 comments you ll get the wall post data 10 times each time with a different comment

2902986
switching	screens
another application is switching templates when a window is resized used very often in wpf but also applicable to silverlight in order to show less details or a different layout for different screens sizes

2903032
serializable	deserialization
for the xml you need an xml parser when all major browser already have a json parser built in - so you don t have to worry about serializable deserialization

2903035
uitableview	uipickerview
the accepted ui for multiple selection on the iphone is to use a uitableview with checkmarks don t use uipickerview for multiple selection

2903040
versioning	upgrade
afterwards you can decide what applications you want to upgrade to the new versioning and do this as an entirely separate process

2903040
versioning	upgrade
whatever you do do not modify the core framework code of an existing framework implementation unless you are going to completely upgrade it to the next versioning

2903040
versioning	upgrade
upgrade your framework trunk in one repository then if you need to you can manually upgrade to a new versioning in an application repository

2903068
mouseover	mouseout
if the mouse is already over the element when the document loads itself the mouseover function doesn t trigger i need to mouseout and then mouseover again in order to trigger it

2903082
implements	extends
i need to scan class or jar file that implements or extends a specific class

2903149
voip	sip
a well-documented way to do this with udp is the stun protocol used mainly for sip -based voip

2903149
peer	p2p
if it is not possible to get behind the router you can only use a server in the open network as intermediator some p2p systems also promote well-connected peer to such intermediators

2903152
free	malloc
if you re using glibc you can set the malloc_check_ environment variable to 2 this will cause glibc to use an error tolerant version of malloc which will cause your program to abort at the point where the double free is done

2903195
hide	show
no need to create a diagram per view i prefer to use the show hide links and directly navigate in the java code and model from the same diagram it is easier and a lot more powerful because interactive

2903214
post	get
you can t really use post since i imagine you will be redirecting to the error page and therefore get requests are pretty much your best option

2903223
istream	getline
if you want to read characters from the istream then by using get and getline

2903223
istream	getline
std istream getline

2903224
ubuntu	linux
assuming you re running it on ubuntu linux

2903226
vim	gedit
my first choice would be a plugin for intellij second option on for vim or gedit

2903244
getter	setter
searching here and on the internet have not let me to a example of a live template for delphi that generate a property with getter setter and also generate the private field and execute the complication

2903257
accessor	properties
in c# 3.0 and later auto-implemented properties make property-declaration more concise when no additional logic is required in the properties accessor

2903257
accessor	properties
when you declare a properties as shown in the following example see msdn article for example the compiler creates a private anonymous backing field that can only be accessed through the properties s get and set accessor

2903264
int	double
only classes that inherit from system.valuetype string int double ...

2903296
jruby	rubinius	jruby	mri	ironruby	rubinius	mri	rubinius
for those methods which are not implemented in ruby they are implemented in c in mri yarv and tinyrb in java in jruby and xruby in c# in ironruby and ruby.net in smalltalk in maglev and smallruby in abap in blueruby in go in rubygolightly in c++ in rubinius or in objective-c in macruby the netbeans ruby plugin contains a stub method that only lists the method signature and the rdoc comments but not the actual implementation

2903573
comparator	comparable
when to use comparable vs comparator

2903573

if you re using linq2sql can t you build the tree by just getting all the categories without parent and then access the children as needed to build the tree

2903627
svg	vml
so was thinking about an svg vml solution like raphael javascript library

2903631
inherited	properties
any control inherited from system.web.ui.control has properties attributes which you can use to add or append style attribute

2903662
post	put
use either the pre build or post build event command line you put delete commands and such in there or run a batch file or script

2903762
button	checkbox
the visibility of the button can be configured via checkbox

2903762
button	checkbox
checking the checkbox and saving means the correpsonding button should be shown

2903788
spaces	delimiter
because multiple classes are delimiter by spaces

2903799
addeventlistener	preventdefault
why can t the events be trapped from the gm end using addeventlistener preventdefault stoppropagation etc

2903809
hash	md5
it will cost a bit extra but you can compare stuff using md5 or sha hash and if 2 versions are the same you can move on

2903852
implements	extends
if you or extends or implements classes or interfaces model the attributes and operations of those elements

2903859
maven	pom.xml
i m working with maven pom.xml files and i don t wish to source control iml files

2903956
pop-up	dialog
i have a really odd behavior here i created a little pop-up dialog in jquery ui and in my test html page it works flawlessly

2903956
pop-up	dialog
in firefox 3.5.6 i do get the dialog as a pop-up

2903956
pop-up	dialog
in both cases the dialog page pop-up disappears again after a second or less - without me clicking anything

2903956
pop-up	dialog
update ok one problem is solved - it appears that for whatever reason the default ms ajax stuff is adding some kind of an observer to my pop-up dialog and closes it right away after it shows up -

2903956
pop-up	dialog
so i changed the to and how that doesn t happen anymore - the dialog box pop-up and stays there until i click on either of the two buttons ok and cancel

2903960
realloc	malloc
you can use realloc on the old rows and malloc on the new rows to fix this

2903975
google-chrome	firefox
update i made another test case and got it working in firefox and google-chrome it probably works in other webkit-based browsers too

2903975
google-chrome	firefox
update 2 on further testing the scrolling directions in firefox and google-chrome were opposite

2904035
post	get
i didn t post all the code but i think with this part you can get an idea of it

2904045
getter	setter
the example titled read write property on the already-mentioned delphi live templates page can be modified to generate getter setter methods instead of a private field

width	height
my application performs a 90 degree rotation on a drawing area so the width and height of the drawing area need to be swapped

2904052
width	height
how can i resize the drawing area with gtk in a way so that the new width and height are actually enforced not just requested

2904058
folder	directory
as i understand it the directory structure within the regression.acceptance.tests folder needs to be preserved when copied by the merge task but the documentation is a little vague and i haven t got it to do anything yet

2904134
mouseleave	mouseenter
the main cleanup would be that .css can take an object and .hover as a shortcut for mouseenter and mouseleave like this

2904151
superclass	subclassing
the normal object-oriented way is to use superclass and subclassing

2904168
printwriter	bufferedwriter
bufferedoutputstream and printstream both extend filteroutputstream but bufferedwriter and printwriter does not extend filterwriter

2904206

this property seems to be unable to handle xhtml at all tested in firefox and google-chrome

2904216
actionscript	mxml
mxml is formally an actionscript generation language

2904216
actionscript	mxml
so the flex compiler will translate all mxml into actionscript

2904248
width	height
the stackcontainer is sized with width and height 100

2904248
width	height
the widget hierachy that contains the stackcontainer is actually a custom widget so the stackcontainer is not actually in a bordercontainer directly but has its height and width explicitly set to 100

2904248
width	height
the inlined height and width specified on the bordercontainer are replaced with explicit pixel dimensions by the stackcontainer

2904248
width	height
however on browser resize the stackcontainer is resized to its parent widget correctly but the explicit height and width on the bordercontainer are incorrect

2904248
width	height
the width and height computed by dojo.marginbox are incorrect the offsetwidth and offsetheight are the dimensions from before the browser maximise

2904248
width	height
maybe this issue is because the stackcontainer is the subcontainerwidget of a custom widget and so is sized with width and height 100

2904253
springsource	grails
i m using springsource tool suite eclipse to program with grails and i m also using jfreechart in the program

2904264
versioning	upgrade
so possibly my question for those more knowledgable about c# dotnet is how does the class loading work that somehow my app thinks there are two versioning types of the interface type and how can i fix that keeping in mind its a dotnet 3.5 vs 4 issue as it worked before my upgrade

2904283
processors	hyperthreading
to be able to detect the number of physical processors cores correctly i ll have to detect if hyperthreading is supported and active or enabled if you prefer and if so divide the number of logical processors by 2 to determine the number of physical processors

2904283
cpu	processors	cpu	hyperthreading	processors	hyperthreading
a quad core intel cpu s with hyperthreading enabled has 4 physical cores yet 8 logical processors hyperthreading creates 4 more logical processors

2904894
fileoutputstream	printwriter
two things i see instantly maybe copy paste-error are that you don t close the printwriter writer in generatexml and you don t close fileoutputstream fos in writetozipfile

2905016

cpu	processors	cpu	irq	cpu	affinity	affinity	processors	affinity	irq
use a sheilded cpu basically this means turn off irq affinity for a selected cpu set the processors affinity mask for all other processes on the machine to ignore your targeted cpu

2905082
cpu	affinity
on your app set the cpu affinity to run only on your shielded cpu

2905386
nsstring	nsobject
something a little different is happening is again specifying a type but this time it s a type casting operation -- what this means is to take the something object reference which could be an nsstring nsnumber or ... and treat it as a reference to an nsobject

2905393
implements	extends
we often need to exchange the messages between 2 devices but the communication protocol is not a public or general one so we need to extends the framework to implements a communication protocol for receiving or sending a message completely

jboss	geronimo
some other application servers that also include servlet containers are jboss and geronimo

2905775
ienumerable	ienumerator
there s no reason that you have to implement ienumerable in order to create a function called getenumerator that returns an ienumerator that just means that you won t be able to supply an instance of that type to something that expects an ienumerable

2905801

int	double
i m attempting to use a double to represent a bit of a dual-value type in a database that must sometimes accept two values and sometimes accept only one int

2907137
min	max
more operations like max min value if they exist or an iterator would be nice of course

2907137
min	max
to implement it i would parse a list into several min max value mod pairs like 1 10 0 1 for 1-10 or 11 33 1 2 for 1-33odd or 12 62 2 10 for 12-62 10 i

2907159
post	get
please consider this post on how to get calendar components from an nsdate

as a rule of thumb int stays int and any other key is converted to its string representation including boolean and float values as well as null and undefined

2907444
folder	directory
add a post-build command that basically copies the file from the folder into the top directory

2907463

i have a parent child relationship let s say class and children

2907586
folder	directory
be aware that this folder is used to populate the inital appdata directory for each new user added to the system

edit whoops sorry i forgot to note where these mysterious stdout and stderr come from

2907756
stdout	stderr
for instance in test one you are writing stdout but in test two you are writing to stderr because of some sort of error

2907771
getter	setter
i also know i can use keyboard commands but i m asking if there s a more permanent solution. i have a lot of properties and my setter do important things so it s silly to step over them but most of my getter are pointless

2907814

you can have your class implement iequatable and override the default gethashcode and equals properties to make them equals if all the values are the same or whatever criteria is approproate

2907841
bellman-ford	floyd-warshall
you can use the bellman-ford algorithm to produce a set of single source shortest paths for each node to help you to solve the problem but you might find the floyd-warshall algorithm preferable

2907865
accessor	properties
or you can also bind the selecteditem properties of your listbox to one of your properties and navigate to the uri in the set accessor of this properties

2907874
packets	pcap
first you should know that pcap give you packets and will not reconstruct the tcp stream so you won t be able to read full http tcp streams without first reconstructing the data

2907875
width	height
width height cannot be enforced by a widget they are determined by its container only

2907919
distance	pdist
however pdist is not what i want since that s euclidean distance

2907940
int	boolean
similarly the add method s signature is public boolean add eâ o so it will only accept int as arguments and will fail at compile time if you try to add the wrong type

2907942

2908210
put	get
we ve experience the exact same problem and at the time put it down to our query being badly formed - that sql 2005 had let us get away with it but 2008 wouldn t

2908211
pull	push
so i could push to x then push to y then pull from z and my hg outgoing x output is difficult to predict local-only

2908228

i have a menu which reads file info but for some reason when i open a video that i know is 1280x720 the width and height come up as 1292x758

2908254
qsort	strcmp
in this case it s pretty easy since strcmp works nicely with qsort

2908270
int	double
even though type int is convertible to type double it still doesn t mean that you can attach a reference to the result of that conversion

2908278
vbscript	jscript
scripts can be in vbscript jscript or a mix of vbscript and jscript

this has no problems in any browser tested in ie7 8 and google-chrome but firefox where it is extremely laggy and jumpy and doesn t keep with the 10 fps rate

2908413
accessor	properties
why can t you annotate each one of the properties accessor with an attribute

2908415
getter	setter
convention question when do you use a getter setter function rather than using a property

2908415
getter	setter
i ve run into a lot of differing opinions on getter and setter lately so i figured i should make it into it s own question

2908415
width	height
however their properties often raise events such as resized when a form s width or height property is set

2908415
getter	setter
what is acceptable to place in a getter or setter and what should be kept in only accessor methods

2908433
hide	show

2908440
lxml	elementtree
mostly i have seen people recommend lxml but given my parsing requirements do i really stand to benefit from it or would elementtree serve my purpose better

2908458
getter	setter
if a setter or getter is expected to be expensive don t make it a property make it a method

2908479
lxml	elementtree
lxml is basically a superset of elementtree so you could start with elementtree and then if you have performance or functionality issues then you could change to lxml

2908502
textview	imageview
i have extended an arrayadapter to manage a listview using a certain tamplate made of 1 imageview and 1 textview contained in a relativelayout as row of the list

i m attempting to implement a repository pattern with my poco objects auto-generate from my edmx

2908567
google-chrome	safari
it s tough to establish a character count with a non-monospaced font but if you don t limit it on the content side you run the risk of upsetting your less visually-inclined users who may be using older browsers that don t zoom all fancy like the latest releases of safari and google-chrome

2908571
ienumerable	iqueryable
just create the basic design which you iqueryable does and drop on the tread pattern that is required as needed your public ienumerable does

2908609

to my understanding it s a free and open source gpgpu library that doesn t depend on opencl instead converting code to hlsl glsl shaders via linq

2908625
actualheight	actualwidth
unfortunately this only works on load because as it seems actualheight and actualwidth don t notify for changes

firefox	safari
firefox and safari don t have this issue

2914646
firefox	safari
firefox and safari s ecmascript javascript engines make those particular properties non-enumerable attribute so they would not be iterated over in a for...in loop

width	height
i have been looking all over the web for a way to plot an ellipse from rectangle coordinates that is top-left corner x y and size width and height

2914807
width	height
the ellipse must be limited to the rectangle s coordinates so if i feed it a rectangle where the width and height are 4 or any even number i should get an ellipse that completely fits in a 4x4 rectangle and not one that will be 5x5 like what those algorithms are giving me

2914808
boost	allocator
we added a small object allocator based on boost to our system in under 2 hours

2914851

scala is less about explicit setter and getter methods than java

2915388
portrait	landscape
you can add folders called drawable-port and drawable-land for resource images that are different in portrait and landscape mode...just give them the same filename in their respective folders and reference that filename in the layout code

2915388
portrait	landscape
this same technique can be used on your layout folders to create entirely different layouts in portrait and landscape if simply having two versions of an image isn t sufficient

if i put the alert within the onclick attribute i at least get the alert to work

2915516

coldfusion	verity
coldfusion 9 s full text search is now based on apache lucene solr or verity but it has too much limitations

cassini	iis
so as most of us do we don t really debug applications under cassini - instead we use iis pointed at our source code that we re continually changing

2915579
folder	directory
other functional work-arounds would include setting this to a folder outside of your debugging iis application directory path has benefits with source control systems or adding an iis application for the debug release copies under the obj folder has other potential benefits

2915584
folder	directory
if we did start using tag branches its been suggested then we d make a full path copy into the tags directory we d still merge onto a single tag branch and put a log comment marking the release number we just have too many modules to manage them as 1 tag folder per branch

2915584
versioning	upgrade
and no we never make changes to historical revisions - if a customer needs new functionality they have to upgrade to the latest versioning which is never a problem until they change the base platform versioning

it s a byte array and i don t know how to go about determining if it s an rtp or rtcp packet

2916178

ant	maven
i have an open-source project that i am converting from ant to maven including its unit tests

2916209

mostly either bitconverter or binaryreader binarywriter

2916264

you probably want an int long float double decimal - or maybe datetime or timespan

2916293
integer	unsigned
looks like you re treating it as an 24-bit unsigned integer

2916311
dictionary	map
you could use a dictionary to map but that doesn t really let you do any additional processing during the transitions

2916338
post	get
it works fine except that when i try to post method xmlhttprequest from ie i get the login dialog again which causes the request to fail

2916353
int	chars
a chars is just an int value

2916353
int	chars
you can convert each chars digit to its int value and you could then iterate over each chars in the string and do something like this

2916356
int	chars
not magically like that you would need to read in the int and break up the digits yourself or read it as a string so you can access each chars individually

2916363
free	malloc
you ve now lost track of the memory allocated by malloc and have no way to delete it using free

2916379
gridview	sqldatasource
on my ascx page i am using a sqldatasource to select a left join of company and address and a gridview to display the results

2916379

by having my updatecommand and deletecommand of the sqldatasource execute two statements separated by a semi-colon i am able to use the gridview s edit and delete functionality to update both table simultaneously

2916405
width	height
i guess that you could put this logic in the a viewmodel and databind the width height center and orientation to properties on the vm

2916413
hash	salt
of course if you don t need strong keys you can go with just a hash of secret word salt + user name and verify them in the application but this is crackable in minutes

2916445
postgresql	mysql
if it is sqlite then consider using postgresql or mysql because sqlite does not play nice with regard to concurrent connections

i ve also looked into other langs which have raii and could serve as good alternatives and so far i ve found that d ada vb perl python c php tcl and lua seem to have some sort of out-of-scope callback

2916588
g++	gcc
most linux distributions let you install multiple versions of gcc or g++ in parallel

2916588
g++	gcc
if g++ isn t available for your version of your distro or if you don t have admin rights then you ll have to download gcc compile it yourself and install it under your home directory

2916645
hash	md5
i would suggest using the md5 hash of

2916645
hash	md5
following the advice of the helpful people i would take a hash probably md5 of the query concatenated with a list of its parameters and use this as the key for that particular data store

2916672
packets	pcap
just take the ethernet frames that you get from pcap and extract the ip packets from them reassembling any that were fragmented

2916672

also if pcap happens to miss any packets make sure you deal with this appropriately

2916703
for-loop	loops
does it help to change the foreach loops to a regular for-loop

2916704

not in the way you describe however there are various profiling tools for linux like oprofile systemtap and perf events i m not sure how well they d fit into embedded development though

atomic	lockless
while not the paterson algo the atomicboolean and atomic classes use the approach of lockless busy loops to update shared data

2916821
jar	manifest.mf
well as you pointed you the problem is that the manifest.mf is generated during package and directly included in the final jar and all this occurs after test

2916844
merb	ruby-on-rails

2916949
maven	pom.xml
maven will not be able to validate this pom.xml because the path is not absolute

2916957
width	height	actualheight	actualwidth
at this point i would expect any of the size properties height width actualheight actualwidth desiredsize rendersize to give me the size of the textblock

2916962
integer	unsigned
i have a database table which contains an unsigned integer field to store the visitor s ip address

2917000
integer	unsigned
although is now an integer i ve read that mysqli has trouble binding unsigned integers so you should just use s as the type when you bind

2917000
integer	unsigned
you can convert to a string representation of the unsigned integer with sprintf

2917001
pull	push
one might use this to pull using the read-only https protocol and push using an ssh-based protocol

2917062
children	parent
you just have to use font-size property with elements like hn li p and so on but don t try to size both a parent div or blockquote and child paragraphs and headings otherwise children elements don t have the 10px - 1em equivalence anymore

2917072
children	parent
that way you can create the parent enrollment table then just insert new children as you encounter them in the form

2917085
onresize	onload
the way to do it apparently is to use javascript to monitor the onload and onresize events and programmatically resize the filling div like so

2917109
cvs	svn
we have some directories that are tracked in both cvs and svn loooong story

2917120

eugene s suggestion of using ecc is a good one - ecc keys are much shorter than rsa or dsa for a given security level

2917141
post	get
but if i use a selectlist in my model and a drop down list in my view and then try to post the model back to my create method i get the error missing method exception no parameterless constructor for this object

2917173
pop-up	dialog
dialog pop-up

2917179
hide	show
considering that i have to support ie6 i wanted to just hide the icons anytime an animation started and show them again when the queue was empty

2917179
hide	show
i couldn t find a reference to any kind of events or hooks into the queue itself and i d rather not add the hide code then the show code to every animation as a callback

2917192
int	chars
it handles varchar chars decimal float and all mysql int types

2917195
inherited	properties
however sometimes these complex types do not have all of the properties that i need so i create a new class in my project that inherited from the complex type used in the stored procedure

2917198
qthread	qmainwindow
i have a qmainwindow with three widgets inside that are promoted to a class containing a subclassed qthread

2917204
post	get
so by circumventing what you may perceive to be just an interface you re actually circumventing an entire client app which could formulate a simple http post or could perform some complex javascript manipulation followed by connection to a flash player and then a direct connection to a login server but you get the point

2917224
qpainter	qimage
qpainter can be used to paint onto qimage qprinter and qpicture paint devices

2917230
versioning	upgrade
always apply schema changes through upgrade sql scripts that use ddl create alter drop statements to change the deployed schema from the on-disk versioning to the current versioning

2917230
versioning	upgrade
this way you keep all you schema changes under versioning control as source text files you can upgrade from any past versioning to the current application versioning and you can easily test all your upgrade paths including upgrading deployments with very large tables

2917284
webkit	gecko
retrieve parent node from selection range in gecko and webkit raquo

2917285
width	height
consider your grid object with a width and height

2917285
width	height
if the reason you wanted width and height to be constant is really to ensure consistency between width and height and the rest of the contents of your grid object and you ve verified that it doesn t matter whether width and height are replaced before or after other elements of grid are replaced then this assignment should be safe because by the end of the assignment the entire contents of the instance will have been replaced and you ll be back in a consistent state

2917285
width	height
however it then falls to you to ensure that none of grid s internal operations or the operations of friends of grid violate this consistency because the compiler won t be locking down the width and height for you

2917306
nsprogressindicator	nstask
i think this might use things like nsprogressindicator and possibly nstask

2917431
memcached	apc
if our web server would go down sessions would be lost either way so storing them in a local apc or a localhost memcached server maybe isn t that bad

accessor	properties
therefore it differs from the memberbind method by not taking a constructorinfo but a reference to a properties get method properties accessor

2917498
ilist	icollection
created by the expression.listbind method requiring also calls to expression.elementinit this is similar to the membermemberbinding in that an object s member is not being created anew but this time it s an instance of icollection ilist that is being added to with inline elements.

2917501
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
have you tried setting the content offset within viewdidappear rather than viewwillappear

2917502
hide	show
and since this only happens in ie6 it would be silly to hide them in all browsers so in the firing function you can add a class with an ie6 hack like to let them remain show in other browsers

2917504
children	parent
a node keeps its children but it needs to be excised from its parent

2917530
postgresql	mysql
i suggest switching to some other rdbms like mysql or postgresql

2917536
tiff	png
note that some image formats such as png and tiff do fully support the translucency so if you need that then those are the ones to go for

2917545
postgresql	mysql
note that neither mysql nor postgresql guarantee that insert â select â order by will result in the data being ordered in the table

2917560
cpu	processors
if the bottleneck is cpu and you have multiple cpus cores then multiple sessions can use multiple the processors which should speed things up

2917565
folder	directory
i installed kohana in a kohana directory in my xampp public folder and i m trying to get the full base url with the domain and protocol

2917626
public	protected
a class-member-declaration can have any one of the five possible kinds of declared accessibility â 3.5.1 public protected internal protected internal or private

2917633
udp	tcp	icmp	udp	icmp	tcp
ports are abstractions in tcp and udp but not present in icmp the protocol used by ping

2917681
xslt	xquery
it is part of xslt 2.0 but not xquery or standalone xpath

2917813
google-chrome	safari
i have tried using the last-child element but it doesn t work in safari or google-chrome

2917821
rsa	dsa
dsa signatures are signficantly shorter than rsa ones

2917844
sip	sdp
for 1 i don t know anything about jmf so can t answer directly but sdp is not actually a complicated standard unlike sip which is so constructing an sdp packet shouldn t be that difficult

2917844
rtp	sdp
the minimum you need to build an sdp packet are the codecs you re offering and the ip socket you re accepting the rtp on

2917844
rtp	sip
for 2 once you get an ok response you will know the ip socket that the sip user agent server uas is listening on and the codecs it accepts and can start sending your rtp

2917844
rtp	sip
the sip side of the pstn gateway is the same as any other sip uas and once it accepts an invite request it will start sending rtp tp the socket specified in the request and likewise will start listening for rtp on the socket it has placed in the ok response that will be sent back to your sip client

2917844
voip	sip
now it does get confusing because you ll have voip providers that operate sip proxy servers or sip pstn gateways which make it seem as if sip does operate on a client-server model but it doesn t

2917844
rtp	sip
a b2bua like asterisk has a sip configuration option called canreinvite which if set to yes will result in it sending re-invites to either end of the call once it s answered to get the rtp to flow directly between the call endpoints rather than being bridged through itself of course if codec transcoding recording or an equivalent feature is required it will not attempt the re-invite

2917844
rtp	sip
a different approach is a traditional sip proxy approach such as used by openser where it s not designed to bridge media at all and all calls through it will always result in the rtp being directly between the sip devices at either end of the call

2917880
children	parent
i m new to monorail and am trying to figure out how to have it so that i can select a parent category in a dropdown then have it show a second dropdown with the categories that are children of the parent

2917882
rubygems	rvm
you should use rvm as others have said to manage multiple installations of ruby and rubygems

2917908
nsdatecomponents	nscalendar
i figure i can achieve what i want by using nscalendar and nsdatecomponents but that would run something like the following

2917917
free	calloc	free	malloc	calloc	malloc
in other words every calloc or malloc needs a free every new_item needs a free_item and so on

2917947
stdout	stderr
when it gets a new job it forks writes the pid and running status to the db record opens up stdout stderr files based on the unique job id and uses ipc run to direct stdout stderr to these files

2917965
awt	swing
but some libraries and i think awt and swing do this internally use the class.forname ... method to lazily load implementation classes

2917997
nsmutablestring	nsstring
i took mike s work and turn it into a category for nsmutablestring and nsstring

2918007
org.json	jackson
json reportedly the jackson json parser is faster than the org.json parser built into android

2918008
subtract	add
if i make new_x x cos angle - y sen angle and new_y x sen angle + y cos angle if then i add or subtract the object center x and y to new_x and new_y i actually get to the new point except when angle is 180 where i would need to go with -new_x + x

2918014
floating-point	integer
you would then create the snapshots by calling drawtobitmap on each control you wish to animate and create the movement effect by drawing the snapshots onto the canvas system.drawing can draw images with floating-point coordinates avoiding the jerkiness of integer locations

2918037
maven	m2e
i m using m2e to manage maven projects

2918037
maven	m2e
does m2e or maven itself maintain settings anywhere that i can blow away

2918046
matplotlib	scipy
there are 3rd party tools such as scipy and matplotlib to help specifically with data analysis visualization

2918182
width	height
figure out the difference between the black squares width and height

2918182
width	height
figure out the difference between the blue squares width and height

2918182
portrait	landscape
how can i figure out how much to crop by depending on if the blue square is landscape or portrait

2918218
nullreferenceexception	argumentnullexception
the difference between argumentnullexception and nullreferenceexception is that argumentnullexception is always thrown explicitly like so

2918233
client-side	server-side
python is a server-side language flash is a client-side language

2918279
tcplistener	tcpclient
i m using a tcpclient passed to me from a tcplistener and for the life of me i can t figure out a simple way to get the address and port it s connected to

2918444
mouse	keyboard
enables or disables mouse and keyboard

2918453
mouseover	mouseout
if you re willing to use a richtext field eg contenteditable and designmode you can wrap the word with a and attach mouseover and mouseout events to it

2918453
mousemove	mouseout	mouseover	mousemove	mouseover	mouseout
to determine position you d probably want to start a mousemove event observer if there is a mouseover event on the and stop the mousemove event if there is a mouseout event on the

2918513
subclass	abstract-class
is there a better way in jpa than having to make all the entities subclass something like taggable abstract-class

2918516
union	distinct
use count distinct hashtag.tag_name -- it can t go in the same select you have except with a union of course but on a select of its own or an appropriate union it will give the result you want

2918552
wxpython	wxformbuilder
for such low-end hardware i suggest wxwidgets or wxpython using wxformbuilder to create dialogs

2918552
kate	geany
alternatively you can use some simpler programmer s editor like geany or kate

2918630
width	height
my favorite way to do it it s by using because it s allow do use width height margins and padding

2918644
int	boolean
you can provide more constructor overloads but obviously the number would explode as the number of parameters grow and you may even have multiple boolean and int arguments which would really make a mess out of things

2918654
width	height
the 2d variant takes a float and two parameters height and width

2918806
mouse	keyboard
you might need a microsoft keyboard to use it though you need an m mouse for intellipoint

2918828
yacc	bison
parsing eval hand-written fsm eating characters yacc bison

2918837
hash	salt
limiting chars makes password brute forcers easier smaller pool of chars to check and it shouldn t affect their storage as they should be salt and hash

2918855
versioning	upgrade
i would like to upgrade my fluentnhibernate to versioning 1.1 but i found out it uses castle.core 1.1

2918890
converter	multibinding
if so you could use a multibinding and change your converter to an imultivalueconverter

2918906
post	get
if you post code showing what you are trying to do and where you are having problems you are more likely to get an answer as at least it shows you ve attempted to find a solution

2918935
temporary	tablespace
the difference is because temporary tables are not memory structures they are written to disk specifically your nominated temporary tablespace

2918946
getter	setter
if you know there are no observable side-effects calling the getter or setter i wouldn t bother

2918972
inherited	properties
however the contentpresenter does not inherited the minheight and minwidth properties from the visual child it renders

2918972
width	height
the only remaining issue is to correct these minimums so that the window width and button panel height is taken into account

2918979
getter	setter
general rule not much point in writing tests for getter and setter

2919005
getter	setter
maybe one day someone decides to change a field type or to add some unit conversion code to a setter getter - a test will show if the code still works or it will show that more work is needed

2919015
getter	setter
i ve only seen a very few problems with getter and setter in the wild and only one of those could have been detected via a unit test and only then if all of the getter and setter were tested together rather than by individual test methods

2919015
getter	setter
consider the copy paste mistake of reusing the same field from two different pairs of getter setter

2919015
getter	setter
unit tests that focus on one setter getter pair at a time won t expose the problem

2919015
getter	setter
modern ides will generate getter and setter on request so this mistake is unlikely but not everyone uses modern ides

2919015
getter	setter
for this reason if i test getter and setter at all and i often don t it s from a single test method that calls all of the setter first with distinct values then asserts on all of the getter

2919015
getter	setter
one problem you ve got to live with though is that there s no guarantee that a method that starts life as a simple getter or setter will stay that way when someone else gets their hands on the code and decides say that a getter is a good place do something that involves a side-effect

2919020
onkeyup	onkeydown
in the onkeyup onkeydown and onkeypress events of the textbox

2919049
kde	gnome
is kde or gnome or other

2919052
folder	directory
if you can add files outside public_html directory put all the directory there and put on the public_html directory all the files inside your web directory put your sf directory if it was needed by your app in this case only the web files are accessible on the public however if you can only access the public_html directory and cannot add directory outside it you can put all your files to a folder inside the public_html and secure it i think .htaccess can do the trick the web files should be in the public_html also but you must change the require_once dirname __file__ . .. config projectconfiguration.class.php

2919088
installation	upgrade
i ve checked tfs installation guide i searched through the web all i could find is upgrade scenarios for the server side

2919099
tmemo	timage
tondrej gives me a very nice sample but this sample only works for components derived from an activex control how can accomplish this same efffect with an vcl component like an timage or tmemo

2919114
width	height
it also enables you to get the height and width of the video

2919118
youtube	vimeo
you can embed youtube videos your own .flv files using jw player vimeo videos etc

2919174
passenger	thin
besides the reason of not restarting server btw you shouldn t use nginx + passenger for development simple mongrel or thin will do the job better in this case i can think of two more

2919211
children	parent
it is not necessary if you are calling databind on entire page or parent container of this label because it will call databind for all its children

2919221
put	get
however even though my page is encoded as utf 8 - in some places when i try to out put utf text i get funny characters like

2919223
curb	libcurl
you need to install libcurl for the curb gem which your app depends on somewhere

2919345
inherited	properties
opaque is a properties of uiview therefore inherited by all controls buttons etc

2919347
width	height
initial co-ordinates are 0 -60 60 0 since height 60 width 60

2919347
width	height
so now the width 70 and the height 70

2919433
mef	prism
if you are working on a localised wpf app though then i d recommend taking a look at the guidance on codeplex at and if you re building a composite app using prism or mef then i have a blog post on a nice way to accomplish wpf localisation using standard bindings

2919434
post	get
when i get it working i ll post code here but check out above link for the mouse-zoom-to-point part

2919434
post	get
i ll just post the code here rather than get you to follow a link

2919461
sproutcore	javascriptmvc
i have been looking at sproutcore and javascriptmvc

2919461
sproutcore	javascriptmvc
i know sproutcore is backed by apple and looks like it is getting more popular by the day and it has a nice green website whereas javascriptmvc looks less professional with less of a following and less momentum behind it

2919474
mvp	presenter
mvvm model - view - viewmodel is an adaptation of the mvp model -view - presenter or mvc model - view - controller patterns both of which are very popular design patterns for c++ applications

2919474
inotifypropertychanged	icommand
primarily the changes revolve around cleanly supporting the binding and command architecture present in the xaml technologies through use of inotifypropertychanged and icommand objects

2919497
migrate	upgrade
i have been looking for a way to migrate and upgrade our tfs 2008 server to 2010 server preferably without losing any data

2919518
button	checkbox
checkbox and radio button being sub-class of button as displayobject

2919528
post	get
a user is suppose to be able to write some words in a search field and get hits on post that contain the words

2919533
stderr	fflush
you can force flushing the buffer using fflush stderr

2919546
lisp	scheme
first off the syntax is neither common lisp nor scheme the two main lisp dialects which are in common use

2919546
lisp	scheme
secondly it s common more so in scheme than in lisp to use tail recursive functions rather than accumulator based ones so rather to add two lists without using the library functions you would typically take two lists and return a list whose head is the sum of the heads of the two lists and whose tail is the result of adding the elements of each lists tails

2919576
post	get
also note that comparing each post will be o n and could get very slow

2919576
postgresql	mysql
many databases including mysql and postgresql have full-text search

2919580
stdout	fflush	stdout	stderr	stderr	fflush
although we actually did it to stdout but the same rules apply - the actual fflush may not be necessary for stderr but it does no harm

2919590
profiling	benchmarking
you should consider using ab apache benchmarking tool to run a large number of queries and xhprof to profiling analyse your code

2919611
aggregate-functions	sum
sum weight is an aggregate-functions

2919612
children	parent
it may be because of a subtlety in xpath where will select all descendant a elements that are the first para children of their parent and not the first a element in the entire document

2919617
nspopupbutton	nscell
if this is just a warning you re getting from the compiler it s probably because cell is a method of nscontrol nspopupbutton s grand-superclass and is typed as returning an nscell

2919631
curb	libcurl
even curb seems to need libcurl

2919699
for-loop	loops
in your case the whole for-loop and its block is read and all variables except loops variables are expanded to their current value

2919704
versioning	upgrade
anyway i am wondering if anyone knows whether microsoft is going to upgrade fxcop because it seems to be stuck in versioning 1.36 for a long time

2919712
serializable	deserialization
of course you might be able to finagle something using the property list serializable api as well or rather deserialization

2919763
gendarme	fxcop
have a look at gendarme it s a lot like fxcop but from the mono project

2919790
perforce	svn
svn is very slow getting revision logs and comparing them perforce used to be fast with these operations

2919795
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox

im trying to get a div to be movable within the constrains of the browser window by dragging the titlebar inside the div

2919881
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
this code is working in google-chrome and opera but not in firefox

2919894
actionscript	mxml
it uses a specific form of xml mxml for layout and supports css and actionscript for scripting and has a lot of prebuild components

2919937
addclass	removeclass
jquery addclass and removeclass are mistyped c should be capital

2919964
post	get
in jsf 1.1 i am assuming that get requests are treated as initial requests resulting in the creation of a new view and post requests are treated as postbacks resulting in the restoration of the old view

2919990
width	height
name block #1 x 0 y 0 width 4 height 1

2919990

opera	firefox
trouble with this file is only for internet explorer works on opera firefox .

2920015
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome the textboxes work as expected however if i view the form in firefox the cursor appears to size to the height of the image but the text is a normal size

2920044
hash	md5
i have a function that generates a md5 hash in c# like this

2920044
hash	md5
is there a way to generate the same md5 hash for the same bytearray

2920085
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this works in firefox safari and google-chrome i assume on windows xp sp3 at least

2920104
superclass	subclassing
the subclassing does not take the place of its superclass

2920104
uicontrol	uibutton
the same way not all uicontrol not all uiviews not all uiresponders and not all nsobjects have the behavior of uibutton not all uibutton have the behavior of your custom subclass

2920147
google-chrome	firefox
it works in firefox but in google-chrome it works only for font families composed from only one word

2920150
google-chrome	firefox
is there a similar way of implementing this in firefox google-chrome

2920154
printf	atof
after all you lose precision when doing a printf and an atof on the other side

2920160
ordinals	difference
difference between stringcomparison.invariantculture and stringcomparison.ordinal are fairly easy to find since ordinals means that the string is not normalized before it is compared

2920222
integer	unsigned
also you mentioned using an unsigned integer

2920266
vsto	add-in
i have office 2007 vsto add-in it uses ribbon xml and so on

2920266
vsto	add-in
the add-in is registered as vstolocal and trusted using vsto inclusion list during installation

2920296
google-chrome	firefox
everything works fine on firefox 3.6.x and ie 7 but i just can t set any cookie in google-chrome 5

2920316
getter	setter
at line 2 and at line 9 it calls the setter and getter respectively

2920316
getter	setter
the bar field for instance was never accessed from outside the class thus the compiler only generated a getter setter for the foo field

2920355
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
html5 video doesn t specify a codec to use some html5 browsers support the h.264 codec google-chrome safari and ie9 others support ogg theora firefox opera google-chrome

2920355
google-chrome	safari
if you have a flash video that is in h.264 then in theory it should work as an html5 in google-chrome safari and ie9 but not in other browsers

2920355
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
to add to the confusion there is a third video codec for html5 called vp8 or webm recently acquired and open-sourced by google this will be supported in firefox opera google-chrome and ie9 but not safari

equals	gethashcode
i m overriding both gethashcode and equals

2920418
subscript	superscript
for the squared sign â œâ²â you ll find it at u+00b2 near all the other superscript digits and just before the subscript digits

2920434
hash	md5
today i read about md5 hash and was wondering if this is possible

2920435
equals	gethashcode
equals the gethashcode methods for the

2920457
hash	md5
then you have use it but you cant add the hash rum til the end of the file expecting it to be correct or if you calculate the run over new yu will always end ut with a new md5 hash

2920462
hash	md5
this place will hold the md5 sum and has to be zero again when verifying the hash later

2920482
hash	md5
well adding a md5 hash to a text changes the text and thus the md5 hash

2920482
hash	md5
computing an md5 hash of your text-including-the-to-be-computed md5 hash is not possible

2920486
hash	md5
what you might be able to try is whether there are any md5 hash values that when hash yield themselves as a result thanks to francesco for that link

2920486
hash	md5
for all possible permutations of an md5 hash create the hash and compare the result with the original

2920615
int	chars
cf takes pointers to chars but in bubblesort you are passing it a pointer to int

2920623
mouseover	mouseout
jquery has a hover method that combines mouseover and mouseout

2920623
mouseover	mouseout
you could add functions to your links that retrieve a thumbnail and display it on mouseover and then hide the thumbnail on mouseout

2920641
jar	manifest.mf
if you are building a jar file from a collection of classes you can specify which class within the jar contains the application main method in the meta-inf manifest.mf using the

2920757
put	get
when i put an alert in the loaddocument function i get only one alert message

2920799
subobject	instances
for instances a subobject is-a object and an array element is-a object and a class-member is-a object or function or type or template or enumerator

2920799
subobject	instances
the entity list of c++0x looks a bit cleaner to me and it doesn t contain variables instances of a function what that kind of entity even is has never been apparent to me subobject and array element anymore

2920817
super	self
either way pass self not super to your nslog statements

2920832
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it is available in ie 5.5+ and all in-use versions of firefox google-chrome opera and safari

2920876
versioning	upgrade
so i think it s a bug in one of the ancient versioning and that you need to upgrade your jsf versioning

2920909
post	get
nb i tried to post an example but couldn t get it to format properly no line breaks with backticks only one line at a time usng the gui so any help with that would be good to

2920914
stateless	stateful
using asp.net with nhibernate could be a challenge because of the fact that nhibernate is a stateful environment while asp.net is a stateless framework

2920973
restrict	shared
i need to restrict the entities to only access the repository from where they are translated using translator to business entities shared at business and service layer

2921004
opera	firefox
do you face this problem in different browsers firefox opera internet explorer or only in some specific browser

2921004
post	get
to get a better answer you should post some of the javascript code that renders your page - maybe there are some optimizations possible

2921047
mouseleave	mouseenter
i think you are looking for the mouseenter and mouseleave events

2921084
equals	gethashcode
therefore i wonder whether it is necessary to implement gethashcode which i never need when implementing the equals function which i often need

2921098
equals	gethashcode
if you write your own equals method i d recommend to use some gethashcode implementation that doesn t break hashset though

2921115
equals	gethashcode
equals is also used all over the place in the bcl and if anyone else uses your objects they will expect gethashcode to behave sensibly

2921155
equals	gethashcode
if you override equals you should override gethashcode from msdn it is recommended that any class that overrides equals also override system.object.gethashcode.

2921201
rss	feed
also helped by so providing an rss feed i think google likes feed from reliable sources

2921242
post	get
i know that the php socket is recieving the post as when i check the server log i get a 200 on the get request

many-to-one	one-to-many
my intention here is a bidirectional one-to-many many-to-one relationship between cat and kitten with kitten being the owning side

2921340
prepare	execute
given this if the application always opens a prepare statement execute it once and then closes it again there s still no benefit

2921340
instances	transient
some aren t and just use transient statement instances instead

2921340
prepare	execute
looks like the jdbc driver has a threshold setting for avoiding the prepare execute server overhead in the case where the application always does this

i can see no advantage in using the server-side geocoding web service when google maps provides a full featured client-side geocoding api for javascript

2921984
pull	push
mercurial has great backwards compatibility at the network and file level in that any version can push pull commit to any previous version s repositories but it s not forward-compatible so if your windows side is using mercurial 1.0 and your osx side is at 1.5 then windows shouldn t be committing to a clone created by the osx side

2921984
pull	push
in general mercurial was built for a clone-per-user-per-system and having conflicting actions mediated through push and pull

a nop operation takes one cpu cycle and in an embedded environment you typically know exactly what clock speed your processors is running at so you can just use a simple for-loop conatining _nop or if only a very short delay is required then don t bother with a loops just add in the required number of nops

google-chrome	safari
it was errant code that specifically disabling the adapters in google-chrome safari

we don t use svg file types just the normal mix of jpg gif png and no video audio not yet anyway

2922692
min	max
as i need to get max and min values of different columns and generate random numbers using these values so without picking up individual columns the only other option is to iterate over rows and columns to get the values and compare one by one which doesn t sound all that time-efficient

2922697
width	height
now i ve noticed some problems with this that required me to set the width and height of the rotated object again after the play method but other than that i get the ideal rotation situation

2922704

getter	setter
i was wondering what the best practice in perl is regarding getting - or more importantly setting - a global variable of some module by directly accessing in case the module didn t provide getter setter method for it

2922896
getter	setter
just because i can do it in perl i m not entirely certain i should assuming there actually is an alternative such as adding a getter setter to the module

2922944
int	chars
you can t cast a chars array const chars into an int in c at least not in a way that gives you a sensible int result 1

2922944
int	chars
the only exception is if you use it to convert a single chars into an int which is basically just widening it if you look at the bit representation

2922944
int	chars
1 yes i know you can convert a pointer const chars into an int but that converts the value of the pointer and not the value of the data it points to

instead of the checkbox should i look to use a button and add that as a stand alone column that the user can click such as

2923128
getter	setter
for example argument validation in setter and lazy computation in getter are both fairly common

2923135
getter	setter
they are just short-cuts for getter setter

2923135
getter	setter
any logic that would be valid in a getter setter is reasonable to put in a property

2923135
getter	setter
any logic that you would normally not put in a getter setter would be inappropriate to put in a property

2923155
folder	directory
like mentioned you could put the files in a vpp directory in the live environment and that way only have to copy ascx-files to one folder for a two-site-code-infront-update

2923156
getter	setter
generally it is not a good idea to implement business logic in getter and setter

2923171
inherited	subclassing	inherited	properties
you can use the table per concrete class inherited strategy hibernate will replicate all properties for each subclassing this will work with a view

2923173
inherited	properties
such an inherited properties approach can be achieved by defining the superclass as a mappedsuperclass

2923445
rss	feed
despite being optional most rss feed provide a guid element for each item which is a string that uniquely identifies it

2923445
hash	md5
my suggestion would be hashing the description using sha-1 or md5 and then checking the new item s description against the saved hash

2923502
x86	64bit
i think it implies the result binary is x86 not ppc but is it 32 bits or 64bit

2923535
xul	xbl
we implemented the -moz-binding fix for that which references the xml file with the binding information for cropping an element defined with xul xbl as defined here and it worked great.

2923666
lisp	scheme
obviously you won t get a job programming in scheme or lisp but that s not the intention behind my recommendation

2923680
subplot	imshow
2 are images of the same dimensions plotted with imshow and the other is some other kind of subplot

2923680

then have each of your implements classes extends abstracta

2923715
inherited	properties
through the inherited simplejdbctemplate properties in your before method

2923730
implements	extends
or you can make a a class instead of an interface perhaps abstract and extends it implements only what you need

filtering	grouping
is it possible to pull out filtering row from xceed datagrid control to some other place like grouping box

2923754
hash	md5
yes you can generate the md5 or sha1 hash for each set of file data and then compare them

2923761
hash	md5
perhaps you should look for a file md5 hash algorithm

2923773
getter	setter
if that s not strong enough you can use the second case which will use getter and setter to compare every element

2923925
junit	testng	junit	unitils	testng	unitils
the unitils extensions to junit or testng have very nice support for this

2923927
children	parent
the trick is to break it all up so that the information is contained in smaller classes that inherits a parent class that has common functions and data to all children

2923927
children	parent
a quick way to divide the information is to create a diagram of a parent class linked with children classes

2923962
cos	sin
i think your formula for the taylor series is incorrect after refreshing myself on wikipedia you shouldn t be calling sin or cos because that s what you are trying to calculate

2924310
stdout	stderr
i d like a good method that matches the interface of subprocess.check_call -- ie it throws calledprocesserror when it fails is synchronous c -- but instead of returning the return code of the command if it even does that returns the program s output either only stdout or a tuple of stdout stderr

2924311
setinterval	settimeout
javascript if you don t mind having this web page open 24x7 use settimeout on page load to wait until a set arbitrary time later on during the day when you do cleaning then call setinterval

2924311
post	get
setinterval will initially call and regularly repeat a xmlhttprequest or just a page refresh using get or post to pass parameters to the php script behind itself

2924314
put	get
figuring out where these tools should put their outputs so they get built is tricky if you ve spread things out

there are four signed int types signed chars short int int and long int.

2924394
int	chars
and unsigned chars is in the family of unsigned int types

2924394
int	chars	unsigned	short
for each of the signed int types there exists a corresponding but different unsigned int type unsigned chars unsigned short int unsigned int and unsigned long int .

2924394
int	chars
to answer your question the reason why the stl uses chars as the default type is because the standard streams are meant for reading and or writing streams of chars represented by chars objects not int signed chars and unsigned chars

2924398
google-chrome	safari
i didn t mention safari or google-chrome because i don t do much development with those but they probably have similar facilities

2924503
draggable	droppable
you can use a combination of draggable and droppable from jquery ui

we had a few customers whose machines did not trust the ssl certificate from the cdn when we used jquery on https pages

2924519
google-chrome	firefox
this is most noticeable in firefox and ie but even google-chrome will experience it

2924519
mouse	keyboard
i ve run tests and it turns out that even by leaving the browser window completely still not touching the mouse and not touching the keyboard backgrounds processes on the computer can still cause hiccups which means that for brief periods perhaps as small as a few milliseconds time is standing still in the browser at completely random intervals outside of your control

2924519
setinterval	settimeout
let s say you have a setinterval call this applies to settimeout also running every 33 milliseconds about 30 frames per second

2924520

2924837
google-chrome	firefox
this code works perfectly in google-chrome but when i try it in firefox firebug throws up this error

i tried sending it as a post instead of a get but receive the same rror

but using external build tool like maven or ant works

2927795

how do you know what are the top stories or hot topics just in rss feed aggregator newsnow for example

2928050
post	get
asptear supports post it just defaults to get

2928078
post	get
i believe the above hyperlink evaluates to get but since the only visibility difference between get and post that is you can see parameters in the address bar with get

2928097
post	get
you can see the query string and consequently whether the request type is get or post

2928097
post	get
clicking a hyperlink generates a get request unless you override it using javascript by simulating submission of a post form

2928155

post	get
as an alternative you can grab the raw and un-url-encoded data from the request body in case of post by httpservletrequest#getinputstream or from the query string in case of get by httpservletrequest#getquerystring and then guess the encoding yourself based on the characters available in the parameters and then url-encode accordingly using the guessed encoding

persistent	transient
i am using the transient annotation in some projects that persistent with hibernate as well and didn t have any problems yet

2928527

it is usually used for fields that can be determined by other persistent properties and using a cache should work also because javas serialization mechanisms caches usually expect the cached objects to be serializable take the transient annotation into consideration too

2928527
getter	setter	instances	transient
i think it is preferrable to use transient getter and setter properties that provide the information instead of instances fields whenever possible

2928541
fileinputstream	fileoutputstream
also don t forget to call close on the fileinputstream and fileoutputstream when you are done

2928559

mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown	mouseup	mousedown
on mousedown you should bind an event handler on the document to mousemove and mouseup

now when these elements have children with z-indexes their position in the stack is determined relative to their parent position

2929747
children	parent
parent has a collection bag of children which are cached and lazy

2929747
children	parent
assume that the cache regions for all caches above are large enough to hold all instances of all children and parent in memory easily

2929747

not true all graduatestudent objects can use any public or protected members of students obviously private members are the exception here internally

2929977
mbunit	nunit
of course there are plenty of other unit test frameworks for .net such as nunit mbunit and xunit

then when your customermgmtform loads you should provide an instances of isession so that it can load your customers track your changes deletions and the new customers created once joined to the isession so that when you call the saveorupdate method the isession knows what it has to do with the tracked changes and transient entities

2931074
google-chrome	firefox
it s because firefox and google-chrome too automatically url encodes your the src because it is assumed to be a url

2931105
children	parent	getter	setter
they act as getter setter for a private static variable that each extending class should have to allow access to the parent to do the common work on a variable that belongs to the children

exception classes that are subclasses of java.lang.runtimeexception and runtimeexception itself are unchecked-exception

2931278
width	height
if i have to do my own calculations prior to each drawing call how to i find the width and height of my imageview

2931321
int	chars
furthermore rather than check the numeric value of the string with int and ord just use the chars values directly

2931326
typedef	struct
there are some things that are more tedious in c++ like the need to cast void to assign to another type but there are many things in c++ that i find to be conveniences like not needing to typedef your struct to avoid writing struct foo everywhere you want a foo

2931348
implements	extends
why doesn t this context class specifically extends or implements the generic state base class interface

2931356
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it works well in firefox 3.6.3 but in every other browser i ve tested safari 4.0.4 google-chrome 4.1 ie8 it seems to ignore the onsubmit and jump straight to the php processing page

2931900
int	boolean
basic communication from my main application to the applet such as invoking simple methods that return int or boolean values works

2931908

how do i properly hide a div menu and show it after being rendered

2931989
zoo	xts
xts plain zoo or timeseries or something else

2931989
zoo	xts
i use both xts and zoo but sometimes not sure to use xts exclusively or sometimes zoo have advantage of lighter overhead

2932002
teamcity	nant
we do not use nant on our .net software because vs 2010 and testdriven.net provide far more context-sensitivity than any other build solution and our excellent ci server teamcity natively understands the visual studio build process

2932008
ant	maven
for tools like ant and maven i would use maven you have no license fee but you need to build skill on the tools which may cost some money

2932028
dpkg	aptitude
if it isn t in a package suitable for installing with apt-get aptitude synaptic dpkg what have you how do i go about installing it on ubuntu

2932029

as zoo is a little older some packages interface it rather than xts

2932110
viewdidload	viewwillappear
if i put it in viewdidload or viewwillappear then it crashes with a nsrangeexception presumably because the table isn t set up yet

2932160
squash	branch	squash	merge
if you go ahead and do so you should squash the commits from this branch into another branch on merge so that you or the other repo users can make sense of the commit messages and individual commits

2932198
int	chars
of course the problem is 2 128 is a very large number and can t be contained in any single int variable in c with which to do the math hence the chars 16 struct

2932200
min	max
making use of classes like splheap or min max varieties splpriorityqueue maybe for things like file size or just wrapping your iterator in something like arrayobject which can sort its own contents

2932258
pop-up	dialog
in this event handler i would like to make some call to pop-up the browse for file dialog box which is a native openfiledialog box

2932298
mouse	keyboard
this prevents the checkbox from handling the mouse click or keyboard event that changes its state and allows the data grid to receive them thus giving it a change to enter editing mode and switch to the editingelementstyle which doesn t affect focusability and hit testability

2932353
folder	directory
the option to install to another folder is a bit hard to notice when installing the sdk but the trick is to hit the up down arrows by the default directory on the installation type step

2932377

post	get
how can i get js to post it

2932441
lisp	scheme
i need to translate some code from scheme to common lisp

2932490
superclass	subclassing
dynamic casting to a subclassing and then assigning the result to a pointer to superclass is of no use - you practically are back where you started

2932490
superclass	subclassing
dynamic casting can only work for you if you have a pointer to a superclass but you know that the object pointed to is actually an instance of a subclassing

2932512
stateless	stateful
these are the session beans stateless or stateful correct

2932512
jar	war
together with the above jar s this will be my war

2932518
for-loop	loops
because the for-loop goes through all characters in word the outer while loops is completely unneeded

2932539
int	chars
this creates a list of int corresponding to each letter with 0 if the letter doesn t match chars and 1 if it does and then sums them

2932557
testdriven.net	xunit.net
i can duplicate the issue and it seems to be related to testdriven.net and or xunit.net

2932584
hide	show
how can i show or hide part of the page if the user viewing it is an app user

2932585
rtp	sip
i believe you need to look at the sip packets that come before the rtp packets

2932596
width	height
you then use background positioning and height and width to select which part of the image you want

2932599
ready	each
by using a css sprite you have each image loaded and ready to go on the button instantly

2932665
int	chars
printf outputs text to stdout and returns an int representing the number of chars that it output not the actual value that was printed

2932665
printf	strlen
note that printf returns the number of characters that it stored into str so you can actually use this to check whether you need to add the 0 instead of using strlen at all like this

2932676
ubuntu	debian
debian ubuntu based systems and has to do with automatic session garbage collection

2932682
mouse	keyboard
the idea is that the user can issue a few simple commands by voice instead of keyboard or mouse

2932714
google-chrome	firefox
the ecmascript 5th edition specification defines a method for that and some browsers like firefox 3.7alpha google-chrome 5 beta and latest webkit nightly builds already provide a native implementation so you might want to implement it if not available

2932734
client-side	server-side
one simple strategy is to screen for validity at the client-side and correctness at the server--that is use javascript to ensure that the inputs are of the correct type and form looks like a date and server-side logic to additionally guarantee that the valid input makes sense is in a sensible range for this user

2932734
client-side	server-side
if you don t mind the extra javascript and http requests you could duplicate all of the server-side checking at the client-side but then you d have two separate programs written in different languages to maintain and keep synchronized

2932740
dictionary	map
4 map to a dictionary depicting phonemes to words you could look at the sphinx dictionary as a guide .

2932747
post	get
2- send the search criteria using ajax request using jquery post function for example and get back the json result and using a template will draw the grid clean but will take time to finish and will be harder to edit later

2932758
ubuntu	linux
is there a way to do this on linux ubuntu

2932769
width	height
note that the width and height is passed from the variable c the avcodeccontext i assume so it may be larger than the actual size of the input frame

2932769
width	height
it is also possible that the width height is good but the pixel format of the input frame is different from what is passed to avpicture_fill

2932769
width	height
for example if c- pix_fmt is rgba and the input buffer is in yuv420 format or more likely for iphone a biplanar ycbcr then the size of the input buffer is width height 1.5 but avpicture_fill expects the size of width height 4

2932771
rss	feed
it appears that it depends on how the rss feed is configured

2932771
rss	feed
can i expect to read the entire content of any rss feed from the wild

2932803
virus	botnet
obviously very similar to the virus answer above the difference being that while viruses usually replicate spread do a preprogrammed inconvenient thing a botnet is more of a take control of your machine for a future usually nefarious but dynamic purpose. i think the hosts your agent can more easily change with a botnet too

2932822
free	malloc
this is only possible if malloc was used so pass the ptr to free

2932847
client-side	server-side
however keep in mind that client-side dsls risk drastically increasing load times and ruining the user experience -- coffeescript is primarily server-side for a reason

2932914
rtp	sdp
in the sdp example you ve provided you could start sending rtp encoded with either g711 ulaw pcmu or g711 alaw pcma

my app has a uitabbarcontroller that loads many different uinavigationcontroller

2933111
post	get
let me know if i need to post anything else to get help with this

2933112
hide	show
i think it should work if you simply swap around the show and hide function

2933112
hide	show
then again i think you are using way too complicated code if you want to hide show just 1 element

2933126
uniq	grep	tail	zcat
though i may be diagnosing the root cause of an event determining how many users it affected or distilling timing logs in order to assess the performance and throughput impact of a recent code change my tools stay the same grep awk sed tr uniq sort zcat tail head join and split

2933126
xslt	xquery
fortunately in xml-land we have wonderful technologies like xpath xquery and xslt to help us

the way i move the labels is as follows the news items from rss feed are represented in a group of linklabels

2933156
versioning	upgrade
remember that the gems are associated with your ruby versioning so with the upgrade you may need to reinstall all the gems anyway

2933162
nsstring	nsformatter
this looks like a job for a custom nsformatter or just a read-only nsstring property called paginationstring .

2933170
width	height
the difficulty is that my final picture must have a fixed width and height 304x179 so if the different pictures are too big they must be cut

this can get a lot more complicated depending on how you handle operator precedence multiplying and device before add and subtract type stuff but the point of the grammar in this case is to help you to write a parser

2933288
yacc	bison
there are tools that will help you do this yacc bison antlr and others but you can do it by hand as well

2933306
width	height
i would generally recommend to not use any width or height properties on the body tag

2933319
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
create a custom subclass of uiviewcontroller within which you set the attributes of the uinavigationcontroller s toolbar set as enabled from within the xib in ib

2933333
mvp	presenter
imho activity is your controller or perhaps presenter a la mvp is the better architectural analogy layout xml and their constituent views are the view layer and your database is your model

2933340
google-chrome	firefox
i ve tested it as working on google-chrome firefox and ie

2933357
integer	unsigned
where nameid is some unique 16-bit unsigned integer that identifies the resource and typeid is some unique 16-bit unsigned integer greater than 255 that identifies the resource type you may define those integers in the resource.h file

2933401
pylons	turbogears
similarly pylons and by extension turbogears 2 i guess has configuration options for error emails

2933404
int	chars
note that the format specifier for a null-terminated string is s not c c is to print a single chars and that printf returns an int the total number of chars printed not a chars

2933450
getter	setter
make sure to hide actual member variables in private-convention names would be the member variable and would be a getter setter accessor

2933453
jython	pypy	cpython	pypy
christian perone has an excellent article from just a few days ago where he claims with supporting benchmark data that pypy is now the fastest running the benchmark in 145 seconds vs 300 for unladen swallow and 374 for cpython psyco doesn t help actually psycov2 slows the benchmark down to 434 seconds 557 for jython -- see the url i just gave for all details

2933454
public	protected
in this case how y can access a b and c and by how i mean public protected private

2933463
fadein	fadeout
they are doing a fadein fadeout on visibility

2933465
public	protected
y can look up to its base-class x and see public and protected

2933465
public	protected
derived classes of y can see its public and protected members

2933465
public	protected
both public and protected parts of x become protected in y

2933465
public	protected
both public and protected parts of x become private in y

2933503
google-chrome	firefox
i would start by developing on a more standards compliant browser such as firefox or google-chrome and check your progress with the versions of ie you would like to support

2933506
dottrace	dotmemory
jetbrains dottrace dotmemory and resharper have better integration on unit testing and profiling

2933509
put	get
you don t get insured expecting a fatal accident to recover all the money you put into your insurance plan

2933510
post	get
here s the code that i m using to get the post from specific category

2933523
filesystems	ntfs
where do filesystems like reiser ntfs etc store the file tables

2933545
children	parent
in one case we returned multiple result sets - one set for the parent and one for all the children

2933545
children	parent
the order by was the same so that you could easily interleave the children for each parent in the client code

2933545
children	parent
it was also possible to return multiple result sets - one for the parent and one set of children for each parent we used a cursor for the outer part of this

2933612
introspection	typechecking
it does typechecking excellent inheritance has introspection capabilities and with moosex declare one of the nicest interfaces for perl classes out there

2933629
filesystems	fat
a completely different approach to building a filesystems is something like the infamous dos fat filesystems

2933629
filesystems	fat
even though the fat filesystems design is kind of clunky by today s standards it does have the advantage of being really simple to implement especially in its original fat12 or fat16 varieties if you can live with its limitations

2933636
public	protected
a derived class can only access public and protected members of the base class

2933636
public	protected
private public protected inheritance affects how the members inherited from the base class x are accessible to the users of the derived class y

2933636
public	protected
private inheritance is akin to declaring the public and protected members of the base class as private in the derived class

2933636
public	protected
is akin to declaring the public and protected members of the base class as protected in the derived class

2933638
versioning	upgrade
here s another example of the upgrade technique you re looking at as well convert mdb database to another format jet access versioning

2933642
put	get
personally i d take currentuser.instance and either move it to useridentity.currentuser or put it together with whatever similar get the global instance methods and properties you have

2933660
put	get
eclipse is a great ide it requires a bit of cuddling to get it to put out but once it does it can be quite nice

2933666
public	protected
protected - all public members of the base class become protected in the derived class

2933666
public	protected
protected members in the base class are still protected base public derived protected

2933678
portrait	landscape
is there an easy way to set my application so that it can automatically rotate to only the portrait modes no landscape

2933679
rss	feed
or you can suggest any pure css rss feed

2933687
coldfusion	railo
this means either using adobe coldfusion or if you re looking to save money try looking at railo or open bluedragon both are cfml processors

2933718
matlab	simulink
it s brilliant for scientific prorgamming ie like matlab or simulink but 10 times better

2933735
width	height
should i work in pixels points percents when defining width and height of the components

2933744
nexus	artifactory
you probably want to start by setting up your own internal maven repository using nexus or artifactory

2933747
for-loop	loops
when you use a for in loops you re iterating over the properties of an object which is not exactly equivalent to the for-loop in your second example

2933754
pop-up	dialog
clicking on the open would cause a dialog to pop-up with all the open options

2933758
allocator	stl
stl priority queue grows and uses dynamic allocator i may be wrong about it though

2933799
awt	swing
when i started programming with the jdk6 i had no problem with text components neither in awt nor in swing

2933845
nullpointerexception	runtimeexception
these are all runtimeexception that may be thrown by the programmer at any point exception assertionerror though it is considered poor style to throw certain exceptions like nullpointerexception

2933867
move	drag
cursor is set to cursor move for blank areas so that the user can drag and scroll the webpage

2933918
width	height
i have an jpeg image and i want to reduce its size in bytes .i don t want to change the image size in manner of height and width and not want to lose image quality.some bit of reduce quality is not an issue

2933918
width	height
i try to make it a thumbnail image but it reduce the size according to height and width

2933923
mp3	flac
i ve been recently working on a program that convert flac files to mp3 in c# using flac.exe and lame.exe here are the code that do the job

2933933
rss	feed
i ve written an rss feed parser in java running on android and it parses some feed perfectly and others not at all

2933940
reverse-engineering	obfuscation
some obfuscators such as crypto obfuscation have a feature of embedding all dlls in the main exe so your dlls are not explicitly visible and available on disk to open in reverse-engineering tools such as reflector

2933942
post	get	post	http-method	get	http-method
the mapping of a path in combination with the http-method get post etc. to a controller and a method is done by the routing not by the controller itself

2933999
matlab	simulink
it is way beyond simulink and if you like matlab then it has a type of matlab scripting built in for those that like such ways of programming

2934028
nsmutablestring	nsstring
the question should i just return the nsmutablestring instance that i used as my work buffer or should i create a new nsstring around the mutable one and return that

2934048
xmltype	clob
incidentally if you re storing xml data why store it as a blob rather than either as character data clob or from 9i onwards the native xmltype type

2934078
opera	firefox
there was no problem displaying those in opera and firefox though

2934110
allocator	stl
if you construct an stl priority queue at the maximum size perhaps from a vector initialized with placeholders and then check the size before inserting removing an item if necessary beforehand you ll never have dynamic allocator during insert operations

2934124
mouseover	mouseout
the best way i can think of to make sure it s actually text which is moused over and not a blank area is to use and put the mouseover mouseout events in the so that blank areas don t trigger events

2934129
pull	push
in general i would push the messages to be sent on a queue and run a thread which every timer tick pull maximum n messages from the queue

2934157
imagemagick	gdlib
i heartly recommend imagemagick check if installed on your server but you can also roll your own thumbnail script using phps gdlib which is bundled with php and most likely available

2934157
imagemagick	gdlib
there already a ton of prebuilt thumbnail scripts for php which rely on imagemagick and or gdlib

2934157
width	height
but performance-wise it is way better to store just the image pathname in the database along with some meta data like filesize width height etc. keeps your db size down and the select php code for processing the resultset fast

2934162
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
this works fine if i place it in the viewdidappear method but will not work in the viewwillappear method

2934162
viewdidload	viewwillappear
but if i put this code in viewwillappear or viewdidload it has no effect

2934191
nsmutablestring	nsstring
thus there is no reasonable way that a client can cast from nsstring to nsmutablestring and suddenly achieve no-compiler-warning mutability of the string

2934204
nsscanner	nsstring
experimenting with nsstring and nsscanner has yielded no results so far

2934222
floating-point	integer
the cast as float was to force a floating-point division because with integer division 556 227691 would give 0

2934309
post	get
i was a bit concerned as i thought it was decoding the query incorrectly the parameters passed to get or post but it doesn t seem to be doing that by the looks of it

2934317
width	height
constraints on the width and height

2934359
onmousemove	onmouseup	onmousedown	onmouseup	onmousedown	onmousemove
if you really want to detect clicks in whitespace you could try attaching to the onmousedown onmouseup onmousemove events for the page itself

2934368
writetofile	nsdata
i have a problem with a nsdata writetofile

2934391
google-chrome	firefox
i m using pylons to serve a dynamically generated pdf document for reporting my approach works in firefox google-chrome it displays the pdf inline if the plugin is available or otherwise downloads it but ie 7 8 only show a blank page and doesn t prompt for download

2934393
ceil	floor
rounding conversions mean rounding â float double to nearest floor ceil float double

2934435
hide	show
on startup i create a window which i show and hide immediately

2934435
hide	show
so when the last window is closed i need to show and hide this window again hiding is necessary so that the user cannot switch to this window using the window menu or cmd-

2934442
versioning	upgrade
you can run the upgrade wizard and then change the assembly reference to asp.net mvc 1 and update the assembly versioning in the web.config from 2.0.0.0 to 1.0.0.0

2934463
google-chrome	firefox
firefox konqueror and google-chrome don t escape characters for example

2934489
noscript	meta
also those three approaches do not exclude each other but should be combined use ajax for the folks with javascript activated a meta refresh iframe in a noscript tag as a fallback for the ones with javascript disabled as mentioned by stagas and a button or link for manual update once the maximum list reload count has been reached

2934518
put	get
if you wanted to get slightly more intelligent with this and depending on your requirements you could perhaps put some code in place to check whether the user has entered the address box with their cursor at any point and then carry out validation accordingly

2934535
versioning	upgrade
i also encountered problems like yours especially when the web host was upgrade to a newer php versioning

2934550
profiling	instrumentation
profiling your app using instrumentation or shark and look

2934554
put	get
yet every put request i make to the server i get 405 method not supported

2934588
int	boolean
this struct can hold strings int boolean and lists i think used in the language the interpreter is working with

2934635
google-chrome	firefox
i want to make firefox and google-chrome add-on in which language can i make

2934635
google-chrome	firefox
and how to make it in firefox or google-chrome compatible

2934665
int	chars
the type of the expression must be chars byte short int chars byte short int or an enum type or a compile-time error occurs

2934709
lz77	lzw
i always thought lz stood for lempel-ziv inventors of most popular compression algorithms lz77 lz78 lzw used nowadays

2934710
ubuntu	debian
if you are a debian ubuntu user the package name is ht not hte

2934724
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
i am using javascript for-loop to loops through a particular arrays and alert it s value

2934788
google-chrome	firefox
i ve just tried the example in firefox google-chrome and ie and it doesn t work

2934788
client-side	server-side
incidentally if the file is larger than max_file_size then calling move_uploaded_file doesn t work so it seems the variable is having an effect server-side but not client-side

2934801
post	get
thanks deizel for the post redirect get pattern

2934818
put	get
to get around this you could put in and get rid of

2934832
hide	show
i want to find out which href is clicked and based on that href click i want to show and hide a div

2934912
vsto	add-in
i m working on outlook 2003 vsto addin.the installer for this add-in creates few registry entries either in hkcu or hklm depending on single user or all user installation

2934935
put	get
we can put the same information in database read from there.though in the terminal of the machine where mysql database is installed we get the message displayed in greek properly when we try to read the same from java code it becomes garbled.will the javac -encoding utf8 be of help for reading the message from database

2934984
nsurl	nsstring
and nsurl or nsstring can override it can you try with those things

2935044
subtract	addition
pointer addition is forbidden in c++ you can only subtract two pointers

2935044
subtract	add
similarly you can subtract or add an integral number to from a pointer which means move the pointer up or down

2935083
apache	nginx	apache	lighttpd	nginx	lighttpd
http server may be apache 1 apache 2 nginx lighttpd etc

2935104
google-chrome	firefox
also google-chrome has built-in tools for this and firefox has firebug right click inspect element in either

2935145
identifier	ambiguous
in javascript you can read the offset between utc and the time in the user s current timezone but that doesn t give you a timezone name so you re left either leaving the timezone identifier off making the times completely ambiguous or including it is an explicit offset like utc+01 00 which is ugly and still doesn t take care of changing timezones over different dst periods

2935147
filtering	grouping
the result of grouping is a collection of grouping another collections so you can use where to filtering grouping

2935168
public	protected
note in order to maintain backward compatibility with php 4 php 5 will still accept the use of the keyword var in property declarations instead of or in addition to public protected or private

2935168
public	protected
if you declare a property using var instead of one of public protected or private then php 5 will treat the property as if it had been declared as public

2935223
return-value-optimization	nrvo
rvalue references is not a replacement for return-value-optimization or nrvo

2935323
serializable	deserialization
if the wire format is not too much of a concern you could also user soapformatter or a binaryformatter to handle the serializable deserialization

2935352
getter	setter
there are setter and getter properties for mfield and mvalue

2935371
rss	feed
lets say i have a rss feed which lists the 3 newest questions on so

2935371
rss	feed
i want to download the rss feed every 5 minutes parse it and save the articles that aren t already saved but i do not want duplicates items that remain in the new updated feed like the examples above

2935390
subtract	add
i suppose in your example the result you were expecting was to add or subtract a pointer to an offset to be moved not to another pointer

2935390
subtract	add
in c++ you can subtract 2 pointers getting the offset in memory between them or add a pointer to an integer value moving a pointer to another memory location being incremented by value sizeof object_class

2935390
integer	unsigned
just adding 2 pointers do not make sense in c++ but if you are sure you want to add 2 memory locations adresses just add then as unsigned integer values using typecast

2935404
width	height
the width and the height of the div is unknown it should work for every div dimension and in all major browsers

2935405
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
what you serialize use objectoutputstream can also be deserialized with objectinputstream

2935405
udp	tcp
it plays no role if you transport it over udp tcp a pipe a local file or whatever

2935405
serializable	deserialization	outputstream	inputstream
serializable writes to an outputstream deserialization reads from an inputstream

2935418
post	get
i m pretty sure i remember reading --but cannot find back the links anymore-- about this on some isp including at least one big isp in the u.s. it is possible to have a user s get and post request appearing to come from different ips

2935418
post	get
the same user makes a get then a post then a get again then a post again and the servers see this

2935418
post	get
so altough it s the same user the webserver sees different ips for the get and the post

2935418
post	get
however i m pretty sure this is inherently broken because there are isps where you may see get and post coming from different ips

2935447
tostring	getter
when you call tostring on that date object or use the getter for hour minute second you get values in the local timezone at the client

2935467
fflush	gets
with a lot a dynamic sql calls the sqltext area gets fflush fast enough that query reuse goes way down and peformance follows it on down

2935492
uiview	subviews
i should probably mention i m trying to add this button to a uiview which is a subviews of a uitableviewcell

2935502
width	height
you need to set its top and left to 50 and the margin-top and margin-left to the negative half of its width and height respectively

2935502
width	height
if the width and height are really unknown beforehand then you ll need to grab javascript jquery to set the margin-left and margin-top values and live with the fact that client will see the div quickly be shifted during page load which might cause a wtf

2935533
width	height
clientdata clientdata int x int y int width int height entity x y width height

2935536
post	get
note here s the link to the example i couldn t get it to work in the post

2935571
stdout	stderr
first of all try fprintf to stderr instead of printf to stdout

2935622
udp	tcp
you say you are sending files over udp yet connecting to the sever with tcp - the two protocols are mutually exclusive over a single connection

2935622
udp	tcp
udp does not provide any mechanism for detecting packet loss that s what tcp is for so by default you won t be able to work out whether packets have been lost

2935622
udp	tcp
in general the tcp protocol manages the available network bandwidth better than the udp protocol

2935622
udp	tcp
most air applications that require socket communications should use the serversocket and socket classes tcp rather than the datagramsocket class udp

2935641
put	get
i d link to know what offers better performance for example i can set outputcache in my views and and use this cache for all page or i could get my list of products in controller put it on cache like the code below and send it to view to render for the user

2935655
kde	gnome
gnome s and kde s terminal emulators have an option for background images and they have profiles that can set up different settings for different usage

2935662
integer	unsigned
as an example consider the following table which depicts the absolute unsigned range of a 3-bit integer

2935662
subtraction	addition
in point of fact all modern processors employ just such a system in order to implement common alu circuitry for both addition and subtraction operations

2935662
subtraction	addition
when a cpu encounters an i1 - i2 subtraction instruction it internally performs a complement + 1 operation on i2 and subsequently processes the operands through the addition circuitry in order to compute i1 + complement of i2 + 1

2935662
subtraction	addition
with the exception of an additional carry sign xor-gated overflow flag both signed and unsigned addition and by implication subtraction are each implicit

2935671
liferay	nuxeo	liferay	alfresco	nuxeo	alfresco
the popular ones are alfresco nuxeo and liferay

2935844
put	get
when i put the cusor on an input field say papertaken in the first student class i can get the corresponding value in class name eg adam

2935844
put	get
i want to get the student name to put into the request for autocomplete

2935852
prepare	execute
i have a method that takes one prepare statement and any number of parameters binds them to the statement execute the statement and formats the result into a multidimentional array

2935861
versioning	upgrade
i upgrade monorail to the latest versioning and now htmlhelper.inputfile and htmlhelper.datetime don t get parsed

2935877
int	chars
here you printed a chars not a chars representation of an int

2935939
margin	height
i made a quick adjustment to the height and added a top margin for correct placement and now my menu is able to be accessed

2935947
width	height
this technique allows you to align element without knowing its height and width although it requires you to know parent s height at the least

2935964
mouse	keyboard
yes i have thought about taking snapshots of the web content rendering these and mapping the mouse and keyboard events back to the browser control but i can t afford the performance penalty and i really don t have time to write and thoroughly test it

2935985
postgresql	mysql
migration of the ruby app code and existing mysql database using taps went smoothly but i m getting the following postgresql error

2935985
postgresql	mysql
this works fine on my local and current hosted environment using mysql but postgresql is clearly more strict

2935985
postgresql	mysql
update see heroku postgresql type operator error after migrating db from mysql for resolution

2935991
parallels	hfs	parallels	bootcamp	hfs	bootcamp
parallels can also be configured to use your mac user directories as your windows user directories though i m not sure if they remain accessible under bootcamp since they would be stored on an hfs partition

2935998
implements	extends
so your giftcardrepository can be re-written as see extends instead of implements and just overrides what you really want

2936003
button	checkbox
i have also tried applying display inline-block to the floated button text-input and checkbox

2936004
inherited	properties
this is because the target type of the bindings is inherited from the multibinding and the targettype of the multibinding is system.string because textblock.text is a string properties

2936042
octree	quadtree
depending on how high of a dimension you re working in how big the area is and how many polygons you re dealing with the most typical optimizations are quadtree octree and kd-trees

2936071
google-chrome	firefox
i ve got around 85 sortable ul s all connected with each other and initializing the sortable function works fine in google-chrome and firefox but in ie it causes a 5-10 second hang while it loops through and connects them all

2936101
post	get
also note that you should perform a get instead of a post

2936111
hide	show
i wonder what hide show support exists to deal with these conventions

2936148
persistent	transient	instances	transient
the state of a transient or detached instances may also be made persistent as a new persistent instances by calling merge

2936174
octal	hex
how can i split a line in python at a non-printing ascii character such as the long minus sign hex 0x97 octal 227

2936183
division	multiplication	division	modulo	multiplication	modulo
much faster would be to treat it as base 4 then conversion can be done entirely with bit shifts no modulo division multiplication this is possible since 4 30 is still less than 2 64

2936214
implements	extends
the nullprintwriter can be either found in the apache commons io package or implements for yourself simple by extends printstream and replacing the print ops with no ops

2936234
antivirus	norton
my college has a silly login page that requires you to download a whole bunch of garbage that a lot of us don t need norton antivirus antispyware software etc.

2936254
getter	setter
properties will only be included in xml serialization if they have both a getter and a setter presumably as this rule ensures that serialization can round-trip if there is no setter you would not be able to deserialize the xml back into the target object

2936275
min	max
that way you don t have to care or know what bitdept the player is using the max value is 1 and the min value is -1 and that s it

2936275
range	max
just take the read value and divide it by the max value and you have your input amplitude converted to the range -1 .

2936280
getter	setter
instead of writing a callback-like function that checks whenever a particular value is true why not make setter and getter functions that can invoke callback or just call callback directly whenever vtrue would be true

2936280
getter	setter
one conventional approach would be to use setter and getter instead of assignments

2936315
getter	setter
in addition to trey answer since i was also thinking of setter and getter

2936338
textarea	textbox
there will 6 different kinds of form each form will have 7-8 inputs which includes textarea of size 5kb textbox and checkboxes

2936342
uitableview	nsindexpath
- bool tableview uitableview tableview canmoverowatindexpath nsindexpath indexpath

2936443
put	get
the result is that i get exactly the same image as before i put it through this method

2936550
accessor	properties
i am looking for a keyboard short-cut to complete creating the default accessor for a properties in a c# class

2936622
listview	gridview
while the excerpt focuses on listview the technique is identical for gridview

2936634
queue	fifo
adding additional items has fifo behavior which is pretty much ideal for a message queue

2936692
uinavigationcontroller	uiwindow
the problem was that the uinavigationcontroller s view was not the top-level view in the hierarchy it was not added to uiwindow directly but it was added as a subview to another view controller s view instead

2936715
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
if you visit the site in question haddongrant.com and go to the artwork section if you click on an image and view it s stack in safari google-chrome or firefox you ll notice the images extend up and down the page eventually disappearing over the edge

2936728
nunit	mstest
any recommendations re whether to got mstest or nunit for a new project in vs2010 c# mainly focused at business logic layer unit tests

and don t worry about having two methods with same name they will be distincted by httpverb one will respond only to get while second to post

2943194
super	implements
marker interfaces are implements by the classes or their super classes in order to add some functionality

2943194

2943437
innodb	myisam
if you have so many records in the table then the first thing is to change the table engine to innodb if its not innodb because for large number of records innodb is much faster as it caches the table data while on the contrary myisam engine only caches the indexes so each time it has to do a full table scan from disk if the data required cannot be fetched from index

use a http proxy sniffer ie charles http proxy to record the http request of a browser that is displaying the rss feed correctly then try using cfhttp with the same user agent string as a previously successful request

2943505

2944102
sorting	grouping
in the example you gave the team may explicitly ask the po if the sorting grouping functionality is needed

2944102
sorting	grouping
if the requirement for the sorting grouping comes up subsequently as a result of people using early incarnations of the product well that s another story and is estimated scheduled into the backlog accordingly

2944109
min	max
a very simple solution is to set the min and max size of each window equal to each other and to a fix number in the window constructor

2944269
inherited	properties
the cursor properties and the click event are inherited by the element s children

to prevent the cursor properties from being inherited you can add a css rule that explicitly sets the cursor for and elements like this

2944276
dictionary	map
for instance you can map collection types to a generic list or an observable collection and for dictionary you can essentially tell it to map to various data types

once strlen invalue returns the length of the string excluding 0 control char the area to be allocated by malloc strlen invalue sizeof char is not large enough to receive strcpy myvalue invalue

2944464

and simpler to use only with the keyboard letting apart the need of using the mouse for lots of simple taks saving you time and giving you more focus on the code.

2944738
for-loop	loops
how would you replace a while loops for example without using a for-loop

2944777
equals	gethashcode
the challenge is that some of the objects in the system have overridden equals and gethashcode for use as value equality and their internal values will change over time

2944777
equals	gethashcode
that means that their equals and gethashcode are useless

2944779
post	get
wordpress automatically adds magic quotes to get and post which you ll need to sanitize before saving

2944792
for-loop	loops
in some cases you can put all logic into the third parameter of the for-loop statement and create a loops that looks empty but does some job i am not saying that this is a good style

affinity	processors
we ve noticed that the application seems to run pretty smoothly if we set the processors affinity to a single processors using task manager only manifesting instability when processors affinity isn t set

2944843
affinity	processors
i know that i can specify the processors affinity of a task using .net and as such there lies a possibility of me writing a shell application that could be used to run legacy applications with a specified processors affinity does anyone have any experience with this and can throw out some ideas as to headaches i m likely to run into with this approach

2944843
affinity	processors
the other question is is it in fact possible to modify the core vba product to handle its own processors affinity

2944886
cpu	processors	cpu	affinity	affinity	processors
you could use sysinternal s psexec to start your application with a certain processors affinity to bind access to cpu 1 call

2944886
affinity	processors
your vba code will then be executed in process you will have to modify the processors affinity of the access.exe process

2944886
affinity	processors
however before you specify a processors affinity make sure that you are fully aware of the consequences

2944893
google-chrome	firefox
but when i see it on the browser google-chrome firefox looks like this

your problem here is to do with get and post requests

second might be to override contentheight or contentwidth so that they dispatch said bindable events for height and width

2946270
width	height
which appears to be where the height and width of the contentholder are set

2946271
post	get

why should i use post over get

2946330
post	put	post	get	put	get
the http standard describes the ways that the different requests get post put delete head are intended to be used

2946330
post	put
for example put is intended to add a resource delete is intended to remove one and post is intended to modify one

2946330
put	get
could you use a get request instead of a put or delete

2946337
post	get
although you will not be able to get line level tracing automatically you can get method level tracing using aspect oriented programming where code can be weaved in post build at method entry exit points

2946343
post	get
if you want an idempotent request uri response is always the same then use get else post

2946345

post	put	post	get	put	get
every http method post get put delete etc

2946363
post	get
here is what is says about post and get methods

2946363
put	get
idempotence is also guaranteed for put which basically means â œupdate this resource with this data or create it at this uri if itâ s not there alreadyâ and for delete which you can simply try again and again until you get a result â deleting something thatâ s not there is not a problem

2946369
rss	feed
is this dependent on whether the feed is rss or atom

2946369
post	get
i am trying to get the blog post s text irrespective of what rss url the user inputs

2946370
post	get
get and post have semantic meaning - get is used to retrieve a resource and post is used to modify it

2946370
post	get
it s safe to cache a get request but not a post command - so that s what caching proxies do

2946370
post	get
post is as easily tampered with or viewed as get

2946376

udp	tcp
i note that tcp is available but not udp

2946553
children	parent
any children of an item would be padded slightly as to easily distinguish their parent item

2946553
children	parent
note that i could if needed make each parent show no children and then when the parent is clicked a new list containing all of it s children is loaded

2946574
children	parent
first you ll need a bit of css a hover class and a background on the elements so the parent s background doesn t show up on children because otherwise they have a transparent background so whatever the parent has will show like this

2946574
mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseout	mouseover	mouseleave	mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseleave
then you can use mouseover and mouseout not mouseenter and mouseleave like .hover uses like this

2946574
mouseleave	mouseenter
this uses .mouseover and .mouseout so it fires when entering leaving a child element which mouseenter mouseleave specifically won t

2946660
free	memcpy
otherwise i ve to memcpy the array to other variable excluding the first position and then free the original array

2946669
pow	sqrt
module v sqrt pow xv 2 + pow yv 2

boost	allocator
if you want to avoid the use of boost i would recommend just using std vector they are array s underneath and there is no need to worry about memory allocator

2946690
free	malloc
you can only free a complete block obtained from a call to malloc or one of malloc s friends not a piece of that block

2946690
free	memcpy
using memcpy works if it is really that important to free the two elements

the post redirect get pattern is effective for mvc

2946858
ubuntu	debian
first be aware that although ubuntu and debian use the same packaging system a package built for one might not work properly on the other due to differences in installed shared libraries

i started using code collector pro to organise and save my emacs codes and this software requires textmate bundles for syntax highlighting

2947018

is there a way to have both of these work together or do i have to try using the mouseenter and mouseleave instead

2947183
x86	64bit
since there are different ngen caches for x64 and x86 processes it could be that the 64bit ngen cache either needs to be rebuilt or updated

2947249
spaces	delimiter
i notice that output value of does not seem to contain any delimiter between the file names nor does it have quotes or other delimiter wrapping the file names which contain spaces

2947258
strlen	substr
then you could just loop it and check for the matched value why can t you use substr but you can strlen

2947264
x86	64bit
also am i right to believe that while targeting anycpu will generate no errors when building a application referencing third party x86 .net dlls the application will throw a runtime exception when it tries to load these dlls when it runs on a 64bit os

2947284
google-chrome	firefox
the problem the galleria plug-in only works normally from inside of the containing iframe in google-chrome 5.0 has inconsistent behaviour in ie8 seems to work in my local copy but won t load properly online and is not loaded properly in firefox 3.6.3

binary heap binomial heap and fibonacci heap all support deletemax on max heap or analogously deletemin on min heap in o log n so overall this is o n log n which is optimal for comparison-based sort

2947337
put	get
my initial thought is to put app views in .gitignore and to have anyone forking the code add their own views directory perhaps including an app views_default directory with a web-app-theme layout or something else to get people running

2947362
pop-up	dialog
unfortunately because it s blocking chrome will pop-up a dialog complaining that a script is taking too long to execute if you take your sweet time selecting the file

2947385
viewdidload	viewwillappear
since that view does not exist until it s loaded viewdidload viewwillappear you are not loading map or displaying it beforehands

g++	gcc
g++ gcc 4.4.1 20090725 red hat 4.4.1-2

2948110
factors	mean
i mean i wouldn t use an estimate of 100 days programming plus a factors of 2.5 to get a project size of 250 days

2948212
width	height
i already tried to achieve this by using a linearlayout but the buttons are ending up using the correct width but still having the height of the background not square any more

2948216

mousedown doesn t have an automatic repeat but you could create one via setinterval and then turn it off on mouseup via clearinterval

2948582
mouseup	mousedown
be sure to test your target browsers i wouldn t be 100 certain some of them don t eat mousedown and mouseup on buttons

2948631

please let me know how to convert a jpg png bmp image into a 8-bit grayscale raw image in java

2949018
mouseleave	mouseenter
you can use event.stoppropagation with .hover but you re actually using mouseenter and mouseleave with .hover anyway

2949018
mouseleave	mouseenter
if you provide 1 function to .hover it runs on both events if you provide 2 functions the first is the mouseenter handler the second is the mouseleave handler

2949018
mouseout	mouseenter
however this may not be what you re after...since mouseenter doesn t fire when entering a child that s actually specifically why it exists mouseout will fire when entering a child

2949018
mouseover	mouseout
however if you are using mouseover and mouseout then it would matter like this

2949179
google-chrome	firefox
works great in firefox and google-chrome

2949236
folder	dir
most antivirus programs protect folder and files in program dir

2949237
getter	setter
yes because that s the convention for naming setter getter for key value coding

2949250
folder	directory
so what i did was locate the source files for the reports reportserver directory and placed the app_theme folder in them hoping that would sort everything out

2949255
post	get
you can have whatever action you want for it get post whatever won t matter

2949260
setinterval	settimeout
using strings in settimeout and setinterval is closely related to eval and should only be used in rare cases

2949303
kerberos	ntlm
ie is very forgiving with ntlm and kerberos challenges

2949318
kerberos	ntlm
if you don t mind a commercially packaged product then take a look at quest single sign on for java which provides support for spnego kerberos including sites and s4u protocols as well as ntlm

rss	feed
i have a small test app that parses a few rss feed

2949560
cldc	midp
minimum configuration profile cldc 1.1 midp 2.0 with support for some necessary jsrs jsr-75 for file storage

2949560
recordstore	rms
there could be one key generated for each storage object file rms recordstore etc. or just use one for all the objects of the same type

2949560
keystore	jks
for this case using a standard jks or pkcs#12 keystore file could be suited to store encryption keys but i could also define a smaller structure encryption-transformation key data checksum that could be attached to each storage store using addition files with the same name and special extension for plain files or embedded inside other types of objects such as rms record stores

2949563
hide	show
that said if you re still adamant you should be able to put something together easily using the mouse over events to swap the visibility of the applicationcontrolbar and then you can use show hide effects to display the control bar

2949582
hudson	phpundercontrol
you can also use a continuous integration tool like hudson or phpundercontrol

2949620
subtract	add
add subtract this vector to from your rotating vector point

2949621
cos	sin
in summary you should use sin and cos

2949621
cos	sqrt	cos	sin	sin	sqrt
45 degrees is a special case where sin and cos are both 1 sqrt 2 so it doesn t matter which way round you use them

2949626
subtract	add	multiplying	subtract	multiplying	add
to get the yellow points just multiplying this up by your 20 pixels and add subtract it on to the co-ordinates of a

2949701
post	get
to start it is firing a get request but the servlet is listening on post requests only

2949701
dataoutputstream	inputstream
apart from the dopost incorrectly been used the io resource handling is incorrect every line has its own try catch exceptions are been suppressed and poor information is written to stdout inputstream#available is been misunderstood the dataoutputstream is been used for no clear reason the inputstream is never been closed etcetera

2949706
hide	show
show hide divs as necessary in tabbar didselectitem

2949804
disk	ram
since it does take me 7mb extra to store the extra column and that has its implications on disk usage and ram usage and our server has cpu power to spare but not ram io i m leaning towards the transform the char into date on each query solution

2949805
cos	sqrt	cos	sin	sin	sqrt
i need to execute it with sin | cos | sqrt | ln where dijkstraâ s algorithm should do the work

2949805
cos	sqrt	cos	sin	sin	sqrt
edit shunting yard is the algorithm to convert input function to rpn but how can i extend it to accept another function like sin | cos | sqrt | ln

2949823
google-chrome	firefox
now i have the joyous task of trying to get this to work with your standard browsers - ie firefox google-chrome

2949830
onclick	onfocus
instead of binding to onfocus event you must bind this action into onclick event and it will work as you wanted

2949869
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
firefox + firebug might help you here or google-chrome safari using the web inspector

2949889
hash	md5
basic example is when you download any file from server server has md5 calculated when it comes to you it again check for md5 values if md5 hash matches file is not corrupted or not modified by any third person

2949924
internationalization	localization
this clearly has something to do with internationalization localization

2949937
groupbox	panel
if those labels are contained within other containers panel controls groupbox controls etc then you will have to write a recursive search - however this would be a good start

2949960
jstl	taglib
maybe you weren t aware of existence and powers of taglib like jstl

2949996
stdout	stderr
if you expect users to redirect stdin stderr and stdout for example when running your program from a different tool then you should make sure that status information and error messages are separated cleanly

2950021
128bit	64bit
you can take a sampling of 64bit from the 128bit hash

2950033
hash	md5
as a cryptographic hash even one nowadays considered broken md5 has no significant correlation between input and output bits

2950046
int	chars

2950046
int	chars
main int argc 2 chars argv 0x028a14c0 line 1188 + 0x13 bytes c

2950062
hash	md5
md5 and sha hash smear the data in a uniform way across the hash value so any 64 bits ypu choose out of the final value will be as sensitive to a change as any other 64 bits

2950072
stdout	stderr
it s worth knowing the difference between stdin stdout and stderr

2950072
stdout	stderr
stdout should be used for normal program output whereas stderr should be reserved only for error messages abnormal program execution

2950078
getter	setter
so i have a fontfamilyproperty and a getter and setter for it

2950097
postgresql	mysql
it must at version 1.0 support ms sql server oracle mysql postgresql and db2

the system must allow an administrative end user to create business rules that will enforce validation show hide ui elements block certain actions based on the identity of specific users specific user groups or privileges

2950126
hash	md5
you can just use any part of the md5 hash

2950126
128bit	64bit
we tried to fold 128bit into 64bit with various algorithms but the folding action didn t make any noticeable difference in hash distribution

2950126
hash	md5
we hash 8 million email addresses into 32-bit integer and there are actually more collisions with md5 than string hashcode

2950144
regasm	regsvr32

i think you can implements that not trivial but not difficult by extends fileappender

2950389
pop-up	dialog
when the user clicks on a certain link a modal dialog pop-up is shown

2950395
width	height
if so .bmp files if i recall correctly tell you their width and height right at the top so you could actually use that to figure out exactly how many levels you ll have which might help you build something

2950396
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
if you subclassing a control that has this behavior there s really no way to override it because your subclassing will inherited the superclass s implementation of setframe which modifies your frame rectangle

2950396
inherited	properties
you ll most likely have to inherited from uicontrol and implement the properties behaviors you want from uiswitch manually to work around this

2950405
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox

2950478
put	get
you have to put 3 ampersands in to get 2 ampersands out

2950510
hide	show
all i can say is start with allowing the user to customize the user interface a little bit hide show fields making a field required in a form

2950623
keydown	keyup
when this property is set to true the form will receive all keypress keydown and keyup events

2950625
int	double
it s saying you need to check if the variable is of the correct data type int double string etc and within some specified bounds mininum maximum value precision string length etc

2950643
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
here is the final working function which solved my issue and works in ie6 ie7 ie8 google-chrome firefox safari and opera

2950732
put	get
personally i would put all the keywords you want in one heading and always remember the golden rule of seo the best way to get good rankings is to have good relevant content

2950744
post	get
i think i get why you want the authentication to only be on the bid post action

2950764
innodb	myisam
in mysql autocommit is on by default for innodb - myisam doesn t support transactions

2950787
stdout	fflush
sub-proceses which produce console output can block and deadlock if their stdout stderror streams are not fflush

2950825
int	boolean	int	chars
calling the methods works fine as long as long as the parameters are simple parameters such as strings int chars and boolean

2950832
public	protected
i m not sure of all the access modifiers but at the most basic only public and protected members are accessible

2950836
public	protected
try the keyword protected instead of public private

2950842
public	protected
public protected internal and

2950845
public	protected
make name protected or public instead that will be accessible

2950852
hash	md5
the standard way is to compute their hash md5 or sha1

2950860
min	max
many basic matlab functions like mean max min sum etc. are designed to operate across a specific dimension

2950877
post	get
i personally use hackbar to send simple post get requests there s a version that can modify cookies per request too i think and wireshark or livehttpheaders although livehttpheaders is also buggy when i need to analyze traffic

2950880
lambda	first-class-functions
as far as must-have features i d say lambda and first-class-functions

2950890
put	get
the best solution is to get a second monitor and put ie on one monitor and the debugger in the other monitor

2950906
base-class	derived-class
public all public members of the base-class are accessible within the derived-class and to the instances of derived-class

2950906
base-class	derived-class
protected all protected members of the base-class are accessible within the derived-class and not to the instances of derived-class

2950906
base-class	derived-class
protected internal all protected internal members of the base-class are accessible within the derived-class and to the instances of derived-class created within the same assembly

2950906
base-class	derived-class
internal all internal members of the base-class are accessible within the derived-class and to the instances of derived-class within the same assembly

2950906
base-class	derived-class
private no private members of the base-class are accessible within the derived-class and to the instances of derived-class

2950945
for-loop	loops
with a for-loop your counter variable is always incremented before the next iteration of loops which adds some uniformity to your code

2950952
post	get
so if i have a need to get categories post authors tags etc. i have to define a new class for every one of these things

2950988
for-loop	loops
remember a for-loop is essentially a fancy while loops

2950988
for-loop	loops
the advantage of a for-loop is that it s harder to accidentally do an infinite loops

2951024
ienumerable	iqueryable
the only things i can find in common with the 2 are that the first is an ienumerable and the second converts itself from iqueryable - ienumerable - datatable.

2951053
hide	show
i have some jquery code that show or hide a div

2951053
hide	show
how do i set the hide the element before the page loads whilst keeping the ability to show hide it dynamically with a script

put	get
like this i am having 12 tables from january to december hwo can i combine this and get out put like below

2951140
folder	directory
click the browse button to select the root directory and it should default to the workspace s main folder

2951152
inherited	subclassing
it is important to understand that all members are inherited regardless of their access modifier because it effects the sizes of the subclassing

2951216
pull	push
upon triggering push or pull of one or more changesets an activity graph is placed in the static activity folder of the default template folder

2951331
for-loop	arrays
last tip arrays.copyof anarray anarray.length also returns a copy of the arrays without the the for-loop

2951337
versioning	upgrade
the email-related credentials are ok because i could send emails until i upgrade my rails versioning about two weeks ago

2951357
gif	png	jeditorpane	jfilechooser
what i am trying to do is open up a jfilechooser that filters jpeg gif and png images then gets the user s selection and inserts it into the jeditorpane

2951418
versioning	upgrade
b the upgrade path from free versioning to paid versioning would include data remaining visible

2951454
equals	tostring
should i use these properties in equals hashcode tostring methods

2951498
touchesbegan	touchesmoved	touchesbegan	touchesended	touchesmoved	touchesended
you can use this code in all touch event functions touchesbegan touchesended touchesmoved and you can count touches and know their states

2951555
uitableview	reloaddata	viewdidappear	viewwillappear
i can of course set some boolean flag and call uitableview reloaddata in viewwillappear or viewdidappear but i was wondering if there s a cleaner way of doing it

2951556
hide	show
i would like for when this anchor is clicked it will hide the first div and then show the second

2951556
hide	show
i just can t figure out how to hide the first and then show the second then third then next when clicking the anchor

2951560
touchesbegan	touchesmoved	touchesbegan	touchesended	touchesmoved	touchesended
in iphone sdk there are touchesbegan touchesended and touchesmoved functions that are called when a touch event appears

2951560
touchesbegan	touchesmoved	touchesbegan	touchesended	touchesmoved	touchesended
in any of touchesbegan touchesended and touchesmoved functions i can use fallowing code to know the state for every touch but outside them i can t |

2951572
uilabel	uibutton
how do i arrange some uilabel and or uibutton of a variable length

2951573
mockups	balsamiq
in balsamiq mockups this is very easy however i don t see any kind of window-like sketches in sketchflow

2951591
serializable	deserialization
looks like amf serializable deserialization is dealt with in this package red 5 code

2951595
hide	show
if the last div is showing clicking the button will just hide it and show nothing

2951604
mouseover	mouseout
simply attach an event listener to the polygon object mouseover and mouseout events

2951631
post	get
when you load the page check for any post data or get however you re doing it and then check the session to see if a recent search was done using that data

2951641
implements	extends
write a custom formatter extends java.util.logging.formatter class and implements the string format logrecord method according to your needs

2951654
g++	gcc
and to know if it is a g++ idiosincracy or not i should try another compiler but i have only gcc and no time now to analyse the asm output of g++.

2951654
int	double
which is a fragment that initializes to 0 0.0 the int and the double of the struct.

2951655
getter	setter
those objects should have private properties and public getter and setter

2951659

shutil	copytree
the shutil module can do this specifically the copyfile copy copy2 and copytree functions

2951679
wan	lan
the lan or wan

2951682
post	get
with a normal restful create action it would be with a post from a form or something but 404s are generally rendered from a failed get action where an activerecord find fails to locate a record with a specific id

2951685
daemons	systemd
if your target platform is debian based it makes sense to create a debina package to deploy it as it also helps getting a daemons properly integrated in the rest of the systemd

2951689
inherited	properties
nhibernate has greater flexibility in inherited mapping better integration with stored procs database functions custom sql triggers support for formula properties and it just a more mature platform than ef 4

2951704
free	malloc
my guess is it s the same thing but when i use malloc i also have to free that

2951738
post	get
the are things like sniffers on simple network analysis tools even like firebug that let you see the data transfered via post or get

2951743
rsa	dsa
you seem to have rsa and dsa confused

2951810
int	boolean
implicit conversion of any int value such as flags 0x80 to a boolean implies a language defined mapping from an int value to a boolean

2951833
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
in practice most of my loops are either stepping through an arrays or structure of some kind in which case i use a for-loop

2951834
webclient	httpwebrequest
that error wouldn t be happening on the client since reader quotas are a wcf-only thing and webclient httpwebrequest don t do deserialization themselves or enforce any other kind of quotas

2951905
int	boolean
mapping the entire range of int -- or the even larger range of floats -- onto the two boolean values is fraught with disagreement over arbitrary assignment of truthness and falseness

2951905
int	double
when you try to automatically convert a double to an int java flags this as a loss of precision error

2951916
apache	nginx
did you make sure you restarted your server like apache nginx or passenger

2951917
wordpress	joomla
security is a major concern and i d like to learn from some of the popular php cms s like wordpress joomla drupal etc

2951954
post	get
enabling register globals so that get and post variables

2951991
post	get
the basic idea is to trick a user to a page where his browser will initiate a post or get request to the cms you attack

2951991
hash	md5
which is a bad idea because of rainbow tables even if the hash is not md5 but sha512 for example

2951991
salt	md5
salt md5

2951999
int	chars
i want to show a select which options are the chars - and a range of int

2952028
persistent	transient
the two typical usages of transient and transient that i m aware of are to use them either for stuff that can t be serialized persistent a remote resource handle or computed properties which can be reconstructed from others

2952040
hide	show
however i suspect that you also want to hide all other divs when one div is show

2952055
opera	firefox
it s not compatible with firefox neither opera so i can t use firebug or such plugins

2952087
int	boolean
it s actually c that does not support boolean so if and any other conditional statement actually expects an int value not boolean

2952099
fseek	fread
move around for your binary search with fseek and fread

2952110
google-chrome	firefox
i float it left and when it prints the second page it leaves off the name part of the list in firefox works fine in google-chrome and ie see here

2952111
rss	feed
it doesn t look twitter supports this in their current api however it wouldn t be difficult to create using a service which follows an rss feed

2952111
rss	feed
in this case you d just have to wait for the rss feed to update and call whatever function you require

2952122
versioning	upgrade
when i upgrade my solution from vs 2008 to vs 2010 the conversion process automatically updated references from microsoft.visualstudio.qualitytools.unittestframework versioning 9.0.0.0 to microsoft.visualstudio.qualitytools.unittestframework versioning 10.0.0.0 in my test projects

2952163
post	get
i ve gone over this code time and time again but always get a 404 when the form post to myentities add this is a post-only url on purpose

2952173
ubuntu	debian	jobs	cron
essentially the garbage collection is set up to be done by cron jobs on some systems ubuntu debian

2952183
jms	jta
the important ones are jpa persistence jta distributed transaction jms messaging jdbc data sources

2952251
partition-problem	np-complete
take any instance of the np-complete partition-problem

2952251
np-hard	np-complete
so this is a reduction so the problem is np-hard and the problem is np so it is np-complete

2952254
cos	sin
symbolic differentiation over common functions + - sin cos etc. ignoring regions where the function or its derivative is undefined is easy

2952256
width	height
set the height width of the canvas to the height width of your image

2952267
accessor	properties
leave generate accessor and generate obj-c 2.0 properties ticked and click finished

it seems that the hide animation on the warning dialog was conflicting with the show animation of the re-login dialog

2952346
bids	ssis
this is ssis bids 2008

2952374
post	get
to use twitter4j to get all post from a user you ll have to make your request over multiple pages

2952395
post	put

2952458
stdout	stderr
sometimes stderr and stdout can also lock the system.

2952469
equals	tostring
the case of tostring is different you can do whatever you want with tostring so i will only cover equals and hashcode

2952469
persistent	transient
unfortunately this solution has a major problem when using generated identifiers the values are not assigned until an entity becomes persistent so if a transient entity is added to a set before being saved its hash code will change while it s in the set and this breaks the contract of the set

2952469
persistent	transient
the database identifier will change if a transient object is made persistent

2952469
instances	transient
if the transient instances usually together with detached instances is held in a set changing the hashcode breaks the contract of the set

2952483
coalesce	isnull
if you were in sql it would be isnull or coalesce but in c# you ll just want to toss a ternary operater in place

google-chrome	firefox
it appears to work on google-chrome and firefox but on firefox i needed to upload it to a server

2952555
filtering	grouping
i d like a flexible good looking and easy to use grid that can do filtering grouping etc

2952576
post	put	post	get	put	get
if you need the base url outside of responding to queries not in a get post put delete block or a view it would be better to set it manually somewhere

2952588
mouseleave	mouseenter
so i ve added a mouseenter and mouseleave event one runs a setinterval function which sends a click every 1 5 seconds

2952593
portrait	landscape
or the tableview is covering it up because the landscape view has less vertical room than the portrait view

2952662
srp	principles
i m reading bob martin s principles of ood specifically the srp text and i understand the spirit of what it s saying pretty well but i don t quite understand a particular phrasing from page 2 of the link page 150 of the book

2952670
folder	directory
wp created the new htaccess file and i moved the index.php to the root directory but left the wp folder where it was in the blog directory as instructed

2952686
unsigned	short
unsigned short s can take up to 5 characters right

2952686
unsigned	short
seems like you d need to allocate 5 characters for your unsigned short to cover all of the values

2952747
children	parent
create your model containing parent and children in this case it is an int and a list of int

2952748
mouse	keyboard
from the site monkeyfuzz primarily sends random keyboard and mouse events to a program but it can record the actions along the way

2952761
unix	bsd
the second alternative requires you to replace sys socket.h bsd sockets library unix standard for the tcp ip stack with winsock2.h and rewrite some parts of the code -not much but some

2952789
getter	setter
when you have a getter setter for every variable it means you don t have to rewrite your set method if you add something to your class

2952789
getter	setter
purpose of getter and setter to my mind is not about simple modification but rather about encapsulating a sequence of actions that results in value modification or returns the value which we treat as visible result

2952795
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome it works perfectly

2952795
google-chrome	firefox
with google-chrome and firefox it closes the popup and allows the handler to reload the page

2952795
google-chrome	firefox
this is very frustrating as the behaviour in google-chrome and firefox is perfect

2952821
firefox	safari
everything works perfectly in safari and firefox

2952837
for-loop	loops
you can t loops this with a for-loop but you can correctly

2952857
globalization	localization
i wonder what the practice in regards to globalization and localization on small-scale internal apps is in the wild.

2952880
versioning	upgrade
though i would call disponse on any classes that implements them doesn t matter if they don t do anything now an upgrade versioning of the class might start leaking something essential and it s a good habit to get into

2952913
cpu	processors
some common entities sharing the memory bus cpu dma controllers video processors sound processors and network or i o processors

2952965
inherited	properties
transparent means that the match inherited its highlighting properties from the containing block these rules do not change the way text is displayed

2952995
post	get
i have a rewrite rule for get and post

2952998
free	malloc
i agree with neil alienfluid and fredoverflow that in most cases you don t want to write your own memory allocator but i still wrote my own memory allocator about 15 years and refined it over the years first version was with malloc free redefinition later versions using global new delete operators and in my experience the advantages can be enormous

2953010
spaces	delimiter
this will parse the file into a collection of spaces delimiter strings lazily and then you can read them as doubles just like

2953026
intersect	contains
1 segment-plane intersection determine if the line segment connecting points 1 and 2 intersect the plane contains the polygon

2953028
extjs	mootools
when development of phonegap was under way we noticed slow load times for modern javascript frameworks such as prototype mootools yui extjs and yes even jquery

2953084
ropemacs	pymacs
this way pymacs and ropemacs will be loaded only once

2953141
lisp	scheme
how come most lisp and scheme are dynamically typed

2953152
width	margin
i tried setting the width of the datepicker element and a right margin so that the time selectors would position next to it

2953168
button	checkbox
i need checkbox exactly style not radio button

2953177
innodb	myisam
you can use the innodb database engine in mysql instead of the default myisam it has foreign key constraints

2953183
opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari
however this doesn t seem to work in any browser i ve tested in safari opera firefox and princexml all on my mac

2953226
rss	feed
i tried using rss feed but they don t give me as much control over what i retrieve as using the api directly.

2953238
spaces	delimiter
if memory serves me right you pass them in by putting them after the call to the batch file and using spaces delimiter c mycmd.bat var1 var2

2953256
pop-up	dialog
i m using a jqueryui dialog command to pop-up a and wish to print just the text of the using the declarative

2953289
post	get
i want to use firebug to view get and post parameters being passed

2953312
google-chrome	firefox
but when i use firefox or google-chrome they just open a new tab

2953351
portrait	landscape
there has been a lot of confusion and a set of corresponding set of questions here on so how iphone applications with proper handling for landscape portrait mode autorotation can be implemented

2953351
portrait	landscape
iphone landscape-only utility-template application layout errors controller does not seem to recognize the view should be rotated but displays a clipped portrait view in landscape mode causing half of the screen to stay blank

2953351
portrait	landscape
presentmodalviewcontroller in landscape after portrait viewcontroller modal views are not correctly rendered either

2953373
unsigned	short
the endianness is preserved correctly so that if you cast buffer into unsigned short you can read the same value of s_int the right way

2953454
ada	algol
several other languages were predicted to replace cobol - algol ada and c come to mind but

2953484
accessor	properties
in the last example validateduser looks similar to your original code but the key difference is that validateduser itself doesn t have any properties values - it delegates all properties accessor to the m_user object

2953512
min	max
min max stuff i would add to the same parameter

2953514
firefox	safari
will make a working link in firefox but doesn t work in safari

2953529
implements	extends
i m trying to extends a java swing component in clojure i want to extends a javax.swing.jcomponent and add some custom methods implements in pure clojure in addition to all the standard inherited methods

2953536
opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari
the website works perfectly fine in ie7 8 firefox safari opera

2953559
google-chrome	firefox
i should mention i m testing on the latest ie8 firefox 3.6 and google-chrome

2953574
width	height
however on ie8 and i assume other versions of ie also when i then iterate over the img elements i am unable to determine the width height of the images loaded

2953643
vmware	esx
virtual machine running on vmware esx

2953643
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
no performance problem using google-chrome firefox opera or safari from same machine

2953645
division	multiplication
since the compiler knows the value can t change it doesn t need to load the value from memory and can optimize the code to work for only the exact value of the constant for instance the compiler can use shifts for multiplication division if the const is a power of 2.

2953664
linqdatasource	objectdatasource
using a linqdatasource or objectdatasource the binding setting the editindex etc is handled through the data source

2953713
button	checkbox
fortunately i had experience getting mvc to work in 3.5 sp 1 so i tried that method opened the properties dialog of the virtual director went to the directory tab click the configuration button and added a wildcard application map to the aspnet_isapi.dll and unchecked the verify that file exists checkbox

2953745
ubuntu	debian
the approach i just got working was in ubuntu which is closely related to debian

2953766
for-loop	arrays
i run through a for-loop each time extracting certain elements of an arrays say element1 element2 etc

2953780
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
for funsies i decided to check out browser compatibility and this method is feasible in ie opera safari and google-chrome but not firefox which does not include comments in the returned string

2953832
jdom	dom4j	jdom	xom	dom4j	xom
as well as being thread-safe jaxen is model-agnostic - it works with many models w3c dom xom dom4j jdom and custom models can be plugged in by implementing a couple of interfaces

2953849
entity-relationship	diagram
so i ve designed a e-r diagram consisting in 6 tables but the problem is that i think that my class diagram and my entity-relationship diagram looks too similar i mean i think i m not doing things right because i have a class for each table practically and when i have to extract all the users on my system do i have to convert all the rows into objects at first and write in the database for each object modified

2953864
gridview	repeater
this is not part of a repeater or gridview

2953887
spaces	delimiter
the file is spaces delimiter

2953903
equals	compareto
i need to use treeset and i can t use contains because they use compareto and equals compareto pair are implemented in an incompatible way and i can t change that

2953933
treemap	treeset	sortedmap	sortedset
the contracts of map and set do not make any guarantees about iteration order but those of sortedset and sortedmap implemented by treemap and treeset do

2953957
equals	compareto	treemap	treeset
using treemap and treeset work properly when compareto and equals are implemented in such a way that they are compatible with each other

2953979
min	max
you can use max and min

2953987
vpn	lan
we wanted an admin section that was available to logged-in admins but also only available if accessed from the lan or vpn

2953987
vpn	lan
lan and vpn ip addresses all started with 10

2953999
jruby	rubinius	jruby	mri	ironruby	rubinius	mri	rubinius
looksee patches the interpreter which is the reason why it only works on mri and yarv and not on jruby xruby ironruby ruby.net rubinius tinyrb rubygolightly macruby hotruby blueruby cardinal maglev smallruby red sun and all the other implementations

2954056
togaf	enterprise
togaf and zachman are both enterprise architecture frameworks that you might find useful

2954080
udp	tcp
if this still does not improves the latency then you could fallback to using udp instead of tcp

2954108
width	height
seems like i have to walk the list of div tags in an outer loop n and have an inner loop another n to compare against all other div tags and do a containment test position width height building a list of contained div tags

2954151
postgresql	mysql
side notes i m using postgresql but a solution for mysql would be fine too so i can try to port it to postgresql

2954177
postgresql	mysql
see for more about emulating mysql s group_concat in postgresql

2954178
google-chrome	firefox
note this error only occurs in google-chrome and not firefox

2954192
pecl	pear
without using the pear library or the pecl extension because i don t want to fuss with pear or have to depend on being able to install a pecl extension on every instance of this application

2954278
pecl	pear
well in addition to the pear package and the pecl extension you also have a zend framework package called zend_markup which is very easy to use zf is loosely coupled so you can choose to only use that component

2954290
gridview	repeater	gridview	sqldatasource
well for what you are doing i wouldn t really recommend a sqldatasource as it is really meant to be bound to a control such as a gridview or repeater

2954346
puts	gets
the game works well currently it s a hotseat version however i m really frustrated by the fact that whenever i rotate the screen of the phone my gridview gets hysterical and puts some empty space in my chess table between the columns

2954346
portrait	landscape
the chess table looks fine if the phone is in portrait mode but in landscape mode it s far from nice

2954346
portrait	landscape
this is how i can decide whether we are in portrait or landscape mode

2954370
folder	directory
how can i make my static-file root directory relative to my application root folder instead of a hard-coded path

2954375
for-loop	arrays
i instantiate the objects into an arrays using a nested for-loop and expect a grid of the objects to be rendered

2954386
voltdb	acid
voltdb is an entrant which claims acid compliance and while it still uses sql its goals are the same in terms of scalability

2954389
client-side	server-side
you specify your validation rules in your java code using annotations and the library generates javascript for client-side validation and java for server-side

2954433
avr	microcontroller
im using avr and the microcontroller is atmega 1281

2954433
free	malloc
now if i use the free function to deallocate the memory at the end of the function using malloc the program just gets stuck when the control reaches free

2954434
post	get
but when i try to execute it with some small changes post instead of the the get method i get a

2954473
profiling	debugging
edit interestingly enough the build time has exploded only on debugging builds as per the following profiling information of the whole project which isn t just the file in question but still a good metric

2954474
free	malloc
whether you need to free a block at the end of the function calling malloc should be determined by whether the memory block is still used after the call

2954474
free	malloc
in any case using malloc and free on small memory blocks linked list operations in a real-time system no virtual memory is going to lead to eventual heap fragmentation

2954541
stdout	stderr
you can get around this by using redirection to redirect both stdout and stderr to a file

2954659
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox the input button has more padding than in google-chrome

2954675
put	get
if i put a breakpoint in the method i m trying to get into it works fine as in the debugger will break on the line but as soon as i step f10 it exits the method and with f11 step into also

2954701
google-chrome	firefox
it s too easy to get focused on things that users won t notice the user likely has either firefox or else ie or else google-chrome but not all of them

2954704
mouseup	mousedown
how can i make this work only when i mousedown over #button and then stop at the last coordinates when i mouseup only over #button

2954709
post	put	post	get	put	get
get put post delete

2954741
verilog	hdl
the best would be to have an hdl source verilog for example for an arm core and create vcd files or other waveform formats

2954753
folder	directory
you would then unzip the directory on the server and scan the user s folder for any directory containing .jpg or .png or .gif files etc. and then import them into a table accordingly

2954772
nsdatecomponents	nscalendar
use nscalendar to get the nsdatecomponents you re interested in

2954793
getter	setter
why programmer set the variable as private then write getter and setter to access it

2954798
tiff	png
png seems to give the best speed file size performance for tiff images

2954811
getter	setter
providing getter and setter means that you have exact control over how variables get assigned or what gets returned etc

2954823
getter	setter
provide a getter if you want read access and provide a setter if you want write access

2954823
getter	setter
in that case you would provide both getter and setter but inside these property functions you would do more than just return - for example if you want to track the number of times an attribute is read by other programs during an object s life time

2954831
accessor	properties
c# calls it properties where in java it is accessor mutators

2954831
getter	setter
for me it makes sense to have getter and setter methods to encapsulate the classes so that no class can change the instance variables of another class

2954876
getter	setter
this can be be done if you only contract for the getter and setter methods

2954902
post	put
rfc 2616 specifies the semantic of the operations for post and put

2954902
post	put
however post should never put the new entity at the request url and put should always put any new entity at the request url

2954902
post	put
this relationship to the request url defines post as create and put as update

2954902
post	put
in particular where your approach breaks is that the url you use with the put is a representation of the transactional context that was created by the post not a representation of the new resource itself

2954903
client-side	server-side
sessions are made up of two components a client-side session id and server-side session data

2954919
client-side	server-side
sessions are a combination of a server-side session data and a client-side cookie with the client-side cookie containing nothing other than a reference to the correct data on the server

2954936
range	max	range	min	min	max
inside a subroutine to determine round graph start end values you could scale the actual min max values to always be between 1 and 10 then have a table to pick nice round values then unscale back to the correct range

2954949
getter	setter
for example one programmer writes public getter and setter around a private member variable

2954949
getter	setter
another programmer realizes that putting in public getter and setter around a private member variable is violating the spirit of encapsulation he sees the futility of the methods and decides to just make the member variable public

2954966
put	get
so isconnected will likely report true until a get put or inquire call is attempted and fails at which point qmgr will then report disconnected

2955007
public	protected
the solution is simple whenever you find a table difficult to use with these you just have to inherit from dataaccesslayer and redefine what you want to redefine so in dataaccesslayer you should only use protected and public modifiers and forget the private modifier

2955079
portrait	landscape
hello all i have my splash screen which i want to show in landscape mode and all other screen in portrait mode

2955084
portrait	landscape	switching	screens
but a warning it s probably worthwhile to tweak your splash screens so it is in the portrait orientation since it may be annoying to suggest to the user that your app likes landscape and then switching to portrait as soon as it actually starts

2955185
width	height
i have a table or a region and want to set it s width and height value to another div or region

2955218
textview	imageview
i have a listview in a custom arrayadapter that displays an icon imageview and a textview in each row

2955222
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
kaazing gateway supports all major browsers firefox version 1.5 and higher internet explorer version 5.5 and higher safari version 3.0 and higher opera version 9.5 and higher and google-chrome version 0.2 and higher

2955224
google-chrome	firefox
as for tools to measure request time you can either use google-chrome webkit s developer tools or firefox s firebug extension or measure request time in your app and send that metrics data back to your server in a deferred request for collection and analysis

2955227
draggable	droppable
i am new to using jquery and i just want to know how i can check whether a draggable object has been removed from the droppable object

2955230
spaces	delimiter
here the spaces delimiter presents a small problem

2955230
spaces	delimiter
the len function ignores spaces in its determination so i used the datalength function and also ensure that delimiter was declared as a varchar instead of a nvarchar

2955252
disk	ram
most are disk backed providing the very same consistency as a normal rdbms - only catch the entire dataset must fit into ram

2955270
argumentnullexception	argumentexception
advantages of reusing argumentnullexception or argumentoutofrangeexception rather than argumentexception or a custom exception type

2955270
argumentnullexception	argumentexception
argumentnullexception and argumentoutofrangeexception has a constructor that takes string paramname - so no need to generate a message like you would have to with argumentexception

2955314
google-chrome	firefox
for me in google-chrome onclick working with second click on select box where as in firefox ie its working fine for first click itself

2955369
put	get
why not get the message and put it into a view model along with your other data models

2955379
free	malloc
someone recently asked me the difference between a c++ standard operator new delete sizeof and function tan free malloc

2955384
children	parent
as you can see in this class source parent and also the children all have a different generic data type

2955398
punctuation	words
i want to put space between punctuation and other words in a sentence

2955429
listview	gridview
gridview like listview is for efficiently presenting scrolling unbounded data sets

2955436
profiling	instrumentation
for adding instrumentation roots to a profiling i need to write the method signature

2955519
.htaccess	httpd.conf
i have one more doubt about .htaccess is there a way i can enable mod_rewrite through any code code without directly editing httpd.conf file

2955525
hide	show
if it is important the method signatures should show it and not hide it wrapped in 2 other exceptions

2955572
izpack	onejar
and can onejar be created using izpack

2955574
.htaccess	httpd.conf
i have one more doubt about .htaccess is there a way i can enable mod_rewrite through any code code without directly editing httpd.conf file

2955574
.htaccess	httpd.conf
you place this line before any rewrite rules in your .htaccess which will switch on the rewrite engine - no httpd.conf change required

2955592
width	height
default t inherit nil stipple nil background #f7f9fa foreground #191919 inverse-video nil box nil strike-through nil overline nil underline nil slant normal weight normal height 98 width normal foundry unknown family dejavu sans mono

2955615
implements	modifiers
my next goal is to implements custom statements modifiers functions etc like for-loop but i don t really know if i should use another module that i don t know about

2955669
int	double
and even there it sometimes creates confusion such as having to cast one operand to double if you want a divsion of int values to yield fractional results

2955676
jms	jta
two examples of such technologies are jta the transaction manager and jca adapter for jms or database

2955688
post	get
you should be using post to pass variables instead of get

2955713
quicksort	mergesort
1- use a sorting algotithm like mergesort or quicksort has better performance with small inputs

2955762
submit	submission
3 ii have successfully created code to submit first two forms and after submission second form i am getting third form in my response in script

2955791
post	get
as to how to get in - read a few adverts for post in this area and look at the skills that they require

2955794
mako	genshi
also take a look at mako and genshi

2955884
google-chrome	firefox
so google-chrome firefox ie8 and even ie6 all work flawlessly but ie7 has some nasties

2955885
hide	show
if i try to hide the lblcountry and cmbcountry a white space is show between zip and practice fields

2955914
switching	screens
each time i switching between screens i save the input data from previous screens and dispose it

2955926
notepad++	textpad	notepad	textpad
i have played with textpad notepad++ kodomo edit and programmer s notepad 2 and found all of them lacking

2955968
inotifypropertychanged	icommand
it doesn t belong there - you might want to reuse the domain model to expose web services or a web site and inotifypropertychanged icommand properties and whatnot does not belong there

2955969
unsigned	short
in the format string means interpret everything as little endian and don t use native alignment h means unsigned short and i means unsigned int

2956008
directx	gdi
however microsoft considers windows forms as old technology and promotes wpf which is based on directx and not gdi

2956029
updatepanel	scriptmanager
i found the solution to this in the end - i should ve been using scriptmanager instead of page.clientscript.registerstartupscript - this works inside updatepanel s

2956040
debugdiag	w3wp	debugdiag	debugging
i ve tried to use debugdiag and iisstate to debugging the w3wp process but debugdiag is only available for post-dump analysis in x64 i m running on windows 7 x64 so the w3wp process is thus 64 bit and iisstat says the following when i try to run it

2956058
post	get
the same example works with get but not with post

2956195
put	get
i want to put reactive extensions for .net rx to good use and would like to get some input on doing some basic tasks

2956222
multiplying	add
so multiplying the old avg by n n+1 and add the new element divided by n+1

2956238
min	max
i m actually working on adding other aggregate functions min max etc. into it but since you only need the count function i think it s a pretty good option

2956266
mediator	service-locator
to use a mediator you typically require some service-locator as well

2956269
width	height
i try to setup ultramon with a really big width and height for my safari on windows

2956269
width	height
the problem is that the width and height seems to have a max value that i would like to change

2956269
width	height
i want ultramon not to change my width and height even if they are bigger than the screen resolution

2956290
post	get
if you are doing an ajax post to get this data i suggest using the server-side language to do it

2956292
width	height
when list rectangle added in mouse down event it s only get the values for height and width of the rectangle if use 0 0 e.x e.y and also rectangle always starts from top left corner not able to start the rectangle point where user likes and it s gets only x and y values if use e.x e.y 0 0

2956379
mouseover	mouseout
issue solved changed mouseover and mouseout events to be return true

2956386
hide	show
basically i m trying to grap the text from the title attribute in a link and show it in a paragaph in another div when a user hovers of the item and then hide it when the user moves away

2956390
post	get
ajax requests get round this by using javascript to send the post data through to the server and that doesn t need a page refresh

2956398
zlib	libpng
so my questions is how can i compile libpng and zlib for that instance into just static libraries and how can i include those in my projects

2956417
opera	safari
i m using selenium rc to do functional website testing and i ve recently experienced a mysterious issue with safari and opera

2956419
g++	gcc
the problem is the following error-message of the g++ gcc version 4.4.3 ubuntu 4.4.3-4ubuntu5

2956431
setinterval	settimeout
have a look at the settimeout or setinterval methods they allow you to execute a function after a specified number of milliseconds 1000ms 1second

2956432
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
edit - this also fails to work in safari and google-chrome - in other words it only seems to work in firefox

2956443
put	get
as you already showed in your second example you have to use a streamreader to get the content of the file and put it into the standardinput

2956452
innodb	myisam
also perhaps using myisam tables in contrast to innodb with referential integrity options usually gives better performance as there is no referential integrity overhead involved

2956492
appfuse	spring
info building appfuse spring mvc application

i tested myself in google-chrome ie safari mozilla and opera

2956578
client-side	server-side
it s worth saying because nobody else did yet that front-end refers to client-side executing code javascript css markup some other scripting technologies and things like flash back-end usually refers to server-side executing code c# php sql everything else...

2956589
equals	gethashcode
also you should take care about implementing gethashcode and equals there is a good explanation in the book essential c#

2956644
comparator	comparable
most places where you can specify a comparator also have a version without using a comparator at all in which case it uses the natural order it expects all objects to implement comparable and uses comparator

implements	extends
that you extends and implements to achieve a goal

2956879
hide	show
in this there is a very basic hide show of paragraphs

2956891

this has solved using the script component which will prepare the sql script then execute so in a single hit i could get the full result set as it is not possible with lookup to retrieve result set

2956897
gif	png
also it would only support jpeg png gif wbmp and gd2

2956951
put	get
to get such a beast to work i would put every group into it s own usercontrol

2956993
libzip	libpng
after that you should eliminate library dependencies between the libraries themselves this means you should link the output of some projects to another projects if your libpng library uses libzip it means you should first compile the libzip and link that output static library to your libpng project

2957046
super	self
the super class might choose to replace the self returned by +alloc with a different object

2957049
hash	md5
it converts the md5 hash to a string hexadecimal numbers of the least significan byte of the character

2957071
implements	extends
for instance in java if your module requires a method toxml to be implements in a bunch of classes originally defined in another module it s complicated because you can not write toxml somewhere else than the original class file which mean you can not extends the system without changing existing sources in smalltalk or other languages you can group method in extension which are not tied to a particular file

2957072
super	self
in most cases setting self to super init does nothing since super init will wind up returning self anyway

2957076
width	height
seems like i have to walk the list of div tags in an outer loop n and have an inner loop another n to compare against all other div tags and do a containment test position width height building a list of contained div tags

edit to compare the previous with the new md5 hash you can use memcmp

2957434
opera	firefox
but when user presses back button in opera firefox he observes fade out page with hourglass mouse cursor that is completely blocked

2957446
sorting	filtering
would it make sense then to remap this data to my own result object and ditch the response so i m storing 1-2 mb in memory for filtering and sorting rather than using the web-responses own object and using 2-4 or am i missing a point

2957456
accessor	properties
using the self.imagespath properties will retain the data you specified it as nonatomic retain - so it will stay around until you release it or assign anything else using the properties accessor self.imagespath ...

2957457

firefox	safari
it is a bit vague what you are after but display none hides the rows and does not save space on all ie firefox and as far as i know but i dont develop specifically for safari safari

2957694
width	height
of course every item would need a left and top property then and maybe also a width and height property

2957734
expander	togglebutton
since the togglebutton has a name expander in the default template you can find it and apply the verticalalignment you want

2957737
vxworks	rtos	vxworks	qnx	rtos	qnx
in those environments expect to see in-house or high-end commercial rtos such as vxworks integrity and qnx with code in c c++ or ada

2957786
button	checkbox
since it appears the criteria for creating the button is not based on repeater data separate checkbox list you could probably move the creation of the button into an event that will fire on postback as well

2957818
put	get
you ll get better throughput if you can put as many addresses as possible on the envelope

2957829
post	get
in order of priority these include user parameters set via setparam get parameters and finally post parameters

2957866
post	get
use post redirect get

2957866
post	get
that s why i suggest you use the post redirect get pattern that s very well supported in asp.net mvc

2957866
post	get
your controller actions should redirect to some get action after post has successfully completed as it is in your case

2957866
post	get
and if you display all previously entered data you can provide those in in the get action or transfer them from post to get action using tempdata dictionary

2958004
pipe	file-descriptor
the idea is to get file-descriptor 3 of a pipe | cat 0

2958006
swt	swing
a common databinding framework for swt is jface databinding i m sure something similiar exists for swing

2958036
int	double
instead of double mean it has to be int mean as the prototype defines

2958074
int	chars
if the type of the switch expression is sbyte byte short ushort int uint long ulong bool chars string or an enum-type or if it is the nullable type corresponding to one of these types then that is the governing type of the switch statement

2958074
int	chars
otherwise exactly one user-defined implicit conversion â 6.4 must exist from the type of the switch expression to one of the following possible governing types sbyte byte short ushort int uint long ulong chars string or a nullable type corresponding to one of those types

2958081
folder	directory

when you link there is no more information about the size of arguments and returning value and bad things happen like reading an int as a double

2958228
int	double
well in the struct there s a double and int can t be nan

2958308

you could replace the values in web.xml as part of the ant maven build process

2958341
onfocus	onblur
so my adding the class and onfocus and onblur attributes was the problem

2958355
kerberos	ntlm
another issue you might be encountering if your reporting server is on a different machine to your web server is the ntlm double-hop problem and you may need to configure kerberos in order to support credential delegation over multiple machines

2958396
strcpy	strncpy
using strncpy instead of strcpy is normally safer but here you alloc eachtime the right amount of memory needed to store inpoint into mpoint so i cant see what s the point

2958397
getter	setter
but if you make a getter and a setter then you may as well make the variable itself public

2958397
getter	setter
if you find yourself later in a position that you made the wrong choice then you must refactor your code from using the public variable into using the getter setter which may not be a problem

2958397
getter	setter
if you use getter and setter from the start you will reduce that risk in exchange for a little effort

client-side	server-side
my python team has been using dojo on the client-side for a few years now and we settled on cherrypy as our server-side about a year ago and are pretty pleased with it

2959051
django	turbogears
initially we looked at django and turbogears as well but we needed to do some things vis-a-vis user authentication db tuning and templating that didn t really fit well in the full stack frameworks so we ve rolled our own stack instead

2959051
client-side	server-side
as for why dojo and python go well together i can only speak for myself but they seem to have a similar feel to me so i can move from writing code on the server-side and client-side without having to make too much of a cognitive shift

2959055
int	double
btw the safe way to read half of a double as an int is

2959107

put	get
i realise you can create pgscript but it doesn t appear to be very good for example if i do the equivalent of above it doesn t put the single quotes around the value in x nor does it let me by doubling them up and you don t get a table out after - only text.

2959363
background-image	background-position
for rollovers you can make two images one for normal state one for hovered and swap between them using the css hover style to choose a different background image orâ better as it requires no preloading and reduces http requestsâ combine both images into one and use background-image background-position to display the right part of that image in each state as a background image

2959528
ant	maven
easy to do in ant can t do it in maven unless you use the antrun plugin which allows you to write ant code to handle issues that maven cannot handle without a full blown plugin

2959528
ant	maven
what i found is that ivy and ant can do most of the dependency checking that maven does without all the issues of writing and maintaining the poms

2959528
ant	maven
if you re not already using maven try ant with ivy first

2959531
afp	smb
when you are accessing files via smb or afp you are effectively using those as the file system and they are file systems that are not very rich in capabilities

2959531
afp	smb
unfortunately you cannot assume that all the capabilities of the actual file system on which the files are stored will be available via smb or afp

2959569
maven	pom.xml	ant	maven	ant	pom.xml
ant with ivy does the same dependency management maven does in fact it uses maven s whole dependency management infrastructure including the same url repositories but without all the pom.xml configuration mess

2959569
ant	maven
ant with ivy might be a way of handling the dependency issues for people who really don t want to use maven

int	double
there are classes in com.google.common.primitives such as int double floats etc

what is the way in which it doesn t work from an rss feed

2960398
accessor	properties
if you do not specify nonatomic then in a reference counted environment a synthesized get accessor for an object properties uses a lock and retains and autoreleases the returned valueâ the implementation will be similar to the following

2960398
accessor	properties
if you specify nonatomic then a synthesized accessor for an object properties simply returns the value directly

2960721
pop-up	dialog
you can use a non-modal dialog as the pop-up

2960732
width	height
and in your html markup make sure you define the height and width in the rel attribute of the a tag

2960741
hide	show
should i be giving the submenus a class so that i can hide then show them

2960750
jar	manifest.mf
for example the jar entry name for the manifest file is meta-inf manifest.mf and not meta-inf manifest.mf

2960752
implements	extends
if not i think you would have to extends the dialog class and implements your own

2960755
getter	setter
you could extend the button class maybe call it a percentbutton whatever and give it a bindable property call it _pctwidth say give it a public getter and a public setter and in your setter you do this

2960928
post	get
while get requests are limited in their length post requests are not

2960928
post	get
some scripts don t care whether their data comes from a get or a post so you might consider having javascript post a form to the iframe on page load

2960929
serializable	deserialization
it is better to think about serializable deserialization subsystem for your program

2960945
jquery	jqmodal
i m having some trouble with jquery and jqmodal and i hope you are able to help since i ve been struggling for hours

this also relates to the zlib configuration you were asking about and client performance measurement tools like yslow and pagespeed

2960962
width	height
you really want to translate the painter so that the it starts painting at the topleft of the rectangle and then extends for the specified width and height

2961019
antivirus	mcafee
it would have security ramifications such as presenting a fake mcafee antivirus dialog to folks who had mcafee antivirus installed

2961025

2961228
google-chrome	firefox
this stuff works perfectly in google-chrome and firefox

2961273
int	boolean
it is though in nearly all cases the old dinosaur computers that had special addresses can be neglected because a null pointer can also be used as a boolean and by using an int of suffisent size to hold the pointer value it is easier to represent in the common isas of modern cpu

2961301
google-chrome	firefox
what i m wondering is if there is any way to do the same thing with firefox or google-chrome

2961305
invokerequired	begininvoke
you can accomplish this using the invokerequired property and begininvoke method found on the form or control object

2961350
comparator	comparable
i ve got a class accumulator that implements the comparable comparator method and i m trying to put these objects into a hashset

2961413
post	get
althrough you pick up all parameters at once post and get through request

viewdidappear	viewwillappear
all you need to do is call viewwillappear and viewdidappear

2961488
put	get
i need and put it in a variable but for some reason i get a zero as a result

2961490
postgresql	mysql
mysql is popular so is sqlite and postgresql

2961525
postgresql	mysql
you can just change mysql to postgresql or sqlite in your settings.py

2961547
wikitext	mediawiki
one option would be mylyn wikitext which is used by some eclipse projects to generate eclipse documentation from the eclipse wiki which is based on mediawiki

2961555
hash	md5
1 i am planning to hash passwords using md5 before i write them to the database or to authenticate the user but i realize that to do that i would have to transmit the password in plaintext to the server and hash it there

2961555
post	get

2961584
post	get
isn t post just as transparent as get just not in the address bar

2961584
post	get
using post and get for the right things is not a matter of security

2961647
post	get
the reason for the difference between get and post is the way the browsers interpret the requests

2961647
post	get
if you had a page that logged out the user in a get request someone could embed an image tag into a comment or forum post like and the browser would be forced to execute the logout operation

2961707
pop-up	dialog
the only difference is that annoying dialog pop-up everytime i start to debug my application

2961711
for-loop	loops
you could use a for-loop to loops through printing fields 2 through nf built-in variable that represents the number of fields on the line

2961761
ubuntu	linux
i have a programming running on linux ubuntu which tries to connect to a server port using tcp

2961774
chi-squared	kolmogorov-smirnov
donald knuth describes a couple popular goodness of fit tests in seminumerical algorithms the chi-squared test and the kolmogorov-smirnov test

2961788
post	get
got it the simplest implementation can be http get post using name-value nv pairs

2961852
ienumerable	ilist
i notice this does not exist on ilist or ienumerable what was the thinking here

2961873
cos	sin
the equation of the ellipse is then given by a cos t b sin t

2961873
cos	sin
|| a cos t b sin t - c || 2

2961877
folder	directory
the system.io.fileinfo class should still work on a unc path myserver some folder provided the user running the application has appropriate permissions to access that directory

2961905
width	height
so div is a box block with height and width span is inline

2961909
jar	war
i found mention to how to add the subversion revision to manifests in jar files but not with war files

2961923
opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari
but they are part of the css 3.0 specification and only supported by a limited number of browsers namely firefox 1.5 opera and safari

2962037
idictionary	icollection
now there are obvious cons to this approach as well the most glaring is the fact that the keys and value and anything else that returns icollection on idictionary has to return a new array for every call

2962038
vbscript	jscript
vbscript jscript

2962051
dns	spf
-i ve added spf domain keys and a ptr record to the dns

2962090
inherited	subclassing
it s also not a completely object oriented language however it s a hybrid one that supports most object oriented features but some such as inherited and polymorphism are a bit awkward to deal with in c++ - for example you have to define methods as virtual in base classes in order to be allowed to redefine them in subclassing - sort of like predicting the future - will this method every be desired to be redefined by an inheritor

2962098
multiplying	division
now calculate by division -- you ll never have to multiplying by 0.001 or 1000 since you re always converting in the same direction

2962153
windows	wow64
does anyone know of a windows api that will tell you given a process id whether the application is running under wow64

2962164
width	height
one minor point the height and width properties of elements should be numbers rather than strings

2962222
ssl	https
one more thing is tht recently we implemented ssl and from http we move to https with name change in url also bfeore it was and now its

2962227
serializable	deserialization
it has only one method for serializable and assumes a specific constructor for deserialization as constructor cannot part of an interface

2962279
mouseover	mouseout
if apple had treated fingerdown as the counterpart to mouseover then the tooltip could be displayed upon fingerdown and made invisible again on fingerup which would be the counterpart to mouseout

2962280
hide	show
i am using some inline c# in the aspx to show hide certain controls depending on a user s role

2962280
hide	show
i would use the visible property but there are so many of them i just decided to do inline c# to show and hide i know not best practice but bear with me for a second

2962302
opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari
and its same across firefox ie opera safari and chrome...

2962312
getter	setter
getter and setter and it does not care about properties

2962329
google-chrome	firefox
works in at least firefox and google-chrome

2962416
put	get
i put if in italics because you should pretty much always use .val to get or set a value on an ...same goes for and

2962441
comparator	comparable
you must implement equals hashcode and after implementing the comparable interface comparator

2962448
comparator	comparable
in either case the item to be sorted should implement the comparable interface with a proper comparator method

2962492
tiff	png
lzw-compressed tiff offers no major advantages over png other than 16-bit-per-pixel support which you probably don t need

2962518
maven	pom.xml
the build number maven plugin sets the build number in the property that you can then use in your pom.xml

2962518
jar	war
i found mention to how to add the subversion revision to manifests in jar files but not with war files

2962529
min	max
my min and max latitude and longitudes are coming back as incredibly low numbers that can t possibly be right

2962529
min	max
you can see the sql query commented out to know how i plan on using the min and max lat and long values

2962605
uiview	subviews
clearly this isn t the right way to be doing this not only because it s contrary to what the docs say but because it -always- displays both subviews completely ignoring some other code in my uiview that sets the hidden property of one of the views it ignores the z-ordering etc.

2962629
post	get
i want to post russian text on a cp1251 site using lwp useragent and get following results

2962629
post	get
this code actually solves the problem but i do not want to add the third request wrapper function alongside with get and post

2962630
min	max
i m trying to create a custom route like search result city p1 state p2 zip p3 min p4 max p5 bed p6 bath p7 cats p8 dogs p9 parking p10 where search is the controller and result the action p1-p10 are variables

2962654
width	height
s webmaster guides guidelines repeats several times that it is better to always put the width and height attribute of the img tag

2962654
width	height
one of the most obvious reason is that the elements in the page won t seem to be jumping around to a new location after every picture is loaded always setting the correct width height sure gets rid of this behavior

2962654
width	height
if we don t want to manually edit all these width height attributes

2962654
width	height
how do we automatically programmatically serve html pages where every img tag have their width height attribute correctly set as the best practice recommend

2962657
width	height
when the webapp starts up we re recursively crawling the entire exploded .war looking for every single picture file and determining their width height

2962657
width	height
later on every single time we re generating an img tag we re calling a method that gives up back that picture s width height

2962657
width	height
the only drawback is that the map lookup and width height attributes generation are performed at runtime

2962664
hex	binary
so a hex address like 1 22 333 aaaa b c d e needs to be converted to its 128 bit equivalent binary

2962683
folder	directory
i am running a script that walks a directory structure and generates new files in each folder in the directory

my data is in tabular format spaces delimiter and looks more or less like

2962702
unsigned	short
as for new code well there s so much example code out there using tchar that it may be easier to cut and paste and there is in some cases some friction between wchar as wchar_t and wchar as unsigned short

2962707
children	parent
it shows only the parent nodes task.name i couldn t figure out how to add children taskitems.name

2962709
width	height
.jsp and .html files have all their image width height set at build time

2962735
super	self
super and self pointing to the same memory and the major difference between them is method lookup order

2962738
children	parent
if you have multiple children within the parent and wish to leave no free space in the parent you should use

2962754
awt	swing
see painting in awt and swing for more about the clip rectangle

2962790
nswindow	nsimage
i notice that nswindow has this method and i m not a big fan of the nscolorwheel or nsimage background options but if they are the best willing to use

2962795
csla	.net
you could check some kind of unique identifier as previously mentioned or in the framework my company uses csla .net there is a boolean isnew field on our objects that when we create a new object the field is marked true

2962798
put	get
entities loaded by em.find are put and kept in the persistence context in memory to track changes so if you bulk load too much of them without precautions you ll just explode your memory and get oome

2962844
r5rs	r6rs
but the #lang r5rs and #lang r6rs don t do the same -- so these toplevel expressions are evaluated but never displayed

2962864
int	chars
the position here is an int so instead of comparing with chars 0 1 ... it should be compared with int

2962865
accessor	properties
edit for some reason the set accessor is hit only on the assetid properties and only the first time

swing	windowbuilder
editor eclipse via windowbuilder netbeans 5.0 non-free via swing gui builder aka matisse

2962877
folder	directory
if you haven t tried downloading the full scala package from scala-lang.org you should do so and then point tools scala platform platform folder at that directory

2962877
folder	directory
for instance on my laptop i have usr local lib scala-2.8 pointing at some place that i ve unzipped scala-2.8.0.rc2.zip and have set the platform folder directory to that link i m using 2.8 there obviously

2962904
filtering	grouping
seems if you don t execute getmembers recursively pass in false you get users and grouping and just need to filtering by structuralobjectclass

2962912
width	height
for example if you only wish to retrieve width height and length for a row you could use

2962930
post	get
this works great when editing a post but when creating a new post i get the following error

2962939
rss	feed
assuming my conditions for building a rss feed reader were i had to provide only a javascript snippet

2962978
uiview	calayer
a calayer represents a completely different thing from a uiview

2962997
aiff	riff
however before you do that be sure to check out the general purpose formats like aiff tiff iff and riff -- one might suit your need and there s no need to reinvent the wheel

2963001
uiview	subviews
adding a uinavigationcontroller as a subviews of uiview

2963040
pull	push
there is a server that has mercurial on it how do i clone my repository to a remote one such that other developers can access it and pull push code from to it

2963053
uiview	subviews
your subviews should have their frame initialized to the bounds of the parent uiview

2963063
client-side	server-side
advantage 3 stored procedures abstract or separate server-side functions from the client-side

2963102
for-loop	arrays
it returns a byte arrays of all the pixels which can be iterated much faster than a for-loop with a call to getpixel inside nested inside another for-loop

2963102
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
unfortunately bytearrays are as their name implies 1 dimensional arrays of bytes so iterating each pixel 4 bytes requires using a for-loop not a foreach loops

2963108
converter	multibinding
if countries exists in address or some other viewmodel object you change your converter to implement imultivalueconverter instead of ivalueconverter and then use a multibinding to pass both countrycode and countries exposed as a property

2963126
post	get
if you could post some code it would be easier to get a more definitive answer

2963127
jobs	cron
cron jobs are only triggered only based on time while gearman functions are triggered by calls by other applications

2963211
implements	extends
assuming newframe extends jframe or frame you cannot do it via inheritance as java only supports single implementation inheritance extends and multiple interface inheritance implements

2963249
getter	setter	mutators	setter	mutators	getter
it only has accessor and mutators methods fancy names for getter and setter methods

2963250
pull	push
i made changes on one machine committed them and attempted to push them to the remote repository but i forgot to first do a pull to get the latest code first

2963250
pull	push
the push gave me a few lines of output suggesting i may have forgotten to pull first true

2963260
emacs	textmate
edit i m aware i can update the interval at which chrome reloads extensions which is a half-way solution but i d rather either making my editor emacs or textmate trigger on-save a reload or asking chrome to monitor the directory for changes

2963271
post	get
if you can switch from post to get you could then check query_string

2963299
portrait	landscape
in the landscape mode it is displayed thin it s height is smaller than in the portrait mode

2963355
config	ini
if you are worried about parsing time you could put those config in the php ini load path - this pre-parses all of the vars you need but you ll need to restart apache to load any changes

2963360
getter	setter
it allows you to either use getter and setter annotations which will provide getblah and setblah methods

2963360
equals	tostring	tostring	getter	getter	setter
or you can just use data and it will automatically implement your hashcode equals tostring and getter methods along with setter on non-final fields

2963417
superclass	subclassing
i have a situation where my subclassing is not seeing the superclass instance variable x

punctuation	words
entries with words that are longer than x characters in this case 25 with no punctuation or spaces will cause the html on a printed a4 page to not wrap properly and therefore not to confrom to certain sizes correctly pushing the margins off

2963491
factors	mean
by the term subquery factors do you really mean re factors using a subquery

2963505
swt	swing
i d recommend you build a browser in java with swing or swt

2963505
google-chrome	firefox
i recently downloaded the code for firefox or google-chrome and this seems like a much more difficult place to start

2963606
ienumerable	iqueryable
the problem you re facing is deferred execution you should be able to find a lot of information on this but basically none of the code s being executed until you actually try to read data from the iqueryable convert it to an ienumerable or a list or other similar operations

2963626
int	boolean
you can provide more constructor overloads but obviously the number would explode as the number of parameters grow and you may even have multiple boolean and int arguments which would really make a mess out of things

2963626
superclass	subclassing
the superclass constructor runs before the subclassing constructor so the overriding method in the subclassing will be invoked before the subclassing constructor has run

2963736
free	malloc
the default memory allocator in libc is not good for multi-threaded applications when a concurrent malloc or free operation occurs frequently especially for multi-threaded c++ applications

2963736
free	malloc
when the default libc allocator is used the heap is protected by a single heap-lock causing the default allocator not to be scalable for multi-threaded applications due to heavy lock contentions during malloc or free operations

2963760
public	protected
another scenario where you would want to add an empty parameter-less constructor is if you want to change its access modifier from public to something else private protected or internal

2963812
kerberos	ntlm
this is because the backend system only supports kerberos iwa but the delegation for some reason - even though the incoming request is kerberos authenticated - converts the authentication to ntlm before forwaring to the backend system

2963817
getter	setter
synthesized properties not only synthesize the getter and setter they also synthesize the ivar if one is not declared

2963817
accessor	ivar	ivar	subclassing
you need to write explicit accessor in the subclassing and access the protected ivar via the self- myivar syntax

2963853
post	put
if you put the link in more than once you risk inconsistencies but then again you d have to post the specs for me to see what you want...

2963859
super	self
what is the point of self super

2963859
super	self
super and self pointing to the same

2963873
getter	setter
you can also use the explicit getter setter attributes to access even the private ivars of the base class

2963873
getter	setter
property assign getter intvar setter intvar int avar

2963885
getter	setter
java properties without getter and setter

2963891
getter	setter
then write functions to manipulate the car setter getter ... and put them in the same .c file as where the struct is defined

2963894
superclass	subclassing
the reason though is because allowing a subclassing to synthesize access to a superclass s internal state would quite explicitly break encapsulation

2963894
getter	setter
if a subclass needs to customize access do so with care by overriding the getter setter and preferably calling the super to actually get set the value

2963911
stdout	fflush
in most cases this means that stdout will be fully buffered instead of line buffered its only line buffered if stdout is a terminal so stuff that is output generally won t actually be output until you do an explicit fflush

2964174
fortran	ada
fortran java and ada

put	get
you can use either rand or random to get an arbitrary random value then you can take the result of that and mod it by the size of the range and then add the start offset to put it within the desired range

2964187
folder	directory
another option would be to put a directory watch via filesystemwatcher on the fonts folder and automatically re-scan it

2964193
mp4	webm
in the same directory i got all 3 videofiles mp4 webm ogv

2964248
min	max
i ve had a couple of ideas one being pure brute-force involving performing a 3-dimensional loop ranging from 0..359 either in steps of 1 or more depending on results speed requirements on the set of vertices measuring the difference between the min max on both x y axis storing the highest results rotation pairs and using the most effective pair

2964277
put	get
this is kind of oddly worded but the gist is that any get operation whose onset is after some put operation s return is guaranteed to see the results of that put

bottle	cherrypy	bottle	flask	flask	cherrypy
does anyone have any up and coming suggestions such as bobo nagare bottle flask denied cherrypy for a lover of webpy s good things

2964291

2964294
pascal	delphi
ð ++ builder s projects can have both c++ and pascal delphi code in the same project

unfortunately when uiscrollview detects a drag operation and cancels the touch touchesmoved and touchesended are not called even for the uiscrollview subclass anymore

2964357
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
looks like whatever uiscrollview is doing is not initiated from touchesbegan touchesmoved but instead it gets some notifications about the touches way before that

2964368
telerik	componentart
i have seen demos of componentart s and telerik s toolsets

2964378

speaking from personal experience only we moved from mysql solely because our production system heroku is running postgresql

2964378
postgresql	mysql
another couple of nice things postgresql has over mysql

2964378
postgresql	mysql
in summary postgresql is like bricks mortar where mysql is lego

2964397
pull	push
how to set up a normal repository is described here -- but how do you set up a team repository that everybody can pull and push from and to

2964419

ienumerable icollection ilist idictionary

2964518
getter	setter
c# property is basically java getter and setter in one

2964525
getter	setter
this means that for me every class in java that is not a data structure has getter and setter for its fields that need to be accessible

2964529
post	get
if you still want to have people manually review post or if you want to get a large number of post manually rated in order to have a sufficiently large labeled dataset for training your machine learning algorithm you might be interested in mechanical turk which allows you to leverage a very large number of people really really cheaply

2964538

i tried to upgrade to dojo 1.4.x i tried several minor versioning

2964637
put	get
what i d like to do is to get first 3 items along with all the tags in between and put it into another file

2964668
getter	setter
if all the operations are completely internal then getsomething is okay even for complex implementation - the whole point of getter setter properties is to encapsulate implementation details and hide them even if in the future they change to be something complex

2964691
avr	microcontroller
now i want to make it a baseline firmware which can be used with similar more or less features configurable on different microcontroller like msp or avr etc

2964964
perforce	cvs
subversion cvs perforce and sourcesafe are not distributed

2965001
cvs	svn
cvs is quite old and if you re planning to use that you d best ignore it and use svn instead

2965001
bazaar	git
git is something that you can add to the list but it s support on windows is not as good as that of bazaar and mercurial

2965025
inherited	properties
like firebug it should take into account inherited shortcut properties and all the other nuances of css

2965028
pdfsharp	itextsharp
in order to read the contents of a pdf file you will need a 3rd party dll file like the above mentioned itextsharp or pdfsharp

2965033
folder	directory
a low tech way of solving it might be to install pdf printer driver as the default printer and remove all others and set it up to automatically write all the files to certain directory on the network and then write a tiny app on another computer to monitor that folder for changes and if any new pdfs appear just print them out to a real printer

2965043
postgresql	mysql
haven t made the switch myself but got bitten a few times by mysql s lack of transactional schema changes which apparently postgresql supports

2965170
children	parent
is there a way to delete parent and children without loading them or at least only load parent

2965237
hash	md5
the md5 and sha1 algorithms both produce 128-bit hash so if you need 64 you can just truncate

2965410
getter	setter
with interfaces i would be free to use getter or setter but having many empty setter

2965410
getter	setter
maybe i should not hardcode the strings in the getter and put the strings in a reesource file because of localization then i need a setter anywhere in every sub class xd

2965420
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
if i remove the dropdownlistfor and checkbox then all works fine

2965420
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
the issue with this is that it will overwrite any dropdownlistfor checkbox selections that the user has already made

2965420
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
when i look at examples in books or online nerddinner all the validation examples involve simple forms with textbox inputs and don t seems to show instances with multiple checkbox and dropdownlistfor

2965450
soappy	suds
i am not sure how to do this in soappy but i do know how to do it in suds

2965450
soappy	suds
suds does the same thing as soappy but it is newer and is still supported

2965481
getter	setter
if the property is not abstract then any base class may choose to only override the setter the getter or both

2965481
getter	setter	implements	modifiers
if you want your subclasses not to have access to your setter except for only a given subclass you can use the internal access modifiers only to the getter and implements classes that shouldn t have access to the setter in another assembly

2965532
ubuntu	centos
this is on centos 5 on ubuntu 10.04 i installed mono packages via apt-get and vb.net just works

2965597
ironruby	ironpython
ironruby ironpython

2965668
setinterval	settimeout
in general never pass a string to settimeout or setinterval if you can avoid it there are other side-effects besides being bad practice.

2965669
implements	extends
this view should extends surfaceview implements surfaceholder.callback

2965696

can you not persuade your servlet clients to use post instead of get

2965758
hudson	phpundercontrol
cruisecontrol + a plugin system or a clean-interfaced hudson + a port of phpundercontrol

2965790
hide	show
in infopath you can not conditionally show hide or otherwise programatically affect specific rows columns cells in a standard table

2965790
hide	show
your best bet is to just show hide the fields themselves that are inside the row

2965807
layoutparams	viewgroup
you need to set the layoutparams of the viewgroup the imageview is sitting in

2965880
google-chrome	safari
this works in all browsers except webkit based ones google-chrome and safari

2965889

2966264
content-length	content-type
setting the content-type and content-length are also important so that the browser knows what the server is sending and can predict how long the download may take

2966272
post	get
you ve mentioned php java and .net in your post - it s time to get a job somewhere you can learn how to do it commercially

2966291
srp	principles
for me the one way was to start with test driven development and that lends itself to good class design as well as the srp single responsibility principles

2966295
hash	salt
as for storing securely on the server once you ve receive the user s password the first time you should use a one-way hash like sha256 with a salt

2966302
versioning	upgrade
the api supports database versioning so you can apply schema changes during upgrade or in your case

2966306
queue	fifo
you want to use a queue object for fifo operations

2966314
hide	show
i ve used jquery s show and hide functions extensively in my code and just encountered a bit of a problem they work by changing the display attribute of the element to block or none respectively so that if you have somethin that has display inline and then hide and show it you ve changed its display to block which screws up the layout in a couple of cases

2966314
hide	show
i d like the change show and hide to remove or add this class instead of directly changing the display attribute so that if you add the hidden class and then remove it again ie hide and show something then it s back to exactly how it was to start off with since adding a class overrides the attributes rather than directly changing them

2966314
hide	show
something like this this is a little pseucodey as i don t know how to set the function up properly - let s assume that this is the object that show hide was called on

2966327
interbase	firebird
firebird interbase and microsoft sql server use quite different data types their sql language dialect is somewhat different and so forth

2966636
hide	show
specify slow as a parameter to show and hide

2966638
put	get
if it does region shouldn t be null i think except you put your handle in your view viewmodel of module and you hadn t get region manager and container on constructor

2966643
put	get
put and get will both overwrite

2966646
post	get
it happens with get and post

2966665

2966742
int	double
i need to write a util function in my c++cli app that converts a string to a double or float or int

2966755
addition	multiplication
if you walk along with a pointer you just do the math to do the walk typically just an addition no multiplication and then return the result because you ve already done the second step

2966763
width	height
currently i have a for-loop which extracts each c node from the xml and also it s attributes width height x y

2966764

freebsd	linux
after moving my mod_perl site from linux hosting to freebsd i have this error in the logfile

2966953
post	get
the problem is the urlrequest object in as3 only supports the get and post verbs

2966953
post	get
we re on a strict schedule and we d really rather not have to rewrite the whole api to just use get and post

2966963
int	double
in your case converting to int would mean invoking conversion to double which could and i suspect is less-efficient than plain conversion to int and evil rounding by your static_cast

2966965
put	get
2 and why does it get even slower when i put this in the inner loop

2967004
google-chrome	firefox
the latest versions of firefox ie and google-chrome on my windows vista box are all cutting the bottom off

changing the post to a get has not helped

2967125
rar	zip
in .htaccess every file zip rar txt ... is redirected to the tracker.php file because the stats

getter	setter
if you need to access the variables from another onject you use the getter and setter methods

2967306

2967371
google-chrome	safari
even though the w3 spec doesn t disallow padding in select boxes for whatever reason webkit browsers safari google-chrome don t support it

setting hide show styles for each isn t a realistic option

2967411
hide	show
simple solution hide the body until jquery is ready and has built the elements then show the body

hide	show
you can also use the slide effect in jqueryui and specify direction up and down for hide and show

2967501
glut	fltk
fltk has a partial glut simulation but it s partial enough that a program that makes heavy use of glut may not work with it in the first place

2967553
cruisecontrol	teamcity
i can t comment on cdash or teamcity but i think cruisecontrol and hudson both have their advantages

2967553
ant	maven	ant	cruisecontrol
cruisecontrol is very well suited to projects that build with ant or maven and has a much clearer ui if you have a large number of projects

2967581

maven	pom.xml
is there a way for the ci job to run a maven task or specify via the command line if a release or snapshot jar should be built without manually modifying the pom.xml

2967606
dbcontext	objectcontext
my example is not meant that way that the generated objectcontext or dbcontext in newer ef versions should be edited manually which would be overwritten with every model update from the database as ctorx pointed out but that the entitycontainer element in the edmx conceptualmodels section of the edmx file should be edited by adding the attribute - either manually in an xml editor or on the properties page of the designer surface where this option is available as well

2967635

2967703
inherited	properties
you can inherited this control and override the properties .itemheight as follows

2967736
inherited	subclassing
ibm s j9 jvm seems to have a few bugs and incompatibilities in the parse routine of dateformat which simpledateformat likely inherited because it is a subclassing of dateformat

2967769
put	get
2 and why does it get even slower when i put this in the inner loop

2967769
disk	ram
if your working set the data that you need to operate on does not fit into registers or cache you will have to pay a penalty to fetch it from ram or even worse disk

2967780
portrait	landscape
i noticed that when running on the actual ipad starting in landscape the app would start in portrait then maybe rotate to landscape

2967780
portrait	landscape
on the simulator starting in landscape the app would start in landscape then the simulator would rotate to portrait

2967790
x86	64bit

versioning	upgrade
with 5.12 you are supposed to just use cpan to install an upgrade versioning of a core module and it gets installed addtionally to the one shipped with the system but since the new one comes before the old one in the include path the new one gets loaded when you use require it

2968564
folder	dir
and did a dir s xamlpad.exe to see if the windows index service didn t get to that folder yet

2968590
uilabel	uibutton
the problem is that uibutton creates its own uilabel and you can t override that safely

2968590
uilabel	uibutton
so if you choose to use a uibutton your only option for changing the label s behavior from that of a standard uilabel is to actually change the uilabel class via categories

2968590
uicontrol	uibutton
alternatively you could write your own uicontrol and mimic the functionality of uibutton

2968590
uilabel	uibutton
edit - if that fontlabel class extends from uilabel it may be possible to extend uibutton and use method swizzling to force it to instantiate a fontlabel as its titlelabel

2968606
folder	directory
i finally got this to work by moving the entire config directory into the src folder

2968640

caanimation	calayer
calayer and caanimation can do something similar to this you can read about it here

2968949
getter	setter
you can via privileged functions which in turn call private variables and functions but then you are basically creating a crapload of getter and setter which might just be doubled in your prototype public methods

2968967
openfire	ejabberd
this requires a separate xmpp server like ejabberd or openfire

2969064
union	distinct
to keep the same semantics for the datastream column after switching to anthony s version you could do new hashset columnstoadd datastream but it might be easier faster to just add via concat or union or whatever the datastream string and then distinct the result and avoid the hashset creation might as well profile both

allocator	stl
c++ s stl standard template library comes with a lot of containers that handle allocator for you

2969178

kerberos	ntlm
could you please help me find out what is wrong with this code and or show me the other possible directions to solve this problem using ntlm or kerberos

in general a destructor should be either 1 public and virtual or 2 protected and non-virtual

2969492
hash	md5
after generating a similar md5 hash in c# it is absolutely vital that i create a similar hash string as the original python program or my whole application will fail

2969512
keydown	keyup
first of all why is your first if allowing keydown and keyup events to pass

2969588
hash	md5
therefore you should be able to pass an ascii string to the c# md5 library and get the same hash bytes as if you passed the string to the python md5 library

2969614
flyweight-pattern	singleton
one cool use of the singleton is when combined with the factory method can be used to create flyweight-pattern

2969621
int	chars
and as a good rule of thumb fundamental types int chars etc. and types with should be passed by value instead of const-reference because their size is small enough that copying will be faster than aliasing

2969630
int	chars
for small types like int or float or chars this doesn t worth the hassle since passing a reference is the same as passing an int

2969639
client-side	server-side
aside from what is going on in the flash platform a client-side platform coldfusion a server-side platform just released version 9 and has a roadmap out through version 11 and adobe just shipped a new ide for developing with the language cf builder

actualheight	actualwidth
relying on the actualheight and actualwidth to size you image then causes the squeezing effect you re seeing

2969800
haskell	scheme
this should begin to sound familiar to fans of some languages like scheme or ruby--because what it means is that double-negation corresponds to continuation-passing style and in fact the type i gave above is exactly the continuation monad in haskell

2969808

2969871
hash	salt
a salt is normally used for storing hash of passwords safely

2969871
hash	salt
to safely log into a third party website can send the userid salt hash from above and the salt that you used if it is not given

2969871
hash	salt
one option is to send the userid first to the website then let it respond with the salt and then send the hash password+salt back to the website

2969888
hash	salt
the third party developer is suggesting that we hash and salt the values

2969888
hash	salt
for any given plaintext you need to use the same salt or else the resulting hash will be different

2969888
hash	salt
so if you re going to use a random or generated salt you need to store it along with the password hash

2969903
post	put
i put it on the page that i would like the post to parse on

2969941
hash	salt
the whole point of a salt is to make attacks using what are called rainbow tables infeasible from a probabilistic point of view if you take a sufficiently big hash then it becomes effectively impossible to precompute the rainbow tables

2969941
hash	salt
you do hash a + salt and you store the hash and the salt the salt can be randomly picked

2969958
hash	salt
whoever is taking the client-supplied password during authentication hashing it and comparing it against the pre-hashed version needs the salt so that the password that the client supplies for authentication can be hash exactly the same as it was before

2970005
hash	salt
you authenticate the user in your program several answers seem to be addressing this issue and yes you should be storing your users passwords as salt hash but that s a whole nother issue and then upon authenticating them are passing some information to this third party app

2970005
hash	salt
if it needs to know the userid for instance then you can t hash salt it before submitting it because the app will never be able to get the original userid back

2970759
google-chrome	firefox
javascript whitespace characters being removed in google-chrome but not firefox

affinity	processors
the os tries to not switch one thread between cpus you can make it try harder setting the threads preferred processors or you can even lock it to single processors via affinity

2973633
cpu	processors	cpu	affinity	affinity	processors
basically the os scheduler assigns the threads via a very adaptive round-robin algorithm to any free processors core as the affinity allows if the previous processors isn t immediately available regardless of the processes which means multi-threaded processes can steal much more cpu power

2973633
affinity	processors
as for affinity you can set affinity masks per-thread or per-process which supersedes all process threads settings but the os enforces least one logical processors affiliated per thread you never end up with a zero mask

2973633
affinity	processors
you may not set a threads affinity to a processors outside the process affinity but you can further limit it

2973633
affinity	processors
but it will not jump to a processors outside its affinity mask which may lead to considerable delays

this way windows installer will make sure your dll is refcounted and upgrade only if needed provided you maintain increase versioning info in your dll

2974141
translation	localization
i don t think localization is an easy-to-automate thing anyway as text held in the database often results in schema changes to allow for multiple languages and web html often need restructuring to deal with truncated or wrapped label and button text because for example you ve translation into german or something

opera	firefox
first compare the output of this command in opera and for example firefox

2974504
put	get
to put a permanent performance hit on your system becasue this can reduce the use of indexes and becasue sending unneeded data over the network is costly and make it more likely that you will have unexpected problems as the database changes sometimes columns get added that you do not want the user to see for instance just to save less than a minute of development time is short-sighted and unprofessional

2974628
getter	setter
the notion of giving such a property an getter and setter is not supported however

2974628
getter	setter
maybe that s clear if you think about it a bit it wouldn t be a dynamic property anymore if you already know what the getter and setter should do

yacc	bison
i might be wrong but it looks like that there s no direct flex bison lex yacc port for c# .net so far

it would be simple via some getter and setter to prevent null from every making it into the list if they didn t belong in it

2974843
google-chrome	firefox
you might be having some problem elsewhere or there s an aggressive popup blocker that is blocking the new window because the following short example works perfectly in my browsers google-chrome and firefox

2974928
sorting	filtering
the datasets underneath use these commands anyway and you can edit control them yourself or leave it for the dataset to build from your schema but the dataset also gives you other fast benefits such as designer support change tracking binding filtering sorting etc

a small question hopefully with a simple answer i am using jquery draggable and droppable to place items into a dock

2975108
autoresetevent	manualresetevent
if you really absolutely positively must implement a more sophisticated synchronization model then i highly recommend you brush up on manualresetevent its cousin autoresetevent semaphore keyword lock and concurrent programming in general

2975115
gridview	sqldatasource
also a gridview is bound to the sqldatasource

2975115
gridview	sqldatasource
with the textbox control as the source of the sqldatasource parameter update of the gridview works for the original page load and all postbacks

2975115
gridview	sqldatasource
why doesn t the bound gridview get updated on postbacks when setting the sqldatasource parameter programmatically when there is no control source

2975116
x86	64bit
my understanding is that as a 32-bit app on a 64bit windows that environment variable will point to the 32-bit program files folder - eg c program files x86

2975132
draggable	droppable
represents the droppable the draggable

2975143
x86	64bit
it should exist and point to program files without the x86 when running a 32bit application on a 64bit windows

2975148
int	chars
if your problem is caused by tab chars preceding the int run the code through expand to turn tabs into spaces then your original expression will work

if you need more detailed information you will need to post any error messages you get from mysql

2975420

if you mean that you want the child panel arrangement to completely fill the center region there s not a simple way to do that other than calculating the inner dimensions of the region then assigning fixed height width to the child panels as you are now but based on your measurements

2975434
alloca	memset
calling other functions or allocating a moderate amount of memory with alloca and memset that area to 0 just before the call to fork would reveal if this is the case as the error would present itself earlier

hex	binary	octal	hex	octal	decimal	octal	binary
whether you interpret the number as binary decimal hex octal etc is up to you

2975583
octal	hex	octal	decimal
in c++ you have support for decimal hex and octal representations but they are all stored in the same way

2975622
filtering	grouping
the other thing to do would be to offer some type of categorization of the data so that they could filtering by category that would put people in probable grouping that would want all them all together

2975626
put	get
you re better off without it but at least this way you ll get something that sort of works and you won t waste time and effort on it that could be put to better purposes like improving your software

2975657
ubuntu	debian
if you are on ubuntu debian its enhanced variant byobu is rather nice too

2975667

like the user would drag something up down and i could just do an ajax call to the server with the id of the object that move and the new parent id of that object and then behind the scenes i could figure out how to reconnect things..maybe need more data than that...

2975723
ssl	https
ssl through https then it ll request

equals	gethashcode
hash collisions are correctly handled by - in that so long as an object implements gethashcode and equals correctly the appropriate instance will be returned from the dictionary

2975784
equals	gethashcode
what you should be concerned with is whether the types you are using for keys implement gethashcode and equals correctly

2975784
equals	gethashcode
the basic rules are that gethashcode must return the same value for the lifetime of the object and that equals must return true when two instances represent the same object

2975787
cos	sin
a look at the generated assembly code shows that _mm_set_ps loads the sin cos results into xmm0 then saves it to the memory address of

2976011
int	double
how do you divide two int and get a double or float answer in c

2976020
int	double
that s probably the same issue as i mentioned in the comment where you aren t using an explicit cast and you re getting an invalid value because a double is being read as an int

2976020
int	double
because the double was attempted to be read as an int

2976023
int	chars
i will do this by creating a chars array and have the program scan each collumn of an int value

2976033
button	checkbox
the behavior of the change event in javascript is a bit different for checkbox and radio button

2976033
hide	show
specifically i want to potentially hide or show certain divs depending on the radio button states

2976033
button	checkbox
aside it s because radio button seem to be handled differently than checkbox so i have a different radio-button-specific event

2976034
int	chars
suppose that the size of chars is one byte and the size of int and float is 4 bytes

2976072
int	chars
if nothing else just use an int array to begin with avoid casting from chars

2976072
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
but to loops through a 2d arrays you would just use a nested for-loop

2976143
switching	screens
the idea is that i ve drawn something on the window it gets temporarily switched to have an alpha of 1 255 for the drawing and then i switching it to full transparent mode alpha of 0 in order to interact with the desktop to be able to move the drawing around the screens on top of the desktop

2976184

implements	extends
i ve implements my own mapping handler extends defaultannotationhandlermapping but i m not sure how to use it

2976268

ciimage	cifilter
if i build the following code the compile step completes just fine but i get an error from the linker saying _objc_class_ _ciimage referenced from objc-class-ref-to-ciimage in appcontroller.o followed by a second error that looks identical except ciimage is replaced with cifilter followed by a statement that says symbol s not found

2976294
put	get
i put that import statement in because without it i get a compiler error on the first line of code that says no +filterwithname method found and i read somewhere that cocoa automatically includes ciimage.h but not cifilter.h

firefox seems to understand it and i believe google-chrome will as well but ie ignores it enitrely

2976436

affinity	processors
the start windows shell command in cmd.exe appears to be able to start a process with a chosen processors affinity rather than starting the process then setting the chosen processors affinity some small period of time after it has started

2976611
xslt	xquery
xpath 2.0 xquery 1.0 has the fn boolean function which does smart xml schema aware evaluation of boolean values. to determine if a value is true in xslt you have to explicitly check it

2976626
children	parent
first of all why would i need to put the prefix for the children if the parent already has it

2976626
children	parent
doesn t the parent namespace dictate the children nodes attribute namespaces

2976659
affinity	processors
i suspect what the start command does in this case is start the process suspended passes create_suspended when calling createprocess then sets the processors affinity then resumes the thread

2976659
affinity	processors
this way while the process exists without the process affinity having been set by the time it starts executing the processors affinity has been set so it only ever runs on the designated processors

2976674
getter	setter
personally if at all possible i dispense with the private variable and just use the getter and setter in the property

2976693
affinity	processors
i do not think that you can set processors affinity before starting the process because the first parameter of setprocessaffinitymask function is handle to the process

2976693
affinity	processors
on the other hand there is a program called imagecfg which allows to permanently set processors affinity for an executable but i am not sure how it works

post	get
i think the best way to get this question answered is to post some screenshots of your app

2977007
getter	setter
i have public getter and setter for the data members available in the class

2977007
getter	setter
now my question is if we have getter and setter for data members in our classes then what s the point in making those data members as private

2977007
getter	setter
but besides that having private members and so do their getter and setter doesn t seem to be of a logical one for me

2977007
getter	setter
or instead can we make all variables as public so that no need for getter and setter at all

2977007
getter	setter
i know having private members ensure data abstraction but having getter and setter actually lets access to those variables quite easily

2977013
children	parent
you could pull the comments into an associative array determine if they are a parent then attach children to the parent

2977016
getter	setter
getter and setter let you apply logic to the input output from the private members therefore controlling access to the data encapsulation to those who know their oo terms

2977016
getter	setter
keep in mind though that doesn t mean each and every private variable needs its own getter setter

2977016
getter	setter
neil brings up a good point in his banking example that sometimes getter setter just don t make sense

2977019
getter	setter
if you have getter and setter for each of your data items there is no point in making the data private

2977019
getter	setter
that s why having getter and setter for each of your data items is a bad idea

2977019
getter	setter
consider the std string class - it probably has one getter the size function and no setter at all

2977040
getter	setter
in the rather unlikely event that you do someday need logic in the getter or setter you can change the data type to a proxy class that overloads and or operator t where t whatever type you re using now to implement the necessary logic

2977040
getter	setter
using a getter or setter actually reduces the level of abstraction and exposes the implementation -- it requires client code to be aware that this particular class implements what is logically data as a pair of functions the getter and setter

2977045
getter	setter
there is no best practice with regard to using getter setter or having public members

2977045
getter	setter
personally getter setter are the lesser of two evils

2977045
getter	setter
because once you start making getter setter people stop designing objects with a critical eye toward what data should be visible and what data should not

2977045
getter	setter
it that natural interface involves exposing some internal properties using getter and setter so be it

2977045
getter	setter
but the important part is that you thought about it ahead of time and created the getter setter for a design justified reason

2977051
getter	setter
i also don t recommend that you have getter and setter for all of your data members

2977051
getter	setter
but don t make getter and setter for all of your members

2977051
getter	setter
if you expose everything through getter and setter you ve not improved anything over using public data

2977058
getter	setter
the return value also effects the use of getter and setter

2977059
getter	setter
on a strictly practical basis i d suggest you start by making all of your data members private and make their getter and setter private

2977059
getter	setter
as you find out what the rest of the world your l user community actually needs you can expose the appropriate getter and or setter or write appropriately-controlled public accessors

2977059
getter	setter
with getter and setter this is easy

2977063
getter	setter
in this case getter and setter are good idea

2977072
getter	setter
aside from the encapsulation concerns which are reason enough it is very easy to set a breakpoint whenever the variable is set accessed when you have getter setter

2977094
google-chrome	firefox
this happens in firefox but not in google-chrome

2977152
getter	setter
i ve always thought that getter and setter are deliberately verbose in most programming languages specifically to make you think twice about using them - why does your caller need to know about the inner workings of your class should be the question at the front of your mind

2977172
getter	setter
getter and or setter methods possibly accessing a private data member

2977172
getter	setter
the getter setter approach does not even expose the fact that the property is implemented by a physical object

2977172
getter	setter
there might be no physical data member behind the getter setter pair

2977172
getter	setter
taking above into the account it is strange to see someone claim that a getter and setter pair is the same as a public data member

2977178
prng	random
urandom is a prng which self-seeds from random .

2977183
ssl	https
this works fine but if i then edit the uri to remove the s from https it still loads the page but without ssl

2977192
getter	setter
using getter and setter will allow you to modify the way that you give the values to the user

2977215

2977261
cvs	svn
we moved from a combination of svn and cvs

2977275
put	get
i m sure the original developer s intent was to avoid the infuriating nullreferenceexception bug resulting from attempting to access the logpath property of some logginglistener object -- in which case it probably just seemed most sensible to put the null check in the get since that s where the exception was thrown

2977282
accessor	properties
i personally don t like when properties changes assigned value in either get or set accessor

2977310
scheme	prolog
for the final project in a programming languages course i took we had to embed a prolog evaluator in scheme using continuations and macros

2977310

as of today the janus controls gridex do not work with vs 10 .net 3.5 .

2977437
addition	multiplication
the difference is that in the second pattern the concatenation x followed by y in xy has higher precedence than the choice either x or y in x|y like multiplication has higher precedence than addition so the pattern is equivalent to

2977443
maven	pom.xml
to achieve the desired behavior in my maven project on netbeans i set up a profile defining an environment variable in my project s pom.xml and modified the test file action in my project s properties to activate my new profile

2977448
width	margin
otherwise if they are explicitly set in the width padding and margin attributes it would be something like

2977449
keydown	keyup
it works though by using keyup keydown also produces the same strange result

2977459
post	get
notice that initally it was a post operation that was performed in the form and the pagination performs a get operation

2977459
post	get
i am trying to avoid sending the form field values via get because i fear that the data may exceed the maximum permissible value in the url as it is less secure than a post operation

2977459
post	get
so what can i do to retain the form values run the proper query and get back the relevant values irrespective of the number of times the same form may be processed by the same user in different browser tabs windows without using sessions given the restrictions on passing data via get and possibly losing them in post operations and be able to perform other activities on the page as well

maven	m2e
this is possible whether you are using m2e or the maven eclipse plugin and is actually the default behavior for both

2977546
put	get
but note that you cannot put the definitions after the display line -- this is an expression that uses their value so if you move the function definitions after it you ll get a runtime error

well whenever nhibernate loads an object from the database when isession.get id is called the set accessor of the mapped properties are used to put the data into the object

likewise the presence of touch input support in the device doesn t mean the user will use that method of input - perhaps the device supports mouse keyboard and touch input and the user prefers the mouse or some combination of the three input types

post	get
this means that when you do a get request to journey the index action is executes and when you do a post request the create action is executed

2980324
ssl	https
i m thinking that this could have something to do with the fact that on the server there is an ssl cert which the isp uses to provide a generic https address to your site

2980341
google-chrome	firefox
even firefox and google-chrome are accepted

2980349
cvs	svn
and on a side note don t confuse keeping directories in sync with version control and the other way around both often happen imho i don t know what you re trying to sync but a git svn cvs repo might be better

2980371
jstl	taglib
you normally use the jstl fmt taglib for this

2980371
jstl	taglib
to install jstl just drop jstl-1.2.jar in web-inf lib and to use the fmt taglib just declare it in top of jsp as per its documentation

2980389
profiling	benchmarking
however i must say that practically i d advise against doing any of the above until you test the app against prod server and benchmarking and find the slow points using benchmarking and profiling

2980428
google-chrome	firefox
the probles is that it works in firefox but not in google-chrome i mean everything works but it seems like the is not working because it doesnt get the first tab

2980445
tcpdf	fpdf
options would be fpdf if you feel like rewriting your whole html into blocks tcpdf if you feel a bit less masochistic which has some limited html css support

while i have not located the source of the error still looking i have verified this on ubuntu 9.04 running linux 2.6.34

2980483
webclient	webrequest
it can t use webrequest or webclient nor can it use asynchronous sockets

2980565
pkcs#12	pfx
you need to use one of the x509certificate2 constructors that are designed for pfx aka pkcs#12 files

2980570
getter	setter
you need to make your xslt generate static member variables instead of getter and setter

2980616
free	strdup
or you could split in the same way but use strdup to allocate new string buffers remember to call free

2980653
3-tier	n-tier
or is this totally wrong for n-tier 3-tier

2980698
children	parent
it ll become more fun if you want color of all layout s children to be affected by color of qvboxlayout s parent but i think that embedded dialogs demo from qt4 demo may give you an idea about how it can be done

2980737
addition	modulo
at any rate the sieve of eratosthenes performs no remainder modulo calculations only addition to move across a list in increments of p where p is the last prime to be discovered so far and crossing out

2980746
integer	unsigned	width	height
this might not be the case in your application but i have come across similar cases where a height or width of an object has been set to some unreasonable big number as the result of misuse of an unsigned integer in calculations for positioning height or width

2980746
integer	unsigned
i guess it is seldom a good idea to use an unsigned integer for stuff like x and y positions that can have negative values

2980752
post	get
it can handle get and post requests but there are other benefits as well

2980805
stringbuilder	stringwriter
i ve looked at several questions here including this one which comes closest stringwriter or stringbuilder but none in which the answers actually address the question of whether there s a reason to prefer one over the other for simple string assembly

2980839
int	chars
for most implementations when you assign an int to a chars the compiler generates code which accesses the low-order byte of the int and stores that in the chars

2980839
int	chars
in your example the command-line input would be stored in a variable larger than chars such as int and later assigned to chars truncating the bytes

2980852
stringbuilder	stringwriter
for a start a stringwriter uses a stringbuilder stringbuffer under the hood to hold the characters written to the stream

2980911
versioning	upgrade
you can use wix to help you create msi packages and this microsoft knowledge base article will give you a quick but complete rundown of how to initially deploy the package and how to upgrade it later when you have new versioning

2980934
free	malloc
you might be able to detect memory leak on tests by providing your own implementation of new delete malloc and free functions by adding memory tracking informations on allocation

2980974
inherited	properties
using vs var type you can probably avoid the need to actually inherited from the type and rather use aggregation for this proxy that way you will still have intelli-sense support and not need to make all the methods properties virtual

2980978
rss	feed
for example one of my tabs displays rss feed list after user clicks one of the rss feed it will switch to a view displaying a list of articles and after user clicks one of the titles a full article view will be displayed

using python and wsgiref.handlers i can get a single variable from a form with self.handler.request.get var_name but how do i iterate through all form variables be they from get and post

2981078

i m using google-chrome version 5.0.375.55 and firefox version 3.5.9 but i can t get the html5 code below to display a box

2981445
pyquery	lxml.html
i would choose python due to superior libxml2 bindings specifically things like lxml.html and pyquery

2981445
pyquery	lxml.html	pyquery	lxml
with any of these you get a truly superior html parser querying via xpath and with lxml.html and pyquery also built on lxml you get css selectors

2981468
width	height
where textureimage is a struct that has a height width and void data

2981471
implements	modifiers
in java you might see the same thing for example you could imagine a adapter class that implements the iterator interface and wraps an enumeration. the only difference is that in scala you can add the implicit modifiers to a declaration to tell the compiler to automatically insert calls to that method if it will make the code compile

2981476

are there also any advantages that one of the others jmock easymock mockito unitils powermockito + mockito easymock has over jmockit

2981480
playlists	autoplay
not sure whether it fulfills your exact requirement whether the feature can be combined with an autoplay setting but jwplayer supports xml playlists

2981535
getter	setter
i think you have to annotate the interface too with entity and we have to annotate transient on all getter and setter of interface

2981590
mp3	ogg
the decoding system is prepared for compressed audio decoding see the pcm decoder for example of how to write a decoder but there is currently no decoder for ogg mp3 or anything like that

there will undoubtedly be other dependencies that you need to install such as libpng and libjpeg

2981657
mockito	jmockit

although i have only experience with jmock easymock and basic knowledge with jmockit

2981663
hide	show
this is fairly simple if you add to each link you want to hide or show as follows

2981705
width	height
specifying explicit values for width and height attributes seems like a wrong idea - the button should calculate its dimensions based on its contents automagically but keep its width and height equal

2981712
direct3d	directx	direct3d	directdraw	directx	directdraw
maybe you want to use some opengl library or windows directdraw direct3d from directx in case you want to do some 3d stuff with your graphics

ant	ivyde
i have installed subclipse ant ivyde red5 plugin for eclipse i added java_home and java_version to environmental variables i also added java and ant to the windows path

2981800
queue	fifo
in my scenario reader and writer can use separate buffers big data chunks independently and then only accessing a shared fifo object like a queue should be synchronized

2981863
stdout	stderr
the first one is to run ghostscript on the commandline dos box the second one will open two gui windows one to render the output another one which is console-like and shows gs stdout stderr or takes your command input if you run gs in interactive mode

runs flawless in safari google-chrome firefox and the latest version of opera

2982007
width	height
problems can occur due to wrong format should be 320 width and 480 height yes that means you can see the status bar in your default.png or because you might have named the first file default.png which is wrong which worked in simulator because it seems to be case insensitive but then when it gets copied to iphone it won t be found cause it is case sensitive

2982037
getter	setter
if the reason you want a ref field is to make a getter and setter of another variable that s perfectly legal

2982040
svg	vml
raphaã l uses the svg w3c recommendation and vml as a base for creating graphics

google-chrome	firefox
i m trying to simply load a plain text file into a page at runtime using jquery- everything works fine in ie8 8.0.7600.16385 firefox 3.6.3 however in google-chrome 5.0.375.55 the data comes back as nothing- i get an empty alert box

2982195
width	height
i think you want to bind button s width to its height like this

2982208
recv	epoll
so it s likely more expensive than select or epoll and doing the read or recv yourself

2982220
put	get
when this new view is put in my xml layout i just get a blank screen

2982292
cos	sin
cos and sin take parameters in radians but you re giving them in degrees

2982312
entity-relationship	diagram
i use schemaspy to generate the entity-relationship diagram

2982327
width	height
you have both width and height set to fill_parent which means that the buttons and datepicker are off the screen

2982327
width	height
if you want the buttons to appear on top of the game engine view then you will have to either set the buttons as children of the game engine or you will have to set the height and width to values that will leave space for the buttons

2982342
width	height
and why the width height and border attributes do not work

2982342
width	height
i want to set the border to be 1 pixel with width 100 pixels and height 200 pixels

2982343
keyevent	onkeydown
you could try overriding the onkeydown keyevent method and change what happens for those keys

2982358
getter	setter
if i m right - this code enforces the property to be backed up by dependencyproperty which restricts it to be a simple property with a store from functional point of view not technically instead of being able to calculate the property value each time getter is called and setting other properties fields each time setter is called

2982362
width	height
divs don t have the width height border attributes

2982380
firefox	safari
firefox ie and safari

you ned to compare a chars and you are comparing an int

2982495
subtract	add
i need to take each table add up every deposit and withdraws per user then subtract the withdraws from the deposits

2982511

put	get
so if you try to put an input directly into a form without a container element and validate under xhtml 1.0 strict you get this warning

2982687
hash	md5
no problem just explicitly open the file openfile read the contents data.bytestring.lazy.hgetcontents perform the md5 hash let

2982722
int	chars
the correct version does int arithmetic on the chars which works as expected

2982730
mouseover	mouseout
i don t want to manually add a mouseout event to each link and i don t want code anywhere other than within the class and the mouseover event creating the class instance

2982733
int	chars
the reason that your code outputted a bunch of random chars is that strings are not int like most other data types but pointers

2982766
width	height
the scrollderid is the containing div with a set width and height

2982836
int	chars
it may be possible to shrink the resultant int a bit smaller with some dechex conversions but ultimately you ll only save a few chars

2982857
maven	m2e
if you use m2e to import maven projects into eclipse you won t have any problems with a maven-typical nested tree

2982857
children	parent
the typical nested structure has a top down hierarchy where the parent is doing the aggregation of the modules below it and the children are inheriting values from the parent

2982885
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in firefox but not in google-chrome and ie

2982889
subtraction	addition
you can also do everything using addition subtraction and operation

2982962
int	boolean
this turns your number into an array of boolean or int in the range 0 1 then we add functions to operate on those arrays

2982972
getter	setter
properties in objective-c have to be synthesized with the synthesize keyword to create the getter and setter methods

2982978
gmail	hotmail
most webmail clients will completely strip out any stylesheets which makes the print and forward statistics irrelevant for clients like gmail hotmail and yahoo

2982996
uiview	subviews
instead the piece should be a subclass of uiview which adds the image as a subviews to itself when it is init ed with a frame

2982996
uiview	subviews
you add it as a subviews to self because self inherits from uiview

2983012
glut	sdl
find the mouse s x and y coordinates using whatever function your windowing system glut or sdl has for that and use gluunproject to get the object coordinates that correspond to those window coordinates

2983099
filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	xfs	xfs	ntfs
although i myself have prior experience in implementing filesystems much simpler ones than ntfs xfs or ext2 i would not tackle this job

2983120
filesystems	xfs
but a recent filesystems failure btw never ever ever use xfs without a battery-backed hardware raid has me spooked and thinking of using a dvcs for all that

2983161
width	height
the size of the grid consists from width and height of number of diamonds

2983182
free	malloc
new and delete are said to be preprocessors while malloc and free are functions

2983185
free	malloc
new and delete are c++ operators like + etc. whereas malloc and free are c functions

2983202
children	parent
the owned one to many bidirectional relationship just means that the children have a reference to the parent

2983203
post	get
my requirements are to do post and get queries on a url and retrieve the result

2983206
int	double
javascript will cast all of its double values into signed 32-bit int to do the bitwise operations details here

2983227
portrait	landscape
i can t think of any screen based system that supports mixing portrait and landscape views so why should android

2983227
portrait	landscape
if all are set to sensor then they will all change if one is fixed to portrait or landscape then the others must follow and whoever sets it last wins

2983250
rss	feed
but in this specific case i actually need to generate the event which will be fired every time another running thread of my app wakes up and refreshes its list of news from an rss feed

2983271
apache	nginx
i d recommend doing this on apache nginx whatever you re using though

2983294
int	double
javascript represents all numbers as 64-bit double precision ieee 754 floating point numbers see the ecmascript spec section 8.5. all positive int up to 2 53 can be encoded precisely

2983294
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox google-chrome and ie i m getting the following

2983297
awt	swing	swt	swing
eclipse uses its own gui library called swt it doesn t use java s awt or swing and it needs some native non-java libraries for this

2983302
opencv	emgucv
then to process the captured images i m using a wrapper for opencv called emgucv that comes in both 32bit or 64bit flavors as well

2983302
opencv	emgucv
now being on vista64 i went for the 64bit versions of flycapture point grey s sdk and emgucv which includes opencv in its install hoping to maximize performance

2983315
udp	tcp
since i need confirmation that the clients received the information and don t want to build an ack structure for a udp connection i decided to use a tcp streaming method

2983322
put	get
i am trying to translate this code but i don t understand how to use the get put part of the code in another language like c++ or c#

2983346
int	chars
the first argument is that they are only safe for pods like int or chars passing a non-pod c++ type has undefined behaviour

2983357
put	get
get and put are simply used to read and write binary data from the file

2983367
children	parent
i didn t feel this rule before but it seems that a binary tree or any tree each node can have many children but children cannot point back to any parent then this data structure can be represented as 1 table in a database with each row having an id for itself and a parentid that points back to the parent node

2983396
post	get
this means i want to get the blog post from outside the wordpress installation using php and do a loop

2983397
hash	salt
at best you could resort to sending up a salt hash of the value along with the salt but even that in itself could be used to test guess values before actually submitting it

2983398
width	height
i set the width to wrap_content and height to fill_parent

2983398
width	height
in hierarchy viewer the width is 2 px and height is 120 px

2983402
rss	feed
yes you can use the rss feed of your blog

vb.net	vb6
i am upgrading my application from vb6 to vb.net

2983502
postgresql	mysql
mysql is reportedly not as good as postgresql for these kinds of workloads

2983509
put	get
if you put resource cleanup code in a java finalize method then it may get called at some indeterminate time in the future or never so is not recommended

2983527
children	parent
what i mean is when you move an element around the sortable parent its children the sortables skip around instead of smoothly animating to their new position which besides from being an eyesore can also make it a bit difficult to figure out what has moved where

2983547
width	height
the problem is that the stage size variables often take a few milliseconds to be set while the swf loads so if the code positioning the menu runs before they are initialized it will see a width and height of 0

2983599
ubuntu	linux
c language in linux ubuntu

2983620
vb.net	vb6
i think there should a control like databound list control of vb6 in vb.net windows form application too which can show up data from database

2983658
doc	rtf
if you want to commit such documents consider committing uncompressed variants - rtf instead of doc tex instead of pdf etc

2983658
doc	rtf
edit i just wanted to note that even rtf is horrible but not as horrible as doc

2983672
matlab	simulink
there is of course the possibility to use the mex compiler to generate c-code from matlab simulink models but we would like to avoid the associated license fees

2983704
hash	salt
i would recommend you hashing the passwords with salt and store the hash password and the salt into the database

2983708
ubuntu	linux
under windows it works well but on linux i only tried on ubuntu 10.4 so far the images aren t displayed

2983713

getter	setter
if you follow the rules and wrap your instance variables in getter and setter you ll find yourself rarely having to write retain or release

2983901
post	get
there are also plugins to get recent post

2983908
folder	directory
update it is strange -- i just tried to look at a project i cloned using mercurial the working directory not including the .hg folder is 126mb but the .hg folder is 239mb

2983938
ready	each
is there a way to keep control on when the whole each traversing is finished and ready

2983944
vb.net	vb6
i assume the same control in vb.net would be datagridview and i m fairly sure that you can probably make it look better than in vb6 but if you want really good looking ones you might want to look at thirdparty grid controls

2983953
free	malloc
don t throw calls to malloc and free all over your codebase

2983961
hash	salt
in either case it is also likely a salt hash is included which prevents the user from tampering with the cookie s data

2983979
cgpoint	cgrect
the myview.frame.origin gives you a cgpoint origin also a struct of the copied cgrect

2984125
ironruby	ironpython
would i be able to achieve those functionality with ironpython or ironruby

2984133
accessor	ivar	accessor	properties
there s not much to recommend one over the other except that the direct ivar access is slightly faster the properties version creates a temporary array and sends an accessor message to make the new condition create its copy of that array

2984133
profiling	instrumentation
you may want to use the property access version first then profiling your application using instrumentation to determine whether the overhead matters on hardware you care about

2984150
put	get
the service and page work fine when i test it locally from visual studio but when i put it on my staging server i get a timeoutexception

2984211
qpainter	qwidget
note that if i was using a custom qwidget instead then i would use qpainter setwindow and qpainter setviewport to create a custom mapping mode but i can t see how to do this using the graphics scene support

2984222
audiotoolbox	avfoundation
add the audiotoolbox and avfoundation frameworks to your project by right-cliking on frameworks - add - existing frameworks

2984238
for-loop	loops
the outer for-loop executes a constant number of times around 100 and the inner loops executes log2 n times

2984241
addition	multiplication
but if you use big integers for example that s not really ok anymore as addition and multiplication are no longer o 1

2984268
division	modulo
there are ways around this that actually allow use of all n slots and eliminate the division implicit in taking the index modulo n

2984286
children	parent
i have a control in my parent mdi form which i wish to be given the focus if all mdi children have closed

2984337
onfocus	onblur
you should probably use onfocus and onblur events in order to support keyboard users who tab through forms

2984396

2984528
width	height
how can i set the width and height for the items

2984538
dataoutputstream	bytearrayoutputstream
i thought of using a dataoutputstream to solve the data writing with writeint int i and and to be able to put that into a byte array i should use bytearrayoutputstream method tobytearray

2984554
dataoutputstream	bytearrayoutputstream
use the former case - wrap dataoutputstream around the bytearrayoutputstream

2984554
dataoutputstream	bytearrayoutputstream
when you are finish close or at least flush the dataoutputstream and then use the tobytearray method of the bytearrayoutputstream

2984556
hash	md5
btw i happen to be using a different md5 hash lib the difference is not significant

2984562
portrait	landscape
possibly related i ve noticed that the button in portrait mode is slow to disappear after rotating to landscape the button appears for a second after the rotation finishes

2984562
hide	show
perhaps there is a more efficient way to show hide the master view button

2984569
outputstream	inputstream
you could use a stream approach if you connect your outputstream to an inputstream through a pipedinputstream pipetoutputstream

2984573
dataoutputstream	bytearrayoutputstream
could you make a variable to hold on to the bytearrayoutputstream and pass it into the dataoutputstream

2984637
postgresql	mysql
rails uses sqlite3 by default though you can edit your database.yml file to use a different adaptor mysql postgresql etc. if you d like

2984669
hex	binary
you can use the ord function to get the ascii value and then decbin and dechex to convert it to binary and hex formats

2984679

junit	cactus
my guide is the apache cactus framework with junit and tomcat jboss etc.

2984862
.htaccess	httpd.conf
this goes in your root .htaccess but if you have access to httpd.conf that is better

2984879
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome at least the timeout starts from when the user clicks ok

2984885
stateless	stateful
anyway i ll assume you are using stateless session beans since you said i could use stateful beans which by definition are stateless

2984885
stateless	stateful
ps you should maybe rephrase your question and try to clearly distinguish concepts such as the http session session beans stateless stateful

2984930
put	get
i have put the following configuration in my web.config to get rid of the problem

2984941

2985014
post	get
i ve noticed three main ways python web frameworks deal request handing decorators controller classes with methods for individual requests and request classes with methods for get post

2985045
serializable	deserialization
something in the serializable deserialization seams not to work

2985067
integer	unsigned
typically when you build a custom protocol on the top of tcp ip you use a simple message format where first 4 bytes is an unsigned integer containing the message length and the rest is the message data

2985085
put	get
if you put the if statement at the top then when it executes there would not yet be anything defined with the name func so you would get an error

2985101
maven	pom.xml
i know my hibernate.reveng.xml is being read by hibernate3-maven-plugin as i experience maven errors whenever syntax errors appear in the file so pom.xml seems to be correct and hibernate.reveng.xml syntactically correct

2985147
implements	sealed
alternatively you can try and mock an interface that the sealed class implements that only your code consumes

2985156
vmware	virtualbox
the vm mentioned in here is not like in vmware or virtualbox it is more like java virtual machine jvm as well as python and ruby

2985180
profiler	yourkit
if you think you have a memory leak garbage collection not kicking in due to references not being released then a profiler such as yourkit may be of use

2985205
google-chrome	firefox
it s working in firefox but for some reason it s not working in ie and google-chrome strange combination

2985205
google-chrome	firefox
like i said the videos are changing perfectly in firefox but in ie and google-chrome nothing happens

2985222
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
for some reason in firefox only not in google-chrome opera or safari being on osx i haven t tried ie there s a conflict between yahoo css grids and swfobject

2985231
free	malloc
but if you malloc don t forget to free

2985241
apache	nginx
i ve read that using nginx as a reverse proxy allows running apache and nginx on the same box

2985243
postgresql	mysql
also as i learned today heroku offers postgresql instead of mysql for rails apps

2985245
wordpress	joomla
look at some of the sample sites for wordpress joomla etc

2985268
post	get
get or post this allows ioloop to

2985268
pylons	cherrypy
for example i wrote a methoddispatcher for tornado that makes it work more like pylons well i had cherrypy in mind when i wrote it

2985295
addition	multiplication
i d suggest selecting a chunk size dynamically for each multiplication in order to keep each column addition in memory

2985320
int	boolean
if you define setfoo int and setfoo int boolean there will be no property foo in your class

2985323
gtk	ncurses
for example i want to use qt gtk or even ncurses as a building block for my user interface for the same application

2985329
post	get
get and post are the two most common but there are several others including head

2985407
daemons	systemd
i m trying to write a perl script that will work better with kde s kwrited which as far as i can tell is connected to a pts and puts every line it receives through the kde systemd tray notifications with the title kde write daemons

2985415
min	max
group by id and picking the min max or first second by the date somehow

2985450
ubuntu	debian
both use debian packages and ubuntu is based on debian but is more user friendly

2985450
ubuntu	linux
i d recommend ubuntu if your new to linux on a desktop

2985451
ant	maven
this has the advantage that all the junit tools work seamlessly specifically ant maven most ide s and continuous integration tools

2985453
getter	setter
for instance you can generate getter setter like in lombok at compile-time or use a dynamic proxy that do that at run-time

2985456
ubuntu	debian
remember that ubuntu is based on debian so it works the same

2985463
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu is the more user-friendly of the two i think ubuntu is actually one of the most newbie-friendly linux distros so if you are new to linux ubuntu is the way to go

2985486
client-side	server-side
as shown in the example in msdn s button.onclientclick property page onclientclick will call client-side script while onclick will call the server-side script

2985497
min	max
group by id and picking the min max or first second by the date somehow

inherited is a properties of oo languages

2985528
wxruby	fxruby
i tried wxruby and fxruby but they are have no good examples to draw simple lines

2985533
ubuntu	debian
since ubuntu is based on debian development is almost exactly the same for both

2985533
ubuntu	debian
the fundamental difference is that debian follows a free software ideology while ubuntu sacrifices that purity for practicality when no free equivalent exists for important proprietary software

2985533
ubuntu	debian
if you choose debian you will have a choice of distribution series unstable testing that may get you newer releases of pre-packaged software a few months sooner than ubuntu

2985533
ubuntu	debian
the ubuntu bug reporting tracking system is far more user friendly than debian s

2985557
width	height
we want to keep the same height width ratio

2985557
gif	bmp	gif	png	bmp	png
if we can convert gif bmp jpg png to one standard format it would be greate

2985558
disk	ram
with 7 free hard disk your server is probably running out of space to page out memory from either your process or other processes hence it has to keep everything in ram and therefore you are unable to allocate additional memory more often than on the server with 50 free space

2985562
width	height
for example i want to crop 100x200px box from image or i want to make thumbnail with width or height not bigger then 300 width or 500 height pixels

2985576
pow	math.h
pow has been not used in this scope. although i have added math.h at the very beginning of the file

2985629
google-chrome	firefox
in testing here firefox and ie do not but google-chrome does send the referrer though this is inconsistent as well regardless of whether it s going to the same domain or not

2985637
rtp	sdp
time to analyze the response + time to open an rtp session + time to construct a response + time to construct sdp + time it takes the server to receive the message - the time it takes the 503 message to arrive to my uac isn t this cutting little close

2985641
mp3	flac	mp3	wav	mp3	ogg	wav	flac	wav	ogg	flac	ogg
i m looking for a good feature-rich library for reading metadata from various audio formats mp3 flac ogg wav etc.

2985649
mouse	keyboard
i m writing a bunch of scripts that present images serially 1 per second and require the user to make either a keyboard or mouse response

2985667
client-side	server-side
javascript is client-side while your controller and model are server-side

2985689
put	get
to get the results you want you could either put the data in the cell as a string in whatever format you choose or you could divide by 100.0 before you store the value in the cell

2985694
winpcap	pcap.net	winpcap	libpcap	libpcap	pcap.net
in pcap.net i use pcap_stats_ex but it s probably only available on winpcap and not on libpcap

2985704
mockito	jmock
jmock and mockito both work well

2985704
junit	testng
you ll need to use them in conjunction with a test framework such as junit or testng

2985706
hide	show
on a side note can i automatically hide the select statement that it generates and just show grid of results

2985713
draggable	droppable
i ve have multiple droppable divs which all have the same size and one draggable div

2985713
draggable	droppable
the draggable div is 3 times bigger than one droppable

2985713
draggable	droppable
when i drag the draggable div on the droppable divs i want to find which droppable has been affected

2985721
int	chars
i would like to allow the entering of int values only no floats no other chars

2985725

each line contains a set of int spaces comma semicolon or some non-numeric chars is the delimiter in the closed interval 0 r where r can be arbitrarily large

2985760
post	get
i should get all post which have no comments with specific tag

2985763
uiview	subviews
i have a catiledlayer that is used to display a pdf page this catiledlayer is the layer type of my uiview which is a subviews of a uiscrollview

2985778
disk	ram
the index in memory and on disk too takes 4 bytes per line of the textfile being indexed and performance should scale in a perfectly linear way so if you had about 100 million lines 4.4 gb i would expect about 4-5 minutes to build the index a minute to extract and print out three arbitrary lines and the 400 mb of ram taken for the index should not inconvenience even a small machine -- even my tiny slow laptop has 2gb after all

2985795
children	parent
as a practical solution i would build an inverted search tree with pointers from the children to the parent where each pointer is marked whether it is coming from a left or right child

2985797
subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	division	addition	division	multiplication	division	subtraction	addition	multiplication
basicly what i need for the program to do is to act a as simple fraction calculator for addition subtraction multiplication and division for the a single line of input for example

2985808
put	get
however when i put the require statement require sunlight in sunlight.rb in config initializers i get the following error

2985831
mousemove	mouseup
instead of just waiting for mousemove you can also wait for the mouseup event - in the first case you can continue moving and in the second case you can return from the loop and stop drag drop this is actually discussed later in the book in section 16.4.5

2985833
printf	strcpy
so rats will report every call to strcpy strcat printf but these can be safe if for instance you are just copying static text

2985898
subtract	add	multiplying	subtract	multiplying	add
one idea is to create four functions add subtract multiplying divide like this one

2985899
inherited	properties
to include a .vsprops file in a visual studio 2008 project one could right-click the project icon in the solution explorer panel choose properties go to the configuration properties | general section and modify the inherited project properties sheets properties to contain a list of .vsprops paths

2985899
inherited	properties
the inherited project properties sheets properties seems to have been removed

2985959
persistent	transient
although fetched properties are not live like itunes smart playlists they can be used to easily filter members of one or more relationships according to attributes persistent or transient of any object in the connected object graph

2985988
jsf	wicket	jsf	stripes	struts	wicket	struts	stripes	wicket	stripes
netbeans is just an ide and let you use whatever framework you want jsf 2.0 wicket struts 2 stripes spring mvc your own poison

if property is marked as abstract then neither it s getter and setter can have bodies

2986102
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the site works perfectly with google-chrome and safari but has some quirkiness in firefox ie and some of the other browsers

2986115
firefox	safari
here at the top right you can see the navigation to the site in ff3 win 7 firefox safari mac some menu items show 1 char on a seperate line to the rest of the menu item

2986116
width	height
but if that were the case then i d think width height and bpp would all be radically wrong and it wouldn t look as correct as it does

2986130
mapquest	directions
mapquest s directions api is http querystring based i m not sure if it s entirely restful

2986136
put	get
i can t get a page to display in the navigationplaceholder the placeholder i put in the white box but thats because the actual page is frontpage.aspx and not whateverisinthenavigationplaceholder.aspx

2986138
portrait	landscape
the following code works but my orientation is landscape and the view comes and goes in portrait

2986168
versioning	upgrade
so i upped the dimensions to about 50x50 randomly filled and ran it and i m still not seeing any performance upgrade with the threaded versioning

2986173
pop-up	dialog
it sounds like you don t actually want a spinner you re just using it for its pop-up dialog

2986173
pop-up	dialog
you can create your own simple pop-up dialog like spinner uses as the result of an add button click in your ui perhaps

2986200
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
working with firefox 3.6.3 google-chrome 5.0.375.55 opera 10.53

2986216
pull	push
it s an imperfect replacement for git s push it mirrors the local repo instead of merging it with the remote so make sure the local repo is up to date with git pull first

2986224
division	addition
the addition result is correct every time but the division value is wrong yet it is reading a and b correctly

2986251
unsigned	short
if you need types for holding non-negative integrals which are not used for the above mentioned purposes what s wrong with unsigned short unsigned int and unsigned long

2986252
post	get
is it possible to pass both the get and post parameters at the same time

2986252
post	get
in the script above only the post parameters get sent and the get query is ignored

2986263
google-chrome	firefox
finally figured out something that works in ie firefox and google-chrome

2986263
google-chrome	firefox
it seems a little unusual to do it this way but it works in ie8 firefox google-chrome so it sounds good to me

2986337
put	get
from semi-related examples online i put together the following service but get the error onkeydown is undefined for the type service

2986378
super	implements
it better than it will see it in a while since he started to use the app because a need fro it is rare because you implements a super duper merging logic that asks user only in very special cases.

2986384
width	height
what i really want to do is have a view that s maybe 70 of the width and height that lays over the normal view as a modal

2986397
inherited	subclassing
if you have control over all of the object types that you will be using dynamically another option would be to force them to inherited from a subclassing of the dynamicobject class that is tailored to not fail when a method that does not exist is invoked

2986432
width	height
i think that your tab container has been created successfully but you don t give it a size so it appears to be zero width and zero height

2986445
folder	directory
if you don t like the default installation directory you can install to a custom location instead and export a pythonpath environment variable whose value is the path of the installed package s parent folder

2986471
bazaar	git
pip lets you install files gives a url to the subversion git mercurial or bazaar repository

2986480
std	ostream
i use std ostream operator and a simple function that will quote a string if necessary

2986487
ssl	https
is it still not kosher to have a https page with images that are not accessed via ssl

2986496
tesseract	tessnet2
you could try the tessnet2 a .net 2.0 open source ocr assembly using tesseract engine

2986500
maven	pom.xml
but btw i am very wary of anything that uses maven because most people like spring who write the maven scripts and pom.xml don t have the expertise to write it in a way that would spew out messages and verbosity appropriately to make it easy for me to locate model errors

2986503
vim	emacs
programs like emacs and vim demand that you invest time and effort before they start paying off

2986508
hide	show
yeah i could open a window with a pink background show the thumbnail take a screenshot then hide this temporary window but thats a horrible user experience and a complete hack i would rather not have my name on

2986509
free	malloc
if i was making a high performance version i d look into caching some smaller sized arrays as malloc and free tend to be slow

2986528
uiview	subviews
i now get this runtime error when adding the subviews - uiview addsubview unrecognized selector sent to instance 0x470f070

2986545

2986674
getdate	dateadd	getdate	datepart	dateadd	datepart
saturday dateadd dd 7 - datepart dw getdate getdate

2986713
hide	show
i have gotten to the point where i can hide or show all s the obvious easy part but i am not sure how to go about targeting each since every website has different id s for them while still using the tag

2986717
versioning	upgrade
you may want to try increasing your versioning number to force an upgrade

2986732
range	max
so range 0 len temp 2 returns an array with the range like range start max steps

2986742
queue	fifo
probably what i d do is create a fifo queue like this

2986755
hide	show
the basics are that it s just a textinput control where you use the popupmanager to show hide a list object depending on the user action click typing etc...

2986794
postgresql	mysql
it looks like mysql uses concat postgresql || oracle concat or || t-sql +

2986797
norton	mcafee
so even if you get it working norton mcafee would be likely to block you - or block you in the future

2986840
sha	dsa
it was originally created by the nsa for secure dsa encryptions and then adopted by nist to maintain all aspects of the algorithm along with sha 2 and 3

2986847
post	get
it was not suitable to post this in the get variables and so i got around it this way

2986855
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
opera firefox and google-chrome all have a native string prototype trim function-

2986867
elf	dwarf
on elf dwarf platforms such as linux you can see what s there by executing

2986867
elf	dwarf
for elf dwarf pahole looks like a good place to start

2986929
dictionary	map
in a python program i m writing i ve compared using a for-loop and increment variables versus list comprehension with map itemgetter and len when counting entries in dictionary which are in a list

2986970
cpu	processors	cpu	affinity	affinity	processors
some operating systems have no sense of thread affinity - they don t care what processors a thread is running on - so when time comes to re-evaluate what resources are being used several times a second at least they ll move a thread process from one core cpu to another

2986988
mp3	wav
or convertion from mp3 wav to pcm

2987030
x86	mips
jvm bytecodes clr bytecodes x86 bytecode python bytecode mips bytecode arm bytecode .

2987058
jquery	scriptaculous
i am pretty sure the examples you have linked to use something like jquery or prototype scriptaculous to achieve the effect

2987092
hide	show
the navigation bar natively animates the table view up and down as it show and hide

2987113

as an alert from user width and height

2987249
try-catch	exception-handling
but if you are getting an exception-handling because you don t have access to some child folder in the tree you can avoid it by putting your code in an try-catch block

2987266
jar	war
i have a war and jar project in my eclipse-based jsf project

2987266
jar	war
the war project has all of my .xhtml files as well as the project s faces-config.xml my jar project has all of my faces related java code action beans managed beans custom converters etc.

2987283
gridview	rowdatabound
i m going to guess that the reason it doesn t work is because rowdatabound fires before the gridview actually gets the data

2987303
cos	sin
i can find rotation angle by the matrix cos î sin î -sin î cos î 0 0 but i could not get the exact coordinates of rotated textframe

2987326

2987424
queue	fifo
although i am not sure why you need to wait since i think the queue implementaion will pick the tasks in order of their submission ie it will be fifo and hence the tasks should get executed when you invoke msgqueue.get in the order of their submission

2987424
submit	submission
cant you directly make the thread to sleep post you submit the msg to the queue instead of submission the wait task to queue

2987740
post	get
not really a security issue an attacker can craft any get post request he wants anyway and even send it from a legitimate user s browser via csrf but a maintenance problem because accidentally a cookie value can overwrite a request parameter

interpolation	splines
you might also want to consider splines interpolation which could be more accurate

2988072
portrait	landscape
my application starts in the portrait mode and then eventually switches to the landscape one

2988072
portrait	landscape
what is strange is that when switching back from landscape to portrait mode onorientationchanged callback is called twice and what s even worse - the second call is dealing with bad context - findviewbyid method starts returning null

2988083
changeset	cherry-pick
if its some following commits that you aren t ready to port yet you can of course use rather than cherry-pick to retain the history cleanly - future merges are also smart about not duplicating commits changeset

embperl provides fdat hash which contains full set of form data passed via either post or get

2988224
post	get
fdat makes no distinction of whether the value originated in get s query string or form field via post

2988224
post	get
if you absolutely must have only the values from get s query_string here s a simple example of a function to get it - although why would you want to separate get from post data is escaping me at the moment

2988256
int	boolean
note that the add method is generically typed boolean add e o so in your case of set the add method will take a short whereas the remove method is not generically typed boolean remove object o so i - 1 autoboxes to a int

just setting request and connection in constructor and having getter setter for them

2988467
width	height
the ratio for width is 4.14 rw and the ratio for height is 4.17 rh

i might argue with carl regarding db4o the easiest database on the market since eloquera can do the same things from api perspective

2989144
equals	tostring
however this approach does not override tostring equals and so on so depending on your needs the first approach might still be better.

2989190
put	get
the error i get is a bad put request error code 400

2989293

for more information click here - but note that this is only supported by very few good browsers firefox safari - maybe opera - but no ie until some day ie9 comes...

2989461
subtract	add
however when you add or subtract a number from a pointer the compiler takes the size of the data into consideration thus in your case assuming the size of int is 4 bytes a+1 will be bigger than a by 4 because you move the pointer one integer ahead but a+1 would be bigger by 40 because you more the pointer one array of 10 integers ahead

2989478

i have a portrait app with a button when pressed video must play landscape

2989957
hide	show
what i wanted to see was what would happen if the socket receives data faster than the browser-side script handles it for instance receiving 2 requests per second after receiving which browser should show and hide a gif animation for half a second without interrupting it and if they try to modify the same array so i did a few tests

2989957
opera	firefox
in case of multiple functions inserting values into an array and a single one popping them and clearing their intervals when there is too much data in the said array it worked as if the browser uses a fifo method to handle when to execute those functions i don t know if different browsers handle this in different ways i used firefox and opera they won t interrupt the function which is being executed

2990217
hide	show
define the columns at design time then simply show hide the columns you actually need want the user to see

2990253

it s quite straight forward if you always hide show all rows

2990253
hide	show
more tricky if you show hide specific rows

firefox	safari
at first looking at my server logs made me believe it affected only firefox 3.6.3 but i ve found an example of safari being afflicted as well

to do this i need to iterate over the rows draw lines iterate over the columns calculate width height wrap the contents if contents do not fit on one line etc

2990730
getter	setter
by creating a class interface you avoid the need to write a bunch of getter and setter

2990730
getter	setter
if you really need to generate public getter and setter for all or even most of your attributes probably better is to just make it a struct then no such generation is needed

2990751
children	parent
you can t have a 2-way lists children in trees pointing to their parent etc

2990767
nfa	dfa
placed on the size of the nfa dfa needed to describe a regular language

2990767
nfa	dfa
provide a short-hand mechanism to specify what would otherwise lead to very large complex nfa dfa

2990767
nfa	dfa
an nfa dfa does not stack state information so cannot

2990870
post	get
the fact that c has high accuracy while accepting 80 of the post tells us that overall spam must be surprisingly low -- if spam overall was the same 40 as for a then c would have to accept half of it even if he was perfect on always accepting non-spam to get the overall 80 accept rate and that would be hardly high accuracy

2990874
filtering	grouping
these users belong to an spgroup which includes users who should not see this data so in this particular case i cannot filtering based off of grouping membership

2992380
keystore	jks
there is a private key that is installed on the server and a public certificate file was exported from the jks keystore file

i ve been looking at codeigniter although i know that kohana is a branch out

2992473
fflush	gets

everything looks as desired in firefox but google-chrome reveals my unknown blunder somewhere

2992725
google-chrome	firefox
any help on what s the problem that is causing google-chrome to not display like firefox

2992725
google-chrome	safari
incidentally explorer shows the tool tip as expected although i m getting a funky bottom margin issue below the names and safari has the same issue as google-chrome must be a webkit rendering setting that i need to accommodate for

i assume the qtip disappears on mouseout so no need to remove anything since it will be replaced on next mouseover

2992822
stdout	stderr
for non-interactive use it s often best to write stdout and stderr to log files

2992822
stdout	stderr
one way to do this is to write a wrapper script that checks for the underlying command logs the commandline redirects stdout and stderr and closes stdin if you want to be careful then execs the commandline

2992852
stdout	stderr
all its standard io stdin stdout stderr operations will be redirected to the parent process through three streams getoutputstream getinputstream geterrorstream

2992859
int	boolean
if you re using a language that supports boolean you should use the boolean not an int ie

2992859
int	boolean
there is really very little reason in most modern languages to ever use an int for a boolean operation

2992876
int	boolean
when using int as boolean i prefer to interpret them as follows false 0 true non-zero

2992884
int	boolean
in language where int that are not 0 represents the boolean value true and 0 false like c i will tend to use because it represents the same meaning as if int whereas represents more the int value being equal to 1 rather than the boolean true

2992884
int	boolean
in languages that support the boolean type always use it rather than int

2992896
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i found a pretty decent solution with html5media - but ran across an issue with a jquery dropdown falling behind the the swf object this only happens on firefox ie - works fine on safari google-chrome because it s loading mp4 instead of a swf object

a server-side controller would then handle the request appropriately and the client-side would know what data to expect when it returned

2993040
google-chrome	safari
for webkit browsers however google-chrome safari the search input is styled as a client created html wrapper for the internal webcore cocoa nssearchfield

2993065

these escape functions take care of any characters that might be malicious and you will still get your data in the same way you put it in there

2993094
free	realloc
changing the buffer size affects this issue in some strange ways - sometimes it crashes on the realloc and other times on the free

2993101
width	height
source image is 400w x 600h and thumbnail size needs to be 100w x 225h - the output image will be 100w x 225h and the images will be vertically centered with a width of 100 the maximum and height 150 with a top and bottom border of 37.5 pixels

2993133
free	realloc
the call to realloc here can potentially free the old buffer before returning the new one

2993178
setinterval	settimeout
rather than setinterval you could use settimeout and set it within your oncomplete handler within the ajaxfunction

2993189
pull	push
if i were in your position though i d keep the central code in one branch do my dev in another branch then have scripts which would push pull as appropriate

centos	linux
the environment it has to work on is centos with python 2.4 but i m testing on cygwin with python 2.5 so it could be that it fails on my machine but will work on the linux one the linux machine is very slow and this error is rare so i haven t been able to get it on there

2993488
post	put
this form has a post put action to search_set

2993488
put	get
at this point if the user simply hits enter on the location bar i get an error that says no action responded to show i am guessing because the url contains search_set which uses a put method and even though i have a search_show get action which simply reruns the search in the session or saved in the database does not get called

2993561
kerberos	ntlm
and why you should use kerberos all over if you can instead of ntlm

2993663
x86	64bit
as for any cpu versus x86 this is a problem only on a 64bit computer

2993663
x86	64bit
the solution is to build the application targeting x86 as that forces the jit compiler to generate 32-bit code even on a 64bit machine and thus ensures compatibility with the dll you wish to call

2993672
put	get
is the best technique to put a frame of some sort on the window then get the coordinates of that frame and draw into that rectangle

innodb	myisam
be sure you are running innodb tables and not the old isam or myisam tables - innodb has row level locks which is much more scalable

2993943
subtract	add
the problem is you can t add subtract integers from timestamp or timestamptz

2993943
subtract	add
you can either do as mark byers suggests and subtract an interval or use the date type which does allow you to add subtract integers

2993949
free	malloc
call every destructor and do a c style free if you are using malloc and placement new

2993996
for-loop	arrays
all of the suggestions have been helpful but since i can only mark one answer as the correct one i will give it to durandal for both suggesting arrays optimizations and being the only one to precalculate the for-loop header

2994005
bazaar	git
is that the normal practice just pushing the required libraries or is there a better way of added libraries to distributed version control like bazaar or git

2994013
free	calloc	free	malloc	calloc	malloc
with malloc calloc you have to call free or start a leak

2994062
ddms	adb
however whenever i start eclipse i get the error message failed to parse the output of adb version. in the console ddms pane the debug output reads

2994074

2994311
post	get
for each term get 5 post that are tagged with that term

2994324
awt	swing
behavior pure java design allows for a greater range of behavior for swing components since they are not limited by the native peers that awt uses

2994324
awt	swing
performance swing components are generally slower and buggier than awt due to both the fact that they are pure java and to video issues on various platforms

2994325
swt	swing
i would venture to say that there are far fewer swt apps than swing apps

2994358
vbo	normals

2994648
int	double
you could have a struct with a type field and an union field containing a string double bool and int

2994648
int	double
then you could write an operator ostream youtype overload which first reads the string from the ostream and tries to convert it to the most specific type 1 becomes an int 1.0 a double and so on .

2994658
button	checkbox
this is my selectall button code..on clicking this i am selecting all checkbox

the put works fine but the get accumulates in my opinion way to much cpu time

2995985
puts	gets
no gets and puts system calls please in the name of the lord

2996023
getter	setter
so you can access the array value into the another file so you need to set an array by setter method and where you want that array you just use getter method

2996026
stdout	stderr
be aware that if the bash script creates a lot of output you must use communicate or something similar to prevent stdout or stderr to become stuffed

2996040
int	double
you d have to explicitly define what types you re using it for and would have to typedef things like unsigned int or double complex or the token paste won t work

2996058
width	height
i am designing a website that has 100 width + height div containing a graphic overlaying the home page

2996142

2996377
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this works great with firefox 3.6.3 google-chrome can deal with it fine although not so fast as firefox but new safari gives a awful experience distorting all content if you do fast resizing

2996381
versioning	upgrade
so you have three options either upgrade your rails versioning or override the to_d method or just use bigdecimal.new 28.04 instead of to_d

2996399
google-chrome	firefox
i came up with the following idea which only works with firefox ie and google-chrome say nan

2996457
jdom	dom4j
any library like jdom or dom4j will allow you to do this

2996465
width	height
you can use .resize to get every time the width height actually changes like this

2996465
width	height
you can view a working demo here it takes the new height width values and updates them in the page for you to see

2996478
cos	sin
i highly doubt this approach impacts performance cos and sin are damn fast in our days

2996485

2996745
post	get
so instead of get use .ajax with http post option

2996752
inline	inlining
other things that could potentially improve speed at cost of readability inline sigmoid function manually the jit has a very tight limit for inlining and the function might be larger

2996764

2996887
stdout	stderr
to work for both stderr and stdout

2996887
stdout	stderr
being able to differentiate between stdout and stderr because i may want to display only one of the to the console or i could try to output stderr using a different color - this means that will not work

2996887
stdout	stderr
remark modifying the popen to use only one pipe is not allowed because in the real life i will want to do different things with stderr and stdout

2996890
firefox	safari
is there any way to disable browsers popups about long running scripts in firefox and safari directly from the website

2996943

2999058
nfa	dfa
the traditional way of constructing a dfa for a regular expression is to first build an nfa using thompson s algorithm

2999058
nfa	dfa
the algorithm works like usual where we simulate multiple runs of the nfa by making our dfa states correspond to subsets of the nfa states we could possibly be in

2999058
nfa	dfa
in the traditional algorithm a dfa state is an accept state if any of the nfa states was an accept state

2999067
hash	salt
i pass that salt to a login page and then use javascript to create a sha hash of the salt + password which is submitted rather than a plaintext password

you predefine all select and show hide and disable enable the other selects

2999228
hash	md5	hash	salt	salt	md5
best come up with your own one weave the salt and password to create a new string then hash as md5 password + salt is vulnerable to dictionary attack still

2999239
hash	salt
traditionally the salt is stored alongside with the hash password but non encrypted typically preappended for example in unix passwords

2999241
disk	ram
it fly on my home machine with an ssd but it s almost unusable on my work machine win7 4 gig ram but standard disk

2999247
hash	salt
using a unique salt for each user is so that if two users have the same password they won t get the same resultant hash

2999247
hash	salt
you then store the result of hashing the salt and password in the database hash salt + password along with the salt for each user

2999247
hash	salt
however if your database is compromised either due to someone gaining local access or via sql injection attacks then both the salt and final hash will be available which means a brute force attack on the users passwords would be trivial

2999247
hash	salt
so using hash hash salt + secret + password etc

2999247
hash	salt
when the user enters their password you can retrieve the salt and number-of-iterations from the db and the sitewide secret from a local file and validate that when you run the same number of iterations with the salt and password the resulting hash matches what you have stored

2999247
hash	salt
above i suggested hash hash salt + secret + password but equally it could be hash hash salt + hash secret + hash password

2999247
hash	salt
relying on the design of how you hash the password and salt together to provide security is called security through obscurity and should be avoided

2999255

vmware	bootcamp	parallels	bootcamp
that said i d recommend bootcamp and parallels vmware

2999930

3000108
navigationcontroller	pushviewcontroller
you are calling pushviewcontroller on detailviewcontroller this is calling it on navigationcontroller

3000157
vbscript	vb6
if you re willing to use vbscript rather than vb6 you might be able to just use the msscriptcontrol to run the commands rather than creating your own

3000202
google-chrome	firefox
the following v3 example does not allow the marker to move around tested in firefox and google-chrome

3000222
ant	maven
you might like to look into the documentation for a version control system one of subversion cvs git etc and for a build system for example in java there are ant and maven

3000266
ant	maven
even if you don t plan to use javac for development fix this issue because tools like ant or maven use it and it will cause problems in case you introduce them at some point

3000284
bazaar	git
bazaar my personal choice is similar and then git is the next nearest in terms of similarity but probably more popular than either at least atm

3000290
post	get
what configurations do i need to change or mappings to get area to still be related to post in my objects but not query it when i filter on areaid

3000392
cruisecontrol	teamcity
for continuous integration software there is teamcity for one also cruisecontrol and its .net counterpart are notable

3000403
post	get
based on your overall use case i d say that the best way to do this is to have the website that s referring to you pass a special post or get param whichever is appropriate

3000507
public	protected
with regards to usage using abstract on a class declaration but having no abstract members is the same as having the class public but using protected on its constructors

3000538

i want to pop-up a dialog box when a user checks the checkbox

3000546
post	get
how about using post instead of get

a recent post on the ie blog shows that as part of the effort to get consistent cross-browser html5 parsing conditional comments will not work in ie10 s rendering engine

3000595
post	get
make sure you re doing a post and not a get method

3000597
post	get
you can use post instead of a get although it wouldn t be bookmarkable not very seo friendy less friendly then a long url even

3000602
post	get
i am assuming it defaults to a get not a post

3000629
hash	salt
by contrast if you have a password hash or a salt password hash then you should use john the ripper to break it offline which is much faster

3000636
post	get
however if you need to do a post instead of a get to send the data perhaps something like the following

3000665
client-side	server-side
the server-side validation are for catching errors before they reach your database data-layer but also to protect against crackers anyone can work around the client-side validation if they want to so never trust data from the client

3000714
width	height
try removing the width and height settings and see whether it works better then

3000725

i ve created a htdocs folder which houses the index.php file in the kohana directory

3000907
stdout	stderr
when i run that wget command directly from the command-line and redirect stderr to a file something sane happens - the stdout will be the downloaded page the stderr will contain the info about opening the given page

3000907
stdout	stderr
i can see i ve simplified the code to the point where it s not clear why i want to use open3 but the general plan is that i wanted to stream stdout to another filtering program as i received it and then at the end i was going to read the stderr from both wget and the filtering program to determine what if anything went wrong

3000990
implements	extends
if you happen to be using a class that extends baseexpandablelistadapter then their is a default implements method you ll have to set the return boolean for

expression-blend	silverlight
when i place this control on my silverlight project using expression-blend i see the three properties listed in the miscellaneous section of the properties window as i would expect

3001035
bazaar	svn
if you want to be able to work with a dvcs and tfs i believe the best way is to install the svnbridge for tfs and the use bazaar which is afaik the only dvcs that easily integrates with svn and since your tfs now looks like a svn you magically get bazaar tfs integration

3001052
easyhook	detours
microsoft has the detours package that can help you out and codeplex has the easyhook that looks quite interesting

rtsp	upnp
i have the following xml code which i got by a upnp device and like to get the res value - the rtsp url

3001272
getter	setter
to be more specific all your members should be private and only used accessed from within the classes--also in general avoid setter and getter instead ask the class to do things for you

3001310
int	double
edit changed the usage to show it with double rather than int

3001312
g++	gcc
the easiest way is to have gcc g++ drive a separate link

3001317
rss	feed
i have a flex actionscript 3 application that displays rss feed in a text element

3001333
g++	gcc
r samuel klatchko has the best advice but if you really want to see what gcc g++ is linking in use the -v verbose option

3001379
post	get
you should in any way use the http post method since the data you can send in a get querystring is limited between 255 and 8k bytes depending on the client used

3001391
getter	setter	mutators	setter	mutators	getter
here s a more complete formal example of your scenario using conventional accessors mutators getter setter constructors and lists

google-chrome	firefox
this works great in google-chrome and ie but not in firefox

3001486
google-chrome	firefox
the reason it doesn t work in firefox but does in google-chrome and ie is

3001490
implements	extends
classes that extends abstract class a will return their instances with this method but i don t want to implements same method in all subclasses with a return this

3001516
superclass	subclassing
if a superclass knows about its subclassing this points to poor design

3001519
jar	manifest.mf
if you want to run your application by clicking on the jar you need to specify the main class in meta-inf manifest.mf file in the jar as it is described here

3001539
implements	extends
i think the conclusion here is you ll end up with a lot less code and a lot less headaches if you just declare the method abstract in the parent and implements it with new whateverclassimin in every class that extends it

3001540
superclass	subclassing
i m a bit rusty on my java but i believe that reflectively code executing in the superclass in this example class a will think it s part of the subclassing

3001545
hide	show
if you want to show and hide a window multiple times during the lifetime of an application and you don t want to reinstantiate the window each time you show it you can handle the closing event cancel it and call the hide method

3001555
width	height
given width height of the rectangle and x y of a point in the rectangle you can do this.

3001570
strncpy	strtok
on the list of standard library functions to avoid strncpy comes second on the list behind only gets though in fairness i have to point out that strtok is a close third

3001589
memcpy	strncpy
you may also want to consider using strncpy instead of memcpy

3001598
x86	64bit
i also looked in c program files x86 windows identity foundation and it s not in there or the 64bit program files folder

3001604
jar	manifest.mf
- just a hint as a third-party jar would not interfere with meta-inf manifest.mf in main jar

3001607
versioning	upgrade
this utility signs onto the server reads the versioning info and then applies the transform scripts from the next versioning in the database until it can find no more upgrade scripts in its sub folder

3001607
versioning	upgrade
this gives us the ability upgrade a database no matter how old it is to the current versioning

3001612
strcpy	strncpy
if you don t want to handle 0 manually use strcpy or strncpy instead

3001613
quartz.net	log4net
apparently quartz.net uses commons logging and that needs to be configured to point to my log4net settings

3001627
agile	sprint

3001657
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
is it advisable to use the web sql database which google-chrome and safari support not firefox though or wait for the browsers to implement the indexed database api

3001669
stdout	stderr
if chld_err is false or the same file descriptor as chld_out then stdout and stderr of the child are on the same filehandle b this means that an autovivified lexical cannot be used for the stderr filehandle b see synopsis .

3001680
integer	unsigned
cast the integer to unsigned

3001713
maven-antrun-plugin	appassembler
also the solutions provided include maven-antrun-plugin and appassembler plugin and i wonder if i could do it with out them.

imperative	declarative
elegant systems provide false 0 as a declarative synonym for the imperative fail 0

3001992
superclass	subclassing
my question is how can i get cstring to return the superclass class rather than the subclassing class

3001995
int	double
well as far as primitive int types go java doesnt handle over underflow at all for float and double the behaviour is different it will flush to + - infinity just as ieee-754 mandates

3001995
min	max
what you would do in place of the throw clauses depends on your applications requirements throw flush to min max or just log whatever

3001997
gwt	cssresource

3002234
preorder	postorder
void preorder int inorderorder int inostart int postorder int poststart int length

3002257
gwt	cssresource
there isn t a performance implication -- if you specify the css in the uibinder file the gwt compiler will create a cssresource dynamically based on the rules inlined in your .ui.xml file and use that

3002288
treelistview	objectlistview
i m using an treelistview a sub type of objectlistview in my current project

3002363

you can use the preprocessor to calculate an upper bound on the number of chars s required to hold the text form of an int type

3002371
subtract	add
for a detailed description of what s going on when you add subtract pointers see

3002382

disk	ram
before each test the disk cache was cleared and during each test there was enough and approximately the same amout of ram free to hold the cd iso twice in ram

3002500
daemons	systemd
save the upload content to a processing queue file on the file systemd records in a database and have the web server notify an external processor - either a custom daemons or an off the shelf scheduler like at for nix systemd

3002556

preorder	postorder
the last element in the postorder subarray is your new preorder root

3002658
preorder	inorder
the inorder array can be split in two on either side of the new preorder root

3002658
postorder	inorder
when calling the print_preorder function the inorder and postorder arrays will be the same size

3002658
put	get
now put down the computer get out a pen paper and think about the problem

post	get
what are the data type limitations of the post and get html form methods

3002729
post	get
to get php to parse a post in a way you ll find a tremendous timesaver i suggest you read this

3002734
post	get
post and get both submit strings to the server

3002750
post	get
i am not sure if you can set post options but as long as get is acceptable you could do this very easily i m not expert enough to rattle this off without testing and promise no bugs so you ll have to test

3002750
post	get
this will turn your post into a get

3002765
imperative	declarative
most functional programmers would agree that you shouldn t try to imitate an imperative style i think recursion shouldn t be taught at all but should develop naturally and self-explanatory in declarative programming it s often at various points evident that a function is defined in terms of itself

3002805
inherited	subclassing
this is based roughly on the scala implementation of these lists in particular the idea of using inherited and a nillist subclassing rather than using null pointers

3002826
opera	firefox
3 i now attempt generating just the option values of a dropdown list of dates using my ajax functions and it works in firefox opera but not ie8

3002908
folder	directory
that is correct simply pointing at a directory will not cause the .libs in that directory to get linked in consider the case of the visual studio lib folder there s 60 files in my version of it imagine if they all got linked in

3002938
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it works in firefox google-chrome safari etc

3002976
google-chrome	firefox
if it was possible to add to the manifest.json some google-chrome internal pages like google-chrome extensions it would be possible to create a plugin that would interact to the reload anchor and using an external program like xrefresh a firefox plugin - there s a google-chrome version using ruby and websocket you would achieve just what you need

3002976
emacs	textmate
you could try to find third-party solutions instead that after seeing modifications in a file i don t know emacs neither textmate but in emacs it would be possible to bind an app call within a save file action just clicks in an specific coordinate of an specific application in this case it s the reload anchor from your extension in development you leave a chrome windows opened just for this reload

3003014
post	get
ex map.resources post collection list get

you must set the uipickerview delegate and datasource members to an object or objects that implement the uipickerviewdelegate and uipickerviewdatasource protocols

3003058
width	height
specifically this means you re using the w3c box model now which computes width height for block elements differently than quirks mode

3003061
lxml	elementtree
this is a bit odd in lxml or elementtree

3003061
lxml	elementtree
note that lxml and elementtree have no special way to represent a document except rooted with a single element but .drop_tag would work like you want if that wasn t the root element

3003089
google-chrome	firefox
you can also step through with tools such as firebug in firefox ie8 developer tools google-chrome developer tools or visual studio

3003101
ready	each
the problem is that because the flash object s state state may change with each partial postback the flash flex object and or external interface may not be ready or even exist yet in the dom when the javascript - flash external interface call is made

3003102

the idea behind using get over post is that using get you have a search url that you can modify in the address bar bookmark and pass on

3005525
post	get
one big difference between get and post is that get parameters shouldn t exceed 1-2 kilobytes in size

3005539

i want to get request post body from http.serverrequest but do so not straight when my request function is called but only after some time redis query

3005579
implements	extends
so they need to make a other project and extends the product class and overwrite the method getproductprice so they can implements there own logic

3005586
post	get
by doing a redirect-after-post the redirected url which renders the results of your search can be made friendly and short while you can use post to pass more parameters in the request to the server and avoid the long query string associated with the get url

3005613
google-chrome	safari

xslt	xquery
while xquery can be used for simple transformations it lacks the power and sofistication of xslt especially templates and the instruction

3005956
xslt	xquery
in cases when accessing an xml database it would be a good decision to use the efficiency of xquery to extract the necessary xml nodes and then do the transformation with xslt from here on

3005956
xslt	xquery
some xslt 2.x xquery processors do allow this via extensions even now

3005956
xslt	xquery
the next wave of xslt 2.x xquery 1.x specifications will most probably make such interoperability an official feature of these languages

3006014

as apple introduce extension support in safari 5 i want to make an extension that manage proxy settings directly in the browser like autoproxy for firefox or proxy switchy for google-chrome

3007557
comparator	icomparer
use the overload of orderby that takes an icomparer the first func argument will feed the comparator and from there you need to compare the strings

3007577
client-side	server-side
they re asynchronous from the client-side browser point of view but from the server-side the call to the web service is made and returns when it is completed holding up any other operations since there is a limited number of connections

3007598
accessor	properties
the compiler will create synthesized accessor which will automatically manage the properties memory for you

3007602
ant	maven
afaik hibernate doesn t offer any support for this and i would personally use a build tool ant maven here they both have filtering capabilities

3007621
vb6	vba
but in several development environments excel vba vb6 the default value is rounded before display

3007669
google-chrome	firefox
apprently this is only a problem in ie8 works fine in google-chrome and firefox

3007729
lxml	elementtree
you can use formencode.doctest_xml_compare -- the xml_compare function compares two elementtree or lxml trees

3007764
opera	google-chrome
i tested the same script on google-chrome and opera and it works correctly on them so this must be an ie issue

3007855

to understand public private protected specifiers

3008051
configobj	configparser
as python s built-in configparser module does not seem to support nested sections i d first try configobj

3008051
bazaar	trac
configobj is used by bazaar trac ipython matplotlib and many other large python projects so it seems pretty mature and stable to me although i never used it myself

3008066
submit	submission
you could also write some javascript to fire on form submission to remove the fields you don t want to submit

3008067
sum	floor
one approach would be to take the floor of for x in 1..n as your integers then distribute the remainding units 100- sum of integers randomly

3008130
setinterval	settimeout
i know about settimeout and setinterval but haven t been able to format the code in a way that works

3008146
setinterval	settimeout
you should use settimeout or setinterval instead of a while loop and manually break out when your counter limit is reached

3008159
pull	push
we have the following systems and more that we push pull data from one app to another

3008202

3008396
gif	png
i thought you were trying to capture a rendered image in the browser like a png gif etc

3008461
inherited	properties
create a concrete class in your test project that inherited from your abstract controller and exposes tenant as a public properties

3008461
accessor	properties
you could use visual studio s private accessor assembly feature to generate a type where you can access your tenant properties

3008468
button	checkbox
it can be more semantic and in some cases leads to a better ui by eliminating non-clickable spaces between radio button or checkbox and their labels

3008486
jndi	jta
for whatever reason i have found that when using jta you must specify a jndi data source within persistence.xml as well

3008491
put	get
if we put this together we get the following code

3008494
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this is supposed to load add_item.php into the #items div and it works fine in firefox google-chrome safari just not ie

3008511
tabs	tabpanel
i found that when using a tabpanel in standards mode widgets on tabs after the first one which aren t visible at first don t always render correctly

3008522
uisegmentedcontrol	uibutton
in order to assign the uisegmentedcontrol 1 as a right button you have to wrap it inside a uibutton sample code taken from the navbar sample application

3008579

3008645
google-chrome	firefox
it ll spit out the same data for google-chrome as it would for ie and firefox

3008645
google-chrome	firefox
most likely your post value has one or more characters in it that are breaking the html of the page and ie firefox are being a bit more forgiving than google-chrome is

3008659
google-chrome	firefox
the problem is that when user download mp3 songs with the code below it works great in firefox and google-chrome but not in ie8 simply because wmp trying to open the songs and it just don t get it instead of having a save as dialog

3008678
put	get
in other words there s a correlation between the fidelity of the attributes you get and the level of trust you put on the issuer

3008682
width	height
i ve tried setting the movieplayer frame height and width to 0 but that still shows the play button

3008715
implements	extends
java only allows interfaces to extends other interfaces and for classes to implements interfaces

3008715
implements	extends
a class implements multiple interfaces could be rewritten as a class implements a single interface that extends all the above interfaces

3008767
firefox	safari
it works great in safari or firefox

3008772
width	height
the quick way to solve this is to actually provide two options 1 scale from width 2 scale from height

3008774
folder	directory
it might be a little harder to get a folder built in your output directory and have the file added to that

3008786
jsf	seam
although a majority of seamâ s work is done in the jsf servlet these additional filters allow seam to

3008789
innodb	myisam
myisam will follow the steps above and lock the entire table even if it is split into multiple partitions where an engine like innodb will do row level locking instead

3008789
innodb	myisam
if you re not reaching the necessary performance benchmarks with myisam and you have shown your bottleneck is waiting on table locks via updates i would suggest changing the storage engine of your table to innodb

3008801
width	height
calculate the new dimensions for both variants scale by width and scale by height then use the one that fits in the display

3008801
width	height
depending on which aspect ratio is larger the height or the width needs to be scaled

3008821
hash	hmac
if i run the openssl command line in hmac mode as below is the key used for the hmac used directly or is it hash before using it as the key

3008821
hash	salt
similarly when encrypting a file with openssl as below is the pass phrase hash with the salt

3008840
median	minimum
instead of subtracting maximum or minimum subtracting the median can work well though you have to choose the filter size such that there s usually a majority of background pixels inside the filter mask

3008856
width	height
because you want to maximize showing as much as possible the scaled image of the original in your window the area in your designer you would take the larger of either the width or height of the original image and scale that to 200

3008856
width	height
pseudo-code width height are dimensions of original

3008869
width	height
if you mean image pixels you need to know the physical size of the image height width and then you can calculate how wide a pixel is

3008890
postgresql	mysql
ps you can also migrate to postgresql it s smarter than mysql when choosing right indexes

3008922
accessor	properties
properties accessor

3008922
accessor	properties
then the properties accessor operator is used

3008922
accessor	properties
also host objects can implement accessor properties that can have a logic get and set methods not just simple value properties

3008922
accessor	properties
in ecmascript 3 we didn t had the power of creating accessor properties only the host objects could implement them but the 5th edition of the standard allows us to do it

3008922
google-chrome	firefox
note the above illustrative example works on ie9 pre firefox 3.7alpha google-chrome 5 and webkit nightly builds

3008966
width	height
make sure your integers have the range to handle the maximum width height

3008976
subtract	add
don t you just need to add or subtract 150 or 100 pixels depending on which edge you are looking at to each distance measurement in your loop at step 3 and carry this larger value into length at step 4

3008998
google-chrome	firefox
the code was working fine in ie but had problems in google-chrome and firefox

3009003

not exactly what you re looking for but hudson combined with msbuild and webdeploy aka msdeploy may fulfill your needs in addition to providing continuous integration

3009015
ssl	https
now assuming this isn t using an ssl connection https a

3009015
hash	salt
if you do hash the password before transmission how do you use that if you only store a salt hash version of the password in your user credentials databas

3009057
btrieve	pervasive
i m migrating data from a btrieve file .dat through pervasive control center and there is field type which is defined as integer but is a date and for example the date 31 12 2009 seen in the legacy system is view it as the number 733772 when i export it

3009072
hash	salt
this is only secure if the server sends a non-reusable salt and of course if you use a secure hash

3009085
hash	salt
if you let the server pick a hash salt every time a user logs in that will protects against replay

3009085
hash	salt
if that is a problem you could hash the salt with another fixed salt use the result as a checksum and add both to your login form as hidden fields

3009138
google-chrome	firefox
target is the originating element in firefox google-chrome srcelement is the same element in ie

3009138
google-chrome	firefox
currenttarget in firefox google-chrome is the element which called the handler which may not be the same element you clicked on

3009161
google-chrome	firefox
it works in both firefox and google-chrome

3009191
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
everything works great in ie7 and in firefox google-chrome and safari for that matter

3009206
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i have a uitabbarcontroller that has 4 viewcontrollers all of type uinavigationcontroller

3009206
portrait	landscape
i am a bit worried that if this could be done from landscape to portrait it should also be possible from portrait to landscape thus making my hack unnecessary

3009211
serializable	deserialization
i would recommend xml serializable and deserialization

3009217
partition-problem	np-complete
if you want exact same values then for number of columns x 2 it is the classic partition-problem which is np-complete but has pseudo polynomial solutions

3009274
put	get
p1 is as close as it can get to o1 so it stays put

3009284
folder	directory
i have a directory with lots of folder sub-folder and all with files in them

3009298
min	max
min and max are usually primitive operations on vectors

3009393
ssl	https
the problem comes when we switch to and ssl https environment

3009437
post	get
urllib2 always uses http method get or post and therefore inevitably gets the full page

3009466
portrait	landscape
first pre-rotate your splash image so you have a portrait and landscape version

3009483
firefox	safari
do i have to make changes for mac os using safari firefox etc

3009487
vbscript	jscript
the control supports vbscript jscript or any other active script implementation

3009513
filtering	grouping
use row_number twice - once to filtering the rows away that are after the third delivery and the second time to find the last row remaining a typical max per grouping query

3009530
int	double
for a given int sequence check number of double palindromes where by double palindrome we mean sequence of two same palindromes without break between them

3009532
hash	salt
you can protect this scheme against man-in-the-middle attacks by using the salt database hash to generate a secret key for symmetric encryption

3009532
hash	salt
server looks up the password hash in the database h d along with salt s d

3009543
16-bit	64bit
passing a 16-bit value or 32-bit value rather than a 32-bit or 64bit address

3009621
int	double
this is probably true for built-in types such as int or double

3009625
punctuation	words
despite the frequently expressed antipathy for regular expressions on the part of many in the python community they re really a precious tool for the appropriate use cases -- which definitely include identifying words and phrases thanks to the b words boundary element in regular expression patterns -- string-processing based alternatives are much more of a problem .split uses whitespace as the separator and thus annoyingly leave punctuation attached to words adjacent to it etc etc

3009625
punctuation	words
this will form the pattern bcat b| bdog b which will locate either cat or dog as stand-alone words ignoring punctuation but rejecting hits within longer words

3009646
free	malloc
convert malloc free to new delete

3009666
des	rsa
it s free and includes rsa among others blowfish md5 sha-1 des triple-des rijndael digital signing of messages

3009676
bluetooth	usb
is it possible for me to intercept the text messages that get sent to my cellphone if i connect to my cellphone via bluetooth or usb or some other connection to my computer

3009693
xfce	gnome	xfce	kde	kde	gnome
windoe managers to name gnome xfce kde ratpoison fvwm twm blackbox are a few

3009693
mouse	keyboard
ratpoison gives full screen to the application that is in the foreground but demands heavy keyboard interaction hence the name ratpoison and no mouse interaction at all

3009747
cdr	cons
1 traditionally in the lisp world cons cons tructs a pair so clojure departs from the lisp tradition in having its cons function construct a seq which doesn t have a traditional cdr

3009765
request-uri	url
i suspect the vodafone connection is going through a proxy and or gateway that can t handle the extra-long url and that your 414 request-uri too long is coming from it

3009772
lsp	principles
learn the open closed principles the primary one and the lsp

3009777
google-chrome	firefox
this online tutorial displays ok in firefox and google-chrome but in ie the main content is pushed down the page for some reason

3009778
pull	push
clone pull push commands are for interacting with ohter repos repos in other dir using git s file protocol

3009780

3009790
margin	height
now i want to make in for example 80 height with 10 margin top and bottom

3009790
margin	height
maybe i can get text container any height but with some margin at the bottom

3009810
min	max
there doesn t seem to be the same convenient min max date values in that programming environment

3009810
min	max
that means there could be those min dates and max dates stored in a database which php would retrieve and it would have to differentiate between normal dates and min max date and eventually they would trickle down to some javascript which again would have to differentiate between normal dates and min max date

3009810
min	max
so which date value do you use for min max dates when working in php + mysql + javascript

3009830
hash	md5
-adding a column to pages storing the md5 hash of the url and indexing it

3009842
opera	safari
browsershots.org shows that it barfs on opera 5 i used an earlier version and some editions of safari and of course ie7 and below ie8 is ok

3009845
google-chrome	firefox
on firefox google-chrome and ie 8 it works fine

3009852
implements	extends
your myjavafxclass then must implements the interface using class myjavafxclass extends if

3009920
inherited	properties
if i set the properties for the project to inherited from parent of project defaults it works and fills them in the vcproj file

3009924
google-chrome	firefox
that being said i did come up with this hack that works in firefox but fails in google-chrome and ie

3009931
google-chrome	firefox
i ve found out that firefox and google-chrome both use libpr0n but i can t find any benchmarks performance info about it - how do i get started

3009988
hash	md5
maybe i m missing something here but can t you just encrypt your password using say md5 and then say sha-1 or any other doesn t matter. wouldn t this increase the processing power required to brute-force the hash and reduce the possibility of collision

3010021
ubuntu	linux
when i run this on my linux machine ubuntu 10.4 this blocking event appears to never return when i return 0 if i change the behavior to return the size written libcurl appends all the data in the http body sending way more data and it fails with a too much data message from the server

3010027
hash	salt
rainbow crack is good for passwords with small unknown salt and straight hash like

3010048
calloc	malloc
i need the equivalent malloc or calloc call to get this to work on unix systems through mono

3010094
portrait	landscape
each landscape view has its specific portrait view so i have to assign like id s to each of this views

3010094
portrait	landscape
can you tell me how i can load the specific portrait view for each landscape view when rotating the device

3010094
portrait	landscape
one for landscape one for portrait

3010094
portrait	landscape
or is it possible to just scroll through the landscape scrollview an load just one portrait view with the right content based on an id

3010105
dundas	componentart
after looking at the options i am aware of and was able to find doing some simple google searches i have narrowed it down to using either componentart dundas charts or infragistics simply because from what i can see of their demos they have certain features i believe i will need to get things done

3010109
hash	md5
if you run sha1 md5 text you first get the hash of md5 then pass that to sha1

3010157
folder	directory
question how do you programmatically distinguish between directory and regular files in the assets folder

3010157
folder	directory
when using assetmanager to access files in the assets folder it seems impossible to determine if a file is in fact a file or a directory

3010157
folder	directory
currently i m relying on that ioexception resulting from attemptng to open a directory in the assets folder in order to determine if a file is in fact a directory

3010179
pop-up	dialog
the only advice i can give is if you open up the property manager for the project and right click on one of the configuration folders it should pop-up a menu with an item called overidden properties... which in turn opens a dialog box that lists each property set in the project configuration that overrides a property sheet property sheet - along with the facility to select some or all and delete the overrides

3010188
children	parent
if there is no finish vodka on stock first check all its children absolut vodka ... then traverse its siblings russian vodka and then its parent nodes in reverse order vodka alcohol until one is found that is on stock

i can get these values by setting an asp.net hidden input control using javascript after the page has loaded and a post back is done

3010220
innodb	myisam
mysql cache works differently depending on whether you use the myisam storage engine or the innodb storage engine

3010246
spaces	delimiter
my text file is of format spaces delimiter

3010277
inherited	base-class	abstract-class	base-class
iâ ve decided that i let it be an interface because i donâ t like to force the plugin-programmers to inherited from an abstract-class so that he or she loses the possibility to inherited from an own base-class

3010315
migrate	upgrade
most real world scenarios are somewhere in between so scalability means to ask if this or that tool should turn out to be a performance bottleneck will i be able to upgrade it or that failing migrate to another product

3010318
jquery	scriptaculous
if the link is present but hidden you use some dhtml jquery scriptaculous to set the display visibility attributes correctly

3010342
hash	salt
let s say attacker has the hash values of the passwords and starts reading from the dictionary file and compares with the hash values if matches then pasword is cracked if salt is used then read from the dictionary and add some salt value then try to find a match.however this should be done for each user

3010374
many-to-many	one-to-many
i saw a similar situation here in stackoverflow but the app crashes since my data model doesn t seem to use nsmutableset for the relationships i don t think i have a many-to-many relationship just one-to-many i think it can be modified so i can retrieve the relationships as if they were attributes

3010401
min	max
php uses 32 bit integer values to represent date time â that means you can use the php_int_max constant to derive the integer values associated with the min max dates

3010412
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
i suspect it is because objectinputstream and objectoutputstream cache all the objects transmitted

3010427
jar	war
these three plugin configurations will allow you to build install deploy a jar version alongside the war

3010434
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	calloc	free	malloc	calloc	malloc
either way calloc malloc and realloc free are the posix choices for memory management

pull	push
i would like to push updates and such to github.com and then log into my windows server and do a git pull to get my changes that are verified to work on my local machine

3010451
min	max
based on your example if your list of possible parameters is just a sequence of max min max min max min .

3010451
min	max
if your tests can be something more complicated than just max min testing the code will need to be modified

3010470
dlsym	dlopen
dlopen dlclose dlsym dlerror are there for you to open external runtime libraries

3010495
width	height
hp and hp should contain pixel width and height but don t

getter	setter
this must have forced the compiler setter and getter to be called

3010668
min	max
i m using the generics collection library c5 server down - and i have an intervalheap t and i need to delete or replace a t that is not the max or min

3010687
curb	libcurl
as alternative - curb ruby libcurl binding

3010710
apache	lighttpd
the easier and better solution is to use x-sendfile header tag supported by both apache and lighttpd through their modules

3010750
easyhook	detours
use a library like detours or easyhook both of which support exactly this kind of patching and one of which at least works in x64

3010764
cout	cin
try replacing cout with wcout cin with wcin and string with wstring

3010791
getter	setter
generally the nsfoo class defines data members getter and read-only operations and the derived nsmutablefoo adds on setter and mutating operations

3010791
getter	setter
while you certainly could take that approach it seems to me that a more concise approach is to create a single foo class mark getter and read-only operations as const functions and also implement the mutable operations and setter in the same class

3010792
versioning	upgrade
instead use scripts to create all your objects including indexes relations constraints everything and use upgrade scripts to control how to upgrade each schema versioning to the next versioning like described in versioning control and your database

3010824
tstringgrid	tdbgrid
it appears to me that delphi 2010 s tdbgrid and tstringgrid have some differences in the way they handle transparency

3010828
vim	emacs
gui-based ides like visual studio and eclipse have several advantages over text-based ides like emacs or vim because of their display capabilities

3010828
vim	emacs
text-based ides like emacs and vim can add features like code completion and refactoring over time so in the long run their main limitation is their text-based display model

3010840
for-loop	arrays
in java you can use a for-loop to traverse objects in an arrays as follows

3010848
inherited	properties
inherited properties are also enumerated

3010848
inherited	properties
in the above example the hasownproperty method allows you to enumerate only own properties that s it only the properties that the object physically has no inherited properties

multiplying	subtract
i can see how this can be done if i was just modifying multiplying subtract etc. the original value with colormatrix but now how i can use the pixels returned value to use it to calculate and new value

3011046
addition	multiplication
i know i can set colormatrix s m00 m11 m22 to 0 0 0 respectively and then put a new value in m40 m41 m42 but that new value is calculated based of a value multiplication and addition of that pixel s components and the result of that - luminance - is multiplied by the color component

3011060
lisp	smalltalk
this works exactly the same as in any other programming language if you have multiple references to a mutable object in say python java c# c++ c lisp smalltalk javascript php perl or whatever then any change to that object will be visible no matter what reference is used even if some of those references are final or const or whatever that particular language calls it

3011062
openssl	polarssl
however if you do not want to do this perhaps you want to look at compiling libcurl to link against cyassl or polarssl instead of openssl to make the installation more lightweight

rss	feed
we have a site which is accessed entirely over https but sometimes display external content which is http images from rss feed mainly

3011222
rss	feed
a worst case scenario is that i parse the rss feed when we import them grab the images store them locally so that the users can access them that way but it seems like a lot of pain for reasonably little gain

see the mxml code is compiled into the actionscript code and then into bytecode which is then executed by the flash player

3011645
actionscript	mxml
so it s get easier to work in mxml but there r some limitations of the mxml so sooner or later u have to use actionscript thats what we all do daily

3011648
actionscript	mxml
mxml files can include actionscript inside tags - similar to how you can have javascript in an html file

3011648
actionscript	mxml
most of the things that you do in mxml can also be done with actionscript but it ll take more lines of code to do it

3011648
actionscript	mxml
an mxml file creates an actionscript class of the same name that extends the class corresponding to the root tag of the mxml file

simple question is it possible to simplify or replace division or modulo by less-expensive operation

3011866
division	modulo
where variables are integers and operators are c style division and modulo operators

3011866
division	modulo
let me rephrase question slightly except for case where variables are base2 under what conditions some variable may be constant can expression be simplified or rephrased partially using base2 operations to remove the division or modulo

profiling	debugging
i ve only just started profiling today firmly believing in not optimising too early so i imagine there s some kind of reference floating around somewhere but i can t see where and what would be super helpful would be the ability to debugging and see a list of objects that reference the target object

3011981
entities	entitymanager
point to note that is entitymanager keeps track of entities through java object references.

3011981
entities	entitymanager
i think if i have new entitymanager in both listings 1 and 2 i should be able to persist same object in database because entitymanager keeps track of entities through java object references and in each iteration i have new entitymanager which dont know or should not know the object references saved persisted in database in previous iteration by some other entitymanager object instance

3012169
qgraphicsscene	qgraphicsitem	qlist	qgraphicsscene	qlist	qgraphicsitem
since most of the convenience functions of qgraphicsscene and qgraphicsitem such as items collidingitems childitems etc. return a qlist you re forced to do lots of qgraphicsitem_cast or static_cast and qgraphicsitem type checks to get hold of the actual items when you have lots of different type of items in the scene

3012194
getter	setter
the actual source code should have the getter setter because you probably want to add validation and change notification to the setter as needed

3012294
public	protected
while compiling it shows clone is protected and cannot be accessed but i had extended object class hence the clone method will be public to my class

3012304
hex	binary
the kernel program ihex2fw called from makefile in kernel_source lib firmware on .hex files converts these hex files to an arbitrary-designed binary format that the linux kernel then picks up with request_ihex_firmware because they thought reading text files in the kernel was silly it would slow things down

3012342
inherited	subclassing
and because object#clone is implemented as a protected method any subclassing of object every class in fact can access its inherited clone method and every class inside the java.lang package can access clone methods from other objects too

sitecore is somewhat conceptually close to umbraco whereas sharepoint is more extensive but there is more work to do to bring it up and running

3012627
hash	md5
i think md5 hash are quite common and so there are probably plenty of free utils or sample code

3012633
hide	show
using your code as a reference you could just use a setinterval that show hide the divs you want

post	get
only store user id in the post object and run 2 queries one to get a list of post and another one to get list of users where user id is in the list of post authors

3013096
getter	setter
putting code validation coercion logic change notifications logging etc in the getter and setter of dependency properties corresponding clr properties instead of using the propertychangedcallback validatevaluecallback and coercevaluecallback

i have generated my model classes in visual c# express 2010 but in a 1 parent - many children relation i can only access the children through a vector in the parent

3013400
mouseover	mouseout
this is the standard behaviour for the mouseout and mouseover events

3013406
min	max
the problem is that library declare min max function

3013406
min	max
i want to disable min max function in stl like #define nomnmax if i could

3013443
int	boolean
you can call bitmap.createscaledbitmap bitmap src int dstwidth int dstheight boolean filter

3013446
min	max
the min and max functions are defined in the std namespace so this code should not compile

3013463
min	max
as both min and max and every other standard library member are defined in std namespace you just mustn t import that namespace don t use using namespace std

3013464
min	max
i sometimes have problems with something like that as well because iirc opencv #defines its own min max as well as i think does windows.h

3013464
min	max
for me the problem arises that with some headers #defining min max i can t even use std min

3013480
websphere	ibm
i also can get ibm websphere and the like for free as well

3013480
websphere	ibm

ubuntu	linux
i also plan on installing everything i had running under linux itâ s almost entirely java based development software so itâ ll run on both only reason i went with ubuntu during the year was because the apache build seemed better

3013539
ant	maven
neither maven nor ant easily intrinsically support the file dependency concept of make

3013551
jquery	jqmodal
there are other alternatives of showing popups instead of using the old school alert for example you could use the jqmodal plugin based on the popular jquery framework

3013592
mp3	ogg
also there is this pymedia library i don t know if its good to convert to mp3 ogg for this kind of software

3013675
width	height
somehow you should specify width and height also add namespace and meta

3013675
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
an other solution is to wait till ie opera google-chrome safari and firefox would support svg inside text html file

3013841
getter	setter
note and i declared setter and getter methods only in my deleagte class.

3013946
ienumerable	icollection
the upvoted answers propose an algorithm that will have o n 2 complexity if the ienumerable wasn t derived from a class that implements icollection

3013980
spweb	spsite
spsite spweb objects are actually thread-specific so you shouldn t pass them from one thread to another

3014016
wadl	wsdl
if you make an analogy the homepage or site map to us humans is what wsdl is to ws- or what wadl could be to a rest service

3014018

i need to hide my mathematics equations before mathjax is fully loaded and show loading message in mean time

3014041

works fine in opera ie 6-8 firefox on some computers

3014082
mbunit	nunit	mbunit	mstest	nunit	mstest
have a look at gallio a framework and other tools test runner etc. that mbunit is built on but that also handles the outputs mstest nunit rspec etc

3014104
put	get
and i don t get the segmentation fault maybe you are doing something else to corrupt the stack earlier and when you put the variable on the stack you get the error

3014118
width	height
now the height and width variables were supposed to be height and width of the layout used for the popup window popupcontact

3014203
gif	bmp
does it matter if i use gif or jpg or bmp or any other image format for the images

3014228
hide	show
what you are doing is the right way to go according to msdn but it does suggest that another option is to hide show the pages as needed

3014229
folder	directory
just in case you created an eclipse rcp application then there is an elegant way to bundle the application with a java runtime environment just create a folder named jre inside your applications directory same level as plugin and features folder and copy a jre to that folder

3014277
spweb	splist
the recommended way to do this is to use propertybag key value pairs through the .properties of spfarm spweb.rootweb for site collections spweb splist etc depending upon the scope that you need

3014302
oncreate	setcontentview
i have a question in regards to lots of issues are already discussed but this example only works for me if i in the oncreate method do not use setcontentview r.layout.main

3014339
cvs	svn
if this is the case you can configure a post-commit hook to call a url works for cvs or svn not sure about other scms

3014480
nunit	mstest
i guess i could write unit tests for wpf part with nunit mstest xunit etc

3014490
put	get
as a result they get the data after it s generated but before it s being encrypted and put in ip packets

3014516
pop-up	dialog
if you want to create a pop-up window take a look at the creating dialog

3014516
popupwindow	dialog
i think there is no need to use popupwindow yourself to create this view and the dialog stuff will get you to a result much easier

3014516
width	height
if you want to stick with the popupwindow and you don t want to change the width and height of your window just use another constructor for popupwindow there are some available that don t need height and width

3014602
google-chrome	firefox
created a new version miming your script and tested it on firefox google-chrome ie8 ie7 and it worked flawlessy

3014630
put	get
if the file can be put into an element in firefox you can use javascript to automatically upload the data to the server without user intervention but you would need something to initially get the file into the page s memory not the file system

3014644
cvs	svn
ive been using sourcegear vault and subversion visual svn for quite a while now and am a big fan of the cvs disconnected style edit - merge - commit way of using source control

3014677
facade	service-locator
if your concern is having a dependency on unity throughout your application you can combine the service-locator with a facade to hide the ioc implementation

3014677
facade	service-locator
now you have a service-locator that is a facade for ioc services and can configure your service-locator to use unity or any other ioc container

3014706
mouse	keyboard
do i have to buy an additional monitor a mouse and a keyboard or is there a better solution

3014716
rtp	rtsp
so now what i need to do is convert video streams from pc camera into rtp rtsp format

3014752
client-side	server-side
obviously your client-side library script needs to be able to create an instance of a javascript object that can be deserialised as your server-side instance

3014766
blogspot	blogger
you can also pull blog content from blogspot using the blogger data api

3014795

if you don t use both computers at the same time it s perfectly possible to use the same monitor and keyboard mouse for both computer

3014805
int	double
how to i write a function that approximates a double in the following manner returning an int

3014809
goto	break
in c# it won t compile without break or goto case statement except when there s no pre-action

3014817
int	double
you could get overflow problems converting a double to an int - this actually returns a long for that reason

3014820
int	double
if you re actually trying to implement something close to this yourself one way to do so is to take the double and explicitly cast it into an int

3014863
google-chrome	safari
when viewing said effects in safari google-chrome and ie the double dashed border effect looks great

3014880
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
question is now should you go for a checked exception which you need a throws declaration or try catch clauses or an unchecked-exception an exception that extends runtimeexception

3014880
illegalargumentexception	unchecked-exception
note that illegalargumentexception is an unchecked-exception perfectly suitable for throwing when arguments are not as they should be

3014966
equals	gethashcode
you should also override gethashcode if you are overriding equals

3014968
equals	gethashcode
you need to override equals and gethashcode methods of your key class

3014983
google-chrome	safari
en-us applewebkit 533.4 khtml like gecko google-chrome 5.0.375.55 safari 533.4 is google-chrome

3014990
equals	gethashcode
in order to use your own classes as dictionary keys you should override gethashcode and equals

3014992
equals	gethashcode
if you do not have the ability to override equality operators equals gethashcode as others have mentioned as in you do not control the source code of the object you can provide an implementation in the constructor of the dictionary to perform your equality checks

3014994
equals	gethashcode
you need to override the equals and gethashcode methods of your key class

3015012
maven	pom.xml
chain of commands to correctly publish artifact and maven pom.xml

3015082
websphere	ibm
i m using ibm websphere as my servlet container

3015094
getter	setter
alternatively to check all methods such as getter and setter for access only on the edt you can use aspectj and load-time weaving to add the swingutilities.isdisaptchthread advice to each method on your swing components and the jdk swing components.

3015096
public	protected
whether a property is public protected or private has nothing to do with how the properties memory is managed

3015100
public	protected
objective-c only allows private protected and public modifiers on instance variables although you can essentially make a property or method private by declaring it in the implementation .m file rather than the header .h file

3015124
inherited	properties
immediately i see an issue with this wsdl testresponse does not contain the properties inherited from responsemessage

3015139
dictionary	map
use a dictionary to map nsurldownload s to rows cells .

3015144
equals	gethashcode
then you will need to override gethashcode and equals on the key class

3015150
equals	gethashcode
overriding a class gethashcode and equals methods so that it will work properly in a dictionary is not a very good approach

3015154
ftp	telnet
i had initially thought that i could display a sign on screen where they would enter their username and password then establish an ftp connection or telnet or something similar with the aix system but this would not be a reliable method as the functionality may be locked down eg

3015171
getter	setter
jaxb does not properly generate boolean field getter and setter this bug is left unfixed for backwards compatibility

of the ipad portrait or landscape the popover appears someplace else

3015439
hide	show
assuming you want to show hide some divs based on what option is selected try this untested

3015439
hide	show
you are going to need to put some values in your options and they will need to correlate to the ids of the divs you want to show hide

3015464

gridview	objectdatasource
i use the objectdatasource because it handels all the paging and sorting of the gridview automatically for me

3015518
inherited	subclassing
however in f# it is usually recomended to use subclassing inherited only when there is a really good reason for that you need to implement some virtual class and pass it to a .net library

3015534
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome work fine

3015558
chown	chmod
make sure you run man chmod man chown

3015569
yacc	bison
typical parser lexer like antlr yacc bison seems cannot deal with this kind of stuff one idea i have is to convert the syntax diagram to a character bitmap and define some function like more_up move_down left right or so in order to traverse the whole diagram to simulate the understanding process as human naked eye

3015570
put	get
1- in the onclick attribute get the value after the productid and put it in its own variable

3015570
put	get
2- in the onclick attribute get the value after the orig_price and put it in a variable orig_price so in this case it would be 22.95

3015570
put	get
3- in the onclick attribute get the value after the width and put it in a variable width so in this case it would be 330

3015570
put	get
4- in the onclick attribute get the value after the height and put it in a variable height so in this case it would be 300

3015605
hide	show
form.showintaskbar to show hide in the taskbar

3015623

3015866
folder	directory
i was trying to access the root directory and list the contents of it but i got 0 folder listed there

3015871
std	ostream
you could use a boost iostreams array_sink wrapped with stream to give it an std ostream interface for that

3015904
nsstring	nsdata
and i m aware that i can convert nsstring to nsdata so i ll see if this leads me anywhere

3015929
put	get
and even though the cost is not really noticeable if you really need the extra performance boost you can simply create custom subclasses for the list class one for each primitive type they are not many so that s not a problem and simply override the methods that put and get values in the list and limit them to accepting each primitive

3015980
opera	google-chrome
i read that the hover fires functions off twice on hover in google-chrome but tried it in opera and the same error occurred so i don t think that s the problem

3015992
codeigniter	cakephp
cakephp is newer more feature rich and heavier than codeigniter codeigniter is designed to have a much smaller footprint so you will most likely find yourself creating functionality in codeigniter to match cake s

3015992
codeigniter	cakephp
cakephp also handles some core capabilities differently than codeigniter

3016009
hide	show
it doesn t answer your question but you could hide your p when the mouse is out and show it when the mouse is over

3016020
mouseover	mouseout
creating elements on mouseover mouseout is much more work on the browser then having those elements created already in the markup with display none

3016020
mouseover	mouseout
your mouseover and mouseout are probably both firing and it can t find the element to remove and continues to add it

3016044
puts	gets
when a client connects it gets recognized as undefined until it sends a message with the word supplier or consumer in spanish as i m from there when the server puts it in the correct clients array

if you re using jquery don t bother with the stock event handlers onclick onmouseover etc actually just stop using them altogether

3016135
firefox	safari	width	height
is there a possible way to make the iframe width and height autoresize and is that compatable with at least ie firefox safari chrom

3016168
put	get
if bob needs bigimportantclass then bob needs to get the people who own project a to sign up to guarantee that bigimportantclass will be written to meet his needs tested to ensure that it meets his needs is documented as meeting his needs and that a process will be put in place to ensure that it will never be changed so as to no longer meet his needs

3016183
width	height
you can manage the width pretty easily but web pages are flow documents and do not understand the concept of height not easily at least

3016210
crossover	mutation
on the other end if the fitness function is the same then it makes sense to compare results given different parameters such as different mutation rate different implementations of crossover or even completely different evolutionary paradigms such as coevolution gene expression compared to standard gas and so on

3016220
getdate	dateadd
dt_wstr 11 bbd + substring dt_wstr 4 dateadd day 30 getdate 1 4 + substring dt_wstr 2 dateadd day 30 getdate 6 2 + substring dt_wstr 2 dateadd day 30 getdate 9 2

i want to draw entity-relationship diagram uml class diagram and uml sequence diagram

3016343
firefox	safari
at least on safari 5 firefox 3.6.3 anyway

3016355
rss	feed
i made a rss feed and fed it to an application called rss grafitti

3016367
width	height
however taking out the image width and height specified on the image element as percentages has fixed the problem

3016384
uitableview	nsindexpath
the cell frame is going to be something like 0 0 width size i dont believe it will have its x and y relative to the tableview...you want to use - cgrect rectforrowatindexpath nsindexpath indexpath for this this should return you the correct frame for the cell relative to the tableview...here is a link uitableview ref

3016441
width	height
as gnoupi observes with level it s not clear how width and height are initialized

3016441
implements	extends
to meet a similar need this example extends defaulttablecellrenderer and implements icon for easier control over the geometry

3016455
gtk	gdk
the locking of gdk is needed because gtk is not thread safe

3016527

the answer in this post suggests 6-11 months after release which would put it at october 2010 at the earliest

3016628
versioning	upgrade
if i choose to upgrade anyway i m told that i m running the latest versioning of silverlight available

3016628

i m running the final versions of vs2010 pro silverlight 4 and the latest version of expression-blend 4 rc

3016707
wordpress	joomla
my question is do i need to have knowledge of one or more cms and or frameworks like drupal joomla zend wordpress etc

3016728
gridex	janus
i understand from the janus gridex folks that the cause of the problem is that linq presents a static list to the grid that is not refreshed after refresh is called on the datacontext

3016732
multiton	singleton
if these programs are running in the same session you can create a separate class to handle writing to files and use either singleton or multiton to map to many file names design pattern to guarantee only one instance of this class

3016766
post	get
you are using associative arrays as they are called in javascript in php object literal notation in javascript but since you use them as the data to the post method they should get treated like normal form submits

3016779
codeigniter	kohana
i would personally go for codeigniter or kohana improved framework from codeigniter but with less commnutiy support

3016782
inherited	properties
apparently the text properties is automatically set to the objects name when you inherited from usercontrol

3016787
rss	feed
i am building an rss feed and i have this for description

3016789
children	parent
a parent view contains and organizes the layout of its children

3016818

joomla is very complex somewhere around 5000 files and wordpress is only for blogs

3016855
draggable	droppable
so basically i m looking for a way to do live with draggable and droppable

3016894
hide	show
i am trying to show a div when the cursor hovers over and image and hide the div when it is not hovered over the image how is this done

3016946
mouseleave	mouseenter
the hover method needs two functions second one is optional though first one is executed when mouseenter the wrapped set and the second one when mouseleave it so you were missing the second one to hide it

3016955
post	get
could you not post the tracking id to an endpoint and have it redirect to a get of resourcea for this client and resourceb for another client

3016960
bmp	png
on my computer image decode filters for image bmp image x-icon image png and image x-wmf are also supported

3016989
put	get
i am trying to put the following in a for-loop but i can t seem to get it to work

3017017
serializable	deserialization
all the serializable deserialization marshaling etc

3017022
google-chrome	firefox
its works great in firefox google-chrome and ie

3017060
pascal	delphi
the problem of course is the business model embarcadero should lower their prices so everyone can buy a delphi version even old delphi x.0 dinosaurs even hobbyists stuck in turbo delphi 2006 or even the small businesses that are using free pascal out there

3017156
put	get
the problem i have is i want to use a variable for the image when i put the variable name instead of the image name i get an error

3017197
hide	show
i ve been asked to create a hide show function with a select tag

3017216
width	margin
since you are hard-coding the width of the labels you could simply give your text a left margin of a slightly-larger value

3017227
move	drag
move drag the fruits you want to group next to each other

3017264
getter	setter
so i thought it would be great to use on getter and setter

3017267
serializable	deserialization
if you want to include field during serializable but ignore it during deserialization then you can use ondeserializedattribute to run a method which will set default value for id field

3017270
mp3	wav
does anyone know of any well-supported proven methods for converting a microsoft word document to an mp3 or wav such that hearing-impaired folks could listen to documents that i have stored in my web-based document management system

3017272
put	get
the problem i have is i want to use a variable for the image when i put the variable name instead of the image name i get an error

3017281
width	height
you would compare the window width height to the window s scrolltop scrollleft etc

3017290
inline	inlining
i don t inline anything until a profiler has specifically told me that not inlining is resulting in a performance problem

3017314
getter	setter
in general having getter and setter is showing poor abstraction don t do it

3017335
width	height
by the way width and height are definitely not deprecated in css

3017355
uitableview	uisegmentedcontrol
i am working on an iphone view that has some header text along with a uisegmentedcontrol at the top and a uitableview beneath it

3017355
uitableview	uisegmentedcontrol
when a different segment is selected in the uisegmentedcontrol i need a different set of records to be displayed in the uitableview

3017372
vb.net	vb6
i ve seen it used as part of vb6 rumors of it s use with python and heard that it can be used for vb.net

3017390
vbscript	jscript
i am updating my answer because i didn t realize you are using both jscript and vbscript

3017407
int	chars
simple things like chars and int are typically atomic when transferred

3017442
put	get
so if you attempt to put something that s not a string you ll get a compile time exception

3017464
public	protected
i would use them for private internal members but use result classes for public protected members

3017465
boost	stl
you can look to c++ stl and boost for examples of how tuples are used in other languages but in the end we will all have to experiment to find how they best fit in the .net environment

3017468
postgresql	mysql
i m relatively new to mysql have been using mssql and postgresql earlier and every approach i can think of is blocked by some feature lacking in mysql

3017495
ssl	https
how can i catch https data for example email from browser before they are encrypted with ssl and send to the network

3017515
width	height
edit just tested it myself and even if i set width and height of well the repeating img

3017517
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
it would appear that the newer os s require all uiviewcontroller in the uinavigationcontroller stack to support the same set of orientations

3017529
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
autopostback true and works in all browsers google-chrome opera firefox 3.6 except in ie 8 ie 6 7 i didn t test

3017529
textchanged	onkeyup	textchanged	onkeydown	onkeyup	onkeydown
ps if i remove the onkeydown and onkeyup events the textchanged fire in ie but i realy this events too

3017540
hide	show
the menu had different show and hide animations attached and i want to prevent toggling while the animation is running

3017563
cos	sqrt	cos	sin	sin	sqrt
it also has sqrt cos sin ..

3017587
width	height
i need to load in an swf component but i want it to be an exact width and height problem is that when i set width and height it doesn t matter content of that swf still goes out of predefined bounds

3017590
google-chrome	firefox
this seems to work on firefox google-chrome ie5.5+ so i am i safe in using this method or is there a better way to make checkboxes submit like inputs and selects

3017591
min	max
given a min and max elm1 and elm check if any three numbers of array are found in any row from min to max in array d1 d2 d3 d4 d5 d6 if found return 1

3017604
short	base
it would keep the code base clean and the xslt s themselves should be pretty short if the data is as simple as you state

3017604
inherited	properties
if you decide you absolutely want to have one class per xml or if you perhaps got a .net dll instead of xml from one customer then i would make the proxy class inherited an interface or abstract class based off your internal class and implement the mappings per properties as needed in the proxy classes

3017652
base	fractions
floats don t represent exact data values they just represent data values that can properly be represented as the sum of fractions of base 2

3017669
udp	tcp
the udp protocol does not guaratnee delivery you should switch to tcp if you need to guaratnee packet delivery

3017695
maven-compiler-plugin	maven-resources-plugin
configuring for the maven-resources-plugin or the maven-compiler-plugin also doesn t fix it

3017697
udp	tcp
common protocols used on the internet are udp message oriented and tcp stream oriented

3017706
hide	show
the issue is when i click on search option on pager it show the search window but the grid gets hide

3017778
shopify	bigcommerce
shopify vendr foxycart bigcommerce volusion bigcartel corecommerce etc

3017787
post	get
when i go to post i get the correct form and i fill it out

3017872
intersect	contains
i have a set of simple no holes no self-intersections polygons and i need to check that they don t intersect each other one can be entirely contains in another

3017872
intersect	contains
since no polygon can intersect any other then any contains polygon has a unique container

3017879
post	get
that will allow the query to get all the post for a tag in the correct order without filesort

3017887
short	base
the short of it is it would be great if all events could summarily invoked asynchronously but it is imperative you execise the same caution you would with any multithreaded code base

3017899
inherited	properties
when specifying event objects for events or eventsources omitting this properties will make it inherited from alldaydefault which is normally false

3017940
post	get
is it dangerous to use post to get back html from the server if you don t want caching since the default for ajax caching is true

3017947
rss	feed
i am trying to generate a google merchant rss feed using php s simplexml and domdocument

3017969
for-loop	arrays
write a for-loop over your arrays be sure to use lbound and ubound instead of looping from 0 to x

3017994
intersect	contains
for your purposes if edges intersect but one polygon is not contains within the other then you know they overlap in a non-permitted fashion

3018007
ciimage	nsimage
so one solution to this problem is to create a nsciimagerep from the ciimage then add that representation to a new nsimage then it is easy to display the nsimage in a variety of ways

3018034
linefeed	delimiter
this script should run on every platform for every kind of line delimiter cr linefeed crlf

3018043
int	chars
and fwiw you can convert between chars and int just by casting

3018050
textview	imageview
it appears to the casual observer that there s an entire layout object pinned to the bottom of the edittext containing an imageview a textview and a button

3018149
put	get
if functions get big i normally put them in a seperate file and call them at the bottom of the file below in the section

3018162
wan	vlan
i need to export 100 million data rows avg row length 100 bytes from oracle 10g database table into sql server over wan vlan with 6mbits sec capacity on a regular basis

3018173
hash	hmac
now this is fine but if this is all we did then the server would have the stored hmac and since the client only needs to send the hmac not the plain text password an attacker could use the stored hash from the server to access anyone s account in the catastrophic scenario where someone would get such an access to the database of course

3018205
public	protected
if the access modifier on the object is set to friend protected friend or public and the object reference is not read only that is it s mutable then you can simply re-assign it

3018206
inherited	properties
scaling is affected by the form s autoscalemode and whether or not they inherited the container control s font properties

3018241
put	get
to put it another way if someone can get hold of the hash that s stored on the server that s all they need to log into the system.

3018265
hash	hmac
i think it hinges on the statement naturally we don t want them stored in plan text so we hmac them locally before storing and or sending. if the system is altered so that the hash password now has the same power the password once had the same level of caution should be used with the hash password

3018279
google-chrome	safari
the fact that the videos are working on desktop versions of google-chrome and safari suggest that the problem is how your videos are encoded

3018292
hash	salt
also as another poster said make sure you are using a salt on both hash

3018292
hash	salt
edit - actually thinking about it since you are using a hash as the password you don t really need to use a salt on the server

3018306
hash	md5
1 hash it with md5 and sha1

3018326
short	base
you should read this explains very nicely the difference between the base sdk and deployment target -- in short the base sdk is the highest sdk version you expect to support whereas the deployment target is the lowest version you will support

3018372
equals	tostring
i d also like to have this implement the standard java equals hashcode and tostring methods

3018388
int	chars
is a positive int that specifies how many chars of character_expression will be returned

3018421
int	chars
is a positive int that specifies how many chars of character_expression will be returned

3018470
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in firefox google-chrome but not in ie

3018470
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox google-chrome this works fine

3018482
inherited	subclassing
i also have some subclassing of the above using single table inherited

3018495
getter	setter
i would guess that accessors getter setter are missing

3018523
filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	fat
because most filesystems these days except fat on windows but ntfs is ok organize the list of files in a directory into a b-tree structure so checking for a file existence is a fast operation o log n instead of enumerating whole list

3018536
getter	setter
right now i have things divided into about six classes with getter setter

3018536
subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	division	addition	division	multiplication	division	subtraction	addition	multiplication
also instead of using math to figure out which indexes data should be placed in i ve used precomputed lookup tables so i don t have to use constant multiplication addition subtraction division per frame

3018541
serializable	deserialization
without hiding the child object s reference to the parent object has anyone been able to use an xmlserializer object to move a linq to sql object to an xml document or is the only appropriate way of handling this to create a custom serializable deserialization class to handle moving the data to from the xml document

3018574
getter	setter
i seriously doubt that getter and setter are at the root of your problem

3018580
firefox	safari
but they grab the data in safari and firefox

3018595
stdout	stderr
how do i redirect stderr and stdout to file for a ruby script

3018608
action-filter	onactionexecuting
then an action-filter or base controller s onactionexecuting method will walk the modelstate errors take all the modelitemexception errors there and merge them into single error

3018610
stdout	stderr
will redirect stdout and stderr to the same file

3018624
submit	submission
it seems that the return false statement that prevents default form submission will neglect any further submit calls even if an instance variable was set

3018642
put	get
you also get the added bonus of being able to access your fields via keyword lookup and being able to put metadata on your objects which defrecord gives you for free

3018655
accessor	properties
the correct usage of -will|didchangevalueforkey is when you are modifying a properties without using kvc-compliant accessor setters such that the kvo mechanism would not notice the change

3018655
accessor	properties
of course it would be better to use a properties declaration and to use kvc-compliant accessor setters either manually coded or synthesized but this is a contrived example

3018661
filtering	grouping
the view model is used by the data binding process as a safe way to allow you to sort filtering grouping the records as seen by a specific control without necessarily making changes to the actual bound data set that is unless until you tell it to

3018684
versioning	upgrade
are you deploying the upgrade to the same location as the old versioning

3018694
post	put
do post put requests to create edit a resource on my server

3018718
post	get
according to last.fm api documentation you should use get method instead of post to pass parameters

3018718
post	get
when i ve changed post to get i ve received the answer about incorrect key

3018719
maven	pom.xml
i added the jboss maven repo to my pom.xml file like this.

3018741
stdout	stderr
from within a ruby script you can redirect stdout and stderr with the io#reopen method

3018791
put	get
in the olden days i would simply put that code in the code-behind and call it at the same time i was building the order but i want to get a step closer to solid proper architecture so i wanted to get some information

3018808
rss	feed
this seems very counter-intuitive to me as now the xmlns declaration is on almost every line of my rss feed intead of just once in the root element

3018822
folder	directory
take all the directory there and put them in your application s folder

3018843
versioning	upgrade
are you deploying the upgrade to the same location as the old versioning

3018877
int	chars
if one is int and the other is chars you won t get any records from the association and no warnings

3018922
implements	extends
you can implements multiple interfaces but only extends one class

3018945
google-chrome	firefox
no properties of objects will not mysteriously disappear for no reason -- at least not barring implementation bugs which should be easily ruled out by seeing if the same thing happens in ie google-chrome and firefox which each have their own and very different implementations of javascript

3018945
inherited	properties
most but by no means all of the properties objects inherited from their prototypes tend to be functions and so the result of that can seem to be a data-only copy

3018980
width	height
if i create and use this camera and set left top to 0 and width 256 and height 240 anything i render to the screen will use these coordinates

3018980
width	height
so a box with a width and height of 1 if set to 0 0 will take up space from 0 0 to 1 1

3018992
.htaccess	httpd.conf
just make sure you have the appropriate modules enabled in this case mod_rewrite and make sure that in your httpd.conf you allow the directives that you need to be used from the .htaccess files and all should work

3019036
serializable	deserialization
deserialization is harder than serializable

3019059
rubygems	bundler
in this case sequel was installed with bundler not rubygems

3019068
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i have an excel file which can be downloaded..for example name.xlsx well it works in firefox but in webkit safari google-chrome it appends to the name also the extension .xhtml so then name it will be name.xlsx.html it should be only .xlsx

3019070
interpreted-language	compiled-language
and perl like any interpreted-language is much slower than a compiled-language

3019089
google-chrome	firefox
if the portal is misbehaving i recommend clearing your cache and using the latest browser version i personally use google-chrome and firefox regularly on the portal w o issue

3019092
gitolite	gitosis
this isn t quite what i was looking for and i don t think gitosis can do it without some serious scripting but gitolite apparently has a way to have permissions for personal branches

3019112
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it works great in almost all the browsers i ve tested firefox google-chrome safari opera v10 at least and ie 8

3019126
keyup	mouseup
i updated patrick s demo using a bind with mouseup and keyup

3019130
onchange	onsubmit	onmousedown	onmouseup
yes i already see you re missing onmousedown onmouseup onchange onsubmit etc

3019140
x86	64bit
is there significant cpu memory overhead associated with using automatic arrays with g++ intel on 64bit x86 linux platform

3019158
typedef	struct
if you swap the order of the structure definitions moving struct people above the typedef of person it will fail again

3019179
google-chrome	safari
i ve not had this function fail yet -- it works with all the office 2007 2010 files that i ve tried so far in safari windows and google-chrome

3019200
portrait	landscape
however when one loads up the iphone application on an ipad the videos play portrait mode with letterboxing on the top and bottom instead of landscape left like they do on the iphone

3019220
google-chrome	safari
safari and google-chrome also have some built-in debugging tools

3019284
cpu	hyperthreading
note that each physical cpu physical id can have multiple cores core id which can further be broken up into additional logical cpus by hyperthreading

3019307
subnet	packets
that s why i am exchanging broadcast packets with the pc to get a good ip address from my other software running on a pc which knows what the current subnet is even in a network with static ip addresses and no dhcp server

3019313
strlen	substr
you ll want to use strlen in a comparison setting substr to cut it if you need to and the concatenation operator with ... or

3019332
boost	stl
try to put all function definitions in the implementation file and leave the pure declarations for the headers unless of course you re template metaprogramming stl boost etc in which case pretty much everything is in the headers

3019339
cout	cin
in my examples stdin or std cin and stdout std cout were sometimes in utf-8 sometimes iso-8859-2

3019350
accessor	properties
using the dot notation is only possible if the variable has an associated properties declared or if there are key-value-coding compliant accessor methods available

3019350
accessor	properties
the properties syntax allows you to synthesise accessor methods for your variable that are key-value-coding compliant and really this is how the dot notation works

3019386
getter	setter
you re not accessing the instance variable directly the dot notation is only used for getting at properties via the getter and setter methods that you synthesized

3019386
getter	setter
you re sending a message to the object which in this case causes those getter setter methods to get called

3019435
width	height
i ve tought i can create a fixed sized image 200 width x 600 height for example with my personal frame top left bottom right element graphics and in the center a transparency

3019438
getter	setter
you can use the obj.prop getter syntax provided handwavily that the compiler has a prototype for the method call obj prop and the setter syntax provided there s obj setprop blah

3019484
public	protected
i ve come to the conclusion that protected data is just as bad as public data in a class

3019493
put	get
you can put oauth_callback parameter to get request token

3019499
pong	minesweeper
a long time ago netscape 4-era i wrote javascript-based games pong minesweeper and john conway s life among them

3019499
google-chrome	safari
use javascript and html 5 - it should run on google-chrome safari or maybe an ipad

3019516
internationalization	localization
this is useful in localization internationalization

3019526
google-chrome	safari
ie 8 crashes with the following javascript but the same code works fine in ie6 ie7 ie8 ie7mode ff3 google-chrome and safari

3019535
if-statement	while-loop
it jerks a little probably due to my programming logic below it s running a while-loop and constantly checking if-statement so it ends up trying to turn left and right every few milliseconds which explains the jerking part

3019561
firefox	safari
at the time there was no real support for text in canvas so my solution didn t work using excanvas but worked fine on safari and firefox

3019565
tostring	string.format
i have found the former approach using string.format very useful when overriding tostring methods in entity classes

3019598
komodo	aptana
i used eclipse pdt aptana netbeans and komodo

3019601
ienumerable	iqueryable
i believe system.linq is linq-objects specific ienumerable iqueryable etc

3019638
stdout	stderr
this directs what would normally go to stderr to go to stdout instead

3019675
jquery	scriptaculous
my advice would be to look at the jquery ui demo page - - and look at each demo and search for the main one or two keywords from each demo like you would probably do for scriptaculous

3019688
awt	swing
i have done some digging and haven t found any information as to how devices are implemented or plugged into swing awt

3019701
width	height
take a width and a height input and then render the image gradient accordingly so i can save it upload it and then use it in my designs

3019758
stdout	stderr
duplicating stderr to stdout is given in the posix page for dup2 as an example usage of the function

3019777
firefox	safari
in second turn is firefox after that is safari then opera.

3019780
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
in a custom uiviewcontroller if i have a member uinavigationcontroller that i initialize with self as the root view like this

3019809
nuxeo	alfresco
i have not much experience with nuxeo but here is for alfresco

3019809
liferay	alfresco
alfresco and liferay work very well together

3019811
maven	m2e
i am using m2e 0.10.0 maven 3 in projects

3019811
maven	m2e
i can add maven dependency using m2e

3019824
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
you also shouldn t mix uinavigationcontroller with uitabbarcontroller if you want to have a tab bar in a navigationcontroller page you can build a custom uitabbarcontroller

3019829
vmware	virtualbox
virtualbox kvm xen vmware vmware fusion on the macbook etc

3019838
post	get
once i post json data to a url in grails how can i get access to that data inside of the controller

3019845
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i think you need to check all the major browsers at least ie safari firefox google-chrome opera..... and verify that the website looks ok and functions normally

3019846
pull	push
since repositories in a dcvs are all the same you can push pull from any other repository no matter the location

3019867
post	get
you can post whatever you like and get the results in a similar way

3019890
post	put
you can use php input only to read from the standard input if php is being run from the command line or to fetch the request data post or put http request data except for a multipart post

3019899
getter	setter
the jit will inline simple getter and setter - although you shouldn t depend on it to inline anything else in very tight loops - like your blitter.

3019910
range	minimum
it becomes even more complicated to me anyway if i introduce a minimum for the range

3019910
range	minimum
therefore any number i evaluate should be either within range or the minimum value if it s below range and the maximum value if it s above range

3019954
terminate	timeout
i want to limit a block of code and only allow it to run for x seconds after which i will terminate that code block and return a response to the user that the script timeout

3019958
int	boolean
first in c c++ a boolean expression can be converted to an int

3019973
width	margin
inner wrapper position absolute left or margin left -1 2 width of content 480px for a 960px layout

3019975
post	put
looking at the ultracart documentation it looks to me like they aren t passing the the body of the xml in as a post parameter but probably as an http put which is fairly whacky

3019999
min	max
putting it together assuming min max

3020026
awt	swing
i think you need to go beyond what swing awt would typically call an adapter and create the bridge yourself to the graphics device using jni java native interface

3020026
awt	swing
have a look at this wiki page which describes the jni aspects of javas awt layer - there are links in that page to details of jni and swing which are fairly low-level

3020052
min	max
probably the simplest way is to use whatever max and min are available in your language like this

3020052
min	max
in some languages java javascript and c# and probably others max and min are static methods of the math class

3020083
x86	64bit
once you do that you should be able to use the same command line as above with tcouple small changes - for cl you ll have to define d x64 1 or d_amd64_ and for link you ll have to change the machine x86 to machine x64 to produce 64bit version of your program

3020190
width	height
let s say the model of the cube is centered at the origin and is of size 1 length width and height

3020190
width	height
it will take up 1 256th of the width and 1 240th of the height of the viewport see also graphicsdevice.viewport

3020190
xna	spritebatch
you probably want to use xna s spritebatch - not least of all because it s heavily optimised for drawing sprites

3020190
width	height
spritebatch assumes your world space is the same as client space top left is 0 0 width and height are the size of the viewport and handles the projection for you

3020190
xna	spritebatch
it is worth noting that in the new xna 4.0 you can use spritebatch to draw with custom vertex shaders and so you may use arbitrary world-view-project matrices

3020207
mef	prism
after some research i found out that prism and mef are possible solutions to these goals

3020221
postgresql	mysql
env jboss h2 mysql postgresql jpa hibernate 3.3.x

should it be integer or long or should i use the unsigned versions of the above declarations

3020295
rss	feed
i have seen in some browsers firefox for example the rss feed icon gets activated only when a page contains a rss atom feed

3020328
cout	cin
it means basically that you will have a black window that pops up and you can use things like std cout to output to standard output and std cin to get input from that console as well

3020333
aim	instant
check this article talks about status in skype instant messenger status indicator - aim yahoo icq msn skype ...

3020559
width	height
given a specific width i want to find out the height of a qtextdocument

3020559

in other words if the qtextedit that contains the qtextdocument is w wide what is its minimum height h in order to fully display the document without the need for scrollbars

3020631
int	boolean	int	double
int double floats boolean dates etc.

3020646
ant	maven
any idea why i successfully compile with maven ant plugin java project

3020651
inherited	properties
since you don t want the bind all the single properties but only the one you care you can inherited from defaultmodelbinder and then bind the single properties

3020681
postgresql	mysql
in the introductory tutorials it talks about mysql postgresql and sqlite3

3020694
post	get
you may need to post code and more info to get a propper answer

3020711
postgresql	mysql
activerecord rails default orm supports mysql postgresql and sqlite3

3020712
inherited	properties
you may wonder why we need to call the hasownproperty method well that s to ensure that only own properties properties that exist physically on the object the ones we defined are enumerated not any inherited properties

3020729
equals	gethashcode
i need to override the equals and gethashcode methods but that doesnâ t really work

3020729
equals	gethashcode
the problems are in equals and gethashcode where i try to get hashcode or equals from itemtype

3020729
equals	gethashcode
a dirty way to fix it is to capture the nullreferenceexception and return false by equals and return base.gethashcode by gethashcode but i hope there is a better way to fix this problem

3020754
stateless	stateful
here s the thing rest is about stateful communications over a stateless protocol

3020754
post	put
note that i used put not post

3020754
post	put
the postback model pretty well obliterates any real hope of doing true rest with real webforms .aspx put and delete are always post and thus fail the rest model

3020770
client-side	server-side
javascript is a client-side language that runs in the browser node.js notwithstanding and mysql is a server-side technology that runs on the server

3020804
mouse	keyboard
techniques such as preventing the left-click of the mouse intercepting keyboard events or converting your entire article into images just make your website less usable

you can use asterisk and implement an ivr flow using agi php scripts

3020887
jcl	rexx
if the parameters together with the rexx member name exceeds 100 bytes the method mentioned by ron patterson won t work as jcl syntax only allows a maximum paramater length of 100 bytes

3020897

3021107
opera	firefox
and i can t figure out why there are a couple of instances of document.all in the code but my attempts to replace these have broken the code besides the fact it works in firefox and not opera makes me think that document.all is not the issue

3021144
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
opera ie google-chrome firefox will carry over the anchor to the new page

3021151

3021204
versioning	upgrade
the solution is to upgrade to the latest versioning of jquery

3021233
inherited	properties
is faster than the in operator because it doesn t checks for inherited properties

3021275
n-gram	words
in this way your terms will be indexed twice and will appear both as exact words and as n-gram

3021302
inherited	properties
as you may know these two tables have modifieddate and rowguid columns so the person class should not have these properties because it inherited them from the businessentity class

3021302
inherited	properties
my question is how can i modify the model to support inherited and optimistic concurrency on both person and businessentity classes tables on modifieddate properties column

3021350
put	get
just remember to put correct indices on your database table or you will get bad performance

3021377

you can use the contacts- import from vcf function to import contacts from a vcard file

3021509
hide	show
if you want something like the status bar in chrome you just need to have a qframe at the bottom of your windows and show or hide it when you need it

3021509
width	height
frame.setgeometry 0 this- height - frame.sizehint height this- width frame.sizehint height

3021525
parallels	bootcamp
parallels will work with a bootcamp partition but has some drawbacks

3021525
parallels	bootcamp
for me the biggest pain was that parallels vms from a bootcamp part can t be suspended and resumed quickly and easily as ones running off an image file

3021536

this uses both shadow copying so my algorithm would need to be discovering and loading them from the shadow-copy drop folder not from the bin folder and it sets up the privatebinpath as being relative to the base directory

3021643
fiddler	charles
either use wireshark or better is fiddler or charles proxy

3021678

int	double
also i need an angle because the user can rotate these elements so i can also make a int int is okay i do not need a double value therefore

3021784
folder	directory
for simplicities sake take the path name folder from the bin directory in your android project and place it in the above directory

3021786
button	checkbox
you can skin them to look like checkbox if you like but most users know what radio button do and how they are meant to behave

3021797
moq	moles
a cool feature of moles is that it can mock static non-virtual methods and sealed classes which is not possible with frameworks like moq

width	height
width height width height

3021881
google-chrome	firefox
it s only this way in ie8 and works fine in google-chrome and firefox

3021903
width	height
you basically multiply the user s x y coordinates with the width height ratio

3021903
width	height
edit2 in the case of a webpage the safest way would be to record the user s viewport width height and then embed the same webpage in a container like an iframe with that exact size in order to replay the actions

3021919

i certainly haven t seen this problem occur with the latest versioning of tinymce so perhaps you just need to upgrade

3022037
gif	bmp	gif	png	bmp	png
are there software services for automated conversion of a typical image format png bmp jpg gif even to canvas html5

3022051
getter	setter
as far as the arraylist field is concerned you should use a generic strongly typed collection and use a property with getter and setter instead of field for better encapsulation

3022065
hide	show
i think what u basically want to a button show hide which can be controlled at the time of oncreate call

3022187
urdu	arabic
we use arabic characters with little modification like parsi urdu etc

the problem is that i also want the listboxitem to be selected when one of its textbox s child gets focused

3022313
button	checkbox
how can i tell which rows have a checkbox checked upon button submit

3022322
addition	multiplication
it is useful to describe multiplication to someone as repeated addition when you are trying to get him or her to understand the concept but you wouldn t want him or her to continue to think of it that way

3022322
addition	multiplication
you would want him or her to learn the rules of multiplication instead of always translating back to the rules of addition

3022334
nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception
on illegalargumentexception vs nullpointerexception

3022334
nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception
while your original code throws illegalargumentexception on null arguments guava s preconditions.checknotnull throws nullpointerexception instead

3022334
nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception
if a caller passes null in some parameter for which null values are prohibited convention dictates that nullpointerexception be thrown rather than illegalargumentexception

3022341
maven	pom.xml
the maven mindset appears to be that configuration is the responsibility of the pom.xml author not the mojo implementor

3022359
ssl	https
if https is used to work in the admin ssl certificate should be valid

3022372
queue	fifo
there are multiple algorithms available i ended up implementing the an optimistic approach to lock-free fifo queue which avoids the aba problem via pointer-tagging needs the cmpxchg8b instruction on x86 and it runs fine in a production app written in delphi

3022372
queue	fifo
you may also want to look at answers for optimistic lock-free fifo queue impl

3022382
put	get
i get sql logging on standard output when i run unit tests if i put the following line in either config environment.rb or config environments test.rb

3022399

nomatter wich id # i puts in my url i always gets the first tab

3022414
dictionary	map
if i supply the formula value1+value3 value4 100 how can i map the value1 etc to map value1 from the dictionary and calculate the result

3022426
fileinputstream	fileoutputstream
well if what you need to do is really simple you should be able to achieve your goal with java.io.file delete check existence read write etc. and a few stream manipulations with fileinputstream and fileoutputstream

3022430
google-chrome	safari
note that it uses webkit rendering engine so you ll see how the site would look on safari or google-chrome

3022447
post	get
i think what you are after is the message that are displayed when trying to reload refresh or back a page that you have posted data to with a post request in oppose to a get therefor since the post-data might be old information you recieve that warning

3022452
fast-forward	merge
allows subsequent merge from design to production to be a fast-forward one

3022487
int	double
personally i d go with three double however if you say you only need the resolution precision of int then three separate values is a perfectly acceptable solution

3022488
cdr	cons
anyway i m currently learning about lists and before that i learned about cons car and cdr

3022523
cdr	cons
you get a list with 1 2 as the first element the car and 3 4 as the rest the cdr because the first argument to cons is the first element of the list and the second argument is a list containing the remaining items

3022548
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome the height variable increases as the inner div expands to fit all the text

3022554
int	double
without knowing the language grammar i expect you would be better served by having token types for less_than less_than_or_equal and also float double int etc

3022583
srp	principles
s srp single responsibility principles the notion that an object

3022583
ocp	principles
o ocp open closed principles the notion that â œsoftware â should

3022583
lsp	principles
l lsp liskov substitution principles see also design by contract

3022588
yacc	bison
i d like to suggest you to lookup to the flex and yacc aka lex bison tools of the u x operating systems these are powerful parsers and scanners generators that take a grammar and output a compilable and readily usable program

3022603
ant	maven
actually i don t think that wrapping an ant build into a maven project is enough for sonar sonar won t discover your source and output directory

3022625
accessor	properties
in accessor methods for properties

3022629
hide	show
the view will use the bool property to hide or show the control

3022687
int	chars
now if the expression t 0 compiles if 0 can be converted to a t then foo result is sizeof chars 1 and else foo result is sizeof int

3022728
cdr	cons
that s the reason cons a b draws only the car part as a separate list and not the cdr

3022754
width	margin
if that s not possible then giving it margin-left equal to the width of the green box plus its margin will be your best bet

3022758
many-to-many	one-to-many
so securitygroups is in many-to-many relationship with user table and one-to-many with lookupapplciation fk

3022790
accessor	properties
here is the accessor for the default timestamp properties in a core data template project

3022811
width	height
which is better but the width appears to be stretched and the height is messed up

3022812
submit	submission
when submission i d like to submit changes to all of them

3022820
width	height
you can use getdevicecaps getdc getdesktopwindow vertsize to obtain height in millimeters of the physical screen. and similarly with horzsize and the width

3022827
inherited	subclassing
inherited if you have two subclassing

3022841
jtree	jxtreetable
- the one which is easier to explain is that in jtree embedded within a jxtreetable i no longer have leaf file icon but gray bullet instead..

3022864
getter	setter
so i m hosting a project of mine on codeplex where i use a very jquery-esque technique for defining properties self-contained getter setter functions very similar to the one you re using

3022864
getter	setter
take notice that the property is a single function where providing a value as the first parameter invokes the setter and leaving out the parameter invokes the getter

3022903
subclass	accessor
so instead of getting into trouble and inconvenience with overwriting accessor in my nsmanagedobject subclass couldn t i simply do something like this

3022921
textblock	itemscontrol
details area is just a stackpanel with a itemscontrol wrapping textblock which repeats 6 times

3022934
ready	each
i develop my app in linux for both unix and win32 cross compile at each build platforms so a ready to use function would be nice

3022954
width	height
how can i customize override an existing style sheet provided in jquery ui like changing the colors and width and height of sliders

3022964
int	chars
chars should be of type int or better

3022981
post	get
meanwhile if i figure it out before i get a response i ll post my own answer.

3022998
listview	gridview
if yes in my opinion it s pretty slow so i ended up using listview with gridview

3022999
folder	directory
i did it more than a year ago so i m not totally sure if it has to be directly in the directory or under a folder called plugins

3023001
persistent	transient
if i interpret this as how do i add a method that is not related to persistent then you need to use the transient annotation on the getallchildnodes method

3023024
put	get
here is a fairly common validation to ensure you don t get nonsensical dates put into a timestamp

3023030
ssl	https
https and ssl in general is there to stop third parties anything other than server or client from being able to read the data exchange

3023047
pull	push
this will create a local branch abranchname tracking fetch pull push the remote branch abranchname

3023077
nsmutablestring	nsstring
also it returns an nsstring instead of an nsmutablestring which is not a big deal but i feel that if you say you are returning an immutable object you probably should

3023098
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
in firefox i get and while in safari and google-chrome i get but

3023138
x86	64bit
one possibility your programm is compiled with x64 or anycpu on a 64bit machine but the dll has been compiled with support for x86 only

3023144
width	height
i should always set width and height could be determined by the server when the user posts the image - would work as long as the image doesn t change.

3023145
persistent	transient
short answer you define them as transient of an undefined type and then store their values in one or more persistent attributes

3023208
pull	push
however i must be missing something because i don t understand how two msysgit clients on different windows machines can push and pull to each other directly

3023224
pull	push
you can use the local protocol a simple shared path is enough for two git repositories on two pc on the same lan to push pull from each other

3023282
google-chrome	firefox
in my app i send down a deep tree and it fails in google-chrome but succeeds in firefox

3023348
put	get
the out put i get for the above is

3023360
radiobuttonlist	checkboxlist
i have two radiobuttonlist and one checkboxlist on the page

3023384
submit	submission
when the user select a value the form will automatically submit i want the item that the user has selected to be selected after submission the form

3023409
int	boolean
and you could use a boolean or int return type depending on which scenario you have

3023455
postgresql	mysql
likewise you can find similar information about postgresql and mysql

3023507
put	get
stanford university have put up an excellent series of lectures for free from their iphone course that will get you up to speed with iphone development with a few assignments to do on the side this is good because it offers some structure to your learning

3023544
fgets	fgetc
maybe you should use fgets instead of fgetc while youre reading lines

3023596
macvim	textmate
is there any way to get macvim to scroll more smoothly textmate style

3023673
updatepanel	scriptmanager

3023710
sorting	filtering
performance is there an advantage to using a smaller n when selecting filtering and sorting on the data

3023748
maven	m2e
i am not sure if m2e import a maven project internally using maven-eclipse-plugin to convert into an eclipse project

3023763
doxygen	miktex	graphviz	miktex
neither do i want to have to go to all the web pages and check manually if there are compatibility issues with the new version of doxygen graphviz and the latest version of miktex for example nor do i want to have to navigate to the download pages and run the setups all by myself

3023765
mouseup	mousedown
using settimeout defers the execution until the call stack is empty again which would be when the browser has finished processing all the events that happened when you clicked mousedown mouseup click focus etc

3023776
width	margin
so i think you could bind the margin of the help menuitem to the width of the menu

3023776
width	margin
but you would have to use a converter to calculate the margin from the width

3023794
junit	jsfunit
the jsfunit faq says currently you can use the junit 4 jar but annotations such as test will not work

3023816
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i m wondering if the behaviour differs for each version of google-chrome firefox safari and opera

3023826
jsf	seam
i d considered spring.mvc and seam as framework alternatives and jsp jstl and facelets jsf as view technologies before realising the cms may drive this choice

3023836
updatepanel	scriptmanager
i have an asp.net site that uses jquery and asp.net updatepanel and scriptmanager

3023864
nsurlrequest	nsmutableurlrequest
you re initializing a nsurlrequest instead of a nsmutableurlrequest

3023965
inherited	subclassing	abc	subclassing
abcs allow classes that don t actually inherited from them to be registered as subclassing anyway so that such classes can be subclassing of the abc for such checks

3023977
rank	max
the table will usually have 30-40 rows max but if the user drags row 1 far down the list then potentially all the rows would need to be updated to update the rank field

3024045
folder	directory
this gives you a set of all the files in the containing folder without any of the hidden .svn directory

3024053
portrait	landscape
are you drawing this background in portrait or landscape mode

3024053
width	height
the gldrawtexioes parameters are x y z width height and since every other part of your code seems to reference those numbers as 320x480 that might be contributing to the cropped incorrectly problem - try switching the 320 and 480 in the cropping rectangle and the width height in the gldrawtex call

3024067
width	height
if you are trying to get the value of the height and width immediately after setting insance.htmltext you are not going to get the calculated size of the container

3024130
wadl	wsdl
the most popular usage of wsdl and wadl in the same way is code generation

3024213
range	max	range	min	min	max
i personally used the range filter and the internal datetime timestamps for max min

wordpress	phpbb
it s the world s most popular database software it s what they use in wordpress phpbb and drupal

3024312
sorting	filtering
note that i talk of a list to select an item from but actually it is some more complex structure that allows quick sorting and filtering that is also the reason why i do not use an itemscontrol here but i don t feel like that s relevant for the question

3024343
folder	directory
as javax.media is a jvm extension javac would look either in the jvm s extensions directory or that provided by -extdirs then in user class folder then in user source folder

3024349
int	chars
oh keep in mind that the array is of type int and is full of numerical representations of ascii chars

3024360
int	chars
since your array is of type then -- assuming that each element represents a single ascii chars -- you ll need to convert those int s to byte s first

3024392
int	chars
the first like skips 1000 int takes them while they re not a null-terminator and then converts them to a chars as appropriate for int representing ascii codes

3024405
decoder	encoder	stateless	stateful
yes it should be safe to use the same encoding object as it s designed to be stateless - whereas encoder and decoder are stateful maintaining incomplete characters etc if necessary

3024409

3024528
post	get
if you do not want use sessions as matthew suggested you can pass post params in get to the new page consider some limitations such as security and max length of get params in query string

3024528
post	get
anyway consider passing your data from post in get to the proper view in case data is not sensitive of course

3024538
versioning	upgrade
when we decide to update a dependency project we release it to ourselves which requires manual tagging manual copying current.zip into a releases area and giving it a versioning number and copying that into the build of the projects that depend on the upgrade

3024570
pull	push
you will have to set up your own deployer which can pull the updated code out of these branches and push them to stage

3024602
division	modulo
division and modulo may help you

3024604
erlang	lisp
i d recommend learning a functional language such as erlang lisp or perhaps certain aspects of python

hash	salt
you need to store the salt in the database along with the password hash

3025497
jar	manifest.mf
you should build a jar that s an osgi bundle so it contains the required manifest.mf with a plug-in id and a version number this does not change the fact that the jar remains executable

3025534
folder	directory
instead of grabbing the last folder name i actually wanted to find everything up until some known directory name

3025542

width	height
also make sure that the height and width of things are specified such that the layout doesn t change as things are downloaded this makes the site feel slow

hash	salt
the salt is a static thing that you generate when you create you user record and you store it along with the user id and the hash of the password + salt

3025705
hash	salt
when the user tries to logon you use the id to lookup the salt combine that with their password hash it and compare to the stored hash

3025705
hash	salt
the salt exists so that an attacker with access to your security database cannot pre-prepare a database of password - hash mappings and then perform simple reverse lookups to try to determine passwords

3026110
int	double
i am now trying to convert the nsdata object into a primitive array array of double int short ...

3026598
jar	manifest.mf
the manifest.mf file in your jar can only have one main-class entry

hash-collision	key
a less trivial explanation though is that in sql server and other servers too the locked key are hashed and there is a pretty significant hash-collision probability

3026728
firefox	safari
just now i feel stuck with it and can t find a proper solution to make it work in all browsers it does work properly only in firefox while in ie and safari its elements are somehow apart from each other

3026956
javassist	cglib
since i know the jar is fine as the unit and integration tests run against it i thought it might be a problem with javassist so i tried cglib

the bytecode provider then shows as cglib but i still get the exact same stack trace with javassist present in it

3027022
mouse	keyboard
if what you really want is any changes that occur between the time the user clicks the mouse or uses the keyboard in this application and the time the application goes idle you can implement this

i ve used tools for converting a vb6 project into vb.net - which you would hope would be perhaps one of the simpler examples of this sort of thing

3027877
free	malloc
also i very recently checked in the standard library a sealed array and sealed binary heap implementation that use reference counting malloc free and deterministic destruction instead of garbage collection see

3027957
google-chrome	firefox
the above works on google-chrome and also firefox 20 and above

3027974
single-quotes	double-quotes
if you replace the double-quotes with single-quotes it works as expected

3027990

3028114
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
additionally you would need to view generated source with a browser plugin or inspect the node with web inspector on safari google-chrome or firebug on firefox in order to see the change that you made with javascript

3028175
fink	macports
i just went through my first migration to a new mac last week including a switch from fink and system perl to macports and custom perl so i remember the pain all too well.

filtering	grouping
it used jcifs ntlm filtering for the java authentication piece so there was never a need to sign onto an application explicitly the users login credentials were exchanged between their pcs and the web application under the hood and their ad grouping was membership retrieved to inform their j2ee roles with the application then controlling access to the database in much the same way an ntlm authenticated asp page was handled

3028519
post	get
i can display post by using the standard wpdb query but then i don t get the other features like paging

3028565
stdout	stderr
if you want both stdout and stderr use

3028565
stdout	stderr
the first sends all output destined for file handle 2 stderr to file handle 1 stdout then pipes that through grep

3028565
stdout	stderr
first stderr is redirected to the current stdout then stdout is redirected to dev null

3028573
stdout	stderr
if you are asking how to redirect stderr to stdout so you can use it in a pipe there are two ways i know of

3028582

i am trying to mapp pojo class to mongodb using morphia-0.93-snapshot.jar but it is throwing exception that java.lang.noclassdeffounderror org bson types codewscope which is bson s exception.so i am not able to run those programs.so please can anybody help me to solved this problem

3028601
expander	grid
when the height of the expander is very large the row overflows out of the grid

3028608
post	get
you might not end up with the most optimal of sql queries but if you get an array of all the post ids you want to use by using your own sql first then using wp_query along with the arguments post__in and posts_per_page wordpress will handle everything for you including sql limits pagination and so forth

3028609
post	get
so when the user will click submit the browser will issue a request to the webserver which in turn will call your application passing to it the various post get parameters related to the form

3028609
post	get
your application then can process the data extracting such parameters from the environment variables if the data is passed using the get method or from the standard input if the post method is used

3028621
google-chrome	firefox
to inspect it you have a few options if you re using firefox firebug or google-chrome you can log it to the console like this

3028934
printf	strtol	printf	atoi	strtol	atoi
just to say not-in-place reversion you should prefer the use of strtol or strtoul instead of atoi and implement also itoa since afaik that is not standard too you could use printf anyway if the base is 10

3028986
antivirus	norton
as i m beta testing norton antivirus 2011 it brought to my attention that my app that i m developing triggered a high cpu usage warning on at least one cpu

3028995
post	put
one way to do it would be to put an msbuild script entry into the project properties-- build events -- pre or post build event dialog which would handle copying your eldos sbb libraries for you

3029006
ati	nvidia
on nvidia display lists work quite well but on ati a display list is little different from multiple calls to glvertex

3029020
put	get
if you are ok with keeping every cookie in memory during operations simply pickle ing the jar is simplest and of course put the blob in the db and get it back from there when you re restarting -- gives you a big byte string for the whole jar and policy thereof of course not just the cookies and rebuilds it once you ve reloaded s as a blob from the db

3029027

i m writing a little application for my blackberry and i need to send some data to a webpage via get or post

3029076
children	parent
adding a new child updating an existing child or deleting a child has no effect on the parent object so there s no need for the parent to know explicitly about all the children except when it comes time to pay college tuition

3029076
children	parent
however removing the parent has an adverse effect on the children objects as they need to be deleted or re-parented otherwise are orphaned and in an invalid state

3029083
post	get
the linked javadoc contains basic code examples for both get and post

3029103
hash	md5
the md5 hash suggestion you had is very good - it s documented in high performance mysql 2nd ed

3029112
getter	setter
while i agree that typically a pojo setter getter doesn t necessarily need a test i believe it is nice to have the simple test there because as things change over time it will make it easier for you to add more tests for the pojo s

3029112
getter	setter
the unit test is set up the methods are there to test the setter getter all you have to do is handle the new complexity

3029118
client-side	server-side
using validation properly both server-side and client-side you re able to implement a solution that doesn t rely on javascript to check if an option has been properly selected

3029135
ati	nvidia
query the total memory usage of opengl using nvidia or ati specific extensions

3029153

injecting an ejb from a jar into a jax-rs class in a war

3029243
post	get
if you post the code from the idle event handler you may get more help

3029277
stdout	stderr
i think you could close stdout with fclose stdout but apparently the constants stdin stdout and stderr no longer exist

3029367
boost	stl
for memory use autopointers stl boost or make your own it isn t hard

3029386
int	boolean
if you didn t use override you may have defined int hashcode or boolean equals key neither of which would do what is required

3029405
post	get
the request.setcharacterencoding has only effect on the request body post not on the request uri get

3029421
implements	extends
the basic solution i adopted is to navigate the window object and to save all its descendant properties using json as base format for exportation and extends it to implements some features

3029422
width	height
how do you auto-resize a large image so that it will fit into a smaller width div container whilst maintaining it s width height ratio

it seems common in the rails community at least to respond to successful post put or delete requests by redirecting instead of returning success

3029557
uiview	uiwindow
a nib file consists in your imagination of class names such as uiwindow uiview uibutton whatever along with instructions for how to instantiate these classes and configure the instances make this uibutton a round rect with the title tap me

3029640

this happened to me with tablesorter 2.0 i was using it then i needed the filtering but theirs kinda sucked so i found datatables what had such a bigger api and developed more

3029676
union	distinct
edit union should make each select distinct by default

3029688
jsf	wicket	jsf	tapestry	tapestry	wicket
the other category the component based frameworks like wicket tapestry jsf or asp.net web forms have become more popular over the last years but my perception is that the traditional action based approach is far more popular

3029706
hide	show
the display css property is built into a lot more methods .show and hide for starters among many others for example you can t just call .slidedown anymore to show the element

3029722
ubuntu	linux
i m a newbie to linux systems and recently i started using ubuntu 10.04

3029762
vaadin	wicket
the component based frameworks will be the final winners like gwt vaadin or wicket

3029764
put	get
if you put all the replicate nodes under one operating system then you no longer have the bandwidth constraint the data transfer speed would be much higher that what you would get if those replicate dbs are on different sites

3029765
post	get
i ve tried both using method get and post only change is in development.log

3029781
jsf	wicket	jsf	tapestry	tapestry	wicket
wicket tapestry jsf or asp.net web

i may just need a terminology update but i have been playing in magento and joomla and they do references like

3029821
vaadin	uibinder
i say this from the bottom of my heart after spending days trying to get things work out the way my team and client wanted both technically and visually even after the release of uibinder vaadin came to me like a light in the end of the tunnel

3029821
command-pattern	presenter
after writing almost a thousand boilerplate actions for command-pattern another thousand presenter and views and another thousand event handlers etc

3029824
google-chrome	firefox
is there a way i can programmatically determine the status of a download in google-chrome or mozilla firefox

3029833
folder	directory
by placing the disp function inside a private folder you override the built-in function with the same name yet this version is only visible to functions in the parent directory thus maintaining the original functionality in other places

3029840
freebsd	linux	freebsd	solaris	ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	freebsd
on unix-like operating systems including ubuntu other linux distributions mac os x solaris freebsd etc. you normally store everything under your home directory typically home username in ubuntu and many other unix-like oses where username is ofcourse your username

3029869
google-chrome	firefox
i don t know about google-chrome but recent versions of firefox keep the download records in a sqlite database downloads.sqlite in your profile directory

3029887
moq	typemock
most mocking frameworks including moq i think but i don t use it myself do not dictate how the fakes are passed to the class under test typemock isolator is an exception here in that it has magic that can inject the dependencies into the class under test

3029887
moq	nmock
there s no reason why you couldn t use an ioc to register your moq-created fakes and supply them to your class under test but that really has nothing to do with moq or nmock or rhino mocks

3029969
decoder	encoder
so i have some other full example of encoder and decoder

3029997
hash	md5
hash uri with md5 or sha1 and that s all

3030014
getter	setter
my problem is that i know our application will grow substantially in the future and writing all the getter setter serialization factories etc

3030014
getter	setter
i ve then written an annotation processor to preprocess my shared models and generate an implementing class with all the getter setter serialization lazy-loading etc

3030020
chunked	transfer-encoding
edit this is the intended behavior after all - nick points out that the files are being transferred with the transfer-encoding chunked header

3030036
stateless	stateful
secondly when contemplating converting an access app for deployment in the web browser the whole application model is different from stateful to stateless and so it s not just a matter of a few access features that are unsupported but of a completely different fundamental model of how the ui objects interact with the data

3030067
hide	show
for example when i hide one and show another widget in same place.

int	double
in templates.h i will have to nm_template_declare_list int nm_template_declare_list double while in templates.c i will need to nm_template_define_list int nm_template_define_list double in order to have the code behind a list of int double and so on generated

3030086
dictionary	map
instead of this looping for match approach you could use a real map dictionary whatever is called in stl from string to number and then switch on that number as the above example

3030125
post	get
if this answer doesn t help you can post real example maybe we ll get better idea why you need this done like that

superclass	subclassing
however does this refer to the subclassing man or the superclass person when the person object receives it

3030258
free	malloc
for the specific example of containers i wouldn t bother - just create a list with void data in it and either use malloc and free to create the data or give the list have a pair of function pointers to create and destroy values

3030329
innodb	myisam
increase your buffers innodb your key_buffers myisam and some query cache buffers

3030353
int	chars
i have a bunch of int ranging from 1 to 999 and i need to convert these into strings but when i do that i need them to be 3 chars long

3030395
range	minimum
if they should all have the same minimum maximum range then they should all be parameterized with the same model values controlling the comment validation

3030434
int	boolean
public boolean addall int index collection

3030434
int	boolean
public boolean addall int index collection

3030440
post	get
if you receive numerical values from for example a form you just need to ensure data quality by converting the input into a number any input from get or post are always regarded as strings by php unless you convert them and any malicious code will be removed

3030455
getter	setter
now xcode generates getter and setter methods for you that will handle the retain statement for you

3030553
post	get
you realise that varybyparam creates a new entry in the outputcache for each varying parmateter set in the http get post querystring

this is working fine when i am adding two int or two double

3030697
int	double
how do i get it to add and int and a double and return the double

3030709
tunnel	vpn
using a ssh vpn tunnel so that the one connects to the db via the middle server seems to remove any possible benefit of maintaining middle

3030743
int	double
now when you add a double and an int what do you expect

3030743
int	double
your users should because you re casting the double back to an int thus losing the fractional part

3030760
int	double
you can define overloads for all the possible combinations of all the instantiations of the template so you d effectively have operators defined for double + double int + double double + int etc.

3030764
hash	salt
either the salt is wrong your password is wrong or the hash somehow got screwed up

3030786
equals	gethashcode
if you are creating a custom list type then you could override the equals and gethashcode methods to support this behavior but it isn t going to happen on the built in types

3030807
integer	unsigned
oh and in production code you ll probably want to properly namespace that and add something for signed unsigned mismatches in integer types

3030830
setinterval	settimeout
if so then you can just pop lines off the array using settimeout which is better than setinterval for most animations

3030841
getter	setter
you can use an anemic approach attributes plus getter and setter to keep things simple and avoid the step of writing business logic in the same step

3030859
google-chrome	firefox
this doesn t work in any browser i ve tried it with ie firefox google-chrome

3030936
uwsgi	cherokee
i am trying to get started from the documentation on both uwsgi and cherokee websites

3030960
post	put
the docs for uploading have a complete example of the headers multipart-related formatting and xml you would be sending with the addition of the access control tags as per this part of the docs -- but the example is a post not a put because it s uploading a video not changing its info and access control

3030960
post	put	post	get	put	get
to send http methods other than get and post via python s standard library use httplib make an httpconnection and then call its request method with put as the first argument then url the part after the host see the examples at the end of this section of the python online docs body the part that in the example in the docs for the youtube 2.0 api starts

3030972
pop-up	dialog

3031016
struts	wicket
the browser interfaces have been ported from struts 1.x to wicket

3031041
int	chars
i understand that the amount of chars in the string will make the int increase greatly forcing the value to become a long not an int

3031049
mouseup	mousedown
when the drop shadow is added i can only mousedown to drag and mouseup to drop the sprite if the mouse events occur within the original location of the sprite when it was added to the stage

3031068
put	get
also you can put in front of the person s name and they will get a message flag

3031068
width	height
normally hidden content has a height and width of zero

3031068
width	height
but jquery is able to determine the hidden content size but it still has some problems because you might need to limit the width or height of the hidden content

3031068
width	height
so what i ended up doing was adding the hidden content in a inside of the box and adding a data-size attribute to the box which contains the width and height of the expanded hidden content for example

folder	directory
in terms of a directory structure for an analysis project i ll often also have the following folder

3031581
getter	setter
create a getter and setter for session and use lazy initialization in the getter

3031590
persistent	transient
you can solve this problem by declaring your custom getter as transient that says this getter does not represent a persistent property

3031598
chunked	transfer-encoding
it s possible it s being served using transfer-encoding chunked which is a perfectly legitimate way of transferring responses over http

3031616
min	max
heap is needed for priority queue for example getting the min max element will cost o 1 inserting an element o log n

versioning	upgrade
tapestry has done a lot of non-compatible upgrade with no continuation of support of older versioning

3031774
rss	feed
i have a class dataimporter which has the code to download an rss feed

3031803
client-side	server-side
it all boils down to server-side - you are in control client-side - public so prone to abuse

3031851
cvs	svn
as far as i know there is an option in cvs2svn which stores the cvs revision in an svn property

3031862
postgresql	mysql
between postgresql and mysql postgresql copied the syntax limit from mysql in v6.5 and added the offset syntax it may be that that was copied as well but i think mysql only had the comma-syntax back then

3031880
int	double
now for example if you add double and int it will yield double as the result

3031884

parses the string argument as a signed integer in the radix specified by the second argument

3031957
put	get
i want to ask how to get a json file from the server that has more recent messages and put them to the top i mean above the first

3031962
put	get
the only sane way i can see is to put it in dialoga b but i would then need to pass the controller all the way down through classes that dont even need it and it ll get all spaghetti

3031995
short	base
in short you can t use .live like this it has to follow a selector base of some sort this is from the .live docs

3032009
hide	show
depending on this id value we either show or hide the with the end date

3032012
int	double
you could use an int or a double to store a distance but then you have to add some more information to make the value make sense for example naming the variable distanceinmeters

3032022
maven	m2e
but when i do the depency search from my m2e plugin i see only results from the official maven repo why

3032048
savefiledialog	openfiledialog
no luck they are only enabled for openfiledialog not savefiledialog

3032076
int	chars
i m new to the c++ so maybe someone can say what the proper way to write a function that gets a string chars represents number and converts it to the int number

3032085
ada	pascal
in a language with strict range checking such as ada or pascal the method might be implemented as pseudo code

3032090
disk	ram
when you program trying to access a memory location that is not currently loaded to ram a page fault occur and the page is brought from the disk

3032109
oncreate	recreate
after the user switches back to my activity its oncreate method is invoked again and tabs are recreate

3032122
hide	show
i also have the problem want main window with child window user controls to show hide on button click from the mainwindow.

3032122

so should i create them all in the same place let s say grid column and then male them show hide by property binding

3032126
pull	push
publication push pull

3032138
apache	nginx
use a cluster of mongrel services for which loads of alternatives exist mongrel-cluster or using apache nginx .

3032170
hide	show
i can hide the windows althought i have to call one of the methods two times with sw_hide option but when i call the method with a sw_show flag it simply doesn t show

3032173
disk	ram
there may be less ram installed 1 gb than there is address space 4 gb therefore some stuff the least-recently-used stuff may be swapped out by the o s from ram onto a page file on disk

3032173
disk	ram
free some ram by swapping something least-recently-used from ram to disk

3032173
disk	ram
swap into ram from disk whatever is supposed to be at that address which at some time in the past had been swapped out from that address to disk

3032188
keydown	keyup
you can test it a bit here keep in mind this fires on blur usually though you may want the keyup keydown or keypress events rather than change if you re looking to do it per character

3032207
dictionary	map
i use a dictionary to map this id to the client sockets file descriptor

3032222
cvs	svn
as khmarbaise says to keep a record of the old cvs revision numbers in svn use the --cvs-revnums flag when converting

3032222
cvs	svn
keeping the cvs revision numbers as an svn property on the revision seems like a good idea but in my experience they never get used

3032224
scheme	racket
so invoking it requires a single value as racket requires which helps clarifying what happens here mit scheme seems to silently treat it as unspecified

3032315
firefox	safari
i needed to use .replacewith data instead of .html data . evidently firefox was compensating for this but safari wasn t

3032327
free	realloc
for example i ve seen implementations of realloc the c standard one which checks to see if the current block can just absorb a free block following it

3032328

3032375
nsstring	nsdata
both of the classes have nsstring and nsinteger maybe also nsdata and nsdate

3032407
ironruby	ironpython
ironpython and ironruby ship with the source code for the .net 4.0 implementation of system.linq.expressions

3032430
public	protected
however it can still be indirectly instantiated as a protected private member of a public class

3032459
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
i am building a custom uinavigationcontroller not subclassing it i subclass uiviewcontroller for this i would like to have the instances of uiviewcontroller that are added to my custom navigationcontroller to get a reference to the custom navigation controller when they access the self.navigationcontroller

3032459
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
you would from a uiviewcontroller that belong to a uinavigationcontroller do this to push a new view controller to the stack

3032459
navigationcontroller	pushviewcontroller
so in the above case when it is the custom navigation controller getting a controller pushed to it it will in the pushviewcontroller method set the navigationcontroller to the custom controller it self so that when the newly added view controller does self.navigationcontroller it will also get a reference to the custom nav-controller

3032459
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
but his approach runs into the issue mentioned above i have no way to get a reference to the custom uinavigationcontroller owning the pushed uiviewcontroller from within these added controllers

3032473
hide	show
you ll have to register an onchange event handler to your dropdown list so that when it s value changes you ll check if it s current selected item is the one you want and then show the input or hide it otherwise

3032538
folder	directory
store it in user data folder which are usually hidden under the user s profile directory

3032571
trie	tree
i am building a suffix trie unfortunately no time to properly implement a suffix tree for a 10 character set

3032610
.htaccess	httpd.conf
setting in .htaccess or httpd.conf would be easy - but i don t have access to that

3032628
maven	m2e
using eclipse 3.5 when i create a new maven project m2e automatically adds j2se1.4 to libraries and compiler compliance level to 1.4 project properties java compiler

3032649
ant	maven
i am not sure if you can easily hook it into a svn precommit hook filter but integration into maven could be done with an ant call like this taken from this demo.xml build script

3032684
accelerometer	gyroscope
if you are relying on hardware features such as camera compass gyroscope accelerometer for your application you d need a device that has this feature as the emulator does not them

3032714
post	get
to get your fields passed as query string parameters instead of form post data

3032728
junit	easymock
however if you really want classic unit tests i guess the closest you can get is compiling your jsp into a servlet class then calling the servlet methods directly from junit using a mocking framework like easymock to prepare the http request response etc

3032786
min	max
as long as and it always should be it s impossible for randx to be both less than or equal to min and greater than or equal to max

3032786
min	max
instead you can get a value in between min and max using

3032790
uwsgi	cherokee
so the way this works is that cherokee is managing a running uwsgi instance in the back ground for you

3032790
uwsgi	cherokee
what i ve noticed so far and i ve not finished looking at is that if you shut down cherokee it doesn t seem to also shut down running uwsgi instances

3032790
uwsgi	cherokee
so your app code is actually run via uwsgi and cherokee is more like a proxy server

3032790
uwsgi	cherokee
that should cause uwsgi to update to your app changes regardless of cherokee

3032815
mongoid	mongomapper
i would expect performance to be the same last time i checked mongomapper lacked rails 3 support - so i am looking at mongoid for now

3032822
inherited	subclassing
work in the constructor such as creating initializing collaborators communicating with other services and logic to set up its own state removes seams needed for testing forcing subclassing mocks to inherited unwanted behavior

3032849
profiling	debugging
if you just specified the mirror element with repository manager location and what repositories urls you want to proxy without that profiling enabled which is practically changing policy for getting snapshots you would have something like central repository disabled messages in your debugging log

3032849
maven	pom.xml
if this works then the reason must be either in maven settings or pom.xml definition

3032854
hash	md5
suppose i have any long hash like a 16 bytes md5 or a 20 bytes sha1

3032916
maven	m2e
in other words you need to configure the maven compiler plugin for 1.6 level compliance and then m2e will derive the appropriate settings under eclipse

3032916
m2e	pom.xml
the pom.xml is the master not m2e

3032920
maven	m2e
this thread reminds us about the difference between m2e within eclipse and a maven script

3032920
m2e	pom.xml
one thing worth to mention that this only applies to the development mode when m2e is configuring eclipse tools such as jdt ajdt and wtp according to the configuration from pom.xml

3032927
put	get
if you put your class in mycompany.collections.generic then you ll get exactly the same level of seamlessness that is achieved by the .net framework itself

3032949
put	get
however if i don t put it around single quotes i ll always get a javascript error when no user is logged in because the syntax is invalid -

3032956
organization	naming
slapping everything into system is a lot like naming all of your variables x or temp and implies that the creator doesn t really understand the point of this level of code delineation and organization

3032966
gif	png
android supports png gif and jpg - i would choose either png or jpg with preferences for jpg since this is presumably a photograph

3032968
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome firefox and the like have it and don t require the client-side code to do anything special

3032974
iprincipal	iidentity
the current authenticated user should be the name in the iidentity assigned to the identity of the iprincipal on the user property of the httpcontext

3033017
getter	setter
but you define properties as getter and or setter functions for the class

3033017
getter	setter
actually you don t even need a variable for a setter getter

3033017
getter	setter
as3 reference on getter and setter

3033023
put	get
and if you actually put a double cast like that into a real project then you deserve to get your ass kicked

3033042
put	get
ps last time i asked similar question but put it wrongly so people got misunderstood and i didn t get my answer

3033073
google-chrome	firefox
i have built a gwt application which runs perfectly in firefox and google-chrome

3033097
width	height
when i start the second activity it sets the background as a gradient occupying the entire window space that is it appears to be fill_parent d for both height and width

3033146
free	malloc
only to get malloc error for object 0x100108e98 incorrect checksum for free object - object was probably modified after being freed. as far as i understand this error memory has already been allocated for this object but i don t see where this happened

3033204
int	double
int to long float or double

3033212
integer	unsigned
but if you are trying this way to know the max value a n bit unsigned integer can have you change 0 into the known value treating n 64 as a special case and you are not able to give a result for n 64 on hardware with 64bit integer unless you use a multiprecision bignumber library

3033223
button	checkbox
i usually use it to detect changes in forms select unselect checkbox and submit them automatically without having to click on submit button which is hided

3033236
google-chrome	safari
because google-chrome and safari are both based on webkit you can try to change the line to to see if that works

3033331
awt	swing
mvc was quite simple with swing but awt and it s paint methods are much more complicated

3033353
min	max
sorting time in stack is o nlog n while you can extract element of maximum priority max min in o log n time

3033362
jruby	rubinius	ironruby	rubinius
and even if they did their compiled methods are vastly different rubinius s compiled methods are rubinius bytecode yarv s compiled methods are yarv bytecode jruby s compiled methods are jvm bytecode ironruby s compiled methods are dlr trees

3033376
versioning	upgrade
all you have to do is import this category copy paste this category into the classes where you want the upgrade uiimage versioning

3033382
awt	swing
view should be just swing or awt classes

3033387
cpython	ironpython
it s possible that jython and ironpython are much faster than cpython as well as they are backed by heavily optimized virtual machines jvm and .net clr

3033407
put	get
edit based on some answers i get here i put this

3033419
children	parent
the master class manages all the children why did i pick master and child instead of parent child or master slave

3033459
cos	sin
most people know that sin cos of 45 is one over root two so normalizing 1 -1 0 will give an easily recognisable value

3033471
affinity	processors
in windows i can set the processors affinity of driver code using kesetsystemaffinitythread and check which processors my code is running on using kegetcurrentprocessornumber

3033526
setinterval	settimeout
using settimeout instead of setinterval allows you to stop the animation with cleartimeout and the use of a variable

3033534
post	get
depending on whether or not your form uses the get or post method you ll have to change the variable name appropriately

3033535
post	get
if you post the form then the variable will be if you get the form default then it will be

3033562
queue	fifo
you can use the existing fifo std queue

3033584
post	get
can i get the verseid from the url and the post the values from the form in the same page

3033584
super	implements
remember i am new at php and probably won t implements a solution that is super hard

3033584
put	get
i have to get it for my to put it in my site

3033585
queue	fifo
for example if the container is a fifo queue the pointer would reference the next node in the queue

3033592
uilabel	uibutton
uilabel uicolors uibutton etc. the instantiation of uielements is just taking up space complicating matters and if you need to change a button or color that is used in 14 places it is really bad to have written all the setup code in different places

3033592
initializer	class-method
because these are all class-method i don t need to initializer the isinterfaceelement class to use them

3033601
queue	fifo
for fifo look into std queue

3033602
post	get
verseid id_of_the_verse this way when an user submits a reply in the post array will be the reply related data and in the get the id of the verse

3033608
filesystems	ntfs
...of course you ll still have a problem because now all of your ten million files will be in a single directory and in my experience ntfs a directory with more than a few thousand files in it still over-taxes the filesystems

3033609
post	get
the method of a form in a html page can be post and the action url can contain get arguments being something like so to say

3033611
post	get
yes it is possible to mix both get and post values with one request

3033611
post	get
the problem you have is probably that you pass the get value to reply.php which then passes post values to postreply.php

3033611
post	get
you can do this by either specifying the get value in the action parameter of the form tag or you could even switch to a post value with that by adding a to the form

3033619
notepad++	gedit
i was wondering if it was possible to group organize conditional statement blocks in gedit in much the same manner as notepad++ via a plug-in or other means

3033718
cgal	gpc
cgal and gpc are only free if my own project is free

3033718
cgal	gpc
but i may want to use my code for a future commercial project so i m hesitant about cgal s open source licenses and gpc s freeware-only restriction

3033754
hide	show
the below code enables me to show and hide row data categorized as quo and cal eventually there will be other categories

3033755

3033841
int	double
when execution subsequently arrives at b ci.get will return a double object---the one that was passed in a ---were the declaration of ci says that its get method is guaranteed to return an int

3033857
super	extends
replace all occurrences of extends with super in your declarations including the one you omitted in the loop and it compiles

3033873
google-chrome	firefox
here is what i see in firefox google-chrome ie

3033906

3034047
solaris	bsd
i believe the question is platform-independent and would have the same answer as if to do the same thing on a nix bsd solaris system

3034049
folder	directory
i don t know if i got the regular expression search and replace syntax exactly right but the point is you already have a good project you should be able to cut paste regex-replace it to get the same set of files only referenced from a different folder and with the same directory structure

3034086
config	ini
it then reads in config data from a ini file and stores this in the site object

3034108
folder	directory
if you re using bundler it ll download it into a seperate folder hidden in your home directory

3034118
mouse	keyboard

public class myservlet extends httpservlet implements

3034176
gif	bmp	gif	png	bmp	png
almost all bitmap formats bmp gif jpg png use 1 or more forms of compression

3034178
sudo	passwd
assuming you understand the risks then you ll realise that you need to build a number of constraints before applying the change which must be implemented in the privilege level which allows passwd to be changed - the code to run this must be a standalone executable with either setuid executoin or called via sudo from your php code

3034196
bazaar	git
etckeeper puts etc under version control it supports multiple version control systems including git mercurial and bazaar and integrates with the package management systems of a number of linux distros apt yum pacman

mouse	keyboard
pretty much all mouse and keyboard events and most anything else initiated by the user are really win32 messages

3034242
int	boolean
i can t speak on the tiny int it might very well be the same but i would not index boolean for the simple reason that they can assume only two values

3034262
folder	directory
in my experience git is very good about storing only binary deltas - i have tested this by adding a directory full of mp3 files to a repository and committing them changing the id3 tags and then committing the changes and before i ran git gc there were clearly two copies of each mp3 in the .git folder but after the git gc the size went back down to just slightly larger than the original working directory

3034270
matplotlib	scipy
you will first need to understand how sampling works then you should use scipy fft routines they are pretty fast in order spit out frequency intensity values then you can use matplotlib to plot such graphics

3034284
qmap	qdatastream
all of the basic collections in qt are supported by qdatastream check for support in the qmap docs as you are only storing other basic qt types and ints you should be ok

wordpress	joomla
i ve developed several real estate sites using joomla and openrealty and i have tried to create a decent real estate site for my wife using wordpress due to it s ease of use for end-users but unfortunately programming a real estate site in wordpress is tricky

3034306
client-side	server-side
the problem with client side security is cwe-602 client-side enforcement of server-side security are created when the server side is trusting the client with secret resources like passwords or to send report on sensitive information such as the players score in a flash game

3034328
folder	directory
the directory should be a source folder src and the schema-name is the filename of wherever you downloaded the schema to

i would like to know the ami image which has linux preferably ubuntu php 5 memcached eaccelerator or xcache

3034489
qgraphicsitem	qobject
qgraphicsitem is not derived from qobject and hence does not have an event queue which is needed to handle timer events

3034489
qgraphicsitem	qobject
try using qgraphicsobject or multiple inheritance of qgraphicsitem and qobject which is exactly what qgraphicsobject does

3034501
apache	nginx
there are some great guides on writing apache modules nginx components and lighttly extensions that can ease you into the field

3034523
tabcontrol	tabitem
the template for tabcontrol to generate tabitem

3034591
children	parent
however for normal inheritance scenario superclass might have pre-defined implementation and children who overrides the function will have their vtables pointing to different content than the parent

change all your int type variables to double or float

3034696
int	double
use floats not int an int int is a whole number floats allow decimal places as do double

3034775
moq	moles
this seems to be a part of microsoft research team and was wondering if anyone here has selected moles over other matured mocking frameworks such as moq

3034781
mbunit	nunit
or maybe instead of writing four different methods you can use rowtest attribute in mbunit or testcase in nunit 2.5.5 onwards to have parametrized tests - here you just write one method and pass in different parameters by specifying them as attributes

3034802
getter	setter
you should probably change zoomcontroler to private so that other classes have to access it via getter and setter

3034805
portrait	landscape
if i rotate my device in landscape then open my application it will present as portrait mode i need to rotate my device to another orientation then it will update

3034806
post	get
you will also need to perform your updates on your ui thread as updating your ui from a background thread can just get lost in the post

3034879
rss	feed
i m not sure how well it handles atom feed but it should pipe in any flavor of rss just fine

3034879
rss	feed
the name comes from its ability to handle rss 1.0 feed which are built on rdf.

3034962
libsvm	liblinear
check out both libsvm and liblinear

3034981
ubuntu	debian
if you are just ensuring that the data is safe if the hardware is stolen you might use a full disk encryption solution like truecrypt or pgp wde or ubuntu debian or fedora s built-in approach and require a pin or password on every boot

3035022
config	ini
if you are using the application and bootstrap classes you should probably use .ini style config loading to put some of these parameters into an ini file and maybe register them for use throughout your application with zend_registry

3035053
rss	feed
in my c# asp.net 3.5 application i am using rss feed to get current updates of my website

3035053
rss	feed
there also this rss feed is opening and showing the data

3035053
rss	feed
let me know how to work with rss feed in cloud environment

3035068
google-chrome	firefox
it seems to me that you want to store passwords in a similar fashion as firefox and google-chrome

3035210
integer	unsigned
the zu is used insted of d as the pointer will be a unsigned integer size

3035254
oncreate	ondestroy
i think i should open the db at the oncreate and close it at the ondestroy

3035288
vim	emacs
the only other thing i could reccomend that will run just about anywhere are the two stand bys vim and emacs

3035289
google-chrome	firefox
and use firebug mozilla firefox addons but apparently they applied to google google-chrome too

3035293
vim	emacs
a lot of developers i have worked with use either vim or emacs

3035322
firefox	safari
this table works ok in firefox safari and ie8

3035342
rss	feed	src	attr
for instance on your page that is served through https i would introduce an iframe that would replace your rss feed and in the src attr of the iframe put a url of a script on your server that captures the feed and outputs the html

3035376
int	chars
i m having problems converting a chars array read from file to an int array

3035429
boost	stl
if people need to maintain your code and are coming from stl boost background the expectation is that things work in a certain way

3035432
put	get
as tzaman put it there s no benefit to having the limit be expressed separately because there s no way to get there except walking one element at a time. however it is not that difficult to built a c# iterator which does several steps a time thus the question -- is there a benefit of having explicit limit iterator as in c++

3035449
width	height
move the note â œleftâ relative to itself by half its width and â œdownâ relative to itself by half its height

3035454
glassfish	weblogic
i am migrating a framework from weblogic to glassfish

3035467
integer	unsigned
with printf try using the zu instead of x for printing out a pointer because the pointer is of unsigned integer type ie zu

3035469
equals	gethashcode
override equals and gethashcode appropriately and it should work fine

3035474
equals	gethashcode
if you haven t overloaded the equals and gethashcode in your class the fallback object equality check will fail since the sequences contain two different objects

3035481
equals	gethashcode
overriding equals and gethashcode should solve your problem

3035493
opera	firefox
i also install other versions of firefox and opera on those virtual images as well

3035587
typedef	struct
as this is tagged c++ can i just point out that you do not need typedef when creating struct in that language

3035588
cvs	svn
same as svn or cvs you need to fetch changes into the second repository before you can commit back to the first and it s this that creates the conflict

3035598
int	double
if you need just one constant number const int or double etc. would be definetly better than enum

3035600
swt	swing
i don t no if that is available for kde but for windows i usally use the eclipse swt file chooser because it is more native than the pure swing implementation

3035635
width	height
chrome is wrongly reporting width and height values for images during or just after load time

3035635
google-chrome	firefox	width	height
also if you specify the width and height values in the img tag the script seems to work as expected in both firefox and google-chrome

3035635
width	height
or will i need to specify the width and height for every image in my code

3035674
draggable	droppable
after i posted my question i had no patience and i decided to ignore ui.sortable altogether building the required functionality from draggable and droppable and using special divs as spacers that would swell up on dragover to facilitate dropping in between tasks

3035730
moq	typemock	moq	moles	typemock	moles
moles is more often compared contrasted to typemock in that it offers a set of facilities outside of moq and or rhinomocks sweet spot

vb.net	vb6	versioning	upgrade
quite a few versioning of visual studio have a built-in upgrade wizard to help you with converting vb6 to vb.net code

3035760
getter	setter
another remark - maybe you should rewrite your getter setter methods for products to export an unmodifiable list and to read the input in a newly created list

3035768
forth	brainfuck
and so forth or a ag ay b brainfuck bx .

3035790
getter	setter
public data members vs getter setter

3035790
getter	setter
what is the use of getter and setter when you can just make your variables public and avoid the hassle of such lines as a.setvariablex a.getvariabley

3035802
getter	setter
with getter and setter you can often change the internal implementation details without changing the visible api and thus avoid having to change any of the code that uses the api of the class in question

3035803
getter	setter
you use setter and getter as an interface to interact with your object so that you can - for example - later add any functionality like validating input data without touching the code that uses the class es

3035804
getter	setter
getter and setter can do validation and lazy instantiation whereas public members cannot

3035815
getter	setter
setter and getter apply to properties whatever properties are in your code

3035815
getter	setter
you can then define setter and getter for this variable with any angle unit that you think relevant

3035881
put	get
expression non-capturing syntax is used so that the delimiters captured don t get put into the result array split puts capture groups into the result array if they appear in the pattern

you may first want to give visualvm a try before going towards yourkit yourkit is not freeware

3035963
post	put
when doing an http post you shouldn t put the data you want to change into the url

3035975
accessor	properties
lock the properties accessor for each object using a critical section

3036034
put	get
i think you can get hold of the text from inside the textboxes using something like activedocument.shapes 1 .textframe.textrange.text and then you could delete it by doing something like activedocument.shapes 1 .delete and after that you d have to put the text you retrieved from the text box in the relevant part of the document

3036041
extjs	mootools
prototype mootools extjs dojo yui

3036057
post	get
send either http query parameters get or post to the server or possibly a json object and get json or html in response

3036182
inherited	properties
in resume you need it for signals and slots to use tr for translation to retrieve class name in real time from a qobject to know if it inherited from other class instrospection to set properties and to be able to call newinstance

3036185
getelementsbytagname	getelementbyid
to look like this you have to select the hidden field by using getelementsbytagname - or set an id for the hidden field and use getelementbyid

3036190

this will hide them all grab at random a next hidden one fade it in and 50ms later start the next one creating a random-ish fadein effect

3036353
gif	png
please note that this is not a solution for displaying gifs you must modify the content of the web and convert split gif animations into different files one for each frame in any format jpg png etc

3036356
put	get
the only issue i now have is that if i put in a discriminatesubclassesoncolumn tagtype i get the same syntax issue creeping in

3036373

but then i don t have a show hide variable

3036461
public	protected
i mean method are generally used to define functions inside a class where several types of user access right like public protected private can be defined

3036496
put	get
edit you d get an linker error if you would put into the second file as well

3036507

could you add a asp button instead of using the checkbox on your gridview and fire an onrowupdating event

3036516
gif	png
creates an imageicon from an array of bytes which were read from an image file containing a supported image format such as gif jpeg or as of 1.3 png

3036533
getter	setter
would i go so far as to include the friend lines even if my implementation of the operators could actually be done with public getter and setter

3036533
getter	setter
so generally i use friend and i write them as though they were member functions not using getter and setter

3036579
ilist	icollection	idictionary	ilist	idictionary	icollection
very different from the .net ones their core is the icollection idictionary and ilist interfaces

3036579
ienumerable	ienumerator
make sure to understand the difference between ienumerable implemented by the collection and ienumerator implemented by the iterator

3036651
super	abstract
1 in this case it might be better to abstract these properties in a super class.

3036677
folder	directory
sometimes i even delete files and they don t delete on svn in a directory hierarchy only the very last item will delete so i have to delete each folder one at a time

3036702
x86	64bit
in the latter case you need only the vc_redist in either x86 or 64bit variant

3036707
int	chars
you can use hhd under glibc s scanf msvc does not appear to support int storage into a chars directly see msdn scanf width specification for more information on the supported conversions

3036726
datalist	repeater
take a look at this tutorial custom buttons in the datalist and repeater

3036742
gcov	lcov
lcov or just gcov can be run from there

3036811
int	chars
in most contexts you save little to nothing by using chars for an int

3036843
air	flashdevelop
i m creating air apps in flashdevelop using the free flex sdk

3036854
treelistview	objectlistview
the objectlistview project has a treelistview

3036859
post	get
if you re using get and the request uri gets pretty long over 2kb then consider using post instead of get else the uri may be truncated by the server

3036859
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
serialize the java object write it raw to the urlconnection#getoutputstream using objectoutputstream and retrieve it raw from the httpservletrequest#getinputstream and unserialize it using objectinputstream

3036902
int	chars
since there an implicit cast from a unsigned chars to an int if the number is more than 0xff it is going to use bytes max 3 next to the variable in the stack and corrupt their values

3036902
int	chars
it does not seem sscanf support storage of numbers into a chars i suggest you use an int instead

3036902
int	chars
although if you want to have the chars roll-over you can just cast the int into a chars afterward like

3037004
shadowing	named
that being said it is confusing and unwise to named types the same both in sql and pl sql you run into shadowing issues

3037005
qdialog	qwidget
i believe your login is a qwidget dashboard is a qdialog

3037007
rsa	aes
encrypt this aes key with bob s rsa

3037014
int	double
invalid syntax it highlights closing double quote in this line print not a valid int s e

3037037
put	get
first thing is i am saving my username and password in the file.on sucessful login i will be saving and moving to internal home screen.the problem is when i logout or close the application and reopen the application i am able to read the data but when i convert it to string i get out put as aaaaaa each as 4 bytes

3037094
children	parent
if you are in an ascx generally you are searching parent if you are in a page generally you are searching children

3037099
vbscript	jscript
you can embed the ms-supplied script engines including jscript and vbscript using the script interfaces

3037116
post	get	client-side	server-side
rather than writing server-side ajax code you should use client-side ajax jquery to get the runtime value of the textbox and post that value

3037137
stdout	stderr
also you need to handle stdout and stderr - not sure if adding 1 home out would work with popen

3037146
post	get
i have read some post that show you how to set up a single ton and just get an instance of the persistancemanager when you need it but this does not seem to work either

3037161
gif	png
if you have control over the images make them load progressively save gif png as interlaced jpeg as progressive

3037169
for-loop	loops
for the last three replacements the for-loop seems to be unnecessary since loops body doesn t use loops variable

3037257
hash	md5
if you want an easy solution just stick with a good hashing algorithm like md5 and store just the hash inside your application

3037338
put	get
temporary tables get put into a schema called pg_temp_nnn where nnn indicates which server backend you re connected to

3037401
qapplication	qcoreapplication
qapplication calls oleinitialize in its constructor but qcoreapplication does not so that s why you get the error 0x80010106 rpc_e_changed_mode when you use qapplication

3037496
hash	md5
if you re okay with a microscopical risk of collisions you could use some hash function such as md5 as you suggest and rely on the hash

3037496
trie	tree
another alternative possibly with a larger memory footprint is to store the already encountered strings in a trie a special type of tree

3037507
hash	md5
md5 is also inappropriate since two different strings can yield the same hash

3037543
bitblt	gdi
i would recommend to use bitblt of the old gdi instead of drawimage

3037552
post	get
in my code i have a section that extracts and lists the different categories of post but my problem is how to get exactly the post that fall within that category and list them only

3037598
inherited	properties	super	extends
this loop is part of a js implementation of classical inherited where classes that extends existing classes retain the super properties of the extended class when invoking a member of the extended class

3037642
post	get
i am using wordpress and i am wondering how do i get just the permalink and name of the category of a post when using

3037647

3037935
uiview	subviews
the navigationbar is a uiview which has 2 or 3 custom subviews for the parts on the bar

3037937
post	get
the solution is to use get or post method for sending and retrieving the values instead of session

3037985
vb.net	vb6	vbscript	vb6	versioning	upgrade
most vbscript is valid vb6 code so one option would be to just rename them from .vbs to whatever it was vb6 used and then add them all to a vb6 project and see if the vb6 - vb.net upgrade wizard that comes with some versioning of visual studio can help you out

3038011
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i m using the html5media library and the test page they provide no longer plays in firefox 3.6.3 though it plays on the latest safari google-chrome opera and ie

3038067

3038097
int	double
ip is an int and dp is a double

3038117

3038176
post	get
i use httpurlconnection to do http post but i dont always get back the full response

3038182
hash	md5
also i would advise against using md5 as a hash

3038182
hash	salt
i suppose you could apply a similar salt hash pattern to the username but then you have pitfalls

3038187
crypt	salt
unix passwords used to be encrypted with crypt that would use a random salt

3038187
hash	md5
to expand on this a little bit an md5 hash is a one-way function - if you hash the same value you get the same hash but you can t take the hash and somehow turn it into the value

3038198
jquery	scriptaculous
short tests show problems even when enclosed in a self executing function if scriptaculous is already loaded although jquery doesn t seem to cause a problem

3038233
int	double
this tempts me to claim that it s even more important to use volatile for long s than it is for int s since not even a read is atomic for non-volatile longs double

3038234
redland	jena	jena	rdflib	rdflib	redland
see jena java redland c rdflib python trine perl etc

my envisioned scenario is this you have some sort of state object for each client consisting of many properties strings int boolean etc

3038375
hex	binary
basically what i do is compile a binary from a test program for my processor dump all the hex s from the binary into a vector in my c++ program convert all of those hex s to decimal integers and store them in a datamemory vector which is the data memory unit for my processor

3038375
int	chars
convert the whole decimal int element that is being pointed to to its ascii chars representation and then search from left to right to see if the string terminates if not then just load each chars consecutively into a filename string

3038389

i can t get it to work in firefox safari

3038389
firefox	safari
it works great in ie but firefox safari won t play ball

3038604
vim	emacs
if you can t live without an ide then eclipse is ok assuming you have some pretty well specced dev boxen but i have to say the best code ninjas i ve encountered all use either emacs or vim

3038606

this is kind of follow up questions of integration of c# f# ironpython and ironruby

3038747
post	get
here is some general code to send a http post and get a response from a server though that may be helpful

3038748
folder	directory
these files are generated into the directory of the eclipse project under a gen folder

3038748
folder	directory
in the project properties this is correctly reflected since two source folder exist - src and gen. however when the project is built for some reason all the generated sources under gen are not compiled checking the bin directory i only see .class files from the src directory

3038790
put	get
the plus side is that once you get used to the language of vbscript and the process of looking up object api references and examples on msdn and other sites it does become very easy to put together complicated and powerful scripts

3038798
elementtree	beautifulsoup
update i discovered beautifulsoup just now a tag soup parser as noted below in the answer comment and for fun i went back to this problem and tried to use it as an xml-cleaner in front of elementtree but it dutifully converted the into a just-as-invalid null byte

3038823
wsdl.exe	svcutil.exe
actually for wcf you should not use wsdl.exe - use svcutil.exe instead

3038839
stdout	stderr
php stdin php stdout and php stderr allow direct access to the corresponding input or output stream of the php process

3038839
stdout	stderr
it is recommended that you simply use the constants stdin stdout and stderr instead of manually opening streams using these wrappers

3038847
width	height
float all paragraphs to the left give them half the width of the containing element and if possible set a fixed height

3038863

my text editor of choice is usually textmate although i often use vim as well

3038887
ubuntu	linux
i m working with both ubuntu mac but i like staying with the linux system feels faster and more stable for me

post	get
i am fixing some old defects and as part of one defect i need to make sure that some requests are being only post to the jsp page instead of a get request

3038890
post	get
the application have a form which submits data to another jsp page i know its wrong and against mvc but too late to fix it since it is a jsp page so we can post the request or else we can get the request

3038931
google-chrome	firefox
i ve tried this in firefox google-chrome and ie

uitableview	nsindexpath
- uitableviewcell tableview uitableview tableview cellforrowatindexpath nsindexpath

3038970
g++	gcc	x86	64bit
if you re compiling for 32 bit x86 then gcc and g++ default to using the x87 for floating point math on 64bit they default to sse however the x87 can and will produce different values for the same computation so it s unlikely g++ will consider vectorizing if it can t guarantee that you will get the same results unless you use -ffast-math or some of the flags it turns on

3038973
suppressfinalize	finalizer
the suppressfinalize method simply sets a flag in the object header which indicates that the finalizer does not have to be run

3038994
dictionary	map
the ideal solution is to track the keypresses in a table std map dictionary etc

3039119
glut	glew
just link to glew and glu glut if you use them

3039126
children	parent
if you attempt to use any type of serialization against this model you will like run into circular reference problems as a serializer moves from a parent to a child and then back to the parent as the linq2sql serialization behavior automatically includes all children in the graph

3039132
terminate	timeout
is there any way to stop listening on the port when the program terminate instead of having to wait for it to timeout

3039133
free	malloc
i was using nedmalloc in a single threaded setting and got excellent performance but i m wondering if i should switch to something else -- as i understand things nedmalloc is just a replacement for c-based malloc free not the c++-based new delete operators which i use extensively

3039139
children	parent
the issue i m having is that my chart model is a parent that has children

3039140
rss	feed
i am trying to make app that displays an rss feed with text and images into a table but i am really struggeling with it

3039168
free	malloc
often the default c++ new delete operators will use malloc and free under the hood to do the actual memory allocation before after calling the constructor destructor

3039177
free	malloc
simply link it into your application at it will replace the behavior or malloc free and new delete

3039199
free	malloc
well usually c++ new and delete operators internally calls plain c library functions malloc and free plus some additional magic like calling ctors and dtors so providing a custom implementation for these functions may be enough this is not infrequent in embedded c++ development but requires some linker-level work

3039221
free	malloc
you can overload global operators new and delete to call the new versions of malloc and free that you re using

3039260
rtp	rtsp
we are working on a c language application which is simple rtsp rtp client to record video from axis a number of cameras

3039294
width	height
scrollview setframe cgrectmake x y width height

3039295
ienumerable	iqueryable
edit - you usually see ienumerable instead of iqueryable because you don t want layers past your repository a determining when the database hit will happen or b adding any logic to the joins outside the repository

3039295
ienumerable	iqueryable
there is a very good linq video that i enjoy a lot- it hits more than just ienumerable v iqueryable but it really has some fantastic insight

3039419
children	parent
i am trying to figure out children processes of a given parent from ps fwaux there may very well be a better way to do this

3039489

the usual workaround is to do a post request with an extra field that holds the method _method put in the post values

3039632
titlebar	window
that is the thing that has the close minimize and maximize buttons and a titlebar etc is the frame . whereas the things that show up when you do a c-x 3 split-window are called windows and when you do something like m-x shell-mode you get a new buffer which may or may not be in a new window

3039665
int	boolean
the former is an int which will be implicitly converted to bool in c++ via but the latter expression yields a boolean directly

3039676
int	boolean
it means that in java the boolean value true is not interchangeable with the int value 1 or more accurately with any non-zero int and the boolean value false is not interchangeable with the int value 0

3039678
int	boolean
languages like java do not allow you to treat int as boolean values in this way

3039691
invokelater	invokeandwait
when running in your new thread be sure that any gui updates use invokeandwait or preferably invokelater to get back to the edt

3039707
int	boolean
to put it another way c c++ don t have a real boolean type they just use int

3039720
put	get
if you can get away with it put your error handling in a global exception handler all errors should log and give a code to look up the log in production for security reasons esp if web but give the full details back during development for speed reasons

3040572
javadoc	scaladoc
the library i am trying to write adds some methods to java.lang.class and java.lang.reflect classes using the pimp my library implicit conversion process to help you go and find documentation initially with google then later possibly with a javadoc scaladoc viewer and maybe the stackoverflow api eventually

i use a lot of vba and vbscript and i would agree that anything under 100 lines is usually pretty straightforward and taking the time to plan a good oop design is just a waste

3040707
post	put
but i am not sure if how the same approach could be applied to post put and delete requests

3040707
post	put	post	get	put	get
can i use get parameters in post put and delete requests

bellman-ford	dijkstra
it contains a bfs implementation among other algorithms and it also includes dijkstra s algorithm and the bellman-ford algorithm for weighted graphs

3040873
hash	md5
avoid using md5 hash if you can as it s pretty flawed

3040879
inherited	subclassing
i think you might get away with public new string runfunction in the subclassing but i d also suggest that if v2 isn t supposed to provide it s own specific behaviour then using inherited isn t the right approach

3040889
client-side	server-side
if you do track time on client-side - always validate it on the server-side

3041124
google-chrome	firefox
this works as expected from google-chrome and firefox but for some reason ie displays all of the images the same as the first image

3041124
google-chrome	firefox
what should happen as it does in google-chrome and firefox the page loads the same 4 iframes but the random numbers in the images will be different

3041124
google-chrome	firefox
notes i don t really need iframes just the images but if i only use img tags the problem appears in google-chrome and firefox as well

3041126

3041143
firefox	safari
this worked in safari and firefox

3041149
equals	compareto
the issue you re running into is that compareto returning 0 means that the objects are equals

3041149
equals	compareto
either re-write your compareto so that unequal elements return different values or use something like a java.util.priorityqueue which allows multiple copies of equals elements

3041166

3041832
lisp	scheme
my hurdle with lisp and scheme was simply lambda

3041832
lisp	scheme
if you re interested a a lisp a language which is essentially from the lisp family then scheme is a good choice

3041832
lisp	scheme
but scheme is not common lisp which is what lisp typically means today they are really different languages

3041832
lisp	scheme
if you want to learn common lisp i would start with common lisp and skip scheme

scheme	racket	lisp	scheme	lisp	racket
scheme --- the lisp with which i m most familiar --- is probably about as easy as python to learn especially if you choose plt scheme now renamed racket which offers you a lot of helpful extensions

3042045
scheme	racket
if you want a more capable scheme either immediately or later on learn plt scheme racket

3042045
lisp	scheme
if you want a big friendly diffuse language of immense power but not as visibly internally consistent as scheme choose common lisp

3042064
lisp	scheme
you ll learn how to program in 7 different languages including lisp scheme sasl clu plus how to implement interpreters for each

3042066
int	double
if you can afford the loss of precision the simplest and cleanest way to do this is to cast a 32-bit int to a 64-bit double and use the fp rounding mode to round toward minus infinity when you convert the quotient back to int

3042066
floating-point	integer
today s floating-point units are pretty fast and may actually divide faster than an integer unit

touchesbegan	touchesmoved	touchesbegan	touchesended	touchesmoved	touchesended
btw for extra credit if you are using ios 3.2 or 4.0 or later use the uipangesturerecognizer class to handle the drag and drop logic - the drag and drop motion is a lot smoother than overriding touchesbegan touchesmoved touchesended .

portrait	landscape
my widget stops working becomes unresponsive to a button press when the view changes from portrait to landscape or vica versa does anyone know why it does this and if there is a fix

octal	decimal
- there are no octal numbers there are strings which are octal representations of numbers and other strings more commonly encountered which are their decimal representations hexadecimal representations

3042289
octal	decimal
so one way to interpret your question is that you want to convert an octal representation into a decimal one etc -- that would be

it takes an input string and a string of delimiters each chars int he string is a possible delimitter and it returns a vector of token s

3047107
put	get
the funny thing is when i put function blah inside this wrapper i get blah is not defined error but when i put it outside - works perfectly

3047136
hide	show
however if you want to speed it up you could hide all your text ie take it out of the dom apply this code and then show it again

3047197
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i tested it on mac with firefox 2 and 3.6 safari 3 and google-chrome beta 5.0.375.70 and it works

3047219
int	double
for int not float double you could get away with something that just takes care of the byte order of your different machines

3047235
min	max
however there are some sophisticated data structures that are meant to handle complete lists they are not designed for min max acces in particular

3047262
processors	hyperthreading
hyperthreading will create 2 logical processors for each core

3047329
postgresql	mysql
works as expected in mysql however in postgresql it is incrementing by 2 each time

i ve got a trouble with chrome5.0.375.70 but firefox 3.6.3 and opera 10.53 are ok

3047454
multiton	singleton
if you need a map of many singleton objects you can use the multiton pattern

3047509
versioning	upgrade
we recently upgrade our struts2 versioning and we had our own converters which also don t work in this case so i was hoping to use the default conversion method

3047523
versioning	upgrade
i use the database extended properties to store the current on-disk deployed schema versioning and then run an internal upgrade array that maintains a map between on-disk versioning upgrade script to next versioning

3047523
versioning	upgrade
at start-up the app runs the steps in the upgrade array until the on-disk versioning matches the current app versioning

3047523
versioning	upgrade
so an upgrade goes through all intermediate versioning

3047523
versioning	upgrade
also if your deployment target is only one location ie a web app where there is only one target the web site db then ability to upgrade any previous versioning looses it s appeal

3047571
accessor	properties
call the function via an object properties using properties accessor notation either dotted notation obj.foo or bracketed notation

3047602
portrait	landscape
i have it working for portrait mode but when i rotate to landscape the image disappears

3047619
post	get
you ll likely use jquery to pass some get or post data to those smaller views

3047621
queue	fifo
java.util.deque is a java interface that provides both lifo and fifo queue behaviour and thus stack behaviour as a subset

3047622
post	get
you do get data from the post try var_dump with your vars eg

google-chrome	firefox
works ok on firefox and google-chrome

3047795
google-chrome	firefox
in my experience gzip compresses extremely well for text content and i have been working with content-type gzip and a gzipoutputstream with no problems against ie firefox and google-chrome for a number of years

3047827
min	max
using min max with the exact numbers you need will be more accurate and avoid the greedy

3047853
crossover	mutation
it s also a pretty broad term---arguably the system of the op is a limiting case of gp with 0 crossover and 100 mutation

3047909
versioning	upgrade
on compilation of the cuda sdk i m getting a nvcc fatal unsupported gpu architecture compute_20 my toolkit is 2.3 and on a shared system i.e cant really upgrade and the driver versioning is also 2.3 running on 4 tesla c1060s

3047921
webkit	blink
i would recommend feature detection going forward but chrome and webkit blink in general is notorious for lying to feature detection mechanisms as well so even that isn t as great as it s cracked up to be anymore either

3047926
xsl-fo	xslt
you should look into using xsl-fo with the xslt

3047964
postgresql	mysql
i doubt you need cloud solutions for this though a standard database mssql mysql postgresql etc. should do just fine and one of these will come with almost any hosting plan that allows you to deploy your own code

3048012
eventlet	gevent
what about eventlet or gevent

3048091
post	get
a browser obviously can easily send get and post requests but i have no good ideas on delete and update

my requirements are that i am simply trying to create a daemon process whose stdout stdin stderr i do not care about

3048222
gtk	cairo
cairo is a generic vector 2d library that is used in gtk since many versions ago

3048229
mp3	wav
if it s one of the supported formats in java wav mp3 etc.. then you can just open this file like you have done for wavs already

3048245
width	height
exstyle int32 x int32 y int32 width int32 height string name

3048253
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
a jframe implements serializable so theoretically it is serializable as an objectstream you could use objectinputstream and objectoutputstream and write the stream to the database

3048268
post	get
i don t require help writing the scraper to get the html bodies of possibly relevant job post

3048280
width	height
where you of course can set backgroundcolor width height etc

3048315
textview	imageview
there is first an imageview the light and then two textview

3048369
int	double
iâ m assuming this since in the first example where double type is being converted to int type checked operator works as expected

3048401
filtering	grouping
this grouping all records by slug then adds a num_records attribute that says how many records have that slug but the additional filtering is not performed and i don t even know if this would work right anyway since given a set of duplicate records one may have and entry and the other may have an article

3048519
sorting	filtering
the next step for me is getting the filtering paging and sorting working

3048547
alloca	malloc
alloca is almost identical to malloc except that it alocs memory on the stack instead of the heap so no matter how you function exits throwing or now the memory will be reclaimed and no deletes or frees are necessary

3048569
hide	show
the filter uses show and hide which i presume means it switches it from display block to display none

3048574
google-chrome	firefox
also poster for firefox and the less-mature poster for google-chrome

3048586
ubuntu	mint
or you could use the info on ubuntu help it should work for you since mint is based on ubuntu

3048630
matlab	simulink
likewise you can generated embedded code using matlab and simulink

3048666
int	boolean
the only downside is that you have to pass primitive types int string boolean but i m sure you ll figure ways around this

3048698
required	placeholder
the _1 is a placeholder required during a bind indicating that the method function pointer being bound required a single argument

3048710

but when i put this code in page_load i don t get the full id which is ctl00_contentmain_divpanel i just get divpanel

3048740
ubuntu	debian
for debian ubuntu based systems you can type below command

3048761
googletest	gmock
so i created mocks i use googletest and gmock for testing

3048763
webkit	gecko
what should happen and does in gecko webkit is that the overlay contains a table with a heading a scaled centered image and a nav menu

3048792
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
when i push a uiviewcontroller within a uinavigationcontroller the uiscrollview in the view changes dimensions

3048795
decltype	auto
supported by the miracle of auto decltype

3048820
versioning	upgrade
that way you are not selling modified versioning of the core software which would kill your ability to easily upgrade the system

3048826
for-loop	arrays
the main view copies information contained in an arrays from the application delegate and pushes the useful information into a for-loop which then takes the name gps coords and other identifying information and passes that into a series of methods and classes which result in a custom annotation

3048845
textview	imageview
i have a scrollview that contains an number of other views textview imageview etc.

3048848
rss	feed
i want to develop a jqtouch web app that will display a list of the titles from an rss feed and then display the title and description when the title is tapped

3048853
post	get
how do i get to display the number of post on a topic like a forum

3048865
google-chrome	firefox
where as in javascript in at least google-chrome and firefox the answer is .2

3048872
prepare	pdostatement
a better option is some kind of prepare statements such as pdostatement or mysqli_stmt

3048873
range	minimum
however you ve got no way of knowing which peers overlap from tracker a to tracker b so the best you can really do from scraping multiple trackers is to come up with a range of the minimum maximum number of leechers and seeders in the swarm

3048876
superclass	subclassing
for editable objects we have a superclass which adds validation behaviors to the subclassing

3048877
vsto	add-in
i ve been installing my vsto outlook add-in to the outlook 2007 on the account that has no security limitations

3048883
innodb	myisam
moving off of your myisam tables and onto innodb will provide a huge performance increase in almost all cases

3048897
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
moreover whatever selection you ultimately make from within either view will push a common uiviewcontroller onto the uinavigationcontroller stack

3048897
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
still more info we don t want to use a separate uinavigationcontroller just to handle this pair of views and we don t want to split these apart via a uitabbarcontroller either

3048941
activemq	rabbitmq
something like rabbitmq or activemq

3048946
std	ostream	ostream	istream
i ve been using std istream and ostream as a polymorphic interface for random-access binary i o in c++ but it seems suboptimal in numerous ways

3048946
put	get	stringstream	fstream
stringstream has independent get put positions whereas fstream does not

3048946
stringstream	fstream
there is a device class but it s not polymorphic and is just an implementation helper class not necessarily used by the supplied device implementations. i m primarily using large disk files but i really want polymorphism so i can easily substitute alternate implementations use stringstream instead of fstream for unit tests without all the complexity and compile-time coupling of deep template instantiation

3049027
width	height
if you are publishing from flash ide you can go to and set the width and height

3049070
hash	md5
i thought that it is impossible to decode md5 hash but i found tools which decode them here

3049095
hash	md5
it doesn t decode an md5 hash

3049095
hash	salt
that s why it s so important to use salt hash instead of storing the hash directly.

3049103
hash	md5
it is impossible to decode an md5 hash as it is a one way algorithm they will have a database of pre-calculated hash and the string that was used to generate the hash and then perform a lookup

3049115
hash	md5
it says clearly this tool searches multiple databases for the unencoded version of a md5 hash

3049121
hash	md5
note from the site any data which is md5 hash is stored for lookups

3049167
width	height
once you drop a word see if you can extend the bounding box to be the width of first box + second box + space and the height of max first box second box

3049170
width	height
essentially i want each div to have 50 width and 100 height but it isn t working

3049172
installation	downgrade
there should be no need to downgrade your java installation to develop for java 1.5

3049201
width	height
so that any elements inside won t report their actual width and height 0 in most browsers

3049240
min	max
how would you obtain the min and max of a two-dimensional array using linq

3049240
min	max
and to be clear i mean the min max of the all items in the array not the min max of a particular dimension

3049248
mouse	keyboard
it allows low level access to the pixels of a single window or the full screen plus the keyboard mouse and soundcard and works on most windows osx and linux

3049260
min	max
you could implement a list and find the min and max foreach and store it to a list and then you can easily find min and max from that list of all the values in a single dimensional list

3049266
mouse	keyboard
testapi actually wraps up sendinput internally and exposes a couple of simple classes -- mouse and keyboard -- to help you simulate input

3049297
x86	64bit
this should output amd64 in 64bit mode and x86 in 32-bit mode either native 32-bit or 32-bit emulation on a 64bit processor

3049305
cos	sin
this means you can precompute cos b and sin b and at runtime compute just cos hp and sin hp

3049305
cos	sin
you ll be trading a couple of sin s and cos s for some multiplications and additions almost certainly worthwhile

3049322
int	boolean
i d normally index the fields that are the most queried and then int boolean enums rather that fields that are varchars

3049343
width	height
image will be an int with length width height

3049389
lisp	scheme
lisp dialects like scheme and common lisp required then that there is no difference between interpreted and compiled code and thus interpreted based implementations had to implement lexical scope too

3049410
hide	show
i can t for the life of me find a way to hide them again and i have no idea why they started to show

3049572
mp3	wav
if i have an mp3 file how can i convert it to a wav file

3049576
vsto	add-in
he said you can include the scripts in the vsto deployment and you can do post-deployment steps with a vsto add-in if you are targeting .net 4.0

3049583
button	checkbox
when you are ready to check for any leaks that may have accumulated click on the check for leaks now button below that checkbox option

3049601
goto	break
it can end in a break return goto continue throw or a detectable infinite loop

3049602
filesystems	hfs+
the filesystems on device is case sensitive hfs+ while the filesystems on the mac is likely to be case insensitive by default

3049629
width	margin
set the right margin of the image div to the width you want it away from the text

3049653
int	chars
reads and writes of the following data types are atomic bool chars byte sbyte short ushort uint int float and reference types

3049682
bufferedreader	fileinputstream
the best option would be to use a bufferedreader for its readline method wrapping an inputstreamreader for its ability to specify the encoding wrapping a fileinputstream for actually reading the file

3049687
outputstream	inputstream
the reader and writer classes can be used for string data where the inputstream and outputstream should be used for binary data byte arrays

3049692
width	height
when i upload images using ckfinder in the ckeditor the image displays nicely using css width height

3049692
width	height
i would like images to have default width and height attributes

3049707
gitolite	gitosis
if you have multiple developers you may just want to take the time to setup gitolite or gitosis and a remote git repo

3049711
bazaar	git
this example is with bazaar but it applies to git very well

3049729
put	get
i have a tool that will allow me to put files and registry changes on the device but i don t know where stuff should go to get certificate installed

3049740
width	height
you can however use create a plugin for ckeditor to change the image width height when using the image dialog of ckeditor

3049740
width	height
btw that dialog allows you to change the width and height of the selected image before placing it in your document

3049740
width	height
the values that are placed there by ckeditor are the real width height of the selected image

3049749
hide	show
it hide that you see in first half of the picture #writecomment and show #sctryvote what you see in the other half picture to the right

3049762
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
another approach is event forwarding which means overriding touchesbegan withevent and similar methods like touchesmoved withevent etc to send some touches to a different object than where they first go

3049848
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
however on google-chrome safari and firefox you would see both hello and world at the end of 5 seconds

3049910
folder	directory
i read somewhere that that gcov tries to reproduce the directory structure where the .gcno files are stored in my project folder which would make sense as the directory above is where the .gcno files are located on my machine

3049915
uitableview	nsindexpath
void tableview uitableview tableview accessorybuttontappedforrowwithindexpath nsindexpath indexpath

3049943
cvs	svn
if your coding style is such that you commit one logical change in a few cvs svn operations then setting a longer quiet period would prevent hudson from building it prematurely and reporting a failure

3049948
free	malloc
if you need a really large array you should dyncamically allocate it using malloc and if you do so be sure to free it using free when you are done with it

3049975
pascal	delphi	fortran	ada	ada	pascal
the direct answer to your question about languages is that yes some languages e.g. c c++ ada pascal delphi fortran etc. can produce programs that will run without a runtime environment like .net or jre

3050032
viewdidload	viewdidappear
the flipping animation if you want it would then have to be handled in the view controller s viewdidload or viewdidappear method

3050053
cpython	ironpython
i foolishly assumed there is something wrong with cpython pipes cause running commands under ironpython on the same machine worked

3050053
cpython	ironpython
if you are serious about making it work on windows contemplate ditching cpython for ironpython + nwsgi look for it on codeplex i use nwsgi for simple wsgi apps and can run subprocesses with a subprocess.py specifically written for ironpython

3050081
regasm	tlbexp
they re usually generated for com components in the case of tlbexp and regasm the tlb is created from the assembly metadata

3050083
queue	fifo
are there locks in linux where the waiting queue is fifo

3050083
queue	fifo
does linux have a lock with fifo waiting queue or is there an easy way to make one with existing mechanisms

3050096
width	height
cgrectzero is literally a zero rect 0 0 0 0 so adbannerview should never show up if it really has a width and height of 0

3050099
nullreferenceexception	targetinvocationexception
it seems that the exception is first of targetinvocationexception with an inner exception of nullreferenceexception

3050104
postgresql	mysql
if you come from mysql what mysql calls loosely databases are schemas in postgresql - sort of namespaces

3050116
try-catch	exception-handling
this could cause your try-catch to miss the exception-handling if the exception-handling occurs in an anychronous thread that s not finished before you leave the try-catch statement

3050142
multiplying	modulo
in this special case with only uppercase letters as mentioned by the op in comments and digits 0-9 you could also omit the order table and instead multiplying both differing characters by 4 and compare the results modulo 256

3050153
google-chrome	safari
i can trigger mouse wheel events using the magic mouse and track pad in both safari and google-chrome

3050187
bufferedreader	gzipinputstream	gzipinputstream	gzipoutputstream
use a gzipoutputstream at the server and a gzipinputstream at the client with an inputstreamreader around that and a bufferedreader around that

3050206
subtract	add
won t automatically be updated with the count every time you add or subtract from the filearray session

3050209
int	chars	int	double
to my knowledge the attribute parameters are limited to bool byte chars double float int long short string object system.type and enum type with public accessibility and single dimensional array of the above types

3050231
put	get
i d like to get the current directory during a gnumake file run put into a make variable

3050262
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i need this implemented for as many browsers as possible but is only required for internet explorer google-chrome mozilla firefox safari and opera

3050311
stdout	stderr
need stderr as well as stdout

3050328
rss	feed
the xe library was designed for generating syndication feed atom rss etc. and i think it is easy to use

3050359
spaces	linefeed
it looks like you have linefeed without spaces prepended to the additional lines which according to rfc 2822 â 2.3.2 is illegal

3050463
trie	tree
i m loading a dictionary of words into a trie prefix tree

3050467
chunked	transfer-encoding
to take http as an example you can use transfer-encoding chunked for this

3050530
versioning	upgrade
for users that are hand-cuffed by corporate it prohibitions they cant just upgrade their flash versioning and the page will not work

3050535
versioning	upgrade
if you re on a versioning of ubuntu older than lucid you ll have to upgrade your os or enable the universe repository in order for python3 to show up in your package manager

3050537
qscrollarea	qtextedit
if i initially have sizehint return some large constant number then the qtextedit is very big and is contained nicely within the outer qscrollarea as one would expect

3050537
width	height
also it does seem odd that the single framewidth integer is used in computing both the width and the height

3050611
google-chrome	firefox
the user is able to press keyboard function keys to process something in the emulator i used stoppropagation and preventdefault javascript function to stop cancel browsers invoking their function key shortcut f1 will invoke firefox to open its help page and the code works fine under firefox and google-chrome

3050618
ada	pascal
my understanding is that gcc and perhaps eventually if not already llvm may have java and other frontends ada for example maybe pascal

3050620
versioning	upgrade
can you upgrade to a more recent versioning than that

3050623
division	modulo
the simple modulo and division for powers of two

3050636
inherited	properties
i wrote an automaticlock class that has an inherited attached dolock properties

3050636
width	height
trigger on dolock to apply a layouttranform or rendertransform to your items or to set other properties like width and height

3050639
width	height
the managed part of a texture2d object is only about 100-200 bytes - which stores the aforementioned reference and a cache of the texture s width height format and so on.

3050667
google-chrome	firefox
not only ie but some old firefox and google-chrome releases as well

3050679
sorting	filtering	sorting	grouping	filtering	grouping
for example you can skip hidden columns apply string formats in binding honor filtering grouping sorting etc

3050700
eventlet	gevent
comparing gevent to eventlet

3050700
eventlet	gevent
reports from users who moved from twisted or eventlet to gevent

3050700
eventlet	gevent
eventlet and gevent are not really comparable to stackless because stackless ships with a standard library that is not aware of tasklets

3050700
eventlet	gevent
both eventlet and gevent could be made to run on stackless rather than on greenlet

3050731
exif	xmp
if no rating was found in the exif data it may be in the adobe format xmp section

3050739
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i am using a uitabbarcontroller as well as a uinavigationcontroller on my app

3050770
wonderware	historian
ask your wonderware administrator to give you access to the wonderware historian you can track the values of the tags pretty easily via mssql calls over sqlalchemy that you can poll every so often

3050809
disk	ram
it will trust me - just a matter of time - plus also a waste of resources disk space and ram in your sql server machine which is really not necessary

3050823
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
it sounds like you have a uinavigationcontroller as the main vc of your app and a uitabbarcontroller as one of the vc s on its stack

3050823
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i think you should embed the uinavigationcontroller inside the uitabbarcontroller instead of the other way around or you could just choose to use another way of showing what you want to show

3050920
post	put
check out ben is pretty sharp and if you dig around on his blog he has some nice post about how cormvc is put together and why

3050959
datamapper	activerecord
it s working fine with ar activerecord but i get into trouble when i d switch to dm datamapper or sequel as both don t natevily support polymorphic associations and discourage it s usage

3050991
glut	sdl
or you could use glut instead of sdl

3051017
keydown	keyup
it contains the key code of the key which was pressed to trigger the event eg keydown keyup

3051041
width	height
so i want to resize images to a fixed width but proportional height

getter	setter
the main argument against putting too much weight in code coverage numbers is that easy blocks like getter and setter that give no real value and could hardly go wrong... count just as much as more error-prone blocks of code

3051654
mouse	keyboard
you might already have thought about it but otherwise remember to handle cut and paste also and that the user might be doing that with the mouse rather than the keyboard

3051675
folder	directory
since svn does not have distinguished handling for tags and branches the typical workflow is to copy the desired svn directory into the tags folder example svn cp file path to my repo branches xyz 23 file path to my repo tags xyz_production_lastproductiondate

3051745
google-chrome	firefox
with firebug in firefox or web dev tools in google-chrome you can see the changes.

3051763
put	get
ideone seems to put cnt somewhere else in relation to pr so it does not get overwritten

3051773
put	get
i would suggest that you get the file names and put them in a database

3051784
keydown	keyup
for keydown and keyup events this is relatively simple it s the key code for the key pressed and returns the same value as the event s keycode property

3051784
keydown	keyup
since all browsers support the keycode property and ie 9 does not support which you should generally use keycode for keydown and keyup events

3051806
isbn	vin
entities that exist outside of the application enterprise usually have their own identifiers a car has a vin a book has an isbn etc maintained by an external trusted source and in such cases the guid adds nothing

richfaces	icefaces
still waiting for the next major release of richfaces icefaces which fully supports jsf 2 - currently only alpha builds can be downloaded

3051861
cdr	cons
any list safe the empty list specifically is a cons cell whose car field contains the first element and whose cdr field contains the list which contains the remaining elements

3051861
cdr	cons
which is why cons 0 1 2 3 evaluates to 0 1 2 3 and not 0 1 2 3 we create a cons cell whose car is 0 and whose cdr is 1 2 3 so a list 0 1 2 3

children	parent
i have a model withs parent children and grandchildren in a many-to-many relationship

3052054
children	parent
when i query the parent or children directly using linq the sql reflects the linq query a .count executes a count in the database and so on - fine

3052054
children	parent
the parent class has a children property to access it s children

3052054
icollection	iqueryable
but and now for the problem this doesn t expose an iqueryable interface but an icollection

3052054
children	parent
so when i access the children property on a particular parent all the parent s children are read

3052054
icollection	iqueryable
changing the type of the children property from icollection to iqueryable doesn t solve this

cos	sin
usually in games there is a lot of pre-calculation sin cos values and other stuff that is used very often inside a video game and it would consume a lot of cpu cycles if not pre-calculated

3052400
children	parent
because it belongs to the parent class it means that it s an attribute to all the children

3052503
google-chrome	safari
when i run a .each loop on the response google-chrome safari seems to omit everything that is under the section of the page

3052547
put	get
this would only get useful when such an attribute would replace multiple method calls for instance when having to put code inside try catch finally statements

3052976
getter	setter
normally when you have accessor methods for getting and setting a variable you would have to set the value and from to return the value however actionmailer uses something called adv_attr_accessor to define the from method so that if you call it with a parameter then it acts as a setter but if you call it with no parameters then it acts as a getter

3053150
sum	floor	ceil	floor
if you know the total of the numbers in your case it is 16 you can go from the beginning or the end of the map and sum up the counts until you get to round n 2 th element or in case the sum is even to average of floor n 2 th and ceil n 2 th elements median

3053235
width	height	disk	ram
if i remember right its width x height x bits per pixel 8 mem usage so for a full screen image 1024x768x 16 8 1 572 864 so around 1.5 mb of ram while on disk it may only be a couple hundred kb

3053573
fink	macports
if you install python from fink or macports you have the liberty of updating it

3053573
fink	macports
another important advantage of managing your own version of python with a package manager fink or macports is that they help a lot with the compilation of module dependencies for instance when you use a module that depends on compiled c code

3053584
uitableview	uisegmentedcontrol
i have a situation where i have a single uitableview and a single uisegmentedcontrol with 3 bar buttons.now my requirement is if i change the segment of segment control i want different data source to be loaded to my tableview.but i failed to achieve this every time i change the segment cellforrowatindexpath is showing same data in my table view

3053869
folder	directory
sure you can iterate over windows c program files folder or nix s usr local or other directory to check for browser names but you might run into user-privilege issues and you re never guaranteed to get all browsers nor is this os independent

3053878
inherited	properties
there is a field properties called type that i am using as the dicriminator and i have created a base type and a single inherited type there will be more later if i can actually get this to work

3053925
post	get
this post shows you how to make a get request with jquery

3054072
put	get
is there a way to get the count first time around and put it into a variable and second time around i just pick that variable rather than calling the whole query again

3054096
sorting	filtering
again the purpose of using this is not to return a stateid object it s to just identify that property off of that entity for sorting filtering and other purposes

3054141
public	protected
since classes have private public and protected access specifiers i feel a taste of security

3054186
wxpython	pyqt

i need a fast easy high level mockups tool like balsamiq not a slow low level tool like boa constructor

3054264
hash	md5
another thing is basically rwmnau s suggestion but don t use predefined hash functions like md5 - use running totals

3054264
subtract	add
for each subsequent ones simply subtract the lost byte and add the new one

3054272
getter	setter
this is an awful practice because developers will expect enums and their associated values to be constants but you can still define a non-final field in an enum with getter and setter

3054289
telerik	radwindow
one of them is telerik radwindow

3054300
agile	sprint
the critical success factor might be having that product owner team and all stakeholders really invest in participating in some of your dev team s agile processes showing up for demos being accessible for questions during the sprint etc

3054306
uilabel	uibutton
another solution could be to use a uibutton with its type set to custom instead of a uilabel

3054347
rss	feed
i d like to get the title tag and rss feed address if there is one from a given url but the method s i ve used so far just aren t working at all

3054347
rss	feed
i ve managed to get the title tag by using preg_match and a regular expression but i can t seem to get anywhere with getting the rss feed address

3054376
ant	maven
what you want is a build system like ant or maven you may or may not be familiar with the very old school make - they allow innumerable actions before and after compilation including building distribution binary source control commits documentation generation testing.

3054381
min	max
one approach i considered was to binary search the min max of each disk to determine the disk that should hold that number if it exists then binary search on the disk itself

3054419
ant	maven
yes ant and maven are preferred but if you insist on doing it manually

3054446
public	protected
start by learning the difference between public private and protected methods.

3054521
pull	push
in that same way you can clone a bare repository to a shared server on your internal network have your developers commit to that repo and then have your maintainer pull from the internal repo integrate changes and then push up to github

3054531
stdout	stderr
after researching i have noticed that the correct way to use java s processbuilder is to spawn two other threads to manage gobbling up the stdout stderr of the newly created process so that it doesn t hang as is shown here

3054531
stdout	stderr
1. why exactly are seperate processes needed instead of having the parent process gobble up the stdout and then sequentially the stderr

3054601
post	get
for java ee in order to make simple http get post calls to some web services like in soap web services but transport format must be json

3054601
post	get
in short my purpose is to serve web services using json and http get post in a maximum possible lightweight solution

3054638
stdout	stderr
because the child could write to both and you would get a deadlock when the buffer for stderr is full child waits for parent to read stderr parent waits for child to close stdout

3054644
lapply	strsplit
more generally take advantage of the fact that strsplit returns a list and use lapply

3054716
google-chrome	safari
i am trying to code a safari extension similar to bubble translate for google-chrome

normally statements that use aggregate commands like count max and min fall into this category

3054870
yacc	bison
it s easy to parse these simple expressions using lex and yacc of flex and bison they re the same

3054890

3054989
getter	setter
in many cases hibernate creates at run time a subclass of your entity classes and overrides the getter and setter methods of the persisted properties

3054989
getter	setter
thus you cannot reference the properties directly in equals and hashcode but instead should access them using the property getter and setter even internally in the entity class

3055044
folder	directory
i even have another code that will move the folder and its contents from one directory to another

3055066
put	get
short answer put vspace -0.1cm after latex adjust the size of the space to get the effect you want

3055093
fflush	gets
handle the output buffering yourself instead of letting the library do it for you keep your own set of 146 or however many you might need output buffers and buffer the output to those and perform an open fflush close when a particular output buffer gets filled

3055100
daemons	systemd
the error is telling you that the daemons gem used by delayed job does not work on windows because there is no fork api in windows fork is a unix linux systemd call

3055126
folder	directory
the problem is that the test data files i have made have a folder structure and this folder structure is only maintained on my machine when copied to bin debug whereas on my friends machine only the files are added to the directory

3055193
opera	firefox
the following javascript code works perfectly in opera v10.5x but fails miserably in firefox v3.6 and ie8

3055211
implements	extends
i have a class that extends the thread class and has its run method implements as so

3055264
implements	extends
then handle packet like any other dictionary-like class you could extends this so that packet implements idictionary or go the other direction and make or set protected so that only valid keys are used

3055266
implements	extends
your functionality would be easily implements by extends the memcached class for your specific purposes which might not be what the rest of the world wants

3055291
agile	sprint
the plan is to create user stories that the development team can use in their agile process with 1 month sprint

debian	linux
my problem is the assembly code dumped by gdb in my computer i m doing this on a debian linux image running on vm ware is different from that of the example in the article

3055481
daemon	cron
look for mail that the cron daemon might have sent to the user under which the cron job is running

3055481
daemon	cron	stdout	stderr
if a cron job produces output on stderr or stdout the cron daemon will email that to the owner of the cron job

3055481
daemon	cron
if something is going wrong possibly because of a path issue like rob suggests above you might see a helpful error message in an email from the cron daemon

3055493
children	parent
however that does not match children with their parent for some reason

3055576
post	get
yes this uses get instead of post but looking at your code it shouldn t make a difference

3055581
ant	maven
if maven isn t your cup of tea they do have an ant plugin i don t know if nant can call java ant tasks directly or not

3055581
maven	pom.xml
so i ve got one project with a lot of modules and 1 maven pom.xml

3055607

as to what extjs is it s a javascript library and framework - a la jquery yui mootools prototypejs etc

3055687

so eclipse is doing the correct thing - it is renaming the directory which automatically changes the name of the parent directory of the renamed directory s children to state the very obvious

3055693
pull	push
you won t be able to push or pull from them anymore

3055726
button	checkbox
remember that using checkbox in places where you should be using radio boxes will be confusing your end-users as they wonder why that checkbox is suddenly de-activated while when using radio button the confusion factor is non-existant

3055743
serializable	deserialization
when i need some custom serializable really fast and my case doesn t require deserialization i just write django template that can make any format i want from list queryset object

3055761

3055769
google-chrome	safari
you can get google-chrome and safari to play along better with your styles on an html5 search field including background images if you apply this in your css

3055801
width	height
i just want to have a few ellipses that no matter how the container changes the height and width should always be the same

3055820
min	max
you can use min and max to make the code more concise

3055830
postgresql	mysql
can t say on postgresql ou mysql since i didn t used any

3055841
merb	ruby-on-rails
i first heard about datamapper in reading about merb so it makes sense that it s in ruby-on-rails 3

3055948
ienumerable	iqueryable
since iqueryable inherits from ienumerable i believe the underlying query sent to the server would be the same

3055961
put	get
and when i put text inside this control like above i get this error

3055970
post	get
supposedly you are parsing the post or get data with php so that you can mantain the same name mpan with no problem

3055976
mouse	keyboard
i doesn t act similarly when a user select a choice using mouse to using keyboard arrows

3055976
mouse	keyboard
when using keyboard everything is fine and the value appears after select in the input text box but when using mouse it sticks with the old typed value not the selected one

3056037
nstextview	nstextstorage
if you want the two nstextview to have difference nstextstorage then you have to create two parallel text systems

3056118
icomparable	compareto
as the container classes are primarily based around a generic list object my first instinct was to write the inner classes with icomparable and write the compareto method that compares the properties

i d try it on your jfiddle post but you haven t put the css source into the css frame

getelementsbytagname	htmlcollection
the for-in statement is enumerating also the item and nameditem methods present on the htmlcollection that getelementsbytagname returns

inherited properties are also enumerated this can be another source of problems

3056215

3056279
onkeyup	onkeydown
especialy the onkeyup onkeydown events

3056339
for-loop	arrays
on this line you had 2 calls to getarray which will call getarray on the instance of bubblesort created in main whereas the arrays has been set on a the instance of bubblesort created in run so the 2 calls to getarray in the for-loop need to be a.getarray

3056376
hash	md5
and using the md5 hash function the result is

3056376
hash	md5
i want to know how can i create a php script that will call md5 hash function with the inputs given above and based on that it will generate the hash function value that will be the checksum value for my coding

accessor	properties
i know how to use properties and i understand that they implicitly call underlying get and set accessor depending on whether we are writing to or reading from a properties

3056428

bazaar	git
search for bazaar git then bazaar hg it s mercurial

3056667
websphere	ibm
as far as i know access doesn t have the rights to distribute the ibm websphere java tools anymore so there s no public location where you can get the jar2prc tool for palm os garnet

uuid	uniqueidentifier
use more universal unique identifier data type like uniqueidentifier uuid instead of integer

ultimately i ended up getting all matching entities with the changes.getbystatus named query and then removing them via the entitymanager which seems to handle the cascading correctly

3056968
children	parent
children are always to the right and on the same row or lower of their parent node

3056998

3057093

opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
also they rendered in firefox safari google-chrome ie and opera mobile identically

put	get
you should be able to implement this in a fairly restful way with http put and get operations

3057260
pop-up	dialog
i need to display an image in a resizable dialog so far all the specific image pop-up libraries i have tried do not fit my needs

3057270

profiling	debugging
and for the purpose of finding out the memory usage of an app during debugging profiling the hack is good enough

3057298
width	height
the control then slices it up into separate tiles based on the image list s configured width and height

3057359
google-chrome	safari
en-us applewebkit 533.4 khtml like gecko google-chrome 5.0.375.70 safari 533.4 had i instead been a web crawler i would have used something else something the web server would identify as a crawler and the web server the web developer could have return a optimized page for indexing

3057400
client-side	server-side
javascript is client-side code php is server-side so you cannot execute javascript while building the page in php

3057421
post	get
i would suggest using post to process your database modifications instead of get

3057449
button	checkbox	checkbox	dropdownlistfor
remove them from the menu and represent them as data objects in the work area of the page or another page if they are rarely used using controls like radio button dropdownlistfor and checkbox

3057461
folder	directory
i ve tried just creating a new folder and naming it jquery but it gave me a cryptic error the directory is already on the disk .

3057470
listbox	bindingnavigator
it appears that every time the bindingnavigator moves to an element the listbox is told to move to the first item in its collection and thus overwrites whatever value used to be in the variable bound to its selecteditem

3057479
x86	64bit
misaligned pointers were a killer in x86 where 64bit architectures were not nearly as prone to the crash or even slow performance at all

3057513
accessor	properties
i understand how declared properties work - i just need a clarification on when objective c is using the accessor method vs

3057553
daemons	systemd
the real way to do it would be to code an actual daemons in w e language and just make a systemd call to etc init.d daemon_name start and .

3057568
dynamic-languages	introspection
may i suggest python a nice very high-level dynamic-languages which has rich introspection included and by usage of compile eval or exec permits a form of self-modifying code

3057612
folder	directory
on the mac many things are placed in the bundle folder so that there are no external files directory and since windows has no equivalent people get confused as to what path they re in

3057640
range	max	range	min	min	max
i m attempting to build a tiny or perhaps not so tiny formula that will contain numbers between a set min and max but also loop these numbers so they are not clipped if they are outside of the range

3057640
range	max
as i want it to since the max is part of the range

3057661
min	max	width	height
q max width height min width height

3057661
division	subtract
subtract the rounded down value from the result of the next subrects division

3057670
google-chrome	safari
you ll need a default property with a single repeating background for those browsers that don t support gradients then gecko and google-chrome safari have different syntax for the gradients so you ll need a property each for them

3057677
mouse	keyboard
i ve got an appsight recording for those not familiar it s a recording of what they did including keyboard mouse input + network traffic etc of a customer reproducing a bug

3057686
lisp	smalltalk
smalltalk methods tend to be more fine-grained than lisp functions so that may be a good place to begin

3057692
kerberos	ntlm
sharepoint uses ntlm or kerberos authentication

3057707
protovis	infovis
you could also have a look at protovis and possibly infovis toolkit

3057751
serializable	deserialization
is there a way to ensure that the enum type has not been manipulated between serializable and deserialization

3057789
public	protected
but the more i thought about this explanation the less it made sense because if i recall correctly as soon as you take the pointer to a member assuming you initially are within access control of the member all access control information is lost i could define a function that returns an arbitrary pointer to a member that alternately returns a public protected or private member depending on some input and the returner would be none the wiser

3057795
button	checkbox
maybe the user clicked on the checkbox but before release the mouse button he moved the mouse away from the component

3057797
recvfrom	datagram
if you could recvfrom without bind you d essentially be asking the stack to give your program all udp datagram sent to that computer

3057815
union	distinct
it s common to use either strings or enums for these in c# java but discriminated union seem more appropriate in f# because these are distinct read-only values

3057834
hex	binary
a your file has random junk or a big chunk of binary zeroes apppended to it -- this should be obvious in a hex editor

3057834
spaces	delimiter
or b the delimiter is a string of one or more whitespace characters spaces tab the first few rows have tabs and the remaining rows have spaces

3057838
int	boolean
rather than having a half dozen boolean in my db i can just use an int and assign each payment method an int like so

3057853
min	max
edit if you want max to be a valid value instead of overflowing to min replace max by max+1 in all 3 places

3057928
backgrounding	multitasking
actually i am working for multitasking and facing error please assist me as i need to work on backgrounding application and also in foreground application

3057938
width	height
after selecting or uploading an image with the ckfinder the user can change the width and height

3057938
width	height
i want it to automatically resize the image to the width and height the user sets

3057938
width	height
somebody has experience with an automatic width and height resize-plugin

3057978
vsto	add-in
this should work in a vsto add-in as it does in any other form

3057988
jboss	glassfish
and these could be implemented with your own server tomcat apache glassfish jboss etc..

3057988
post	get
if you post a little more detail on what you are trying to do you will probably get some more specific recommendations also

3058015
hide	show
i know about the uisearchbardelegate protocol but i don t know how to show hide the scope bar with animation

3058016
gif	png	tiff	png
it can read convert and write images in a variety of formats over 100 including dpx exr gif jpeg jpeg-2000 pdf photocd png postscript svg and tiff

3058055
min	max	width	height
you can view a demo here you can also destroy and re-create it...but that s a bit wasteful so just create it above specify the max min height width in the resizable instead of the dialog if needed

3058057
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome and firefox 2.x even when you use the typeof operator with a regexp object you get function because they implement the internal method

3058098
webclient	httpwebrequest
but webclient and httpwebrequest throw exception

3058112
imagemagick	mogrify
i ve been using imagemagick s mogrify on cygwin but at some point it stopped working

3058139
16-bit	64bit
the context for this question is generating unique ids a 64bit id might be composed of several 16-bit hashes of various 32-bit values

3058150
concave	convex
btw i should have mentioned that the quadrangle can be convex or concave

3058169
hash	salt
password is hash salt and compared to one in the database

3058182
ssl	https
if you use https ssl for your page your ajax requests will by default be handled the same way so yes this would eliminate all the clear-text issues and you ll get all the security benefits of ssl with your ajax requests as well

3058184
hash	md5
i would say just apply a standard hash like sha1 or md5 and then grab the last 16 bits of that

3058208
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this works just fine in google-chrome safari firefox but is really slow in ie

3058220
servicebehavior	was
what actually worked for me was setting the servicebehavior attribute for my service class

3058241
google-chrome	firefox
alright this code works in google-chrome and firefox but not ie which is to be expected

3058276
post	get
the browser cache should automatically invalidate the cache when you do a post to the same uri that you did a get from

3058311
post	get
use button.postbackurl to change the page which the button post to and then on the target page use page.previouspage to get a reference to the source page and therefore its controls

3058326
width	height
press button touch to show dialog 90 height and width - ok

3058330
width	height
css this is the simple example with 2 images you ll need to set the height + width

3058335
twitter	bit.ly
they will often shorten the url with tinyutl or bit.ly and get it out with the usual social engineering methods email message board twitter hijacked facebook accounts etc.

3058361
opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari
right now i use and it works like a charm no opera firefox or whatever because if i set the background to the image as i do in safari they will all be ruined

3058373
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
sure all newer browsers firefox 3.5+ newer google-chrome versions newer safari and opera versions ie 9 will support it but they make up a very small portion of the internet right now

3058453
children	parent
my initial thought here is to access the parent and then retrieve a list of children within it

3058469
lisp	scheme
as to which is easier lisp or scheme being dialects of the lisp family at the beginner level they are pretty much the same thing and interchangeable

3058469
lisp	scheme
i learned common lisp from peter siebel s practical common lisp then picked up sicp and worked through all the exercises through the first two chapters using common lisp rather than scheme

3058475
concave	convex
a collection of documents has lat lng values and i want to find all documents within a concave or convex polygon

3058492
setinterval	clearinterval
this is only an idea you can use a setinterval function to put the focus in the username field and you can interrupt it when you want with clearinterval function

3058526
post	get
the included page file must account for that when setting up post targets for instance or you will get very bizarre errors

3058533
post	put
when i put ajax on my code i send a group of variable via post but when i received the data it is in a obj.responsetext ie text format

3058571
google-chrome	firefox
i have spent the last half hour working with google-chrome s inspector and firefox s dom inspector - all to no avail

3058574
rss	feed
actually if your sites publish atom or rss feed parse those instead

3058604
versioning	upgrade
android cannot be tricked into installing the premium versioning over the free versioning and treat it as an upgrade

3058605
rss	feed
if at all feasible use the blogs rss or atom feed instead -- they re well-structured xml rather than not-so-well structured html and universal feed parser is enormously helpful at getting to feed contents in python

3058605
lxml	beautifulsoup
lxml the library hank recommends does include a copy of beautifulsoup i believe but if that s all you re going to get why go to the bother of installing the whole when you only need a part

3058609
rss	feed
instead of parsing the html page why not parse the rss feed

3058609
rss	feed
you can still use regex for parsing the rss feed or you can use existing python modules such as universal feed parser

3058634
portrait	landscape
in case of landscaperight and landscapeleft and portrait top home button the views shows correctly but when the app start in portrait bottom home button the views show in landscape mode..

3058654
post	get
the plugin doesn t permanently change urls in the database so if you disable the plugin you get your category base back with no 404s for post

3058702
fadein	fadeout
i am trying to create a jquery fadein fadeout effect for my page content using the code below

3058755

firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the cookie itself is just a rgb colour value which gets set using .click and is working fine in google-chrome and firefox yet in safari the value of the cookie is incomplete showing up as rgb 193 instead of rgb 193 184 76 as the other browsers do

3058782
accessor	properties
instead declare a different properties themutablearray corresponding to no instance variable and write this accessor

3058787
put	get
can i get this logic into the model or will i have to put it in the controller

3058822
folder	directory
i have this script which moves all my folder and files from my c projects directory into a rar archive in c backup

3058838
opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari
the jquery code below works ok with firefox safari opera but not with ie

3058851
jruby	rubinius
rubinius and jruby are optimizing next for the builtin types because it is very difficult to implement in particular on the jvm

3058856
hash	salt
however if you are storing passwords be sure to only store them as a salt hash since apps with root permissions if your app is ever installed on a rooted phone read and even alter the sqlite databases of other apps

3058948
google-chrome	firefox
my application is working fine and looking good in google-chrome and firefox

3058948
google-chrome	firefox
that is working good in firefox google-chrome but not in ie

3058952
multiplying	add
in this case you can t just multiplying two numbers by different factors and add

3058952
post	get
my original post would have an interest ratio of 1 2000 while this post which got 28 views and 1 comment right now it would get a score of 1 28

3058999
int	chars
the generic it takes is primitive type always int chars bool string etc

3059003
devise	activemodel	activemodel	mongomapper
the only versions of devise that support rails 3 have removed the orm adapters for mongomapper due to mm relying on a custom validatable gem which uses a different syntax than the activerecord activemodel style

3059014
width	height
another more elegant solution involves setting width and or height and overflow

3059034
firefox	safari
apparently from here alt text showing in ie and firefox but not in safari

3059051
post	get
1. did classic asmx web services standard http post get use soap to

3059076
mongoid	activemodel
mongoid uses activemodel s to_json method and by default that method includes the root object in the json which i don t want

3059092
onresume	onpause
so i guess u can override the onpause and onresume functions to put your bit of code

3059112
implements	extends
you mentioned that you ve created an class that extends sqliteopenhelper and implements the oncreate method

3059160
ubuntu	linux	x86	64bit

folder	directory
i am troubling from this problem i want to find the list of folder but there is some problem i have a support folder in root directory first i have the subfolder of this support folder then in each folder i have to find a specific say x folder and then in this x folder i want to check each file and folder

3059287
sqlconnection	sqltransaction
as thief master said - when the using block is exited the sqltransaction or sqlconnection is closed

3059315
ready	each
i would set the link destinations into the fadeurl attribute on each link and then your document ready code could look like this

3059318
inherited	subclassing
in c# using reflection is it possible to define method in the base class that returns its own name in the form of a string and have subclassing inherited this behavior in a polymorphic way

3059322
portrait	landscape
in portrait mode it is working fine but when i changed to landscape mode the ad size i am getting in portrait mode is the same size of the ad displayed in landscape mode

3059346
equals	gethashcode
you will have to define your own container possibly wrapping the list to get useful semantics for equality-hash-equals gethashcode and equals

3059346
equals	gethashcode
to avoid mutability issues and a changing gethashcode equals results which would make use of your new object in a hashing dictionary problematic

3059346
equals	gethashcode
you can use sequenceequal to implement equals rather trivially but you ll need to implement a gethashcode in a relevant way -- a simple method is a shifting xor of the gethashcode of each element

3059346
equals	gethashcode
note in .net4 there is a set of tuple ... classes which override gethashcode and equals

3059347
portrait	landscape
iâ ve got a view that has to be presented both in landscape and portrait

3059358
int	chars
so results in const chars and results in int

3059363
int	chars
ord c will return an int representing the chars

3059366
put	get
don t forget that when you use an integer in a map you can get put int as well and java will automatically box unbox it for you but if you rely on this - you can get npes when asking the map for a key that does not exist

3059427
terminate	timeout
sometimes you get lucky and you have more than corepoolsize threads alive so every worker thread will go into a conditional logic branch that allows it to terminate after your specified timeout period of 10 seconds

3059448
getter	setter
even if the properties in question are not all called name you can still use the nterface solution by adding a name property to each and having its getter and setter access the other property

3059483
post	put
i have a jquery post ajax call that calls a controller method but i did not put any authenticity code in it and yet the call succeeds

3059490
implements	extends
icy and http are very similar and if you ve already implements icy on top of socketserver you could probably extends basehttpserver.basehttprequesthandler to respond to both icy and http requests on the same port

3059498
google-chrome	firefox
whereas google-chrome and firefox takes the maximum width of the items in the select box

3059540
margin	height
try height margin border and padding with

3059595
qpainter	qimage
because qimage is a qpaintdevice subclass qpainter can be used to draw directly onto images

3059595
qpainter	qimage
when using qpainter on a qimage the painting can be performed in another thread than the current gui thread

3059730
getter	setter
and then let compiler generate setter and getter methods for you automatically with desired memory management behaviour

3059738
allocator	stl
with standard stl containers like list string etc you may or may not want to use custom memory allocator

3059798
int	double
converting between double and int might be faster or slower for you

3059808
int	boolean
this is a reflection of my programming background that has led me to the belief that boolean are a different type from int and pointers and that assignments are not expressions even though in the case of the c implementation i am wrong

3059812
folder	directory
for development your media_root may point to an arbitrary local directory on your machine containing the files it need not even be below your django project s root folder see

versions 4.0.5 5.0 changes the height of my text lines or at least it looks like that or as if a padding margin has been increased - but nothing has been changed except for the font

3059905
firefox	safari
why does this font setting yield to different results in firefox and safari

3059987
tstringlist	tlist
scan the file structure for each hit add the path+file to a tlist tstringlist or similar using syncronize

3060014
addition	multiplication
addition multiplication square root and so on

3060028
getter	setter
however getter and setter need not map to actual members

3060050
uilabel	uitextview
i have a uilabel and if i adjust the size of the text i can make it look loke a uitextview however the left margin is different on the uilabel the text is right up against the left border where the uitextview has a slight margin

3060064
addition	multiplication
my guess was that the computer did repeated addition to achieve multiplication

3060093
multiplying	addition
repeated addition would be a very inefficient way to multiplying numbers imagine multiplying 1298654825 by 85324154

3060093
multiplying	add
to multiplying them together multiplying the mantissas and add the exponents

3060123
versioning	upgrade
it is already in the our development versioning trunk and 1.1.x but you might not want to upgrade to any of them if you consider this go for 1.1.x

3060154
textarea	textbox
i have created web application and textbox as a textarea

3060184
luasocket	iup
so i m using luasocket for the comms and iup for the ui bits

3060214
accessor	properties
if the string resides as a properties in a class you could make it a read-only properties - accessor method but no setter method

3060232
uitableview	reloaddata
i ve been playing with this problem for a couple of days and think that subclassing uitableview s reloaddata is the best approach

3060232
uitableview	reloaddata
i ve subclassed uitableview to send methods to the delegate before and after reloaddata

3060247
hash	md5
using sha1 or md5 might be a good idea but this requires going through the whole file to create that hash

3060312
bazaar	svn	bazaar	git
in comparsion to git hg and bazaar it is true git hg or bazaar can handle these situations svn at the moment doesn t

3060320
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
this only happens in firefox i ve tested already in explorer google-chrome and opera

3060396
width	height
w is the width function and h is the height of the original array data

3060416
subtract	add
i don t know what you want to achieve but you could add one day add a month and subtract one day

3060453
public	protected
in my own components plugins modules should i follow this convention or use a more secure private public and protected keywords

3060493
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
which worked only in ie and not in firefox safari google-chrome and opera

3060493
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
which appears to fix the position only in firefox and not in safari google-chrome and opera

3060507
public	protected
it is very difficult to add php 5 s new oop features like private public protected to a complex system like that

3060511
superclass	subclassing
i have a subclassing and a superclass

3060511
superclass	subclassing
how can i persist a subclassing as a superclass

3060511
superclass	subclassing
i do not prefer creating a superclass instance and then passing the values from the subclassing instance

3060520
width	height
in ckeditor is there a way to get the width and height attributes instead of css style attribute for the image dimensions

3060565
implements	extends
if it is too much of a burden to implements all six methods on this interface you can extends the mouseadapter instead which provides default no op methods for all the event types and you can just override the ones you need

3060565
jlist	jtable	jlist	jtree	jtree	jtable
it seems on closer inspection that jlist jtable and jtree require a bit extra for drag and drop support

3060587
jobs	cron
you should probably use a cron job which schedules a task google cron jobs and that can execute and run a mysql query on an interval

3060610
children	parent
since offset is always relative to the parent element all you have to do is to add offsetleft and offsetwidth to get the total width of all children

3060617
multiplying	multiplication
multiplying the mantissas 5.1 2.6 13.26 nb this can be done with integer multiplication as long as you track where the decimal point should be

3060619
width	height
not the height and width from getheight and getwidth

3060627
g++	gcc
if you re interested in a concrete implementation i would still recommend you take a look at the gnu compiler collection especially gcc or g++ as it is perhaps the most popular open-source c compiler that s available

3060656
width	height
so it turns out setting width and height for the image will show alt text incase the image is unavailable not otherwise

3060680
csv	tsv
the new bulkloader supports delimited csv tsv etc and xml formats at a minimum but much like the old bulkloader it s possible to support any format you wish

3060696
webkit	gecko
if you re talking about line art then svg is a good choice because embedded in xhtml its properties become scriptable in gecko or webkit via javascript

3060718
width	height
i think you ll want to look at activity.getwindow and window.getdecorview and get the width height of that

3060751
integer	unsigned
- doesn t matter to a 64-bit unsigned integer

3060754
post	get
with get the parameters are appended to the url with post they are in the http message body

3060778
versioning	upgrade
note that if you don t have administrator priviledges then you can install a local versioning of the toolkit alongside the sdk but you would need admi to upgrade the driver

3060886
hide	show
i m writing a jquery plugin and i would like my code to take advantage of the jquery ui and functions which allow you to show and hide elements with a nice animation

3060886
hide	show
however i d also like my plugin to degrade gracefully if jquery ui isn t available switching back to use the basic non-animating show and hide functions present in the standard jquery api

3060886
hide	show
i ll need to test for the show and hide functions specifically as even if jquery ui is available it could potentially be a custom version without the effects components included

3060915
public	protected
the compiler is free to reorder different access levels as it wish lay out in memory public before protected before private... but many don t

3060934
profiling	debugging
nvidia s parallel nsight formerly codenamed nexus has opencl profiling features in the beta and will support opencl debugging

3060945
google-chrome	firefox
this works perfectly in firefox and apart from google-chrome not getting the textarea content perfect there too

3060951
sqldatareader	sqlconnection
but in general you can use a nice sqlconnection object and a sqlcommand call a stored procedure and get a nice sqldatareader full of data from which you can build a datatable or an ienumerable list of data objects

3060951
listview	gridview	gridview	repeater
you then have a repeater type control listview gridview etc in the ui simply by binding your datatable or list to that control will render the results

3060951
filtering	grouping
if you still want to show the data as an ordered list then use a listview define a template for each data item then you can use linq to grouping or filtering the data you like the data item template can contain whatever html or asp.net controls you like and that template gets rendered for each data item in the list of data

3060955
postgresql	mysql
postgresql can do this with the --table parameter mysql seems to do this when the table names are listed after the database name

3060993
integer	unsigned
you can get the ip address as a 32-bit unsigned integer from client_addr.sin_addr.s_addr

3061058
hide	show
or if you want it completely read only you can set or if you don t like the look of that i sometimes have two controls one readonly textbox and one combobox and then hide the combo and show the textbox if it should be completely readonly and vice versa

3061146
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
firefox safari google-chrome all work as expected

3061180
filesystems	fat
to be exact fat filesystems uses so-called fat table - it is a table located close to the start of the hdd or partition adress space and it contains map of all clusters little storage cells

3061180
filesystems	fat
ok so now when you want to save some file to the hdd os filesystems driver looks into fat table and searches for the value 0x0

3061190
division	modulo
i have added all the ranges and some checkings using modulo division to avoid incorrect values set directly in the value field using the keyboard instead of the arrows

3061196
ienumerable	ilist
of course you can search through an ilist or ienumerable etc for a matching key but that will take o n time rather than o 1 for hashtable or dictionary

3061198
ienumerable	ilist
if you are using list ilist or ienumerable generally this means that you are looping over data well in the case of ienumerable it definitely means that and a hashtable isn t going to net you anything

3061272
integer	unsigned
this means that anything of integer type that is narrower than an int is promoted to an int or possibly unsigned int before the operation is performed

3061272
int	chars
this means that is performed as an int calculation but because the result is stored back into a which is a chars the result has to undergo a narrowing conversion hence the warning

3061304
mousemove	mouseenter
if i use for example a mousemove event handler on a div and check the layerx property of the event it changes when my mouseenter a positioned element inside that div like an image

3061360
accessor	properties
wpf and silverlight have a data binding model whereby i can provide a binding with a path which comprises a dot-notation of properties accessor down from a datacontext to a specific value inside a complex object graph eg

3061360
getter	setter
i have a non-ui requirement to accept such a path expressed as a simple string and to use reflection on an object which is hopefully of a type which exposes the right property getter and setter in order to read and or write values to those properties

3061362
chunked	transfer-encoding
transfer-encoding chunked

3061400
width	height
to clarify say i have a canvas having its width height as 100 100

3061435
folder	directory
can you put you logic into a webservice hosted by yourself if not you may want to look at using mef directory catalog to view a folder without having to compile it

3061453
button	checkbox
so i have a set of checkbox button generate using yui markup and javascript

3061473
move	drag
it seems that if you drag a uiview display into a secondary display in interface builder and save the xib then either disconnect that display or open it on a computer with a secondary display in a different postion left v right of the screen for example then the view can t be seen closed move

3061481
opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari
go to adobe.com and download the plugin for other browsers firefox safari opera and re-install.

3061492
mouse	keyboard
if your listview items don t need mouse or keyboard interaction you can just put a rectangle with a visual brush to the right of it

3061496
cil	ildasm
using ildasm to decompile the resultant executable gives us the following cil listing

3061514
getter	setter
the beauty of dot notation for accessing the getter and setter of synthesized object properties is that you can think of the dot-notated properties as data fields

3061514
getter	setter
the bottom line of it is dot-notation is for accessing data fields while knowing that it s really a convenient piece of syntactical sugar around synthesized getter and setter methods and method calls are for instructing objects to do something

3061526
uilabel	uibutton
some cells have uilabel and some have uibutton

3061526
uilabel	uibutton
however the uibutton repeat when i scroll down appearing over the uilabel

3061533
division	multiplication
but using multiplication and division isn t as interesting or inefficient as this 17-character solution

3061542
user-controls	datarepeater
oh btw the user-controls is in a datarepeater so it occurs for each of the user

3061547
client-side	server-side
note that server-side caching is not nearly as effective as client-side caching

3061608
centos	linux
i used 5.3.2 on linux centos .

3061612
implements	extends
i ve noticed that extends idisposable so i m required to implements the dispose method

3061645
google-chrome	firefox
i ran your code in firefox google-chrome and ie8 with no trouble

3061680
ecj	javac
a few examples where ecj is preferred over javac is

3061759
implements	extends
class myenum e extends myenum implements mycomparable e

3061766
client-side	server-side
you can remove it client-side by removing the session cookie usually asp.net_sessionid or server-side by calling session.abandon

3061770
width	height
no matter what i input for padding the width and height of the button never changes

3061776
superclass	subclassing
this is required for superclass to define methods using the generic parameter that work transparently natively if you will with their subclassing

3061776
superclass	subclassing
and hence you can provide method implementations in the superclass that remain useful and specific in all subclassing

3061776
superclass	subclassing
basically the conclusion is that this trick is useful when you want to provide some functionality in a superclass that somehow gets more specific in subclassing

3061776
superclass	subclassing
by declaring the superclass like this you are locking down the generic parameter for any subclassing to be the subclassing itself

3061776
superclass	subclassing
this is why you can write a generic compareto or createchild method in the superclass and prevent it from becoming overly vague when you re dealing with specific subclassing

3061779
implements	extends
di ioc aims to satisfy interfaces with concrete classes and given that your static class along with its static methods by definition cant implements an interface or extends a class the question makes no sense

3061793
actualheight	actualwidth
makes sure to check the following canvas properties actualwidth actualheight opacity visibility

3061823
pop-up	dialog
i am having a button in the pop-up dialog

3061841
ant	maven
you can use maven instead of ant

3061841
ant	maven
using maven you can specify packaging type and you don t need to write ant script

3061859
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this will work for firefox 3.0+ google-chrome and safari

3061869
elf	dwarf
use objdump -w to look at the elf file s dwarf debug information to see the .debug_str table

3061921
uiview	calayer
in most cases you make an uiimage out of a uiview s calayer

3061985
onresume	onpause
the proper way to do it is stopping the thread onpause and recreating it onresume

3062063
rss	feed
i parsed the following elements from a rss feed title dc creator and enclosure url an image

3062105
post	put	post	get	put	get
the generic activeresource class has the four main verbs get put post delete as methods which it calls against a specified resource url passed in at cunstruction

3062105
post	put
of course you can also use the other verbs on the object to put post and delete

3062105
post	put	post	get	put	get
the code basically wraps up the underlying http post put get functions and takes care of the serialiasation of the payload to objects

3062117
post	get
could be a caching issue try using post instead of get

3062128
websphere	ibm
i ve recently started on a project to develop some portlets which will run on ibm websphere portal server 6.1

3062128
ant	maven
does anyone know of any scripts ant tasks maven plugins etc

3062212
multiplying	add
need to manipulate with large floating point numbers more than 10 billions - make add multiplying operations and so on

3062245
min	max
this can make the second phase o m in the best case when there s a unique min max in a row column

3062264
regasm	gacutil
i use regasm to register the type library for com and gacutil to install the assembly into the gac

3062307
joomla	phpbb
now i have to refactor the whole page with joomla and want to integrate the phpbb3 directly into the main page so that header menu and footer of the joomla page are still beeing displayed only the content shall be the phpbb

3062327
children	parent
i use libraries i created that effectively allow one datacontext to save changes back to a parent datacontext and for a parent datacontext to notify its children that it just received changes

3062327
children	parent
when the child datacontext writes back to the parent this causes all controls bound to objects in the parent to update and for the parent to broadcast the changes to all children so they can update too or not if they are in snapshot mode

3062406
xslt	xquery
i have been watching this thread for a bit and wondering this myself as i am a vim user and work with a lot of very large xml files and associated xsd s xslt s and xquery files all of which could benefit from this sort of thing as i am sure you can imagine

3062454
udp	tcp
if you want real-time you have to use udp sockets not tcp pipes

3062473
integer	unsigned
an array can t have a negative number of items so an unsigned integer is a much better match for the kinds of values this method will actually return

3062484
range	max	range	min	min	max
the effects table might have better descriptions of what sp stands for maybe the min and max range etc

3062504
hash	md5
a create md5 hash for all the files

3062509
jdom	xom
edit i wound up pimping jdom after all because xom doesn t compile xpath queries ahead of time

3062525
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
firefox unlike opera or epiphany but like google-chrome builds the codec directly into the browser

3062600
hide	show	slideup	slidedown
i used slideup and slidedown functions to show hide elements

3062624
voltdb	acid
voltdb is an opensource commercial database acid scalable and very high throughput 50x from leading oltp dbms

3062666
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
firefox ie6-9 safari opera google-chrome

3062669
getter	setter
is-accesible allows an object to be updated regardless of access modifier and presence of getter setter essential for objects generated using jaxb

3062675
joomla	phpbb
note that phpbb isn t running exactly inside of joomla since that would be disadvantages for performance reasons.

3062700
implements	extends
to accomplish this i would suggest implements a action extends abstractaction to deal with when the user attempts to open a file

3062741
sequence	permutation
this implies that most permutation of a long sequence can never be generated

3062746
division	multiplication
basic arithmetic operations are + - and not xor or left shift right shift multiplication and division

3062787
post	put	post	get	put	get
i am able to perform the get operation but i am unable to perform put post or delete requests

3062797
put	get
i randomly get this excpetion when i try to reach my session to put a variable

3062826
children	parent
following code returns all parent on the top and then the children

3062826
children	parent
i would like to get data parent 1 â his children then parent 2 - his children then parent3 â his children

3062879
post	get
as far as i know webinvoke only supports get and post at this time

3062879
post	put
i use post to perform put and delete action instead

3062884
jsf	wicket
component based mvc frameworks jsf wicket

3062891
integer	unsigned
sprintf will then write it as an unsigned integer

3062956
onchange	onkeyup
this javascript is triggered on the onchange standard asp.net behavior event but i would like that this javascript is triggered onkeyup

3062961
free	malloc
if malloc simply takes a long time you re probably traversing a fragmented free list many of whose entries have been swapped out

3062961
free	malloc
for more information on malloc implementations including understanding fragmented free lists the wikipedia article is good

3063014
move	drag
this is fine and working as intended however the problem is that now my collision detection is tripped whenever you try to move this player because its sitting underneath a wall and because of this you cant drag the player anymore

3063022
children	parent
i personally do not like them when i can avoid them but it would give you a way to grab one parent at a time and then all that parent s children

3063079
put	get
where do i need to put the files to get them register

3063084
post	get
i am doing phonegap app i want to access web service from server in coding javascript get post or ajax methods working fine for http url request but it cant work for https url request

3063133
setinterval	clearinterval
i know i could do this by using clearinterval and then using setinterval again but is there a cleaner way

3063159
min	max
what i want is the min and max values for paraid column for each group of errorid values.

3063159
min	max
for example for errorid 3 the min paraid is 125 and max is 129

3063172
setinterval	settimeout
alternatively you could stop using setinterval entirely and just use settimeout

3063173
int	boolean	int	chars	int	double
environment entries limited to string chars byte short int long boolean double and float

3063236
firefox	safari
tested in firefox safari ie8

3063267
hash	salt
remember also that you have to store your salt along with the password or you won t be able to check the plaintext version against the hash version

3063333
vmware	virtualbox	virtualbox	parallels
alternatives to virtualbox include parallels desktop vmware fusion and crossover mac

3063378
getter	setter
a safe practice in oop is to use setter getter methods

3063403
daemon	cron
instead try something else to schedule tasks like cron or my scheduler daemon gem

3063406
button	checkbox
i want to display checkbox or button at the same position based on user role

3063410
onresume	onpause
although when the child activity is started the onpause event is fired and it stops the camera until onresume is called

3063410
onresume	onpause
to the onpause and a similar one to the onresume methods

3063411
apache	nginx	apache	lighttpd	nginx	lighttpd
run as non-root and use a standard webserver apache or a lightweight one such as lighttpd or nginx on port 80 to redirect to your instance

3063432
trie	tree
you can also use a trie which is a prefix tree data structure - for sorting in memory

3063432
trie	tree
sorting requires you traversing all the trienodes of the trie tree using dfs depth first search - o |v| + |e| time

3063453
post	get
i have a get post json function on an aspx page

3063456
hide	show
if the purpose is to show or hide a part of the page then you can do the following things

3063471
lxml	elementtree
my personal suggestion would be lxml as i m currently using it on a project and it extends the very usable elementtree interface already present in the standard lib xml.etree

3063471
lxml	elementtree
lxml includes added support for xpath xslt and various other features lacking in the standard elementtree module

3063487
folder	directory
i m trying to code a batch file to copy only the most recently dated file in a given folder to another directory on the local machine and simultaneously rename it as it does

3063530
post	get
what is the difference when encrypting get and post data

3063535
post	get
the difference is that an encrypted parameter that is sent with get verb will be visible in the address bar while the one sent with the post verb will not of course this doesn t mean that the user cannot see the encrypted value

3063541
post	get
post can send more data than get

3063547
post	get
if you re using an encryption library to encrypt the data then you can use get or post but this will be an added pain and you might not setup the encryption correctly so i d still recommend using post over https rather than rolling your own encryption setup

3063554
uiview	subviews
i have a uitextview object and i want to load a label object or a set of label object over it but i dont have a view property for uitextview.the only thing i have is subviews property in uiview class which is parent class of uitextview.how should i really go about it.

3063654
pop-up	dialog
it opens up a pop-up window with pdf file inside it but fails to open the print dialog box

3063654
pop-up	dialog
opens up the pop-up window and show the print dialog box

3063712
kde	gnome
d-bus is a lightweight ipc protocol and object request broker orb very similar to com and heavily inspired by both com and d-bus s predecessors dcop kde and corba gnome as well as netlink linux kernel

3063712
kde	gnome
gnome had bonobo which was based on corba and kde had kparts which was based on dcop

3063712
kde	gnome
in the end under the umbrella of the free desktop organization whose goal it is to create cros-desktop standards both the kde and gnome developers got together to develop an ipc messaging system based on the best parts of dcop and netlink and the result was d-bus

3063712
kde	gnome
in current versions of both gnome and kde d-bus has completely replaced corba and dcop thus making it possible to run gnome applications in kde and vice-versa with much higher fidelity

3063725
cos	sin
sin î +î² cos î² sin î + sin î² cos î

3063725
cos	sin
cos î +î² cos î cos î² â sin î sin î²

3063754
post	get
so to get an event handler called with the right context this value you have to take special steps as outlined in the post linked above

3063787
post	get
when making an ajax call when contenttype is set to application json instead of the default x-www-form-urlencoded server side in php can t get the post parameters

3063798
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
i tested it on my local iis server and on an internal build server in ie7 google-chrome opera firefox and it worked fine

3063811
hash	salt
whichever you use use salt hash

3063857
strcpy	strcmp	strlen	strcpy	strlen	strcmp
obviously a lot of functions are missing strcpy strlen strcmp etc.. here s a link to the actual header file

3063867
int	chars
1 is an int that holds the chars value of 1

3063912
hash	salt
my recommendation would be to use the highest level of the sha algorithms that you can in your programming language and hash against a salt value you can create a random one by hashing the current time if you like that you store in the database record with the hash password

3063930
spaces	delimiter
the problem is when i look at the output it also includes spaces as delimiter and chops up my results

3063955
maven	cargo
it also works well with our build and deploy - the war is built using maven so all necessary dependencies are included and also can be deployed to our qa app servers using the cargo plugin

3063969
google-chrome	firefox
there are two problems while it works just fine in firefox ie and google-chrome do not create the table if the page is refreshed

3063979
integer	fractions
okay from what i understand an integer that is a fractions will be rounded one way or the other so that if a formula comes up with say 5 6 - it will automatically round it to 1

3064003
copying	overwrite
further if a function returns data allocated on its stack it will require copying semantics on the caller s part or risk returning something that will be overwrite by the next function call

3064018
pull	push
so i m new to dynamic web design my sites have been mostly static with some php and i m trying to learn the latest technologies in web development which seems to be ajax and i was wondering if you re transferring a lot of data is it better to construct the page on the server and push it to the user or is it better to pull the data needed and create the html around it on the clientside using javascript

3064040
vim	emacs
i was very happy with my vim but once i heard of org-mode i started learning emacs

3064041
client-side	server-side
it s better to do as much as possible on the server-side because 1 you don t know if the client will even have javascript enabled and 2 you don t know how fast the client-side processing will be

3064054
spaces	delimiter
set it to true and it will only parse on the delimiter not the spaces

3064069
hide	show
i would make the initial startup form your login page and authenticate the user if their details are correct hide the login form and show you other form

3064076
postgresql	mysql
please also tell me where would be difference when i use different database like postgresql or mysql within steps

3064140
dictionary	map
no a many-to-many table can only map the keys plus index or map key if it s a list or dictionary and its own id if it s an idbag

3064164
nsscanner	nsxmlparser
that said i think nsxmlparser on it s own uses nsscanner or similar + extra processing for bells and whistles related to xml

3064185
versioning	upgrade
so i then created the new mde but when users try to open it gives them the message that it is not the correct format and that they should upgrade to a newer versioning of access

3064199
width	height
i need to have a crossdomain iframe with dynamic width and height

3064203
union	distinct
if you know the records by design such as each table is for a differnt clinet or each table has a differnt date range cannot be duplicated union all not try to distinct the resultset and thus runs much faster

3064213
folder	directory
how do i get a directory listing for a folder on the web

3064216
lxml	elementtree
another option is lxml which provides useful extensions to the built in elementtree

3064229
accessor	ivar	accessor	properties
it s common for properties like this to do everything through self except in the accessor themselves or in dealloc and possibly in init opinions seem to differ on this where you would access the ivar directly

3064229
accessor	properties
also never call -- the properties accessor doesn t give its caller ownership

3064266
pypdf	reportlab
for pdf generation you could use the reportlab toolkit or pypdf

3064272
folder	directory
i also have a second question can i tell python to open a file in in a certain directory for example if the script is in a certain loaction home folder but i want the script to open a file at home some_directory some_directory can it be done

3064310
matplotlib	scipy
python with numpy scipy and matplotlib

3064328
cpu	processors
if the process is entirely cpu bound then you divide the processors speed by the number of cycles to get the throughput

3064365
user-controls	tabcontrol
how can i add tabs to a tabcontrol that exists in one user-controls from another user-controls that is contained within a tab itself

3064380
hide	show
if status is private i want to show the list if status is public i want to hide the list

3064426
prng	random
if randomicity is required ensure random numbers may be reproduced exactly at a later time look at seeding with pseudo random number generators prng or use canned random sets

3064427
user-controls	tabcontrol
the user-controls will need some means of finding the tabcontrol

3064427
user-controls	tabcontrol
this would potentially allow you to walk up and find the tabcontrol instance containing this user-controls

3064437
oncreate	findviewbyid
would it be there noticeable speed improvement if i would create local references to needed view elements edittext or button in my activity in oncreate and use them for accessing needed elements or it does not much matter if i always use findviewbyid when i need to access some particular element

3064443
silverstripe	modx
from what i ve been reading silverstripe or modx sound like good candidates

3064483
springsource	grails
there s a grails plugin available that turns a grails application into an osgi bundle that can be deployed on springsource s dm server

3064487
xstream	jibx
spring ws is nice and i believe you can pick from jibx jaxb or xstream

3064487
xstream	jibx
xstream should work fine in gae but i don t know about jibx as it uses bytecode manipulation

3064511
rss	feed
i ve spent ages on this all i m trying to do is extract the title contents from an rss feed everything else can be ignored

3064511
rss	feed
theres a whole bunch of unneeded tags thats coming in from the rss feed all i need is the title tag it looks like this title my title 3.0 title

3064532
oncreate	findviewbyid
it is a good practice to define private variables and to bind them to the references returned by findviewbyid once in oncreate then accessing them throughout your code

3064579
realloc	malloc
it does not use malloc realloc

3064579
subtraction	addition
this cheapens the cost of end which no longer needs an addition ever so slightly at the expense of a marginally more expensive size call which now needs a subtraction

3064597
vmware	virtualbox
virtualbox or vmware both work well

3064623
spaces	delimiter
remove the spaces in the delimiter

3064652
cassini	iis
i ve recently moved my silverlight solution off of cassini one for service one for sl app and over to iis to simulate production

3064652
cassini	iis
everything works fine in cassini with a clientaccesspolicy xml file but in iis something is replacing localhost 2002 with my machine name in the wsdl

3064724
ubuntu	linux
unless you have a very powerful machine the overhead of windows + ubuntu linux + rails server + database server + ide editor will be painful

3064845
vsto	add-in
i would like to know what are the possible ways to solve this problem and what is the best approach to implement this add in xla or vsto or com add-in

3064857
sorting	grouping
is there an algorithm to split a sequence of random numbers into two grouping based on a median value determined on the fly without sorting them

3064864
range	minimum
if i have a uidatepicker and i wish to set the minimum and maximum date range to be between thirty years ago and thirty years in the future how would i set that up

3064868
validationsummary	customvalidator
following an example which you can rewrite easily to validate a checkbox customvalidator in a gridview with a validationsummary control

3064894
realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
make sure you re consistently using malloc realloc free throughout your class

3064894
realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
this is actually pretty close to what vector does in my implementation gcc glib except it uses the c++ low-level routines operator new and operator delete to do the raw memory management instead of malloc and free rewrites the realloc routine using these primitives and delegates all of this behavior to an allocator object that can be replaced with a custom implementation

3065030
vsto	add-in
unlike add-in which extend the whole application and as such apply to any open document a vsto document project is a customization of a specific document to which extra code is attached

3065037
textview	imageview
if you just want the look and not the functionality though just adding a linearlayout with a gradientdrawable background containing an imageview a textview and a checkbox styled as a star to your activity s layout should get you there a lot more easily without requiring custom widgets

3065060
stdout	stderr
whenever i open a pipe using the python subprocess module i can only communicate with it once as the documentation specifies read data from stdout and stderr until end-of-file is reached

3065075
disk	ram
you can also use snmp to figure out responsiveness of the processor and ram and remaining size on hard disk among many other options

3065092
free	malloc
i realize that the answer for an arbitrary address is no you can t but i do think it is possible to override malloc free and keep track of allocated memory ranges

3065104
accessor	properties
fields shouldn t be public so to do this properly you would have a properties and you would therefore have to call the set accessor

3065105
bazaar	svn
since i won t have access to the svn repository for a while i wanted to use bazaar as a helper version control to keep the intermediate commit history before i commit everything back to the svn repository

3065169
gif	png
any binary info except jpg gif png filefield

3065215
post	get
with a dirty dirty hack i was delighted to be told just last week this can also work for multipart form-data get raw post data

3065263
colt	jama
jama colt and parallel colt are not fast

3065272
folder	directory
is there a way to direct .net to look for resources files in another folder for example one inside the user s home directory

3065339
cvs	svn
our developers would then clone from this and push back to it using more of a cvs svn development model - if joe is working on something in branch then leaves we d just like hank to take over by checking out the branch

3065339
pull	push
if i m correct i d add upstream as a remote to my personal checkout pull it then push it back to our shared repo

3065341
post	get
let me know if i should post more code to get help thanks

3065378
udp	tcp
the process has several tcp udp connection over each a data is received sent in a high load

3065420
cvs	svn
3 compare the current svn cvs git whatever version with an old version and report

3065425
google-chrome	safari
tosource is non standard and works in the gecko engine only so will not work in google-chrome safari or ie

3065429
int	chars
i use string for the const chars int for int and so on

3065448
width	height
first try to set the parent both width height with pixels not pct

3065456
int	double
update all the datatypes are int except a.size which is a double precision and p.foo which is varchar

3065490
postgresql	mysql
please also tell me where would be difference when i use different database like postgresql or mysql within steps

3065508
folder	directory
i have this code i have been using....but i need a conditional where it will read all the sub directory of bg to select an image as opposed to a specific folder if they were on a subpage

3065517
serializable	deserialization	ord	enumerate
besides ord some important type classes are eq equality comparisons but not less greater than enum types you can enumerate values of such as counting integer s and read show simple serializable deserialization with strings

3065528
post	get
my problem is that when i click on the link i am reaching the delete action via a get rather than a post and the confirm dialog is not taking place

3065531
public	protected
making the virtual functions private protected with a public method wrapper - allows you to enforce some other workflow of stuff to do before and after the virtual method

3065565
jsr311	jax-rs
if you really intend to do this with plain vanilla servlet api instead of a more suited rest api like jax-rs i.e jsr311 with jersey as reference implementation then i recommend to go for the front controller pattern as depicted in your first example

3065602
firefox	safari
i have some event handlers that work in firefox and not in safari

3065602
firefox	safari
any ideas on why it works in firefox and not in safari

3065602
firefox	safari
firefox breaks and safari remains broken

3065609
put	get
if you re allowed to get extra code locally eg your own personal modules you could take text csv_pp and put it somewhere locally then access it via the use lib workaround

3065612
mockito	easymock
i have used easymock earlier but now i m using mockito

3065612
mockito	easymock
i found mockito simpler as compared to easymock

3065612
mockito	easymock
for the detailed comparison of easymock and mockito you can refer here

3065626
children	parent
in the code example the author assumes that the reader knows that the sample is for an element class that has parent name attribute children and parser properties

3065643
int	double
runprediction int location double int location referenced from

3065643
int	chars
mainframe respondto chars int in mainframe.o

3065688
getter	setter
this will change if the getter or setter of a property performs some sort of work like possibly returning one of two or more values based on the state of some other field property whatever

3065708
int	chars
do we have a standard way of converting a chars to int or long in a strict way we should get proper result only if all chars are digits and can fit in an int or long -- some way by using strtol etc

3065714
nsoperation	nsnotification
-when the nsoperation is finished writing the file it fires a nsnotification defaultcenter which tells the cell s view to update the label and image and i set self setneedsdisplay

3065736
min	max
so i get the max and min prices for all items in that category and assign the sliderextension max min values appropriately

3065736
min	max
i change the item category and go get a new max min value for the slider control

3065736
min	max
i set the max min values then i set the target textbox values each to the corresponding max min values

3065736
min	max
like say for example my initial min max is 1 100

3065736
min	max
why do the slider handles only appear properly when i first set the min max values

3065778
getter	setter
well just use the getter and setter methods or configure it correctly in ib.

3065778
getter	setter
because you are confusing getter and setter

3065812
width	height
using a width or height of 0 and hiding overflow

3065857
pecl	pear
you may be able to run pear or pecl inside mamp to do the install easily

3065867
profiling	debugging
i agree with ideas about using a profiling - but you might also want to consider just using log4j or apache commons logging etc to get some cheap stats about program performance - in that the log entries in the resultant logfiles will get timestamped to the nearest millisecond since logging is generally a useful thing to do when debugging anyway it s probably worth doing this first

3065876
stdout	stderr
however you will run into problems with synchronyous reading if you try to read both stdout and stderr of the process there is no way of reading 2 streams synchronously and simultaneously - you will deadlock if you read stdout and process is writing to stderr and waits for you to consume its output or vice versa

3065900
toggleclass	slidetoggle
but in reality jquery can animate the toggleclass with slidetoggle

3065904
move	drag
the jquery code for drag drop and clone would not work when in the index.php page so i move it to the page that gets called to request the products as each product has drag drop code created for it

3065904
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
works fine in firefox even ie but not in safari or google-chrome

3065952
getter	setter
the above does not work because the moment the log property is touched by a setter invocation it causes the code path related to the getter to be executed...which means the internal logfactory instance data is always set to the baselogger setting the logobject is always too late

3065968
width	margin
right now in both ie and standards compliant browsers the total width is 120 pixels 100 pixels wide plus 10 pixels of margin on the left side

3065968
width	margin
from this point forward the total width of ie will be 120 pixes 100 pixels wide plus 10 pixels of margin on left and right

3065968
width	margin
however the width of the div in standards compliant browsers will be 122 pixels 100 pixels wide 20 pixels of margin and 2 pixels of border 1 pixel on the left side and one 1 pixel on the right side of the border. are you starting to see a problem develop

3065968
width	margin
again the total width in ie is 120 the 100 pixels of width plus 20 pixels of margin

3065968
width	margin
however in standards compliant browsers the total width of the box is now calculated to be 142 pixels 100 pixels of width 20 pixels of margin 2 pixels of border and 20 pixels of padding 10 pixels on the right side 10 pixels on the left side.

3065968
width	margin
standards compliant browsers calculate total width by adding the width margin border and padding of an element

3065972
int	chars
assuming you know what a union is if you were extracting something less repetitive from a binary value then you might want use it for clarity instead of making say two 24 bit int from 48 chars out of shifts and masks

3065998
innodb	myisam
as an exercise in futility your current solition would probably be faster and prefered if the table is myisam or you can live with the approximation of innodb

3066014
labwindows	cvi
labwindows cvi is ni s c ide with good integration with their instrument libraries and drivers

3066014
labwindows	cvi	labwindows	labview	cvi	labview
if you re willing to write c code maybe you could get by with the base version of labwindows cvi versus having to buy a higher-end labview version that has the functionality you need

3066014
labwindows	cvi	labwindows	labview	cvi	labview
labwindows cvi and labview are priced identically for the base versions so

3066033
folder	dir
if i were you assuming you installed rubygems into your home folder i would trash that installation dir not sure where it defaults to maybe rubygems

3066057
firefox	safari
i have tried it and it works like a charm in safari and firefox but causes ie08 to bypass the jqueryvalidator and go straight to the server side validator

3066058
vsto	add-in
we have word with vsto add-in which takes 20-30 seconds on first start and 6-7 seconds on second start

3066058
vsto	add-in
going from just word to word with just the vsto add-in or word with just the vba add-in to word with vba and vsto add-in together gave a non-linear increase in cold start time

3066058
vsto	add-in
using a com shim eliminates the vsto runtime but still allows you to safely use .net in the add-in

3066062
karatsuba	strassen
in practice the schã nhageâ strassen algorithm starts to outperform older methods such as karatsuba and toomâ cook multiplication for numbers beyond 2 2 15 to 2 2 17 10 000 to 40 000 decimal digits

3066109
many-to-many	one-to-many
the only way i can think of to truly represent a many-to-many relationship in an xml or any other hierarchical structure is to use many one-to-many relationships

3066129
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine on firefox and google-chrome

3066159
getter	setter
yes i ve set properties and getter and setter which seem to work but only in the initial view controller class

3066162
filtering	grouping
if you are worried about the capturing grouping that might be zero length you can pass the matches through to filtering them out

3066167
cells	tablecell
i initially tried replacing the current tablecell with a customcell in cellforrowatindex however the animation looks a bit choppy as you can see the cells being replaced and overall the effect doesnt work to well

3066186
libsvm	liblinear
if that s the case i believe neither libsvm nor liblinear do that

3066186
libsvm	liblinear
if you re interested in a normal quadratic-programming formulation of the svm with quadratic slack penalties libsvm and liblinear should work

3066220
post	get
before method declaration works fine with soap requests but i am looking for something that would work the same way with http post get requests as well right now i get return class name as element name

3066228
valgrind	memcheck
you can best catch those kinds of errors with valgrind memcheck tool

3066244
websphere	ibm
off the top of my head ibm websphere business monitor provides this capability

3066249
firefox	safari
i noticed that for internet explorer i could be uploading 10 or more files simultaneously but firefox and safari seems to cap the number of uploads to 2

3066262
websphere	ibm
i m in charge of maintaining a jsp based application running on ibm websphere 6.1 ibm j9 jvm

3066360
innodb	myisam
this is a very good thing considering how ludicrously foreign key constraints are implemented in mysql - myisam just ignores them and innodb creates a non-optional index on every single one regardless of whether it makes sense

3066375
ssl	https
https is not another protocol it is merely http over an ssl tls-

3066375
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
if you want to perform an ajax call to a https domain hosted somewhere else other than your domain it is somewhat possible to do so but only in firefox 3.5+ safari google-chrome and i think opera there is some interesting information about how to make cross-domain ajax requests possible here - this method is not supported in ie no surprise there

3066397
google-chrome	firefox
it works great in firefox and google-chrome but when i try and use it in ie 8 it gives me an the xml page cannot be displayed error instead of allowing jquery to load the json being written by the response

3066398
perforce	cvs
i ve used subversion cvs and perforce in the past

3066425
pop-up	dialog
comodo antivirus firewall blocks all applications from calling dll s you have to click allow on the dialog that normally pop-up

3066457
nsuserdefaults	cfpreferences
in nsuserdefaults cfpreferences or is there a way to retrieve it out of the keychain along with the password

3066461
hide	show
just use css to show hide the pages

3066462
post	get
in this way the var quiere get post

3066466
hide	show
you can do a whole bunch of stuff such as hide show rows columns we are talking about table manipulation here because you mentioned a table and even with these show hide actions add delete actions where when you click a delete row or button it deletes that row not only visually but in the database all done via ajax calls to server-side code

3066566
ubuntu	linux
i am attempting to open firefox using c++ on linux ubuntu

3066576
pull	push
once in a while he could git pull upstream_master checkout proprietary and then git merge upstream_master pray for no conflicts to incorporate the new upstream commits and then push to companygit

3066591
wordpress	joomla
i can t speak to the current relative merits of the different tools as it s been a couple of years since i did a comparative evaluation of drupal joomla wordpress and 40+ others

3066596
getter	setter
however for domain objects particularly if your objects do not constitute an anemic domain model where objects are just bags of getter and setter it can be useful to have objects that for example can persist themselves to a datastore etc

3066654
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
used it in touchesbegan touchesmoved

3066673
client-side	server-side
in nutshell what criteria would you use to determine if you are going to use client-side sorting paging as opposed to server-side paging

3066682
jar	war
my plan is to create a jar file of the scala compiled artifacts and add that into the lib folder for the war file

3066693
quicksort	median-of-medians
if our selection of a pivot guarantees geometric convergence of quicksort like median-of-medians does then our overall algorithm will be o n

3066696
g++	gcc
install gcc with g++ of course on it and use that g++ dedicated environment

3066697
getter	setter
i would get 1.0 down pat before looking at properties this way you ll understand what they do first they basically just automatically make getter and setter

3066714
int	chars
the other draw back is name requires 30 chars where id is int so .dat and .idx are larger

3066718
stdout	stderr
and if you need to get the stdout or stderr you d use proc.stdout or proc.stderr

3066751
width	height
actual width and height 0 in most

3066762
post	get
here s a contrived scenario that expands on previous answers if the form requires authentication to reach and is easier if the site doesn t care if forms are submitted via post or get

3066785
prepare	execute
the execute and prepare entrypoints could modify the given statement before passing it on to the driver dll

3066785
prepare	execute
an alternative method that might be easier than writing a shim dll would be to hook just the execute and prepare functions probably just sqlexecdirect and sqlprepare

3066806
waitpid	fork
gory details in perldoc -f fork waitpid wait kill and perlipc

3066822
pem	pkcs#12
i already have it in pkcs#12 jks and pem formats

3066842
google-chrome	firefox
that only a part of the code of course the think is firefox and google-chrome display the code above like this

3066906
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this works great in ie8 but it won t work in safari firefox or google-chrome

3066942
width	height
i ve got an image where i firstly set its inline style to control the width and height then use direct html attributes width height to try modifying that but failed.

3066942
client-side	server-side
frankly speaking i am puzzled myself as i can clearly see some other incorrect statements here and there amongst the slides such as javascript is on client-side how about server-side javascript

3066950
nexus	artifactory
both sonatype nexus and jfrog artifactory support artifact routing using wildcards or regexes

3066959
google-chrome	firefox
modern browsers firefox google-chrome etc. automatically detect these and apply the css rules onto them as error detection but internet explorer fails to apply css rules because theyre not html tags

3067011
versioning	upgrade
is there any use lib or other statement which i can use which is not so long and verbose and which does not include the actual versioning of perl in order that i don t have to go back and edit this out of the program if the versioning of perl is upgrade

3067041
range	max	range	min	min	max
do this by subtracting the center average of the min and max of the range

3067050
hash	md5
i was under the impression that most of the passwords are md5 hash before storing in the database and hence the service provider will not have any access to clear text passwords is this a security violation

3067056
opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari
many browser vendors each use different codecs safari ms use h.264 firefox opera use ogg theora

3067059
hash	salt
only a salt and hash version of passwords should be stored

3067067
google-chrome	firefox
should work on all major browsers or at least firefox and google-chrome

3067101
postgresql	mysql
you may want to try something like the following tested in mysql but i guess it should be easy to port to postgresql

3067175
rss	feed
i am writing an extension for safari5 and i am trying to intercept the fact that the user is clicking on an rss icon and loading a feed ..

3067205
put	get
i had been assigned to develop a system on where we would get a xml from multiple sources millions of xml and put them in some database like and judging from the xml i would receive there wont be any concrete structure even if they are from the same source

3067212
superclass	subclassing
quick answer you can t instantiate an nsmanagedobject subclassing without a context so using an nsmanagedobject as a superclass for something that s not gonna be saved since it s just viewed from the net is probably not a great idea

3067212
superclass	subclassing
therefore product superclass of favoriteproduct has to be a subclassing of nsmanagedobject context too

3067214
nsoperation	nsnotification
-when the nsoperation is finished writing the file it fires a nsnotification defaultcenter the responder should then performselectoronmainthread a method that does the actual updating of the view

put	get

3067522
src	attr
best guess use a little .filter with a regexp and then the .last element in the set grab its src using attr src

3067579
hide	show
i think that the easier way of doing this is to use the detailtextlabel to show the text and handle the show and hide of the text edit fields in the row selection code

3067588
hide	show
then you will show one and hide the other

3067588
hide	show
when the user executes some action which requires you to change the view then simply hide the displaying panel and unhide show the other one

3067588
hide	show
you can also dynamically load user controls into a panel much like an iframe but i find it easier to have the content in the form and hide show as needed

so we upgrade to a newer versioning of the nunit framework within the test project itself but then found that ncover 1.5.8.0 doesn t support this versioning of nunit

3068132
ncover	partcover
in terms of the coverage side of things for reporting into cruisecontrol.net we have found that partcover is a good candidate for substituting-out ncover as the newer version of ncover is quite dear and partcover is free but this is a few steps down the line yet as we can t get the test runners to work first

3069128
multiplying	addition	multiplying	add
in addition to the speed issue mentioned by mark byers i ve used unchecked when computing hash codes for objects - the typical method for creating a hash code from multiple items for example object members is to iteratively multiplying your working hash code by some factor then add the hash code for the new item and repeat

that byte could then be sent to the browser using a response.binarywrite and a content-type of image type - jpg png gif

3069812
int	chars
if your variable stores a constant value such as static final int num_gears 6 the convention changes slightly capitalizing every letter and separating subsequent words with the underscore chars

3069866
equals	compareto	sortedmap	sortedset
as far as i know things such as sortedmap or sortedset use compareto rather than equals on types for checking equality contains containskey

3069866
sortedmap	sortedset
is the approach of using sortedmap or sortedset on equatable but by concept not comparable types good anyway

3069866
equals	compareto
can t i just make compareto return 0 for equals and 1 for non-equal instances

3069866
sortedmap	sortedset
i ve dome some tests it seems that sortedmap sortedset call compareto on a pair of instances once

3069873
children	parent
i believe this is because my data has children with multiple parent nodes

3069886
sortedmap	sortedset
so there is no way to put objects that are not comparable in a sortedmap or sortedset

3069901
public	protected
i thought i understood that to be because of the ability of the use of the modifiers private public internal protected

3069904
sortedmap	sortedset
no using sortedmap or sortedset on equatable but not comparable types is a horrible idea

3069904
comparator	comparable
if they re not comparable intrisically or through a comparator they should not be used in a sortedset

3069905
sortedmap	sortedset
there is no point of using sortedmap and sortedset if you don t need it to be sorted

3069917
ddms	adb
ddms uses adbd to request the information so root is not required as adb has the permissions needed to request the data from dev graphics fb0

your code indicates a lack of understanding of the min max and constrain functions

3069984
public	protected
fields can either be public or private or protected in case of props you can make them read-only publicly but writable privately

3069987
getter	setter
although it s accepted practice to not put large amounts of code in getter and setter you can t just assume that since it s a property it will behave quickly

3070016
put	get
put image into something like paint and get it s coordinates not the coordinates on the web page obviosuly so it will still work anywhere on the page

3070027
getter	setter
one of the nice things about properties is that the getter and the setter can have different levels of access

3070059
serializable	deserialization
the documentation for the storable class which is used by apache session file uses storable deparse and storable eval but also goes on to suggest a method for serializable of code references and deserialization in a safe compartment

3070072
comparator	comparable
the javadocs would tend to suggest this all keys inserted into a sorted map must implement the comparable interface or be accepted by the specified comparator

3070080
treemap	treeset
then use a treeset or treemap which you construct with a custom comparator

3070087
post	get
can anyone think of any reason why get would work when post isn t

3070103
post	get
a header redirect would pass along get variables if using but lose post ones

3070117
accessor	properties
there are other ways to achieve this goal but using properties and varying accessor visibility is a good one to consider if you re doing interface-based development or if you expose libraries to others etc

3070147
sortedmap	sortedset
if you must use sortedset sortedmap then provide a comparator like ptomli mentions in his answer

3070182
min	max
if your table is simply too large for your column row data perhaps performing whatever meaningful operation aggregation you re after avg sum min max etc would be better than simply saving off the counts individually

3070186
put	get
you just put it in your url add it to your routes before the controller and then you get it passed to your methods just like any other paramter

3070187

try exporting the rtp file stream into a dump file in wireshark right-click an rtp packet â follow udp stream â save as and then send the file via gst-launch to be demuxed

3070384
serializable	deserialization
but this also seems inconvenient because it means that i have to worry about serializable and deserialization

3070433
client-side	server-side
i am implementing jquery client-side validation and would like to pull in my error messages from the server both to support internationalisation and to make sure that validation gracefully degrades if javascript is not available in that the error messages pushed back into the view from the server-side validation are identical to those displayed dynamically by the jquery validation

3070436
inherited	subclassing
a random note if you are using single table inherited sti and forget to remove the initialize method from your subclassing definitions you will get a similar nil object when you didn t expect it exception

3070482
dlsym	dlopen
i think it can be achieved using dlopen and dlsym but i am not sure about it.please correct me if i am wrong

3070596
folder	directory
additionally since there is no default.aspx or similar default document in the folder you re accessing iis defaults to attempting to list the directory s contents

3070604
jlist	jlabel
in your case the jlist is actually using a jlabel to display each item so you just need the list model to return the string values in the list as html and it should all work

3070607
rss	feed
i can imagine these sites publish a lot of their content also in rss feed which you can use to keep your indexes up to date faster than you would by continuously crawling them

frerich raabe the basic late binding mechanism can be implemented as your said but you can use a combination of dlopen dlclose dlsym and pointers to function to get something like

jquery	scriptaculous
unfortunately the project is heavily tied to the prototype api and scriptaculous so the option of using jquery or any other framework is unavailable

3071354
post	get
to get an application token look at the excellent description from the post from dynamoman on may 7 2010 about the fourth post down

3071416
pull	push
now you can push to this and pull from it but can t work directly over there

3071419
maven	pom.xml
there has been some issues with ordering of execution mng-3719 mng-2258 but it should be fine with maven 2.2.1 and plugins should be executed in the same order as they are listed in the pom.xml when bound to the same phase

3071429
freebsd	linux
basically non-blocking event loop utilizes device that allows for waiting for multiple events simultaneously select poll on unix waitformultipleevents on windows epoll on linux kqueue on freebsd etc

google-chrome	firefox
when i have 5 ide s open sql server 2008 notepad++ oxygenxml editor and google-chrome ie firefox all open in my vm then my main machine has outlook onenote and a few other programs running it turns to crap

3071449
post	get
when i post the form i see that all of the selected values get posted but all are bound to the same name foo

3071449
post	get
so i seemingly cannot get each of the posted values i am using django python server-side to handle the post

3071455
getter	setter
the advantage being that you could control the scope of the field to only be accesible in the property code so you don t have to worry about anything else in your class playing with the state without using the getter setter

3071462
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it works on google-chrome and firefox but in safari and ie it only works if i set the cookie permissions in the browser to the lowest possible which is impractical for average users

3071470
width	height
to work around this problem before setting windowstate to maximized set width and height to zeros first

3071526
post	put	post	get	put	get
the reason that rest seems to work well is that it is a natural fit for the client-server nature of the web with its separation of safe and idempotent get requests idempotent put requests and post for requests that are neither safe nor idempotent

3071526
post	put	post	get	put	get
an example of this is that a web crawler will know only to request resources using get because it is guaranteed not to affect the resource whereas put and post requests have different rules

3071538
free	malloc
when i replace new delete with malloc free there is no crash

3071544

beside making final and the author suggested way is there more ways to prevent the above problem donâ t call subclassing methods from a superclass constructor from happen

3071582
installation	upgrade
i just upgrade one of my many blogs to wordpress 3.0 and i was glad to see that i now should be able to run all my blogs from a central installation

3071584
free	malloc
reasoning if you were able to trivially replace new with malloc you re probably allocating an array of primitive types rather than an object and naively using delete in place of free on the assumption that object allocation and array allocation are the same in c++

3071595
min	max
you can set the form s max min size properties so the full usercontrol row always shows have to do to prevent horiz

3071617
post	put
post scriptum perhaps you might wonder--now that we re thinking about functions taking type parameters why can t we do something more interesting with those parameters than put them into a type signature

3071648
pascal	delphi
have a look to delphi pascal object and some exemples

3071667
pull	push
i am able to clone and pull updates but when i try to push i get

actionscript	mxml
i have the project complete in mxml with actionscript but due to the fact that flex is limited in its visual animations no timeline

3071720

3071908
google-chrome	firefox
it seems like in ie a mousemove event is always fired right at the beginning in firefox never and in google-chrome strange enough if the script is loaded from an online location but not if it s loaded from my local disk

3072030
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
that works in firefox google-chrome safari and obviously not in ie7

3072030
post	get
do you know how could i get into a psw protected directory creating maybe a login form and using get post to get in

found the answer the loaded ajax page had tags wrapping the script tag removed the tags presto works in ie firefox safari google-chrome and opera

3072123
inherited	properties
rather than suffer a headache over it i d probably be inclined to just have icartitem offer its own sku properties and not inherited from iskuitem at all

3072137
getter	setter
if you use synthesize in your implementation then what you re implementing there are public sets of getter and setter

3072153
slug	permalinks
it gives you the flexibility to use persited permalinks slug also strip diacritics convert to full ascii etc

3072201
melt	reshape
use melt from the reshape package to get from this format to the one laid out above

3072205
ant	maven
but why do we need an advanced ant in form of maven

3072211
swt	swing
but in practice it all depends on swt and swing implementations on each platform

3072226
cvs	svn
for that you should use a vcs git svn or cvs as stated on other answers

3072246
maven	pom.xml
it is also a dependency manager which means when you realize the server piece of your project needs apache commons-logging 1.0.4 but the client conflicts with anything past 0.7.9 you can just add a couple lines to the respective pom.xml files and maven handles all of that downloading installing and keeping track of the different versions of those dependencies

3072260
scheme	racket
racket formerly plt scheme has a statically typed dialect which is designed to work nicely with scheme idioms -- including macros

3072283
initializer	class-method
for regular methods you can of course call base class-method with base.somemethod ... but there s no initializer style available

3072310
post	put
when you post a form the values that are posted are put into modelstate

3072310
post	get
i would personally look into that and maybe implement the prg post redirect get pattern

3072341
google-chrome	safari
however my script works fine using safari and google-chrome and plays the tracks in sequence

3072342
wxpython	pyqt
personally i would just write a python script with pyserial and something like pyqt or wxpython gui libraries to filter the data to different windows

3072350
children	parent
i want to extract the parent children as well as page name

3072350
children	parent
all said i need an efficient way to parse out the parent children as well as page name from a string

3072362
ant	maven
advanced ant in form of maven

3072362
ant	maven
maven introduced convention over configuration this helps if some colleagues write bigger ant scipts than code

3072363
put	get
grab the contactid that was returned and put it into get textbox and click submit

3072368
sudo	passwd
so i run it again with sudo it asks me for my passwd i type it in hit return

ssl	https
i m accustomed to nix servers and if we wanted a completely secure sign in screen we as far as i am aware are to use ssl via https

pop-up	dialog
this page is using http and what appears to be basic auth a pop-up dialog for an sql server report manager

3072508
filesystems	ntfs
this is a feature of the ntfs filesystems one that s unfortunately well hidden because explorer has no support for showing their content

3072518
inherited	properties
i don t want to manually set all those values especially if my inherited class only has a couple of extra properties

3072522
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
of course it works fine in firefox google-chrome and safari

3072548
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
firebug extension for firefox yes it also supports breakpoints or the webkit inspector that s built into safari and google-chrome by default

3072548
profiling	debugging
both offer javascript debugging profiling and a lot of other useful features

3072578
.htaccess	httpd.conf
if i have the httpd.conf virtualhost section and the web site s root .htaccess configured one way apache does not read the index.php file www dot mywebsite dot com fails writes nothing to the rewrite log and places this error in the general error log file

3072578
.htaccess	httpd.conf
yet again with the same httpd.conf and .htaccess settings i can get to my login screen www dot mywebsite dot com account login succeeds and there is plenty of information in the rewrite log

3072617
keydown	keyup
you could take a look at the keydown keyup or keypress events depending on your use case and then check what character was last typed in the textarea in the handler

3072623
uilabel	uitextview
the contents in the p element the block tags are missing in your example can be passed to a uilabel or uitextview whichever is appropriate

3072645
arp	mtu
the ip arp protocols come into play when your packet is larger than the path mtu

3072672
bitwise-and	modulo
because no other class of numbers shares this property you can t create bitwise-and expressions for most modulo expressions

3072680
x86	64bit
e.g the x86 architecture has 32 bit pointers most arithmetic is performed in 32 bit registers but it also has native support for some basic 64bit operations

3072681
width	height
the issues with tables come into play when you have td s that do not have height width specified whether they contain data or not

3072703
mouse	keyboard
even demonstrating simple keyboard and mouse control and screen feedback would be enough in my opinion and that s well within reach

3072703
mouse	keyboard
apart from capturing the screen data remotely and showing it in the local window you ll need to listen for local window messages for mouse and keyboard events send them to the remote host and then play them back

3072734
translation	localization
it also leads to localization issues if it ever goes off to translation

3072761
extjs	ext.net
you should also look into ext.net if you haven t already -- they are the official sencha .net partner and offer the same dual licensing model as extjs

trie	tree
sorting requires traversing all the trienodes of the trie tree using dfs depth first search - o |v| + |e| time

3073006
width	height
you use the code from the linked example but you explicitly do a function call to get the height and width

3073040
pop-up	dialog
there is a way for unprivileged web page javascript to request more privileges and if the user grants it there will be a pop-up dialog asking for permission the web page code would be able to write to a file

postgresql	mysql
or you could just use a real db server like mysql postgresql or something and save yourself the headache

3073474
getter	setter
lots of code in getter setter in several properties of entity classes core business validations business data refresh etc.

3073474
getter	setter
logic behind getter setter would also access database

3073474
getter	setter
validations are handled as collection from the same class and would automatically refresh based on getter setter

3073474
getter	setter
the problem is with the logic behind getter setter

3073476
put	get
if you have multiple input sources keyboard network etc. they all get put there in the loop checking one after another

3073486
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
because i am building this 3 dimensional arrays inside 3 nested for loops i cannot use a for-loop to access the 5 x 5 part of loops

packets	multicast
in general this is not possible since multicast packets aren t routed

3073534
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the backbutton it something entirely diffent from a new request up to the user-agent in most contexts a browser like msie firefox google-chrome safari opera and the like and most likely they all have their own interpretation about what the end user wants when pressing the back button

3073540
textarea	pre
because haml automatically indents the html source code the contents of whitespace-sensitive tags like pre and textarea can get screwed up

3073579
post	get
those attributes are used for prg post redirect get pattern

3073587
gif	png
i m not sure i understand the question completely but if you want the background image to show through parts of the content images you will need to use png s or gif s as they permit parts of the image to be transparent and jpg s donâ t

3073649
width	height
as other people have mentioned the best you can do at this point is pass the height width information back to the server to be used later or make an ajax call to update the page dynamically given the size information

3073665
post	get
do you actually want to get or post

3073666
ienumerable	icollection
they both implement ienumerable and icollection

3073666
ienumerable	icollection
the question is with that information in tow do you want to create extension methods that extend ienumerable or icollection that are really only meant for session

3073698
jobs	cron
i have a rails app with the whenever gem installed to setup cron jobs which invoke various rake tasks

3073698
jobs	cron
inspecting crontab reveals correct syntax for all of the cron jobs so i don t think this is an issue with the whenever gem not correctly configuring the cron jobs

3073732
superclass	subclassing
there s no way the superclass can know anything about the subclassing

3073732
inherited	subclassing
what it means is if you instantiate the subclassing b and it inherited a method foo and overrides a method bar then when you call foo that will call the bar definition in b not the bar definition in a

3073756
integer	radix
one might be to put your structs in one big array radix sort by the integer key cull on it then re-sort per pass

3073830
accessor	properties
it was also important to place appropriate contractual obligations in the properties accessor

3073844

what i d prefer to to is use a listview or a gridview and an adapter

3073991
width	height
goal is to create a overflowing scrollable div that stretches the entire width and height of the body

3073991
margin	height
the div seems to ignore that the body margin is not part of the height so the div s 100 height turns out to be the body height + the top body margin

3074013
implements	extends
so you should extends baseadapter and implements spinneradapter

3074015
fadein	fadeout
because i need to fadein another element of the same size back in is there a way to fadeout the element so that the space is kept so that the other elements are not re-flowed for a split second and then the fadein will bring back another element with the same size

3074092
getter	setter
in your webserver class you can make a property a getter setter of type logger so that webserver knows about the logger you want to use

3074152
flexunit	jsunit
you can use jsunit for extjs and flexunit for actionscript

3074176
accessor	shadowing	accessor	properties
i mean you declare a properties which you then don t use and it s not clear whether you are defining your accessor properly or if array is also a local which is shadowing your properties or what

3074286
aggregate-functions	sum
column1 instead of sum column1 but that doesn t seem to me to be the answer - the query doesn t have any aggregate-functions in it so mysql won t know what to do with it

3074324
comparator	comparable
here s a comparator that sorts map.entry objects with comparable keys and values

3074326

3074397
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
with all browser compatibility ie 8 7 6 firefox google-chrome safari iphone

3074403
children	parent
i bet you need to set the order property of the datamemberattribute to match actual position of is-enabled amongst the other children of its parent element

3074408
nginx	lighttpd
the alternative might really leave you stuck in a box of the lighttpd way or the nginx way etc

3074787
rss	feed
what is the very very simplest method of getting the rss or jsonp feed of a twitter account s list or friends timeline

3074787
rss	feed
the script fetches the friends_timeline of a dummy account whose sole purpose is to combine the friends tweets into a single rss feed rather than making one request for every friend

3074787
rss	feed
well friends_timeline requires authentication and right now the server uses networkcredential to pull down these rss feed

3074831
hide	show
is there a way of quickly show hide of google maps markers

3074831
mouseover	mouseout
i don t want to remove re-add every time because i basically need to display them only on mouseover and hide on mouseout

3074837
hash	md5
md5 hash use mixed characters so i would rather go with varchar 32

3074846
versioning	upgrade
probably an optimizer may not implement optimized in evaluation process but this doesn t exclude that one time it could happen with a database versioning upgrade

3074849
width	height
instead of using a background to display the png blend we can use an img element and set the width and the height to 100

3074874
inherited	subclassing
if you want to use -initwithnibname bundle the cleanest way imo would be to have all view controller inherited from a common subclassing where you define the outlets they have in common

3074928
firefox	safari
all works fine on safari firefox but not the dreaded ie which shows a white background behind the text

3074928
background-color	transparency
i also tried background-color transparency all to no avail

3074936

daemons	launchd
you may well need to deal with problems such as preventing two instances being launchd unexpected termination of the daemons taking daemons down when maintenance is needed

3075009
hide	show
in onpreexecute i show a loading dialog which i then hide again in onpostexecute

3075093
implements	extends
instead that just implements spinneradapter in my adapter i extends baseadapter and implements spinneradapter

3075093
implements	extends
additionally using this solution one can call adapter.notifydatasetchanged which isn t as easy if the adapter just implements spinneradapter and doesn t extends baseadapter

3075098
post	get
background is that i configured the notifier to report method not allowed exception eg this is raised when an action is accessed with get instead of post

3075098
post	get
but i have an autocomplete controller which is scanned by bots probably to find exploits by sending get requests to my controller instead of post with all sorts of strange parameters

3075315
onclick	onchange	onclick	onkeyup	onchange	onkeyup
if there are no number based effects you can bind the event to onchange onclick and onkeyup to handle all cases it ll run a bit extra but if it s a lightweight operation no multi-run side-effects and you want to cover your bases it s a viable option

opengl is better for playing around and experimenting because you can easily draw triangle without messing with hardware buffers available on larger selection of platforms plus glsl is better than hlsl because it doesn t compile into assembly

3075639

the problem with this approach is that es5 object.create has a signature of 2 arguments first â an object to inherited from and second optional â an object representing properties or rather descriptors to add to newly created object

3075832
nsinteger	double
you might for instance be making assumptions about the size of some object that is not true for instance using a double instead of a cgfloat or a int64_t instead of an nsinteger

3075929

a function to add or subtract business days from a given date this doesn t account for holidays

3076262
apache	nginx	apache	lighttpd	nginx	lighttpd
both nginx and lighttpd just like apache are production quality software meaning very steep learning curve

3076277
free	malloc
it seems to me it should have increased each time a malloc is called and no free

3076301
calloc	malloc
however if you change that address each time the function is entered via malloc or calloc you ve lost the reference to the blocks from the previous allocation

3076301
free	malloc
yes 6144 bytes were actually allocated according to what malloc returned while the program ran but that just means the static pointer was free then reallocated according to the number of times memeat was entered

3076487
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	calloc	free	malloc	calloc	malloc

getter	setter
add a few eval calls and some logic and you can make this function build you new getter setter function references

3076754

3076881
qscrollarea	qtextedit
so the moral of the story is that the qtextedit code was correct in overriding sizehint but the qscrollarea was ignoring the value returned from the main frame s sizehint

3076888
coalesce	isnull	coalesce	nullif	isnull	nullif

getter	setter
since you re evidently not concerned about attaching specific business logic to the getter or setter for this indexed property like you could do with the default indexer in c# or any property in vb.net you need an internal storage mechanism in order to accomplish this

if your method to handle the get requests takes id if your post method also takes id and you are using the beginform helper method with none of the parameters overloaded the form method will take the id as a parameter and you won t need to worry about including hidden fields for the id itself

3079839
children	parent
should children and parent be properties in the header file

3079849
disk	ram
on the os front for example windows vista 7 will use any spare ram for disk caching and this works very effectively which means you will see little or no performance gain using a ramdisk

3079849
disk	ram
a ram disk or cache also only works if you have enough ram

int like the 5 you are trying to pass as well as nstimeinterval actually just a typedef for double are fundamental types not class-types

3079918
getter	setter
edit if using the solution provided by mike b and you have a setter getter for the object you re mocking that does type checking to ensure the correct object was passed into the setter you ll need to mock the getter on the class you re testing and have it return the other mock

post	get
i had another issue with this code answered in another post but currently i m wrestling with the fact that if i try to run this i get

3080273
width	height
when it s empty the width and height of the custom panel i ve defined is 15 x 15

3080326
sorting	grouping
i figure the best way to do this would be grabbing the latest comments and then sorting or grouping them by content type and object_pk so that only one comment the latest is returned per related content object

disk	ram
when a ram cache miss happens we would then fall back to checking the disk cache

3080741
disk	ram
whenever we retrieve new web service results we would then update both the ram cache and the disk cache

3080741
disk	ram
2 a single system that would replace memcached and provide both the ram cache and the disk cache

3080741
disk	ram
1 i believe redis doesn t fit the bill here since its disk cache is just a mirror of what s in ram

3080741
disk	ram
i want the ram cache to be a small subset of the disk cache

3080813
int	boolean
oracle uses a single data type number for long int short boolean float and decimal

gridview	sqldatasource
consider a web page having gridview connected to sqldatasource having all permission to insert update and delete

for the actual submission i would set ajaxsubmit to false and submit the form after the user has verified they are happy with what they entered and clicked the button link

3080886
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
you could subclass uinavigationbar but then the only way to get that subclass to be used in a uinavigationcontroller is via ib or do some rather interesting mucking about to do it programmatically

post	get
in chrome resources view you can see the post and that the response is a 302 redirect and then the subsequent get request - the header of which looks fine -

3080922
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome resources view won t show me the content of that document just blank but firefox does and the xml document looks fine

3080933
put	get
in particular the ordering you get out of them will depend on the objects you put in rather than the order you add them

3080935
persistent	transient
also note that static and final entity fields are always considered to be transient can t be persistent

3081008
google-chrome	safari
in fact window.event exists in safari and google-chrome but not i think attachevent so that dodgy inference is preventing your code from working

3081014
rsa	dsa
this can be achieved by used a digital signature rsa dsa or a mac message authentication code

3081041

3081109
jruby	rubinius	ironruby	rubinius
also most ruby implementations do not implement 1.9.1 ironruby will go straight from 1.8.6 to 1.9.2 jruby will implement both 1.8.7 and 1.9.2 and rubinius will also go to 1.9.2

feed formats are mostly standardized rss or atom and have clearly identifiable properties such as title thumbnail description etc

3081183
gif	bmp	tiff	bmp
if the image blob is in one of several standard formats bmp jpeg gif tiff file format you can use wia 2.0 for this

3081216
hash	md5
start with a system hash say grab the macs on any nics sorted and the cpu-id info plus some other stuff concatenate it all together and take an md5 of the result you really don t want to be handling personally identifiable information if you don t have to append the cd s serial number and refuse to boot unless some registry key or some datafile has a valid signature for the blob

3081260
onresume	onpause
i think what you should probably do is have your activity listen for the device orientation and use onpause onresume to handle the registering for orientation changes

3081282
public	protected
this all said a destructor should usually be public and virtual or protected unless a class is not meant to be a base class

3081340
qtableview	qstandarditemmodel
what should i do if i want to do something else while sorting the qtableview + qstandarditemmodel

3081383
public	protected
there are different issues with what you propose the first of which is already dealt in other answers you only need virtual destructors if you intend to delete through a pointer to a base a general recommendation is to provide either a public virtual destructor or a protected non-virtual destructor as that would inhibit deletion through the base class

3081393
put	get
my usual method of code reading stepping through it with the debugger didn t work because this is a gui program and as soon as you get to the main loop it doesn t stop until there s a breakpoint and where to put the breakpoints is basically what i m trying to find out

3081405
realloc	malloc
if there s a chance you may have really really long lines and you have to process line by line you could malloc a resonable buffer and use realloc to double it s size each time you get close to filling it

3081411
struts	wicket
the main thing that drives my choice between wicket and some other framework struts 2 tends to be the other one is the statefullness of the web app

3081418
children	parent
2 when parent is back from client save it and all its children in the db in a new session

3081462
filesystems	ntfs
some filesystems offer their own metadata as ntfs and later do but this particular metadata is coming from the file itself and not from the filesystems

3081462
mp3	flac
to modify the metadata in the files in question you probably can use the mutagen library assuming these are mp3 aac flac vorbis etc

3081478
fink	macports
my experience in supporting users of mod_wsgi is however that macports and fink are an absolute pita

3081479

3081569
folder	directory
you can record to either the docs folder for your app or the tmp directory

3081571
accessor	properties
you need to set start date using self.startdate in viewdidload - in this way you will call the accessor and use the retain in your properties statement

3081597
opera	firefox
this answer is a bit out there - for it to be valid html you d have to define your own dtd and in any case it doesn t work in ie or opera works in firefox

3081616
accessor	properties
the bracket notation properties accessor implicitly converts the expression between brackets into a string so

3081616
accessor	properties
the expression implicitly converts the 1 number primitive to an object this is made by the properties accessor and it lookups a properties named the properties lookup is made on the number.prototype and the object.prototype objects for example

3081625
cassini	iis
i am trying to host a wcf service using iis works fine in cassini

3081636
google-chrome	firefox
you can view it live on cssdesk this method works in a lot more than google-chrome but breaks in firefox 3.0 and just doesn t work in a number of ie versions

3081714
ostream	istream
if you have an istream overload for a type that reads data in a particular format then if you implement an ostream overload for the same type it should output in the same format otherwise it could get quite confusing

3081731
pop-up	dialog
the dialog that pop-up should allow you to configure the type of behavior you re looking for

3081770
cvs	svn
git will be no less appropriate for a corporate environment than something like cvs or svn

3081771
ant	maven
if it s maven based simply use the ant task to copy the class to your target classes in the appropriate phase i guess compile-sources or such - something before test

3081855
folder	directory
this will return an array of all the paths to the sub directory of the music folder

3081872
hash	md5
but there s that issuse of collisions and i think salting the md5 hash maybe with the name of the table should make it more robust

3081883
g++	gcc
i believe you re trying to compile main.cpp with gcc instead of g++

3081900
width	height
you want to make sure your flash swf is set to use 100 100 and then when you want to trigger full screen mode change the html container to be placed in the top-left-most corner and have a width height of 100 of screen

3081900
toolbar	tabs
you ll still have the browser s toolbar and tabs and address bar but if you want keyboard input there aren t many options

3081902
folder	directory
if the problem isnt relating to your path i suppose it is delete your lib and scripts folder in your project directory to clear out the virtualenv settings

3081902
virtualenv	yolk
activate the virtualenv and then install yolk

3081943
inherited	properties
for instance i found myself on a project where i had to analyze a site that used oop with deep inherited 2 and one of the important base classes had a public properties called name

3081943
getter	setter
however it also had getter and setter getname setname that accessed that property for the mere purpose of getting and setting it

3081943
getter	setter
the magic methods allowed me to solve the problem by renaming the property to _name and making it private forcing all requests to the property through the getter and setter

3081943
getter	setter
this being said there s no need for getter and setter if you re just treating a property like a variable

3081943
getter	setter
in your case since there is validating sanitizing going on you should employ getter and setter and code them directly as methods rather than unnecessarily incurring the overhead from the magic methods

3081949
int	boolean
i d use id int and backupenabled boolean and use a cron script or quartz to enable disable backups

it makes less sense to fragment tcp than it does to fragment udp

3082171
udp	mtu
you can send a single udp segment greater in length than the mtu

3082180
put	get
i had to put the initial in there otherwise you get use of unassigned local variable compilation errors but i think it s actually benign

3082225
udp	tcp
ie tcp s 3 way handshake im here i see you lets pass traffic just a simple connection is a little vague but i guess you can say it would encompass all kinds of connections both established connections and connectionless with protocols like udp a one way dont care if you get the data connection

3082239
portrait	landscape
see android - switching between landscape and portrait mode makes intent lose values

3082262

this allows you to have methods that only your superclass knows about and methods that subclassing can know about

3082345
moq	moles
i actually use moq and moles in the same test project

3082419
inherited	properties
i next then thought that i should have a properties in the enrolmentapplication class that has get set properties to serialise deserialise the xml properties for me however i would either have to move the applicationform class into the data project or create another class that inherited from enrolmentapplication

3082428
for-loop	loops
i reformatted the code changed some variable names and changed the while loops to a for-loop

3082438
public	protected
because c# does not have any mechanism for providing public private protected inheritance which is what you are actually after

3082438
inherited	subclassing
imho c# enforces stronger is-a relationship via single base class inherited so it makes sense that if a car has an engine a bmw subclassing shouldn t be able to hide it

3082556
xsl-fo	xslt
for filling in the blanks kind of documents a regular reporting engine may be a better fit or some straighforward xslt stylesheets spitting out the xsl-fo directly

i am able successfully retrieve nsmanagedobject s using an nspredicate query like this

3082579

uiview	subviews	uiview	uiwindow
is there a way to create an intermediate uiwindow but not visible in the current screen so you can play the video there and probably add subviews and return everything as a uiview where i can place it anywhere

3082743
portrait	landscape
this would also prevent the current screen from rotating from portrait to landscape

3082743
uiview	subviews	uiview	uiwindow
now my question is now that its part of uiwindow and since uiwindow is a uiview subclass is it possible to subviews this uiview

3082772
free	malloc
others i ve developed had different pools for 16-byte chunks 64-bytes chunks 256-byte chunks and 1k chunks again using a bitmask to reduce the overhead of the accounting information and to increase the speed of malloc and free no need to coalesce adjacent free blocks particularly important in the environment we were working in

3082776
free	malloc
when malloc allocates the memory from the free list it will allocate size + sizeof struct mallocheader and return the address of data

3082819
post	get
i would add that you should prefer to send your url parameters via post instead of get otherwise you may be leaving private data all over the place in logfiles browser windows etc

3082852

the function strcpy is considered unsafe but your memcpy .. src strlen src is quite unsafe too

3083034
portrait	landscape
as you ve noticed that things workfine when webview is initialized in portrait and then you turn it to landscape

3083034
portrait	landscape
now as the contents started loading when the frame size of your webview were according to portrait say 320 460 so converting your webview to landscape will automatically adjust your web view if you have this line in your code

then i go iis version 7.5 create a virtual directory to my published folder then convert it to web application

3083054
uiview	subviews
i have a lot of uiview added as a subviews to this scrollview

3083094
width	height
if you have your stage resize mode to noscale then you expand your flash area just by placing something off of screen though obviously it wont be displayed this can then be calculated by using the height and width properties of the main instance and then passing it to a javascript command via externalinterface which can then update the size of your flash in the html view

3083136

i indeed build against the level 8 targetsdkversion with level 3 minsdkversion and try to use a wrapper class with reflection to overcome the problem that the application will not run if you implements a class that extends an nonexisting class

3083222
opera	firefox
while some browsers intentionally keep the page state even when you navigate away from it notably opera and firefox a memory leak means memory that the program doesn t use anymore but forgot to release

3083241
pop-up	dialog
maybe you could have a form saying something like waiting for x or something like that that has no close buttons etc and that you pop-up when needed as a application modal dialog that way you avoid the issue with all windows of the app being disabled while at the same time giving feedback to the user of why he can t do anything

3083289
mef	prism
for the client side silverlight i can use mef prism but i m not sure what would be a good approach to tackle this problem on the server

how to get set the request query string in post method

3083382
nvda	voiceover
examples of screen readers are nvda www.nvda-project.org for windows orca for the gnome desktop on unix platforms and voiceover included by default in macosx

3083382
nvda	voiceover
now if you wish to see how this works nvda and orca are opensource projects and voiceover is included in macosx 10.4 i think and higher so you can try one of these at no cost unlike some of the commercial offerings which can be very expensive

3083405

3083774
implements	extends
so you can provide some implementation while you leave the choice whether extends your abstract class or implements the interface

3083774
implements	extends
since you should prefer composition over inheritance its easier to make your own class with a private instance of your class x which implements interface y and implements y with your wrapper too than extends a abstract class

3084094
hide	show
on the other hand say you have some content that you wish to index but for one reason or another you do not wish to show it i know this is not recommended and is not very nice to the end user anyway but there are valid use cases you can load this content normally and then hide or even replace it using javascript

swing and swt are the two you might think about

3087164
swt	swing
i worked with swing and prefer it over swt as it has a purer component model with swt you have to worry about freeing resources as you re using native widgets is truly multi-platform swt works on windows macos and linux and is not even very well optimized for all three and it s more customizable

3087180
portrait	landscape
under normal circumstances when displaying a new uiviewcontroller it should automatically rotate to portrait if it only supports portrait and the app is currently in landscape

3088183
post	get
if you need to actually redirect the user to your classic asp page with the values posted you might have more difficulty all of the standard methods of redirecting via asp.net only do get requests but my understanding is that you will need a post request for the values to go into the request.form collection on the classic asp page

3088200
onfocus	onblur
two things the events should be all lower case onfocus onblur and this doesn t point to the object that triggered the event in ie

maven	m2e
what m2e does for you is to exactly map the maven configuration to an eclipse projects with the necessary facets set

3088247
maven	m2e	maven	cargo

this is because there is no element.properties.html setter and getter in mootools 1.1.2

3088676
getter	setter
otherwise create your own setter and getter or update to a newer version of mootools

3088701
datamapper	activerecord
i then did a little more digging and re-proposed ruby using the jruby interpreter using either activerecord or datamapper for orm which was much better received as rails seems to fit in well with the re-shifting of our development to web-based front-ends that we are attempting to move to with our old cludgy code and of course because the ability to interact with java if the need arises is a great capability

3088731
yacc	bison
that starts with lex and yacc flex and bison next etcetera

3088735
filtering	grouping
a select on that result filtering to only those having a row number of 1 the first record found for that value of a returns a solid record for each a grouping -- in my example above you d be certain to get either the work or home address but not elements of both mixed together

while all examples seem logical getter and setter delegation etc. i m not sure i am able to grasp the can t break on its own concept in full

3089722
post	get
i m not sure this is possible without a bit of programming creating html forms to post i wouldn t normally recommend it but if you are not familiar with any programming constructs you might want to check out autohotkey you might be able to get it to mimic your copy and paste action

3089733

i ve created a togglebutton to show and hide a piece of ui and i ve sent its content to an icon

3089747
websphere	ibm
ibm has a product called asset analyzer these days it is probably being marketed as the rational websphere asset analyzer or some such

width	height
for your case your outer loop should iterate from the smallest possible bounding box upward with the width and height successively increasing by powers of two

3089829
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
with those two i should be able to know the width of a char beware padding and margin and its height

3089831
getter	setter
same goes for unit testing you don t test getter setter because the only way they may fail it because the runtime environment fail

3089839

modern ides that know enough to show instance methods and variables are also frequently smart enough to show or hide things in the list based on whether they re public protected or private

3089940
int	chars
you can treat chars as int their ascii values and manipulate them

3089944
int	chars
chars and their ascii value int are interchangeable

3089952
width	height
just check the interface orientation and if it s landscape switch the application frame width and height dimensions width becomes height height becomes width

3089970
public	protected
your ide still won t be able to help you when constructing arguments and your magic __set basically just makes your protected properties effectively public

3089993
opera	firefox
i ve used w3schools xml dom object reference but it s badly dated it only tracks ie firefox opera and w3c it s missing heaps of newer standard methods plus i m certain i ran into something there that was wrong but i can t remember what it was

when i post it back i can easily reconstruct the taglist object by iterating through my tagliststring - but it doesn t get updated

3090461
distance	polygons
z-fighting can be mitigated but you can t really eliminate it completely so eventually you could either apply a texture with the letters you want to the surface or you can try to manually adjust the values of the 2d overlay position trying to increase it s distance from the other polygons progressively by small bits till it is small enough that it looks like if it s there and big enough to make the z values be different after they are truncated eliminating the doubt for the render and consequently eliminating the z-fighting

3090478
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this seems to work in ie8 firefox and google-chrome but not in safari and i assume not in earlier version of ie

when treated as unsigned it becomes the largest possible integer so the comparison is true

3090535
mousemove	mousedown
a mousedown and mousemove combo also commonly goes by the name drag so here s an example of creating a drag event that you can bind to elements

3090535
mousemove	mouseout	mousemove	mousedown	mouseout	mousedown
one of the advantages to using this is that you only bind the mousemove mouseout and mousedown handlers once each element no matter how many times that element is bound to the drag event

3090587
inherited	subclassing
so if some one makes a huge class of his own with several methods besides the ones he inherited from the interface for some addition functionality and those are of no use to you its better to use a reference to a subclassing in this case the interface and assign the concrete class object to it

the whole point of wpf s architecture is that you never will need to toggle a button in the first place conceptually all keyboard and mouse actions in wpf should serve to toggle a bound property in your model or view model

3090764
inotifypropertychanged	icommand
there are still very valid reasons to abandon icommand and inotifypropertychanged in favor of just calling a method on your viewmodel from the code-behind

3091953
width	height
note a slight error in your code was to re-get the height on each iteration of width

3092016

you might have to tweak it a bit - i didn t quite understand the min part is it used only because the last range is 1 size bigger than the other range

3092322
vb.net	vb6
it s probably not too important but i should point out that there s a distinct difference between ms access the developer s tool to let you write code build forms and build reports and that of the database engine that access developers vb6 vb.net and in your case java can use to read an access database file

3092328
put	get

when the calculation is started in a form this form could pop-up a dialog to ask the user for input

3092475
inherited	subclassing
these pure virtual functions can be implemented using a template since the differences between subclassing aren t large - so my idea was to use multiple inherited to mix-in the appropriately templated helper-class that provides the implementation

3092483
g++	gcc
i m using g++ and gcc in linux

3092499
actionscript	mxml
btw should you plan to create custom components in actionscript instead of mxml you ll face the opposite problem properties are set before you had a chance to actually create your children so you may need to buffer them if they actually should influence some childs properties

3092577
hide	show
the above code show the toolbar on top of screen with progress bar in center but that time it require to hide navigation bar otherwise toolbar is show below the navigation bar

3093187
width	height
then edit the css of the class to display block and define a height and width like a lot of other answers have mentioned

3093203
put	get
do this either via a direct database query or then just have a gui console to call into your service and get those entries - but don t put that burden on the servicehost - that s the wrong place to put this functionality

3093219

touchesbegan	touchesended
i d like to handle touches horizontal slide in particular in a uiviewcontroller subclass i did but the problem is the controller s view contains a uiscrollview which covers the whole screen so touchesbegan and touchesended events are never called in my controller

3093490
inherited	subclassing
make my uiviewcontroller also inherited from uiscrollview and handle touches as needed and remove the current scroll view or use a uiscrollview subclassing in place of my current scroll view which will call a delegate method for the cases i need

3093490
touchesbegan	touchesended
the goal would be to get newviewcontroller s scrollview to call newviewcontroller s touchesbegan and touchesended methods

3093490
touchesbegan	touchesmoved	touchesbegan	touchesended	touchesmoved	touchesended
perfectly horizontal slide no scrollbar appears touchesbegan touchesmoved and touchesended are called

3093490

any touch that doesn t cause a scroll touch without moving or horizontal move followed by a slightly vertical slide touchesbegan touchesmoved and touchescancelled are called

3093490
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
dr what seems to be the easiest way to me if you can t use uigesturerecognizer is to subclass uiscrollview set its delaycontenttouches property to false and override touches functions touchesshouldbegin touchesshouldcancel as well as touchesbegan touchesmoved ... according to your needs

3093519
equals	compareto
the usual way to implement compareto or equals is to compare only some values that you store in your type

3094820
terminate	timeout
for example if you have only a 2-way ssl connector configured in your tomcat it will start fine with the scripts in tomcat_home bin but if you try to start it with the eclipse server view it won t be able to open a connection to the http port and will terminate when it hits the timeout

3095624
stdout	stderr
if you have a logfile for example you might wish to open it as stdout or stderr and open dev null as stdin

3095959
inherited	properties
as gumbo said it doesn t matter where you put it if you don t reset the font and eric meyer s reset inherited font properties so it s ok to declare it also before the reset but if you want to follow some guidelines and write it based on some elementary architecture logic if you set some properties to an object then reset it destruct those properties are supposed to be long gone

adding mptt onto the category model on top of that - via level tree_id left and right fields which will be added automatically by django-mptt - will make it easier to get all parent or children in one go

3096313
post	get
is there a built-in way to get at post get parameters in racket

3096313
post	get
is there a more-or-less standard non-buggy way to get the value of a post get-variable given a field name and request

3096313
post	get
or better yet a way of getting back a collection of the post get values as a list hash a-list

3096317
jar	war
so say i have two projects one producing a war and the other a utility jar

additionally i would like a pointer cursor with the show hide but i can t seem to get that to work

3096473
folder	directory
so maybe you could just loop through all the subdirs in the assembly folder and see if any of the sub directory contains the public key

3096473
folder	directory
just remember that any assemblies can be under any of multiple of the direct sub directory to the assembly folder so probably safest to loop through all of them

3096522
children	parent
i have a list of parent objects that contain children

3096522
children	parent
both parent and children have a checked boolean property

3096593

you would need to specify a wildcard matching expression such as this one to select the first character following a sentence delimiter and spaces

3096600
mouse	keyboard
even better is there a similar keyboard command to holding ctrl and scrolling the mouse wheel

3096630

i have tried to do it manually and this works to some extent with usual numbers but it fails for very big or very small numbers no range checking and for special cases nan infinity etc.

3096653
ienumerable	iqueryable
no they don t if they re correctly called on the iqueryable rather than the ienumerable they are compiled as expressions and will later be translated to sql

3096653
ienumerable	iqueryable
if the first parameter of the extension method is ienumerable rather than iqueryable you ll run into a database query

3096666
punctuation	words
the select statement includes a reserved words or argument name that is misspelled or missing or the punctuation is incorrect

profiling	debugging
from what i can tell visual c++ express doesn t generate a debugging file that is used by profiling programs

3096764
coalesce	isnull
you can probably solve this by identifying which it is and using coalesce or isnull

3096764
coalesce	isnull
coalesce is the standard ansi way isnull gives slightly better performance although the difference is probably insignificant in most cases

3096794
spaces	delimiter
-d use spaces as the delimiter

3096795
children	parent
the filter will use a bool property on the parent class to determine if the parent or its children are checked

3096806

from what i can tell it is pulling in the info but it fails when i try to create the listadapter from the new simplecursoradapter

3096864
ddms	adb
it really helps if you would use adb logcat ddms or the ddms perspective in eclipse to look at the stack trace associated with a crash

3096901
int	double
i realize it s trivial to do this with int just where size is predetermined to be the number of digits in the number but that obviously won t work for floats double because you can t mod one floats

3096925
nsurlconnection	nsoperationqueue
the nsurlconnection is already asynchronous so there is no need to add it to an nsoperationqueue

a better approach may be to pass a variable via get or post to your page generating the rss and grab the data that pertains to the variable passed

3098611
versioning	upgrade
i just upgrade core-plot to the latest versioning in an application that was already running successful plots

3098613

the intention is to do a one way salt hash of the passwords using sha256managed on user creation and then validate the users using the same

3098829
hash	salt
is there a better option than doing a salt one way hash

3098837
draggable	droppable
when you drop a draggable element into the droppable jquery then checks the scope attribute of the draggable and checks if the droppable you are trying to drag into is present in

3098837
draggable	droppable
if it isn t it means that the droppable you are tring to drop into is not in the same scope as the draggable

3098849
client-side	server-side
for things like regular expressions it can normally be written just once and then passed to js i use it to validate once on the client-side and then again on the server-side

3098861
hash	salt
storing passwords as hash with salt is the correct way

3098876
hash	salt
storing password hash with salt it correct

3098886

google-chrome	firefox
this works in firefox google-chrome but not in internet explorer 7 or ie8

3099306
getter	setter
all the properties attached to your native javascript object will be available as qooxdoo properties which have to be accessed with the commonly used getter and setter

g++	gcc
the alternative to creating symlinks is to explicitly use ccache gcc as the c compiler and ccache g++ as the c++ compiler

3099502
crossover	mutation
to apply genetic algorithms it is essential that you define the mutation and crossover operators such that a single application of mutation or crossover results in a small change in the overall performance while a many applications of mutation and crossover results in a large change in the overall performance of your algorithm

3099509
hide	show
effectively hide the uitabbar so camera button show up on bottom

satellite	altitude
however i faced numerous difficulties a major one is how to convert two line elements tle information to longitude latitude and altitude to display the satellite and satellite path on the map

3099619
inherited	properties
one way may be to create a class that inherited textbox and in that class create your own dependency properties that delegates to stringformat when set

3099619
inherited	properties
so instead of using textbox in your xaml you will use the inherited textbox and set your own dependency properties in the binding

3099637
inherited	properties
it may be important to use the hasownproperty method to determine whether the object has the specified properties as a direct properties and not inherited from the object s prototype chain

3099659
comparator	icomparer
you would need to implement an icomparer as opposed to creating a class that implements comparator

3099659
comparator	icomparer
the difference is that an icomparer has the necessary knowledge to compare two objects whereas comparator is implemented by a class that knows how to compare itself against something else

3099660
integer	unsigned
you want a type that is an unsigned integer that is exactly 64 bits wide

3099669
integer	unsigned
in most cases i know of though unsigned long is an unsigned 32 bit type while uint64 which is an implementation type not even mentioned in the standard is a 64 bit unsigned integer in vs

3099676
crossover	mutation
the best improvement in solving the multiknapsack via the use of genetic algorithms would be to improve your encoding of the mutation and crossover operators which can make orders of magnitude of difference in the resulting performance and blow out of the water any tweaks to the fundamental genetic algorithm

3099676
crossover	mutation
there is a lot you can do to make your mutation and crossover operators tailored to multiknapsack

3099676
crossover	mutation
then you would adapt their encodings to your mutation and crossover operators and see how well they perform in your genetic algorithms

3099676
crossover	mutation
it is highly likely that an efficient search space encoding or an accurate heuristic evaluation function of the multiknapsack problem can translate into highly effective mutation and crossover operators

3099691
stdout	stderr
if this is a linux system you could append to your command in order to redirect stderr to stdout

3099699
stateless	stateful
is it good way to use both stateless and stateful session beans for the different modules if the requirement demands

3099751
jar	manifest.mf
i you have a main class in that jar that you want to run the best approach is to put a meta-inf manifest.mf file in the jar and launch your class using java -jar mypackage.jar

3099821
serializable	deserialization	stateless	stateful
you should use stateless whenever possible they are faster and consume less memory because they don t require serializable and deserialization and stateful only when needed

3099821
stateless	stateful
so it s perfectly ok to have 8 stateless and 2 stateful beans

3099823
stateless	stateful
you question is quite vague but it seems like you basically ask for advice whether it s good to use either stateless or stateful session beans

3099907
jrails	ujs
i wouldn t recommend using jrails at this point because it s fairly outdated and as the episode mentions it kind of defeats the purpose of switching to jquery as the rails 2 helpers generate ujs

3099909
barbecue	zxing
i think barbecue is an open-source easy java library so it is best.also zxing pronounced â œzebra crossingâ is an open-source multi-format 1d 2d barcode image processing library implemented in java.see this link

probably also interesting for you to read variables from external sources which describes how to deal with data sent via post or get or cookies

3099978
post	get
then in your php using the following code by using request you can get the data from either get or post parameters

3099983
equals	gethashcode
which isn t dependent on the gethashcode equals implementations it looks at the reference itself
