width	height
i think this is what you are looking for - your container should be overflow hidden your graph would be contained in some thing with a width and height and beyond that you just need to calculate a constraint box which is going to be the .offset of the container adding the extra space by the calculating overflowed portion i.e

serializable	deserialization
deserialization iaw making java objects from serializable data requires the same versions of the classes

5703412
pull	push
the best solution is to create a bare repository on the server that you push to and then a non-bare clone of it which contains the checkout so after you push to the bare repo you ssh to the server and do git pull from the non-bare repo or set up a hook to do so automatically after the bare repo receives the new version

5703752
jobs	cron
my personal theory is that they somehow set up cron jobs to fire at the set times

5703767
fast-forward	merge

the point of salting password hash is that the salt should be different for each stored hash

that way an attacker can t use a single precomputed hash dictionary against all the hash he d need a separate dictionary for each salt value

in any event you should be using wrap_content for the height or width and they should all have a weight of 1

you created a retain properties in your code yet you didn t use the accessor method so the object was never retained

looking at the public protected interface of the class there s only one redeeming quality it implements the non-generic iequalitycomparer interface

5707968

the double iee754 type has 53 bits of mantissa so you can easily represent the 32-bit int range and then some

5708693

so i guess my question is why is the compiler attempting to convert to a double when i would assume it should be converting to int

5708713
division	multiplication
a division for example would have to be rounded down and a multiplication would either have to be checked for overflow or masked down to fit in the integer range

5708715
processors	hyperthreading
in a numa memory architecture which have been relatively mainstream in x86 since intel hyperthreading and amd opteron there s an ideal group of processors which can efficiently access a particular region of memory and all other processors will pay a significant penalty to access that range

rtp	rtsp
this is the simplest approach as you don t need to host an rtp rtsp service on your pc

5708716

it s also the most universal as all network providers should allow your client to use http but use of rtp rtsp isn t guaranteed

some people might refer to clang or llvm-gcc incorrectly as llvm which may cause some confusion

5708732
clang	llvm
clang is a whole new c c++ objective-c compiler which uses its own frontend and llvm as the backend

5708732
clang	llvm
each of these approaches plain gcc gcc + llvm and clang have their advantages and disadvantages

5708732
clang	llvm
the last few sets of benchmarks i ve seen showed gcc to produce slightly faster code in most test cases though llvm had a slight edge in a few while llvm and clang gave significantly better compile times

for-loop	arrays
the program will check and with the 5 values from the arrays i have and print out numbers that are larger than what the user put in in this case which is 17 i use a for-loop to do this

5708955
installation	upgrade
i would suggest sql server compact edition - it s free file based requires no extra installation and this also gives you a nice upgrade path since it also supports entity framework

5709028
gridview	checkboxlist
i currently have two web controls one being a checkboxlist and the other a gridview

5709028
gridview	checkboxlist
the gridview s data configuration has a parameter in it s query which is linked to the selected values from the checkboxlist

5709050
post	get
that said you should either try with mime encoding or try to get a hang of post requests

5709158
rar	zip
to be sure the actual class exists in the swc you can open the swc with zip rar program and look in the inclusion xml for the line

5709169
int	chars
declaring a pointer of type or instructs the compiler that a later attempt to dereference it using the unary operator must yield a result of int chars or mytype respectively

5709170
sorting	filtering
viewers handle the drudgery of populating sorting filtering and updating widgets

5709175

how can i locate the drive letter that has a folder custom on the root directory

5709194
folder	directory
i create a directory named js in my media root then create tiny_mce and copy scrpits from tinymce tiny_mce.js is in this directory to this folder

5709261
width	height
how can i get rid of them either by eliminating the translation transformation or by deriving the number from some meaningful math related to the height and width

5709287
cpu	hyperthreading	cpu	processors	processors	hyperthreading
it would be good to know what physical cpu this is but i m assuming from your phrasing about logical processors that there is 1 physical socket 2 cpu cores and hyperthreading is enabled giving you 4 logical processors

5709287
processors	hyperthreading
this sharing can take place at different levels for both hyperthreading and multicore processors alu execution resources cache at different levels etc but in broad terms physical cores in the same socket won t be affected much by what the other core s is are doing and logical cores implemented by hyperthreading will be hugely affected by what their hypertwin is doing

5709287
processors	hyperthreading
the results you got -- on processors a and b being intentionally ambiguous about which 2 processors those are you get double the performance of a alone but on processors a and c you get approximately the same performance as a alone -- sure sound like hyperthreading is the difference where a and c are hypertwins in the same physical core and b is in the other physical core

5709287
cpu	affinity
i would run task manager keep an eye on loads on each cpu before you run your test to get an idea of how much else is going on and where windows schedules it then run your test again a few times for different combinations of cpu affinity and see if you can confirm or deny this theory

5709312
pop-up	dialog
i m considering overriding the back button so that when pressed from the root b it will pop-up a dialog essentially saying log out

using xml parsing tutorial from here as a reference i am trying to parse a simple xml rss feed with the following structure

5709411
folder	directory
when you create a subdomain in plesk 10 a directory is created in your http root and in the subdomains folder so say you create a subdomain called secure you ll get

5709421
width	height
70 is the difference between the width and height divided by two

5709485
postgresql	mysql
it s pretty easy under postgresql and can be done under mysql argument under 5.5 afaik

5709533
postgresql	mysql
point to make also is that heroku uses postgresql by default even if you ve included mysql gem

5709544
getter	setter
so maybe the object will be car and have a setter getter for door colour wheels

5709549
post	get
i think it could be useful blog post get more out of your content content modeling and data stores

5709554
proficy	historian

5709554
proficy	historian
you can configure ge intelligent platformsâ s proficy historian without the active maintenance and back-up routines that a traditional rdb requires

5709554
proficy	historian
popular options are proficy historian from general electric or osisoft s pi historian

5709567
post	get
i ve experienced the issue of a scrollview starting off scrolled down slightly the solution was to post a runnable which called the animateto 0 0 method to get the list to scroll to the top

5709573
rjava	jri
c program files r r-2.9.2 library rjava jri

5709646
mdpi	hdpi
all i would say is that obviously romain guy is correct about using drawables to keep xml files in and then moving image resources into the relevant mdpi hdpi and ldpi folders the only time i d go against this is when you wish to target 1.5 devices

5709659
free	malloc
i can see it malloc and free the view as i open and close it

5709671
viewdidload	viewwillappear
correction the above code should be in viewwillappear rather than viewdidload

5709685
pop-up	dialog
you can either create a pop-up or a dialog

5709690
flowlayout	jsplitpane
i expect to be able to slide the jsplitpane s slider bar to the left beyond the edge of the buttons compressing that jpanel and have the flowlayout wrap the buttons to a second row

5709726
ccscene	cclayer
use two cclayer objects gamelayer and hudlayer as child nodes of one ccscene gamescene

5709749
querypath	phpquery
this is performance-wise not the better choice but easy to do with phpquery or querypath

5709770
children	parent
here is one possible solution which basically tracks the popups child windows and injects them as automation children of the parent page

5709784
google-chrome	firefox
i also tried google-chrome n firefox they don t have the border as in ie9

5709827
portrait	landscape
the uisplitviewcontroller is going to resize the view controller to its own content size which for sure in portrait mode not sure about landscape off the top of my head is going to be 768.0

5709870
stdout	stderr
i m redirecting stdout and stderr in a perl script with

5709875
post	get
this blog explains how this is done and a follow-on post that shows how to get window borders

5709890
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
and this gcal works perfectly in google-chrome and opera just doesn t display at all in firefox

5709918
postgresql	mysql
mysql and postgresql seem to be equally supported from what i ve noticed

5709930
profiling	benchmarking
maybe try profiling different parts of the code with the benchmarking class

5709977
client-side	server-side
rather use both server-side and client-side validation or simply server-side alone

5709982
stdout	stderr
the only way i can think of is to fork off a subprocess which sends back everything via pipe think io pipe or something like ipc open2 - either way you still redirect your stderr to stdout in the child and then in the parent write the stuff you get in the pipe to the log file - this allows you to open the logfile when you first have data

5709988
spaces	linefeed
it seems to be spaces or possibly even a linefeed

5709988
spaces	linefeed
this seems to fix it outputting spaces and or a linefeed but the value is still lost

5709989
pop-up	dialog
1 the user clicks the edittext a timepicker dialog pop-up the user selects the hour and minute and the edittext text is set to the time picked

5710068
viewdidload	viewwillappear
you should probably put the viewdidload code into viewwillappear as the bounds of everything may not have been set in viewdidload before viewwillappear

5710095
postgresql	mysql
this is standard sql92 syntax so will work in any db that supports that including postgresql mysql and sqlite

5710107
int	chars
the logic is simply to process each chars into it s int value adjusting for position within the string

5710126
folder	directory
i tried editing the buildinfo.properties file to change the publish path to home but all that did was create a literal home folder in my project directory

5710131
int	chars
for each one add to the counter you re keeping - the value to add is the int value of the chars

5710143
nas	qnap
the next steps will be to optimize performance and logic as this script runs on my nas low cpu and memory performance qnap ts-219p

5710154
int	chars
in c c++ and java strings are made up of chars that can individually be treated as int usually one byte thanks to ascii

5710154
multiplying	add
we know now that we re reading in a new digit so we multiplying the previous value by 10 to shift the value over and then add in the digit

5710175
mdpi	hdpi
50sp looks right on 240 hdpi wvga800 30sp looks right on 120 ldpi qvga and 160 mdpi hvga

5710177
width	height
box-shadow will not really work gecko firefox and other browsers add the length of the shadow to the object and therefore create and overflow horizontally if you set the object to have full width or height

5710208
post	get
i need to get the time elapsed and post it through my php file so that it gets saved in a table that was created in our mysql database

5710217
drjava	bluej
in some java ides bluej and drjava for example the user can open an interaction window where java expressions and statements can be typed in

5710221
textview	simplecursoradapter
you supply the ids of the textview widgets and the corresponding column names from the cursor in the simplecursoradapter constructor

5710231
google-chrome	firefox
true basic http authentication is not currently supported but i got it working now for firefox and for google-chrome

5710267
postgresql	mysql
at the same time i want to migrate my database from mysql to postgresql

5710267
postgresql	mysql
basically i want take the data from the mysql database and i want to fit it to the new schema in the postgresql database

5710267
postgresql	mysql
the new tables in the postgresql database consisted of joined views from the mysql database

5710280
debian	linux
i m using debian linux so that should simplify things a bit

5710285
inherited	properties
therefore your mvvm must inherited from dependencyobject and then you can create a dependency properties that can be animated

5710287
ftp	telnet
such as ssh ftp passwd telnet etc

5710323
postgresql	mysql
you can use a database abstraction layer to handle the differences between mysql and postgresql but for the most part you re on your own

5710338
put	get
how do i get the value of for example the field of checkbox and put it on a conditional clause and set the value checked to checkbox if it is 1 and not checked if it returns 0

5710342
hide	show
i have a form where i show hide fields dynamically using jquery depending on some radio buttons

5710395
width	margin
this works by centring the lhs of the element using left 50 then centering the element by using a negative margin of exactly half it s width

5710426
free	malloc
trying to free a pointer not returned by malloc d or already free d

5710443
ubuntu	linux
the code i ve posted above works beautifully when the server is running on arch linux or ubuntu

5710448
folder	directory
approach #2 will automatically add new folder files as they are added to the directory tree

5710475
nsurlconnection	nsurlprotocol
when you would like to display an iad you can send your pause notification this will cancel the nsurlconnection but not the nsurlprotocol which will remain open and loading and thus your webview will continue to appear as if it were loading

5710475
nsurlconnection	nsurlprotocol
then when the add is finished you can send a resume notification much the same except in this case any active nsurlprotocol handlers receiving the notification will create new nsurlconnection using the range header to resume where they left off

5710475
nsurlconnection	nsurlprotocol
if you want a timeout then it should be in the nsurlprotocol handlers nsurlconnection

5710481
free	malloc
memory allocated with malloc will persist until you manually remove it with free

5710481
free	malloc
in general try to write your free calls the same time you write your malloc calls

5710481
free	malloc
maybe you have a foo_init function that calls malloc and creates associated contexts from an api then you pass that context into other routines that operate on that data and then you need to place the free calls into a foo_destroy or foo_free or similar routine

5710481
free	malloc
perhaps this memory is being returned too soon perhaps some pointer is being free ed two or more times or you re overwriting your buffers that malloc sizeof nav_str call is a little worrying

5710522
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
you don t need the dataoutputstream here and you must create the objectoutputstream before the objectinputstream otherwise you get a deadlock

5710532
google-chrome	firefox
yes it sucks for sure but you ll usually find that when you get it working in ie7 and then test in firefox ie8 or ie6 - it s pretty close or the differences are an easy fix compared to testing in say google-chrome and then double checking in ie7

5710668
ubuntu	linux
i use source insight in windows but now i use ubuntu and i can t find a version of source insight for linux

5710691
width	height
i need a way to calculate the width and height values of an image when resized to 1024px

5710691
width	height
the largest value of the image height or width will be resized to 1024px and i need to figure out the remaining width or height value

5710691
portrait	landscape
this needs to be dynamic as some images will be portrait and some landscape

5710693
google-chrome	firefox
if on a localhost i would suggest using firefox or google-chrome and installing firebug for mozilla and google-chrome gets a default

5710696
portrait	landscape
i am trying to display a custom uiview on top of all other views making it modal that works correctly in both portrait and landscape

5710696
portrait	landscape
it seems that mainwindow is always in portrait regardless of what the actual device orientation is so even when i am in landscape my custom view displays upside down as if it was in portrait mode

5710696
portrait	landscape
my question finally is how do i correctly add my custom view to the main windows so that it is correctly orientated in landscape as well as portrait and still displays over the entire screen

5710714
width	height
the values of width and height at the end correspond to the width and height of the image

5710801
width	height
it will choose the largest possible size less than 1024x1024px that has the same width height ratio as the original image

5710898
postgresql	mysql
it s basically a middle-man between mysql and postgresql and will be able to handle all the differences between them

5710922
mp4	h.264
i use the code below to play an mp4 video h.264 aac codecs from a url the url is perfectly fine no redirect 404 or anything

5710942
cout	cin
it seems the benefits of modularization and templates would be a no-brainer even if you couldn t use your cin or cout

5710946
dao	facade
so on the server side you have the dao and facade layers

5710951
.htaccess	httpd.conf
add this to your .htaccess or httpd.conf file

5710973
min	max
first build a query go get your min id and max urgency

5711055
width	height
just guessing you set a height for the buttons but not a width

5711065
move	drag
when i open the dialog i have a set of functions that query a drag drop event on a calendar if it is a multiple event then i need to make the dialog not modal and allow further interactivity with th calendar to move another event

5711100
min	max
if i used stat_summary to get the mean of all y s at a given x is there some way to identify the new y the means that is the max min of all new y s

5711132
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
the problem is that your code loops through all indices of the arrays using a canonical for-loop which is fine

5711144
for-loop	arrays
the last iteration of your for-loop is referencing one past the end of your arrays so you get an arrayindexoutofboundsexception

5711158
nsmutablestring	nsstring
if you really need to modify an instance directly you can use an nsmutablestring instead of an nsstring

5711160
nsmutablestring	nsstring
nerver use nsstring for string manipulation use nsmutablestring

5711160
nsmutablestring	nsstring
nsmutablestring is the subclass of nsstring and used for that purpose

5711160
nsmutablestring	nsstring
the mutable subclass of nsstring is nsmutablestring

5711174
int	chars
currently i have my java object defining this field as a string and the database mysql is an int padded to 4 chars laborcode int 4 zerofill

5711206
put	get
you could put a get param on the image like

5711219
client-side	server-side
you re trying to combine server-side scripting with client-side scripting here

5711253
x86	64bit
there is no way to make a direct and unconditional jump to an address with a displacement greater than 2gb on any x86 32 or 64bit

5711315
rss	feed
am working on a news paper project but without rss feed so i was compelled to make it s feed programatically using php so i have 2300 process of processing pages and inserting in mysql the results of the processing

5711316
int	double
in your manufacturer class you re calling the superclass constructor with an int string int and double

5711316
superclass	subclassing
the getinventorymethod exists in the superclass and is not private so you can call it from the subclassing like this

5711330
super	implements
is implements as a hash then maybe it is super quick anyway comparable to the blank

5711350
rss	feed
usually rss feed implies that you put there just a subject and some text snippet

5711350
rss	feed
i d create rss feed as simple xml file so it is not necessary to load data from mysql on every hit users do

5711411
boost	stl
first stl s and boost s smart pointers are available on windows and there s nothing wrong with using those

5711438
children	parent
work with parent and children

5711442
onresize	onload
use the onload event of your iframe and the onresize event of the window to resize the iframe to the required size

5711463
uiview	subviews
you need to add a transparent uiview as a subviews below the keyboard and handle touches there to dismiss the keyboard

5711643
google-chrome	safari
p.s.- only works in google-chrome and safari as of yet

5711659
setinterval	settimeout
there is no way to delete an object only to let it become unreachable in which case the gc may reclaim destroy it if it feels like it -- however both setinterval and settimeout will maintain a strong reference to the callback which 1 will fire the callback even if the callback and or myevent is not strongly reachable elsewhere 2 may prevent other objects from being eligible for reclamation if they are reachable via the callback

how to get landscape and portrait view in android tablet

5711681
portrait	landscape
if you rotate your tablet to landscape then you get the landscape view otherwise you get the portrait view

5711693
division	subtraction	division	subtract
this is o log p because you are dividing by 2 every time or subtract one then dividing by two so the worst case would really take o 2 log p - one for the division and one for the subtraction of one

width	height
i dont know how to find the text height and width in pixels for the given text size in android

5711825
post	get
dialog use post redirect get

5711834
folder	directory
if the folder newname does not exist yet the trailing backslash suppresses the question whether you mean a file a directory

5711854
width	height
you need to calculate programmatically the new width and height of the scrollview

5711877
post	get
you get the polling effect that you were looking for in your original post

5711916
maven	pom.xml	maven	m2e	m2e	pom.xml
if you have m2e installed and you have a maven pom.xml building the jar use

5712227
installation	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
as for how to fix it upgrade your php installation to a versioning that hasn t been dead for years and that includes the extensions you need

5712240
jobs	cron
if you can t start the cron job from the server itself there are free web services where you can set up cron jobs that call scripts on your server at given times

5712266
typemock	moles
unless you want to use typemock isolator or moles you ll have to hide the load method behind an interface and inject that into the class

5712313
addition	multiplication
i ve started the basic tutorials for os x ios development and have actually made good progress making an os x app that takes a text string converts it to numbers and performs encryption using modular addition and multiplication

5712355
profiling	instrumentation
you just profiling your code with instrumentation and eliminate the slow areas

5712406
width	height
but it doesn t help at all for width and height

5712406
width	height
a possible solution would be to use snipmate for the snippet use for the image s path capture the path and feed it to some command line utility fill the width and height attributes with its output

5712438
folder	directory
can we create a directory on the internal storage of the device during application installation .also after creating that i need to copy some images and music to that directory from our res folder

ondestroy gets called and then oncreate gets called again

5712539
rss	feed
you should use this link to get rss feed

5712546
jar	manifest.mf
if i understand your problem correctly your zip is correctly created but the my-app-0.0.1-snapshot contained in it as well as the jar directly located in target directory does not include your main class in the manifest.mf file

5712546
jar	manifest.mf
this is the task of the jar plugin which provides a way to indicates in the manifest.mf the main class of your project

5712608
width	height
you should specify in your main mxml the width and height of your application even though it contains but a clickable image

5712608
width	height
of width 400px and height 100px then your application tag must look like

5712608
width	height
and nonetheless in your html you should have both your object and embed tags to have the same width and height and you should specify a value to your embed tag s align attribute as well eg

5712608
width	height
to set the html object s width and height based on your flex button s size you should update your application mxml code as follows

5712608
width	height
these values width and height are passed to the javascript function onflashappinited which you should also update

5712626
range	minimum
you would want a class which selects the maximum value from each unique range but you might also want to select the minimum value sum the values average them count them etc etc

wadl	wsdl
1 for all restful web services will there be a wsdl wadl for describing the service

5712879
post	get
if i use get post to the resource which could do this operations for me then will it be a violation of rest principles

5712913
wakelock	powermanager
you need to use powermanager to acquire a wakelock in your application

5712925
post	get
what i d do is acumulate them in an array but you can t pass an array to the server so at the time of passing that array just transform the array in a serializable string you can pass it by get or post whatever you want and deserialize the string at destination

5712964
post	get	post	put	put	get
rest isn t limited to crud and the put get post delete methods are not necessarily the same as create retrieve update delete

5712980
wadl	wsdl
wsdl wadl is not mandatory for restful webservices

5713018

you should catch mousedown event on the target controls and then subscribe mousemove event

5713216
mousemove	mouseup
and don t remember unsubscribe your mousemove event on mouseup

it would have worked fine on the log entry ... .. ...... .......... but won t match at all for an entry containing characters other than the delimiter the spaces separating the fields and dots for field contents

5713405
webkit	gecko
does anyone know what selector is used or will be used or even a bug report for webkit gecko relating to this

5713448
sorting	filtering
you can benefit an index if you need sorting of filtering on columns that are the beginning of the index

5713480
ubuntu	linux
first my present amd machine is running ubuntu linux with 6cpu-core and ps -ef gave

5713517
getter	setter
after that and now coming back to your question first of all you generate stored procedures for your getter and setter

5713517
gridview	sqldatasource
if you re there you can add a sqldatasource to your gridview and in the site you add your stored procedures to the control like this

5713527
for-loop	loops
use a for-loop that loops from 0 to data.length as above

5713528
hide	show
i was trying to come up with a way to combine the hide and show lines into one using .toggle with the showorhide flag but it s too early in the morning to be thinking too hard

5713575
width	height
all i want is to make the fix on its width and expand its height when i put too much text

5713724
udp	tcp
we are using ice tcp udp hole punching to implement the p2p

5713724
udp	tcp
while tcp ensure the packet loss but for udp i need a decent approach to make sure packet must be delivered to the other peer

5713737
mouse	keyboard
the script can be programmed to run a program check boxes as a mouse or keyboard doesn t matter and read files in

5713738
chmod	mkdir
i cant seem to make a folder using exec mkdir new through php using the www-data account...i have done chmod 775 var www however i still don t have privileges

5713762
sudo	passwd
make the script runnable as root via sudo with no passwd really trying to hide the passwd in your code doesn t really help with security

5713762
restrict	shared
alternatively set up a script via x inetd which reads a shared secret and a username from stdin and runs adduser as root restrict connections to localhost and set up your php script to communicate with this via sockets

5713772
tesseract	tessnet2
if you don t want to reinvent the wheel i suggest you use tesseract an open source ocr in c++ or tessnet2 which is a .net wrapper around it

5713772
tesseract	tessnet2
i had the same approach as yours grayscale then thresholds etc in .net then i adapted a bit tesseract tessnet2 is a wrapper around tesseract 2.0 not 3.x which is the actual version to have a good interface for ocr output then i have good results

5713909
stdout	stderr
still captures only stdout not stderr

5713909
stdout	stderr
if i execute stderr actually goes to dev null and only stdout is printed in terminal

5713910
prepare	execute
use odbc_prepare to prepare an sql statement and odbc_execute to pass in the parameters and execute the statements

5713962
stdout	stderr
here you are capturing the stdout of sh which is not the stderr of cmd

5714007
factors	matrix
the matrix is coerced to character if there are columns of numeric and character or factors

5714056
profiling	debugging
btw you are profiling a release binary and not a debugging one aren t you

5714101
nhibernate	queryover
yes there are several ways in nhibernate to query the database plain sql hql icriteria queryover and nhibernate.linq

5714117
macports	homebrew
i installed homebrew and after it continued to give me warnings about having macports installed i uninstalled that

5714119
boost	stl
also i don t have access to most of the standart libs no boost stl etc..

5714148
sse	avx
for example with clever use of sse or avx you could process the neurons in chunks of 4 or 8 and use a multiply-add instead of two separate instructions

5714150
unix	bsd
you didn t mention what os this is running on - if its linux unix bsd then you could just use sed to change all the absolute links and grep to find the relative ones which you ll probably need to edit by hand

5714169
hide	show
my problem is that i want to show some sub-folders or sub-elements contained in one parent folder that i may want to hide filter

5714169
children	parent
if i filter the parent folder then children folders or elements contained are filtered by default and i am not able to show them in my tree view

5714194
children	parent
if you filter the parent the children are filtered by default

5714194
children	parent
if you want only few of the children to be filtered then you should set the filter on that pattern only - not on the parent

5714247
coff	omf
to include glew in borland it is first needed to convert visual studio coff lib from coff to borland builder omf lib

5714247

so how to overcome this error and get count of comments for each post

5714431
google-chrome	firefox
the following can draw two arcs easily using svg and it works on firefox or google-chrome

5714449
hide	show
you could also use show and hide instead of the dn class

5714457
hide	show
i think it s pagination you re after but perhaps using the jquery columnize or columnizer plugin would work then you could tweak to show hide the columns created

5714467
google-chrome	firefox
i see two javascript errors on your live page in both google-chrome and firefox

5714477
google-chrome	firefox
the demo is here and is working on google-chrome and firefox 4

5714484
serializable	deserialization
so these objects need to contain logic for usage in the first process in the second process as well as serializable and deserialization logic

5714520
try-catch	exception-handling
why doesnot outer try-catch handle this exception-handling

5714537
getter	setter
if the property is implemented with an synthsize command the compiler will create getter and setter methods for you and it will make sure the getter retains your property

5714544
width	height
to estimate the body s height i could get the client s window s width then roughly guess how many lines the body occupies

5714556
width	height
therefore to enlarge the tile by one pixel on the screen we would need to add 1.0 scale to the width height

5714564
accessor	ivar
i believe that this doesn t make any real difference to the implementation however it s a nice way for you to be able to ensure that your public accessor are separate from the private ivar

5714567
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
they can present their views in multiple ways modal the new view slides up and covers the previous view in a tab of a uitabbarcontroller or as part of a navigational hirachy with a uinavigationcontroller

5714582
postgresql	mysql
i am not aware of node.js library for virtuoso as you have for mysql postgresql and the like

5714582
redland	jena
connections to virtuoso for querying the quad store can be made via http using the web server vsp or sparql endpoint or using any of the data access interface we have drivers providers for which include odbc jdbc ado.net oledb or rdf data providers jena sesame redland and others

5714607
n-gram	words
n-gram will tell you what is the probability that words is meaningfull

5714639
hash	md5
looking at the form it has an onsubmit call to a javascript function which takes the username and password and encrypts them into some kind of hash maybe md5 plus a little extra bits and bobs then saves them in further hidden fields in the login form

5714647
put	get
or to put it another way why should the first thread get bothered because a different thread has suffered an exception

5714669
chown	chmod
if you can avoid them in the dangerous places rm chmod chown ... so much the better

5714670
next	except
my problem at the moment is next i added facebook request dialog and everything goes well except for one thing when a user gets notification the links goes to canvas page not to fan page where i would like to go...

5714672
post	get
now if i done this comparison it returns false because _post atloriginal values are strings the are passed trought get post from client and oldatlpos values are integer

5714685
textarea	textbox
why don t you use an multi line textbox textarea

5714703
flex	robotlegs
i m trying to build a flex application using the robotlegs framework and don t know how to deal with the creation of mediators - onregister being called only after the creationcomplete event of the view component

5714703
flex	robotlegs
is anybody using robotlegs with flex and has foud a cleaner way around this than manually dispatching an event in the mediators onregister

5714708
google-chrome	firefox
my site appears fine in firefox google-chrome but load it in ie tested in 7 8 and none of the background images load

5714720
thunk	trampolines
local classes are used to create trampolines functions usually known as thunk

5714770
maven	pom.xml
then i created the pom.xml file to enable the maven dependency in that i have given the groupid as projectname and artifactid also as projectname

5714821
quicksort	mergesort
in worst case quicksort will have o n 2 where mergesort will be o n log n

5714895
quicksort	mergesort
yes both quicksort and mergesort are divide-and-conquer algorithms

5714895
quicksort	heapsort
quicksort and heapsort and can be

5714901
quicksort	mergesort
the implementation details of the underlying data-structures would also be a factor such as efficient random access needed by quicksort and the mutability of data-structures would have an effect on the memory requirements particularly mergesort

5714978
google-chrome	firefox
i have tested in google-chrome ie6+ and firefox and this approach seems to work in all of them

5714999
post	get
using firebug you can easily get the post data for the login page and use it to create a webrequest and login to the forum

5715001
directwrite	direct2d
the second point of the original answer is no longer valid either because its now possible to share d3d11 backbuffer with direct2d and through it draw text with directwrite

5715016
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationbar
so in viewdidload of rootviewcontroller inside uinavigationcontroller of recententrysplitviewconntroller how can i show uinavigationbar promp

5715044
pull	push
but when you can clone push pull that is publish to different repos which can have different purposes in themselves then master can play a different role from repo to repo

5715084
nsstring	nsdata
your response may be uint8 but you don t need to copy it into a as your already have it in a cfdataref assuming the you pass in really is a cfdataref if it isn t you have other problems... - a cfdataref is toll-free bridged with nsdata you can just cast from one to the other and you can construct an nsstring directly from the bytes in an nsdata

5715177
width	height
and if you find out what to use for fill_parent hint try -1 then you may use those constants for width and height

5715184
entities	entitymanager
i have two entities person and order being managed by jpa hibernate entitymanager

5715215
quicksort	mergesort
quicksort has a bad worst case while mergesort is always o n log n guaranteed but typical quicksort implementations are faster than mergesort in practice

5715332
coldbox	coldspring
their relationships are best managed by some sort of bean container service locator of which i believe coldbox has its own another example is coldspring

5715380
glut	sdl
anyway if you want things to be really easy instead of glut sdl etc

5715391
google-chrome	firefox
i tested it with firefox 3.6 google-chrome 10.0 and internet explorer 8 and it seems to work fine

5715394
rss	feed
i ll assume the rss feed are in date order anyway so the newest one is first

5715437
put	get
that way you can get the best of both worlds a simple way to see a persons email-address without using joins and a flexybility when someone decides to put every email address he ever owned into the app

5715442
put	get
if you put the limits in the branches of the union you only get the first 50 entries among those who were already within the top 50 of their persona kind which might be different

5715461
dpkg	aptitude
aptitude upgrade dpkg or apt-get install dpkg if you don t have aptitude

5715473
versioning	upgrade
update 05 04 13 final comments after two years i was able to work again on the system with the problematic greek character delta and was able to draw some final conclusions about the problem so first i upgrade the versioning of jasper we were using to 5.x and still experienced the problem

5715473
versioning	upgrade
so my suggestion is still true any people having this problem upgrade your jasper versioning to 5.x but also re-export your font extensions through ireprot 5.x

5715483
mouseleave	mouseenter
i am using mouseenter and mouseleave instead of onhover so that the append isn t happening a million times however i am still having an issue with people entering and leaving their mouse multiplte times on the div

5715488
dpkg	aptitude
get the .deb for dpkg and install it but you should really be doing it via apt-get or aptitude

5715499
min	max
it has a couple basic properties for setting max min values performing steps and setting the value directly

5715613
inherited	properties
another very important reason why this is also a bad idea is that when you parse this file you will need to resolve inherited properties yourself

5715613
inherited	properties
one of the major technical design aspects of the iis6 metabase is properties inherited

5715613
inherited	properties
for example if you re collecting script maps then this is an inherited properties

5715613
inherited	properties
unless you ve explicitly set the scriptmap or perhaps the defaultdoc or some other inherited properties on a site virtual directory or application then you ll need to walk back up the metabase tree to find this value

5715637
websphere	ibm
i configured ibm websphere portal 6.1 on was7

5715658
min	max
in the group clause you have to write all the fields that aren t in the agregate count max min

5715684
public	protected
then i can happily insert mock dependencies via the protected constructor and test all the public methods via the inheriting class

5715756
getter	setter
there is very simple solution add field version with getter setter pair

5715760
folder	directory
assuming that domain1.com and domain2.com are on the same local network then rather than using mod-rewrite i would suggest creating symlinks to the shared image folder so that they are accessible in each of your sites as if they were a local directory

5715777
inherited	subclassing
if you use a sti cti entity as a many-to-one or one-to-one entity you should never use one of the classes at the upper levels of the inherited hierachy as â œtargetentityâ only those that have no subclassing

5715783
int	chars
comparison between chars is normal chars order comparison between numbers is normal int order and comparison between a chars and a number places numbers before any chars except

5715798
width	height
has width 320dp and height 50dp

5715831
octal	decimal
im writing a program to convert a four digit octal number to a decimal number

5715856
nsmanagedobject	nsvaluetransformer
i ve written a custom nsvaluetransformer to map between the bound nsmanagedobject tag nsset and the nsstring nsarray of the token field

5715897
inherited	subclassing
the reason the first test fails is because nhibernate retrieve company as companyaccounting as company 32 is both an accounting company and a client and when i call session.get after it has retrieved company as companyaccounting it doesn t go back to the database and check if there is an entry for companyclient it assumes company can only be on subclassing is there anyway of making it specify that it can inherited from all of the subclassing

5715898
getter	setter
you could also possibly use an aop compiler to weave in a version filed getter setter or annotation into build domain model

5715931
width	height
i have stackpanel created in design xmal which has auto height and width

5716013
superclass	subclassing
so a reference is expected of the type cat but we are providing a reference for a superclass of type cat rather than a subclassing as it says in the definition above and this is allowed but with limited functionality unless you do a cast

5716024
submit	submission
that is - it will provide validators filters layouts but it also provides client-side jquery ui widget ajax submit and submission handling

5716048
folder	directory
hey i got the same error.in my case i d made a directory named web-inf apparently the name of the folder has to be mandatory in upper-case web-inf

5716066
width	height
what is the difference in simple terms between height and width and device-width and device-height

5716078
screens	tablet
automation code will be triggered only if there are any automation clients like screens reader tabtip in tablet pcs etc running in the machine

5716093
octal	decimal
hello im writing a program to convert a four digit octal number to a decimal number

5716100
free	malloc
the malloc implementation will go through the list of free memory physical memory we will call it free list and find an appropriate chunk that is greater than or equal to 4 bytes

5716104
int	double
the non-const member is perfectly valid to call here and the double to int conversion is just as safe

5716110
cos	sin
i found the following bit of code in the aforge.net framework library and it shows additional cos sin operations being done that are not being handled in your code

5716122
button	checkbox
once the user clicks the saveattendance button i want to add all the studentid s displayed in the gridview along with adding the status of the checkbox weather they are checked or not into the attendance table fields studentid and present respectively

5716127
put	get
if so what should i put on that action in order to get the view displayed and not a 404

5716129
parsley	robotlegs
i m not expert in robotlegs i m actually a parsley addict however if you re using a mediator pattern that means that your mediator has direct access to the view itself

5716140
width	height
you d have to use absolute positioning to have elements overlap each other but then you can t have the elements adjust width and height to their contents

5716161
stdout	stderr
backquotes capture stdout not stderr

5716161
stdout	stderr
system will dump both stdout and stderr to their parent s settings

5716172
cakephp	yii	cakephp	kohana	kohana	yii
later you can also try kohana yii cakephp zend etc

5716226
width	height
this is fixed height and width header whereas i want it relative to the screen size

5716337
put	get
my problem is i get an error when i try to put it in isolated storage

5716337
put	get
however i only get this error when i try to put it into isolated storage

5716359
put	get
when i add layouts they get put on the bottom of each other or off the screen

5716366
filtering	grouping
the database then automatically appends filtering to user supplied queries to filtering out what can t be seen from the security grouping

5716382
post	get
allows variables to be set by either an http get or post which can pose a security risk since your site will presumably use one or the other

5716394
exponent	modulo
the modulo and the private exponent are the private key at least in a simplified way

5716394
primes	modulus
with rsa it is customary to include a few other parameters in the private key such as the two or more primes factors of the modulus

5716394
exponent	modulo
these extra parameters do not offer more power the modulo and private exponent are enough to compute signatures and decrypt data but allow for a faster implementation by a factor of 3x to 4x

5716394
primes	modulus
thus possibly the question is about recovering the primes factors of the modulus given the information above

5716398
width	height
you can however fake it by putting an absolutely positioned image in the corner of the page with width and height set to 100

5716452
filtering	grouping
may want to filtering other junk out here too rows grouping with null values

5716452
min	max
predict the step value difference between adjacent sequence values based on the max min and count set values for each vendor

5716460
width	height
include topbar layout without specify width and height

5716515
perl	tcl
you can use this toolkit with tcl python riby perl and others and it works quite well on all platforms

5716554
antivirus	mcafee
i am unable to send mail as the smtp port is getting blocked by mcafee antivirus as bulk mail

5716576
prepare	execute
you should also look at mysql prepare -- this will ensure that only 1 statement is execute and prevent additional sql vulnerabilities

5716627
calloc	malloc
a rule of thumb is that if you need more than a few hundred bytes allocate it dynamically using malloc or calloc instead of trying to create a large auto variable

5716764
hide	show
what you have uses the multiple selector selector will show hide both the nav li and the .subnavi-wrapper

5716767
extjs	gxt
i m developing a custom tooltip using extjs gwt gxt for a project of mine and this tooltip has to appear over grid rows when they re selected

5716773
free	malloc
the new address is then added to the free list and malloc manipulates the free list according to its implemention check glibc for example

5716786
width	height
i need to read the dimensions of a given video file its width and height without constructing a video player like phonon my question is which class i should use to get access to this data

5716815
x86	64bit
and iirc there is no settings in x86 forcing the use of the range of 64bit double

5716851
hash	md5	int	chars
if for example the session id is an md5 hash to avoid having to deal with large 160 bit int that these values represent just strip the chars from the string using for example

5716869
union	distinct
if you want the columns to be of xml type you need to add type and use union all because the xml data type cannot be selected as distinct because it is not comparable

5716893
keystore	jks
severe failed to load keystore type jks with path webapps ft.keystore due to signed overrun bytes 128

swt	swing
mig layout is a free and open-source layout manager for swing swt javafx2 fantom qt and other gui toolkits

5716964
inherited	subclassing
edit if you can t change the parent put all of the behavior you want to inherited in the base class keeping in mind that you can overload or customize any of the methods in the subclassing

5717010
width	height
i have a preset width that all images must confirm - and the height of the images can vary proportions constrained to the original width and height

5717020
mamp	wamp
if i could get apache mysql and php to run locally like it does using wamp mamp lamp etc. it would be great

5717037
mousemove	mousedown
i digged its source and found two functions named downselector and moveselector getting invoked on mousedown and mousemove respectively

5717037
mousemove	mousedown
it might be because the ev object for mousedown and mousemove are different

5717064
ant	pom.xml
the problem comes if you try to use some ant tasks for checking out a pom.xml file make some changes like updating some version numbers and then checkin the modified pom.xml file before starting to build

5717064
ant	maven-release-plugin
no matter if i use an ant script with clearcase tasks or internal java classes or even a maven-release-plugin for hudson that tries to do this kind of job i always end with the following error

5717135
pop-up	dialog
my one issue is that the dialog is not opening as a pop-up even though i am setting the display parameter to pop-up

5717156
maven	cargo
i have one problem with cargo maven plugin

5717156
maven	cargo
but when doing second run cargo maven plugin fails with such an error

5717184
for-loop	loops
if you re going to use loops s index inside for-loop and this won t be required by others in next lines better declare the variable with var so you ll be sure x is for-loop s index initialized with 0 while the other one if other x variable is available in this context this will get overwritten by loops s index - that s you ll have some logical errors -

5717198
put	get
if i try to put it in a dataview i only get the first table

5717201
children	parent
so this very query does return all possible combinations regardless of the traversal order it does not matter whether you are connection parent to children or the other way around

5717343
public	protected
there are no public or protected members in these internal classes

5717379
installation	upgrade
if the installation type is not the same the upgrade is not performed

5717396
organization	naming
honestly i believe namespacing wouldn t repleace a right class naming scheme because namespaces are an organization thing while classes are part of what your program does

what hashing algorithm is enough for most of sites wordpress joomla fb et al

5717519
salt	md5
simple md5 with salt

5717528
aggregate-functions	sum
if you use aggregate-functions like count sum avg etc. any regular column you want to return side-by-side must be specified in the group by clause

5717564
cpu	processors
if that number is greater then the number of processors and the work as stated is mostly cpu based you will actually see overall performance degradation

you should use md5 with a salt as a bare minimum

5717621
hash	md5
in order to avoid unnecessary load on the server-side i want to create file hash with sha md5 or whatever... on the client side

5717621
client-side	server-side
long story short my question is why should i prefer client-side over server-side hashing

5717734
google-chrome	firefox
it s working very well in ie but in firefox google-chrome and other web browsers it gives me only 3 text rows and if these rows are full i need to start scroll

5717785
calloc	malloc
you can dynamically allocate a target buffer using malloc or calloc this is actually the preferred method since the buffer can be resized as necessary unlike a vla

5717791
integer	unsigned
image data in matlab is typically of type uint8 meaning each pixel is represented as an unsigned 8-bit integer spanning the range 0 to 255

5717791
int	double
assuming this is what in is when you perform your sum operation you will implicitly end up converting it to type double since an unsigned 8-bit int will likely not be big enough to hold the sum totals

5717811
portrait	landscape
i need a view controller on ipad to share two modes one in portrait and one in landscape

5717831
for-loop	loops
they can t be equivalent because in your first code only one loops is iterating the for-loop which checks the if-else statements at each iteration of row_index

accessor	properties
introduce properties into the class with the accessor desired which doesn t give you access at design time directives can be applied to the aspect at design time to determine which properties to inject though

5718066
equals	gethashcode
also in case of composite id we have to override equals and gethashcode and all this seems to be overkill for such a simple task

5718122
ienumerable	ilist
an ienumerable does not give you the same features that an ilist

5718122
ienumerable	ilist
unless your stuff is an ienumerable that is also an ilist your code won t work

5718155
ienumerable	ilist
while every ilist is an ienumerable not every ienumerable is an ilist

5718158
multiplying	division
also note that in order to prevent the integer division from truncating your result you need to multiplying first and then divide

5718162
versioning	upgrade
i m using an old versioning of lucene lucene 2.4.1 i cannot upgrade

5718166
clang	llvm
the llvm clang static analyzer can typically find memory management problems even before you run your program

it has a nice menu with options to validate css html both local and remote and rss feed

5718328
children	parent
make a lookup table that has two columns that are keys to the events and have a parentevent|childevent layout so if your parent has 3 children his key is listed 3 times tied to different children keys

5718369
inherited	properties
all the controllers i push onto the navigation controller inherited from a base class that in viewdidappear adds a couple of uibarbuttonitems and sets the navigation controller s toolbar uinavigationcontroller.toolbar properties to be visible

5718376
post	get
if it works with get you can redirect to another action after handling post and there you can set the repspose header

5718419
hide	show
there are probably better ways to change this by playing with the hide and show events but this suits my needs

5718442
folder	directory
directory but it doesn t create the .svn folder for the project like it s supposed to

versioning	upgrade	onenote	ms-office
anyway it is too expensive to upgrade every engineer s versioning of ms ms-office just for this one little feature of onenote

5718511
ant	maven
ivy for old projects which have complicated and established build process in ant - the conversion to maven may be real pain

5718511
ant	maven
ivy is dependency management only and adds basically just some ant tasks you are still in ant where maven does lots of extra stuff packaging deploying site generation etc.

5718535
post	get
hope this helps and please post back if you get this working and it looks at all reasonable

5718553
min	max
fitting a rectangle over all the points is pretty much a trivial affair sort them all get the min max and voilã

5718629
min	max
to find a best-fit rectangle over a set of points and with the assumption that all points in the set need to be within the rectangle all you need to do is find the min max in both dimensions

5718629
min	max
one way to do this would be to sort the points by their x dimension and take the first and last as the min max in that dimension and then repeat the process in the y dimension to get that min max

5718629
min	max
this wont give you the tightest fit on the set of rectangles because it won t ensure that one side of the rectangle is collinear with at least 2 of the points for that you will need the rotating calipers algorithm that bart kiers suggestes but it is a much faster algorithm since the rotating calipers does esentially the same as i have described here but then rotates the rectangle until one of it s edges lines up with 2 of the min max points

5718675
hash	md5
i would have guessed that ci would have implemented it better include the md5 hash to cover both the sessionid+timestamp when encoding them in the session record

5718681
spweb	spsite
you need to delete the spsite spweb instance if it is a new object

5718719

5718886
ostream	istream
i have this code in my header file and ive got loads of errors on the ostream and istream lines

5718887
accessor	ivar
as mentioned this is setting the ivar to be separate from the accessor

5718887
ivar	subclassing
the usual reason for separating the ivar and the property is to prevent collision in a subclassing

5718887
superclass	subclassing
this way subclassing can create a variable named window without colliding with the superclass window since it is actually _window

5718888
post	get
how do i get the file and post it to a php script using jquery

5718888
post	get
can i just use .val to get the value and then post this

5718918
std	ostream	ostream	istream
note all the standard types like istream ostream live within a namespace called std

5718930
ostream	istream
it s not clear to me the context this code appears in but the error suggests that these declarations appear before ostream and istream are defined

5718938
width	height
thanks it helped a bit...however i still missed some other properties as grid thickness but i solved it by inserting a row column with 1px height width to double the gridline and the qtablewidgetitem setbackgroundcolor was also helpful

5718947
width	height
rather than setting each image height and width i did so through css

5718947
width	height
since my width was a fixed width i set that but set the height to 100

5718947
width	height
this caused the box to not expand to fit the height and width of the images within

5718947
width	height
i imagine setting the width and height the box holding the images was sized right off the bat

5718950
pop-up	dialog
pop-up an alert dialog with 3

5718969
for-loop	loops
to use a while loops instead of a for-loop note that as a looping construct while is an alternative to for rather than to if it is necessary to step through the iterator manually

5718987
mouseover	mouseout
mouseover and mouseout fire every time the mouse cursor hovers over another element or no longer has a direct line of sight to the element for which it fires

5718987
mouseleave	mouseenter
mouseenter and mouseleave on the other hand fire whenever the mouseleave the bounding box of the element

5718987
mouseout	mouseleave
try using mouseleave instead of mouseout

5719010
hide	show
in that slot create your new window and show it then hide the main window

5719013
portrait	landscape
regardless of all this i would suggest either allowing both portrait and landscape for both or only allowing portrait

5719072
post	get
i also tried changing the type to get instead of post but to no avail

5719085
post	get
android allows you to sent data in get and post method.

5719095
post	get
right now it looks like this is the only way in which i can get the json document to appear in the result of the post request the result variable

5719164
width	height
user can give id width height and description rectangle and then i write it to a file

5719187
opera	safari
safari and opera as well as non-windows clients i m not sure any more

the closest that an asmx service will get to rest is that it can be configured to permit a get or post request in which case it will return plain xml with no soap envelope

5719366
google-chrome	safari
i am using font-face to embed some fonts and everything works just fine on google-chrome safari etc

5719385
uiview	subviews
i thought it would be by just adding a uiview subviews underneath the uitableview which would then expose it when the tableview is dragged too far but this didn t work

5719436
mouseover	mouseout
if you want to do something different after hovering try binding to both mouseover and mouseout

5719465

the animation worked fine in google-chrome 10 and firefox 4

5719595
for-loop	arrays
if you re going to have a particularly large form you may want to look at using arrays and a for-loop

5719607
client-side	server-side
the server-side control is rendered using a combination of client-side javascript code and html

5719612
post	get
you can read more about http get vs post here

5719630
post	get
checkout this post about fft for iphone which mentions various options including the possibility of using apple s accelerate framework in which you will need to drop to c to apparently get apple-written fft functions

folder	directory
i m also not sure why it s calling the epd64.framework directory -- the module folder and contents are actually contained in library frameworks python.framework ... site-packages

5719752
google-chrome	firefox
this works on all browsers to expand the div vertically and also displays the horizonal width correctly on firefox google-chrome and ie7 8

5719773

try doing a or the same for just your get and post

5719836

also i d like to download the project into the workspace directory and then currently it makes a bunch of folder based on on the server

5719920
stdout	stderr
all its standard io stdin stdout stderr operations will be redirected to the parent process through three streams getoutputstream getinputstream geterrorstream

5719921
keydown	keyup
i also get repeated key events for normal keys in keydown and keyup without difficulty

5719952
post	get
everything works fine when the user clicks the button but when the hit enter it seems the form is trying to submit through the html not through the jquery and you get taken to where the form should post

5719978
post	get
second you need to be able to go to your script and using a certain method like get post variables rest soap etc be able to call your function

5719999
textview	imageview
in my listview each item consists of imageview and textview

5720045
cvs	svn
those icons are typically used for version control like cvs or svn

5720057
put	get
this works fine normally but when i put the code in a function and call it i get the following error

5720100
superclass	subclassing
after some debugging i determined that the classify call is returning widgets bugs or sprockets bugs so when i call all on it it appears to be running against the superclass instead of running against the subclassing

5720146
width	height
there s nothing in my as3 code that modifies the scaling width or height of any of those fields

5720179
implements	extends
for most of the clojure constructs that allow you to implements interfaces or extends classes the sanest way - especially if you don t own the class - is to use closures to capture state

5720202
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
if it s a very deep inner loops however and you need to squeak out every last nanosecond my experience has been that with release build code a for-loop indexing over an arrays is measurably faster than a foreach loops with a slightly smaller performance loss for using delegates with linq vs

5720256
post	put
post with http put rails will expect a post object to edit thats why you see only post in the url underline it goes as a put request

5720461
rss	feed
think of taking an rss feed and only keeping track of the article dates and nothing else

5720471
post	get
i have tried the suggestions in this post but i can not get windows authentication working with iis express in vision studio 2010

5720507
post	get
is there a way i can add a new page that can be invoked via http get or post so that i can do some things i would normally do in a controller without actually making a new action etc

serializable	deserialization
i decorate the method in the interface with this attributes and i need the type information in order to perform serializable and deserialization on the incoming and outcoming messages

5720548
hide	show
so if you have a gif show once the image has loaded it will hide it

5720551
for-loop	arrays
so i need to use expressions and a for-loop for filling the arrays but since this is my first c# project that is a bridge too far for me

5720566
folder	directory
keep in mind that aspx files or razor files that are just asp.net pages should not be in the views folder as mvc apps are configured to refuse serving up files in that directory

5720568
objectoutputstream	printwriter
i couldn t find any mentions of this in the printwriter or objectoutputstream documentation

5720598
nexus	artifactory
i would add a maven repository to your environment such as artifactory archiva or nexus and deploy to that using ivy

5720598
jar	war
if it s a war i would use cargo but if it s a jar it really depends on what s executing the jar - you might need some sort of file copy scp etc

5720615
uitableview	nsindexpath

5720641
entity-relationship	diagram
as i mapped it out the entity-relationship diagram became a bit overwhelming

5720655
inherited	properties
my first thought was to create a base class that inherited from webcontrol and implements the new properties and methods but without multiple iheritance that would mean an inability to also derive from say textbox

5720664
uilabel	nsstring
data dynamic variable data that is converted into a nsstring type within a background thread displayed within a uilabel or nslabel on the main thread

5720676

5720676
decoder	encoder
if the output of the encoder is streamed one code at a time to the decoder then the decoder can work with each code as it receives them

5720676
decoder	encoder
but if the encoder writes all the codes to a file the compressed file and then later that file is fed into the decoder then how does the decoder know where one code starts and another one begins

5720682
getter	setter
without manually defining getter and setter or using property other objects can t see or change the ivars

5720706
freemarker	velocity
can anybody let me know how to generate the templates using velocity or freemarker and then include templates in e-mail body as html content

5720737
put	get
however when i hit my action with a parameter that i would expect to be put into the map i get the following error

5720778
hide	show
this would allow you to find the total number using php and you wouldn t need to make the third query if you simply output the contents of all the comments to the page using css to hide those that you don t want initially show and javascript to show them when the user clicks the view all link

5720800
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
wrapping the i o streams with objectinputstream objectoutputstream would again end up blocking things

5720845
post	get
ultimately the best fastest way to get the comments count is to store them within the news post table your almost caching the count query to the comments column

setinterval	settimeout
never use a string as the first setinterval settimeout argument

from gmaps4rails setting map width and height

5721007
setinterval	settimeout
to set up a poll on a fixed interval use setinterval or settimeout

5721037
for-loop	loops
however i am not aware of the best way to loops over this correctly so for me i might just load the product in the for-loop and not set the attribute to select all

5721169
width	height
then call your method myfunction string height string width string description

5721173

basiceffect has getter and setter for the world view and projection matrices but the shader itself keeps a single worldviewproj matrix which is why fails

5721288
versioning	upgrade
to detect a versioning upgrade store a copy of your versioncode in a preference

5721325

in fact this is the only hide show thing that is handled correctly by that piece of borland crap

5721607
client-side	server-side	peer	p2p
another problem with this is that bouncycastle provides a light weight client-side tls api but because this software is p2p a server-side api is also necessary so that i can use tls by making it believe that the peer originating the connection is the client

5721635
hide	show
i want to be able to hide and show categories on a stacked column chart

sorting	filtering
one other idea is to use sqllite and let it manage storing sorting and filtering your data

5726588
getter	setter
in the parentpage i have a field iscancelbuttonclicked and its getter and setter

5726589
width	height
use relative values where is the top left corner of the image and the bottom right corner width and height similarily representing a fraction of the image size

5726657
portrait	landscape
when the layout changes from portrait to landscape or vice versa how can i detect when the orientation change event finished

5726683
inherited	properties
the idea behind this is to construct entities that will inherited from item with additional properties set

5726753
ppl	tbb
note that i answered a similar question with a performance slant on the msdn forums for the ppl and remember that syntax and semantics of task_group structured_task_group parallel_invoke and parallel_for parallel_for_each are consistent between the ppl and tbb

5726776
portrait	landscape
note with android 3.2 api level 13 or higher the screen size also changes when the device switches between portrait and landscape orientation

5726864
put	get
they get disfigured and its a mess.also i have put up a bitmap image on the background.upon moving the calculator the background image also

5726874
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it s working in google-chrome and safari but not opera or firefox haven t even attempted ie yet

5726887
portrait	landscape
for landscape and portrait mode you can use different xmls incase u need to display your screen according to the orientations

5726910
post	get
i tried to get him to post it himself

5726929
gilead	dozer
pure dtos dtos with dozer and gilead use are described in details here

5726956
google-chrome	safari
but when i tested the same on google-chrome safari

5726956
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
and when i created the css for google-chrome its working on safari but not on mozilla firefox

5726967
children	parent
so i managed this by introducing a relationshipbuilder class which i used to keep track of the parent and children of a relationship without actually creating it

5726988
ubuntu	debian
emacs 23 running on various environments including debian and ubuntu

5727006
bonjour	avahi
it worked fine when we installed bonjour service on our machines and avahi on linux machines add .local partionname they will work only in same subnet address else it wont

5727019
innodb	myisam
myisam keeps track of the row count while innodb counts

5727026
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
tested in opera google-chrome safari firefox ie5.5 epic script fail ie6 ie7 ie8 ie9

5727044
hide	show
first i hide the tab bar then i show the translucent action sheet and immediatley after that show the tab bar

5727100
mouseleave	mouseenter
normally mouseenter and mouseleave events are microsoft based events jquery make them useable in all browsers using other function to create this effect.

5727100
mouseleave	mouseenter
so check jquery source and see how mouseenter and mouseleave works

5727100
mouseleave	mouseenter
as i said before it is not the basic function that only runs on ie but a simulation that acts just like mouseenter and mouseleave events by using other javascript functions.

5727103
ienumerable	iqueryable
can the following loop be implemented using iqueryable ienumerable or lambda expressions with linq

5727108
button	marquee
that said everything else about the dialog works including moving it clicking on my close button and drawing the marquee thing inside the listbox with the mouse

5727189
width	height
try setting the horizontalalignment and verticalalignment of the stackpanel to stretch and ensure that the stackpanel doesn t have explicit width and height set

5727233
sorting	filtering
does she need only filtering or also sorting

5727240
width	height
you can add or remove classes or recalculate height width with javascript on stop event

5727277
config	ini
the saved form should be textual data like the above to be usable in normal config files like ini or the registry

5727277
qsettings	qdatastream
hmm i looked at the qsettings source code and it just has hard-coded handling for some common types and then used qdatastream for the rest

5727281
ironruby	ironpython
like ironruby ironpython

5727281
ironruby	ironpython
yes at least you can with ironruby ironpython

5727297
hide	show
it will also hide show members or classes based on inheritance hierarchy

5727323
tabcontrol	tabitem
in my application i have used wpf tabcontrol i want to handle click event of the tabitem

5727349
google-chrome	firefox
requires special handling rather than having it just work as it does in firefox and google-chrome

5727351
google-chrome	firefox
the application is working fine in both firefox and google-chrome

5727381
qiodevice	qdatastream
the qdatastream class provides serialization of binary data to a qiodevice

5727381
serializable	deserialization
which will be responsible for serializable and deserialization of data

5727430
width	height
when i use above code the cardwrapper has height 0 and width 0

5727430
width	height
i can only see the home page when i set height width of cardwrapper to some value

5727474
opera	firefox
this works fine in ie8 firefox all versions as far as i can test opera etc but doesn t work in ie7 or previous

5727495
actionscript	mxml
i am using flex 4.1 actionscript not mxml

5727568
int	double
while using exponential operator in c# the compiler was reporting operator cannot be applied to operands of type int and double

5727609
mongodb	bson
maybe i don t understand your question directly but mongodb already stores everything using bson

5727717
inherited	properties
but when looking at inherited xml attributes from class android.view.view the properties android scalex android scaley are still available

5727754
accessor	properties
this protocol provides a mechanism to set values of object properties based on the names of the properties represented as nsstring s rather than calling the accessor directly

5727754
accessor	properties
in order for it to work you need to have defined your objects with accessor that follow the naming conventions easy enough using properties

5727761
uinavigationbar	uisegmentedcontrol
and that view got a uisegmentedcontrol right on uinavigationbar

5727787
wincrypt	cryptoapi
i have signed a data in windows using wincrypt cryptoapi pkcs_7_asn_encoding | x509_asn_encoding and in linux i have x509 certificate and the signed message which i have to verify

5727871
ubuntu	linux
for example the following code produces a linker error on windows compiled both with vs2010 and gcc but compiles successfully on linux ubuntu gcc

5727878
int	boolean
or use the color int rgba boolean hasalpha constructor for convenience at the cost of performance

5727906
mouseover	mouseleave	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseout	mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseleave	mouseout	mouseenter
for a javascript solution you were close but typically you d use mouseover and mouseout or use mouseenter and mouseleave but not mouseover and mouseleave not usually

5727906
mouseover	mouseout
in this case i d probably use mouseover and mouseout but only act on events actually triggered by the element in question not bubbled ones

5727925
width	height
i have a problem regarding jfreechart.createbufferedimage width height info

5727925
width	height
i am creating a jfreechart in java and showing it in jsf page like this jfreechart.createbufferedimage width height info

5727925
width	height
right now i am passing width and height as hardcoded attributes

5727925
width	height
but i want the width and height should dynamically set accoding the cleint screen resolution in jsf page

5727936
hash	md5
if you really want to do something simple then assuming you ve got a record of the api keys you ve handed out i would write the client script so that it makes an md5 hash of the key with another bit of information on the form - a username for example lets call the hash string the request key and the username the username and i d include an identifier for the partner which we ll call partner_id

5727939
google-chrome	firefox
however when we run this in our client test environment which is identical to our local env. it works perfectly for firefox but not for google-chrome and ie

5727939
google-chrome	firefox
never reaches google-chrome or ie but it does for firefox

5728082
portrait	landscape
result is retained but landscape xml is not used instead portrait xml is used for both orientations

5728090
next	except
this works fine except that when the user selects a row it does not highlight - it only highlights when the user lifts off their finger so you briefly see it highlight before transitioning to the next view

5728158
g++	gcc
so as long as you target the same instruction set object file format and use the standard c++ abi which is now the default in gcc g++ you should be ok assuming of course that the standard c++ abi is actually standard and properly implemented by most modern c++ compilers that run on linux which seems to be the platform you re targeting

5728166
onclick	onchange
i process event onchange for input text and onclick for button

5728166
onclick	onchange
i would like onclick to be processed after onchange completed

5728166
onclick	onchange
and as a result onclick is processed not every time after onchange

5728200
ivar	subclassing
the way to fix this is that you need to remove the bodies when their corresponding sprites are removed from their cclayer by either subclassing ccsprite to add an ivar that points to b2body or by wrapping both objects i.e sprite and body in another class

5728273
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
in ie safari google-chrome it works without problems but in firefox it shows only the html5-player with a x in the middle

5728300
folder	directory
i ve set the bugtraq prop-set properties on files and directory including the root svn repository folder but they aren t automatically added for new project check-ins commits

5728374
versioning	upgrade
1.348 cause we have that versioning running on another machine i then got the option to install as windows service which i did and then i upgrade to newest versioning my case 1.398

5728437
opera	firefox
for firefox and opera you need theora+vorbis+ogg - though with the newest versions of these browsers webm is working as well

5728437
mp4	webm
basically you will always need mp4 + ogv + webm to make your videos work on all plattforms

5728441
post	get
when i m trying to use post to get the auth token from the ac2dm service i only get the sid and lsid not the auth has this happened to anyone else if yes how did you solve this

5728448
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
navigationcontroller is the instance of your uinavigationcontroller which is used by all the controller in your navigation stack uiviewcontroller

5728454
audiotrack	audiorecord
i m using audiorecord and audiotrack classes for record and playback respectively

5728460
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in firefox ie 6 7 8 9 but not in google-chrome

5728534
super	implements
super k which means some unknown type that s a base type of k super class of or interface implements by

5728610
put	get
if i create a component helloworld i can put it on main if i create a component mycomponent and do the same i get this error

5728630
post	get
basically i m trying to see if there is an option to choose get or post while calling sendredirect

5728644
uiview	subviews
in my uiview i added uiscrollview as subviews and in uiscrollview i added uibuttons

5728667
voip	rtp	voip	sip	rtp	sip
i would like to initiate a jingle rtp and or sip rtp call from to the public voip network

5728667
voip	xmpp
it would be nice like the xmpp gateway to use my native voip desk-phone or soft-phone talking with my facebook frinds

5728785
ggplot2	lattice
i have tried using ggplot2 and lattice graphics but haven t found anything that suits my needs

5728836
jar	war
hi i tried to develop an application using ipc in websphereportal using two different war files.am trying to transfer one bean object for that i have placed one jar file in .. websphereportal portalserver shared app

5728842
post	get
is it possible to send a value from a column in the grid to the controller via either get or post

5728908
int	double
nstimeinterval is a double not an int

5728936
width	height
based on your most recent answer i take it you don t need the footer to be full width only sticky though yours isn t and also i presume you know that your version will only work if you know the height of the foo - not so important content as you need the that height to set the top co-ordinate for the sidebar

5728936
width	height
the footer s not full width but you can make it look like it is by putting a background image on the html element i have a plain dummy image in my fiddle but it s not showing up anyway you would make an image the same height color as the footer with the 1px border built in

5729010
post	get
i keep seeing weird behaviour in our logs where urls that should normally only be accessed via a post request are called via get

5729100
decimal	ieee
the third line displays the data with the maximum useful precision - an ieee 754 64bit floating-point number has slightly less than 16 decimal digits of precision so all those digits of the literal in math.h are pointless perhaps they can be seen as future-proofing against a possible future redefinition in a format with more precision

5729113
temp	tmp
one solution is to write to tmp linux or temp windows

5729150
hide	show
first of all you can set credentials in generator.yml to show hide links to actions and object actions based on credentials

5729168
postorder	inorder
i don t think there is an optimal filling order of a binary tree except something like a pre-order postorder inorder filling

5729193
move	drag
so if you click drag a corner the size changes accordingly and if you click drag inside the selection it should move the selection

5729212
int	chars
i think that you should use the getchars int int chars int

5729238
fancybox	colorbox
i would recommend either fancybox or colorbox

5729271
put	get
i somehow need to put kill-compilation into a ignore-errors with emacs 23.2 to get it to work when no process is running

5729317
post	get
right ok to update where i am i checked in firebug and on the external server and the reason why i m getting a 405 error is because i m doing a get rather than a post

5729333
getter	setter
in fact it is better if you use the getter and setter instead of array access on magento objects because it allows other developers to provide overrides in a conventional way

5729361
uicontrol	uibutton
if you re just trying to handle simple taps on the button i suggest you use - void addtarget id target action sel action forcontrolevents uicontrolevents controlevents for more info on it look into uicontrol of the uibutton otherwise my way would be to subclass the uiscrollview add a delegate for touches and pass them on to it but it s messy and i wouldn t use this unless extremely custom behavior is needed

5729383
put	get
if they are equal put it in the new tree and get the next values from both iterators

5729402
cakephp	yii	cakephp	kohana	kohana	yii
you could use frameworks like kohana zend cakephp yii which all uses this pattern

5729416
min	max
given a collection of mytype int index string name what would be the technically efficient way of getting min max index items

5729428
tunnel	vpn
the ways to make this harder go beyond wcf - access lists for ip addresses vpn tunnel etc

5729437
maven	pom.xml
is there a way to include another pom.xml or information in a maven pom.xml

5729453
width	height
sorry better take off both the width and height from the field

5729495
ssl	https
use an ssl certificate and send the login over https from your ajax form

5729505
int	chars
but remember every chars within source should be convertible to an int

5729506
prepare	execute
besides the advantage of escaping value when using bind value in pdo is there any difference in performance when using bind value with multiple values prepare the statement once but execute multiple time with different values instead of a single insert statement like

5729517
ssl	https
there is no reason to do any encryption in javascript or php as the appropriate solution is to use ssl https

5729528
many-to-many	one-to-many
do you mean a one-to-one one-to-many or many-to-many relationship between two objects

5729531
int	chars
if you subtract 0 from the chars it will give you the correct int

5729561
google-chrome	firefox
this link works great with google-chrome and firefox 4 bquadint drmonod

5729573
width	height
the device height and width need to be set you can use ipad specific styles to achieve this so that it doesn t break your other browsers

5729577
folder	directory
note that it uses os.makedirs instead of os.mkdir which means that it will also create the root folder if necessary as well as allowing the subfolder paths to contain intermediate-level directory if desired

5729591
width	height
s ellipse width 20 height 20 includein collapsed

5729591
width	height
s rect radiusx 10 radiusy 10 width 80 height 20 includein expanded

5729593
width	height
and i don t want to give fix width and height to any element

5729612
jar	manifest.mf
jar cvfm javaappdemo.jar manifest.mf c javasamples myapp

5729612
folder	directory
pls tell me i want to create a jar and i have to bundle the files in my project directory to that jar files when i extracted the jar i got my project folder but when i run my jar i got the above exception so i got confused where the loop hole is present

5729628
width	height
hi the easiest way and that s how i do it is to give maximum height width to the overlay

5729632
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome firefox will fill in these names so you won t need to parse it

5729638
activemq	rabbitmq
if you don t need synchronous calls then you can probably look at messaging -- jms activemq or rabbitmq

5729640
slideup	slidedown
note that when stopping the animation i had to explicitly clear the height because it could get left in an intermediate state by slideup slidedown

5729658
put	get
you can get the size of your videofile.if you want to put check according to the size that is possible or you can get the duration by using mpmovieplayer class but for that you have to get the full video file .i dont think so you want to do this so its gud if you can put a check according to the size

5729680
qgraphicsview	qwidget
i used qgraphicsview instead of qwidget which made the development much easier

5729680
qgraphicsview	qwidget
qgraphicsview already handles a lot of user interaction so i didn t have to bother with reimplementing qwidget mousemove events etc

5729680
qgraphicsview	qwidget
plus the performance was much faster than on qwidget because of qgraphicsview optimizations

5729694
jar	war
in maven project you can build jar automatically using maven war plugin by setting archiveclasses to true

5729742
width	height
my guess is the backgroundview gets strechted automatically but you could make sure the image isn t stretched on that view by setting a width and height

5729757
hash	md5
the idea is that an md5 hash of a string is normally shorter than the string itself and the index lookups on the hash are hence more efficient than those on the strings

5729758
folder	directory
i need to add as link a complete directory structure that lives under my solution folder but not under any project folder

5729770
maven	pom.xml
we have a large project consists of 300-500 modules which are organized by maven 3 i have divided it into 10 sub-projects so each sub-project have a root pom.xml

5729827
width	height
note width and height matters

5729844
dbcontext	objectcontext
the problem with dbcontext api is even worse because dbcontext api doesn t offer methods to change state of independent association so you must revert back to objectcontext api and use objectstatemanager.changerelationshipstate

5729844
many-to-many	one-to-many
any other solution is about loading the old object from db first and merge changes into attached object - that is what i do all the time and you will have to do it once you start to work with many-to-many relations or deleting in one-to-many relations

5729866
ubuntu	debian
i ve tried to install rails on ubuntu and debian 4 times each but i got all kind of errors you can imagine

5729966
hide	show
can you help me to hide the location service popup window at the time of application start in iphone and ipad.it will show only once for an application at the time of first deployment.i think it is the reason of alassetlibrary which i used for retrieving images from photo library

5730010
memcpy	malloc
is it possible to how do i check the device state eg between malloc memcpy and kernel launch to implement some machine-dynamic operations

5730028
folder	directory

5730034
put	get
if i understand correctly you would like to get for a particular article having as id articleid the list of all the tags not just those it has and put a checked to true if it does have it false otherwise

5730036
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
if i m not mistaken all of the browsers supporting text-shadow support css transitions in theirs most recent versions opera safari google-chrome firefox

5730040
google-chrome	safari
why is simple html css being read differently by the traditional browsers ie mozilla google-chrome and safari

5730091
hide	show
if you want to hide buttons you can use view.setvisibility and dynamically show and hide the buttons when your state changes when other buttons are pressed

5730094
nullreferenceexception	targetinvocationexception
to be clear the error is manifesting itself as an xamlparseexception which contains a targetinvocationexception which contains the nullreferenceexception

5730101
g++	gcc
why does this work when i compile that with gcc better say g++

5730129
parsley	robotlegs
you should read up on application frameworks as well like parsley robotlegs and swiz

5730157
addition	multiplication
as to the logic tends to be vaguely associated with multiplication and || with addition if you use zero and non-zero to represent false and true respectively the operators have equivalent semantics

5730162
associativity	operator-precedence
see operator-precedence and associativity

5730186
google-chrome	firefox
i can t speak for firefox but this is simply the way that xml is handled in google-chrome

5730197
cdr	cons
so in fact i think you want do1 to be myfunction cdr data cons car hello list1

5730235
carrierwave	paperclip
i would suggest using carrierwave or paperclip which simply store a reference to the file stored either locally or on something like amazon s3

5730245
versioning	upgrade
an alternative could be to keep propel but upgrade the versioning

5730267
width	height
in my monotouch app i call uiscreen.mainscreen.bounds to get the width height of the screen

5730267
width	height	portrait	landscape
when i first start the app in landscape mode the width is returned as 768 and the height 1024 ie portrait

3 when you synthesize properties use names for ivars that differs from names of properties so you will never miss calling of setter and getter methods

5730703

5735420
post	get
any performance differences will be insignificant as far as the server is concerned but browsers do not cache post requests and rightly so so therefore if you wanted to be able to allow the server to respond with 301 not modified if someone makes 2 subsequent calls to the same url then you need to use get

5735420

for sending it post or possibly put is correct

i say most likely because you get a 128-bit hash from md5 and the likelihood of a hash collision is on the order of 2 -128 about 10 -55

5736983
hash	md5
if you need smaller identifiers you can chop the result from md5 down to a smaller number of characters but you could potentially significantly increase the chance of a hash collision depending on which characters you take

why aren t they the same under the covers is there some difference in performance which i know that a c++ data structure is optimized for or why would the .net dictionary actually be a linked list under the covers and the c++ std map then a red-black tree which to my knowledge are completely different data structures used for entirely different purposes mostly

if a class has simply an empty constructor and a getter and setter for every variable then i think that is a lazy class

5746588

i mean variables such as systemroot or programfiles could get you to the appropriate folder and . would leave you in your current directory

5746719
put	get
just put it in a known subdirectory and manipulate __file__ with os.path to get the path to pass to subprocess

5746720
client-side	server-side
being a client-side script javascript gets run on the client s computer so if the file whose m-time you want to check is on the server then you are correct to use ajax and a server-side script

lisp	scheme
i don t know offhand what common lisp or scheme use

5746757
equals	gethashcode
note that my response to your other question mainly criticized the use of a thusly modified equals together with gethashcode for use in a hashtable - that just won t work which is a good example why it s problematic to override equals in a way that breaks its contract

5746773
folder	directory
most responses fall into seperate test projects within the project foler myproject and myproject unittest or a mirrored directory structure with a unittest top level folder

post	get
the server i have written can handle get and post methods

5746891
postgresql	mysql
also consider that if your main reason for using access is just so you can use access as a user-friendly gui tool for forms reporting you could still store the data in less restrictive database derby sqllite mysql postgresql ms sql server etc and then connect via odbc from access to the database. this would allow you to deploy your java application on linux your database wherever makes most sense and still use access to connect to the database from windows

5746910
apache	nginx
i would rather use apache for this site but i am fine with nginx

5746917
getter	setter
yeah as3 getter and setter are already flexible enough to make it easy to write difficult-to-follow code by making them unexpected side effects and this idea would just make it even more confusing

5746917
getter	setter
the whole point of a getter or setter is to provide a controlled public access point--there is no need to call a getter or setter from within the class that has access to the private members

5746920

my target is to simple post few data to next page located on other domain and get its xml response and parse it and display it

5747507
for-loop	loops
that means if you use it in the for-loop s condition then your for-loop would become an infinite loops because you re adding elements to it and so the vector s size would keep on increasing

post	get
you should never assume that information from get or post is properly escaped even if you do validation on your website javascript can be disabled and requests can be manually coded to do an sql injection attack

5748169
submit	submission
and while i can enable ajax validation support by including the microsoftxyz.js files they aren t tied into the submit button of the jquery dialog so being invalid doesn t prevent submission

abstract-class	base-class	abstract-class	abstract-base-class
whenever i am in a situation where i have a factory returning abstract-base-class implementations to a user based on some low-level type parameter such as a protocol or the format of an external resource i am always tempted to convert the abstract-class into a concrete class with an internal strategy factory so that users can just pass the implementation type to the constructor and work with the base-class directly

5748680
hide	show
then based on the class you can show and hide like this

the mytreeviewhelper class keeps track of the mouseenter mouseleave events and gives a nice property that can be used in triggers and things like the one above

5750676
int	double
in the code i would just store the cost of the item as a single value int or double

5750738
for-loop	arrays
i d suggest making a for-loop that adds the to the arrays instead of restricting it to just the last two elements

5750771
xlwt	xlutils
it s nothing to do with xlrd xlwt xlutils or eclipse

5750967
savefiledialog	openfiledialog
i have an application with an openfiledialog and a savefiledialog

5750967
savefiledialog	openfiledialog
however this directory is not environment.currentdirectory which is set to c users brian documents visual studio 2008 projects ifpm analysis ifpm analysis bin debug and is not changed by either the openfiledialog or savefiledialog

5750967
savefiledialog	openfiledialog
when i subsequently call the openfiledialog it defaults to the directory used by the savefiledialog

5750967
savefiledialog	openfiledialog
so my question is where is the directory that is being used by the openfiledialog and savefiledialog being stored

5750967
savefiledialog	openfiledialog
ideally i want to be able to store the directory selected by the user from the openfiledialog and reset it after i have used the savefiledialog

5750971
textview	imageview

5751001
profiling	instrumentation
most profiling use a process called instrumentation adding measuring code to gather data but some profiling can also use sampling polling data at specific intervals

5751009
ssl	https
hey i am in the middle of developing a ci app that is successfully running with https ssl

5751009
put	get
plus if you were to split content between ssl non-ssl you may notice that if you include non-ssl based content on an ssl page users will get a pesky message in their browser about insecure content etc which may put them off and create some needless doubt

5751053
oncreate	setcontentview
well i wouldn t call enablecompass on oncreate which is where i assume this code comes from given the setcontentview call

5751053
onresume	onpause
enable the compass in onresume and disable it in onpause so you don t keep the sensors alive when your activity is not on-screen

i am very new to javascript actually i know nothing at all about it if i could get a step by step instruction that would be awesome i have tried so of the other post codes but can not get it to work so i have no idea what i am doing wrong

5751153
stateless	stateful
for those requiring more information checkout stateful vs stateless beans

5751181
put	get
first thought was to use a list or dictionary to store the records in the distributed cache -- get the whole collection manipulate or search it in-memory locally put the whole collection back into the cache

5751185
sorting	filtering
i am displaying results from my database and am filtering and sorting them at the onchange event of a select input with js

5751264

i added a big for-loop inside the above loops to simulate a slower load and it still doesn t show the loading message until loops is done.

5751588
pull	push
your working copy of git uses this url when you do a push or pull

5751637
opensuse	linux	xen	raid
for example i designed a system last year implemented in php on 10 linux opensuse servers running about 25 xen virtual machines vms. some of the vm s were load balancers some were front end tiers some were middle tiers and some were back-end tiers some contained mysql databases and we had a couple of dedicated servers that were raid arrays for user file storage

5751637
postgresql	mysql
postgresql to mysql or vice versa

5751657
inherited	properties
looking at the code the current process forks and in this case the child inherited all of the relevant properties of the parent process since there are no timers signals or anything involved

5751666
hide	show
then you can show hide report tables based on what you have data for

5751669
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this happens in every browser i ve tested on from safari 5.1 google-chrome 10.x and firefox 4.0.1

5751684
profiling	instrumentation
the sampler instrumentation and the time profiling differ in the way they gather data

5751684
profiling	instrumentation
the time profiling instrumentation and the

5751684
profiler	shark
time profiler gathers backtrace data in the same manner as shark from

5751684
profiler	shark
note time profiler and shark can yield inaccurate backtrace data if the

5751684
profiling	instrumentation
in regards to profiling an opengl es application you ll want to look first at the various statistics that you can enable in the opengl es driver instrumentation

5751732

i am trying to draw a rectangle shape in xna using spritebatch

5751733
min	max
what exactly are the min and max prefixes in css

5751744
google-chrome	firefox
update 2 i am so surprised that in firefox or google-chrome defining the click handler actually works for pressing enter with nothing entered as well

5751744
google-chrome	firefox
so looks like firefox and google-chrome build that intelligence in

5751747
getter	setter
in fact if you set a breakpoint in the getter or setter of the customnestedvalue property of the nestedusercontrol you ll find it will never hit when binding in xaml

5751758
matlab	s-function
if this doesn t work for yout the next easiest thing to do is to use either an s-function written in matlab or a matlab function block

5751788
filesystems	ntfs
the 5th byte should have the filesystems code which is 07 for ntfs

5751806
width	height
not 100 width height

5751808
client-side	server-side
edit now that i ve seen your example you have to realize that you re changing your paradigm from server-side to client-side programming language

5751817
hash	salt
is the idea of salting to do something like hash password + salt or hash password + salt

5751827
hash	salt
if you just concatenated the salt and the hash then an attacker can simply remove the salt and use a rainbow table

5751829
hash	salt
the salt should be part of the hash calculation

5751833
hash	salt
hash password + salt

5751833
hash	salt
if you concatenate the salt after the hashing the concatenation is easily reversible and doesn t add any difficulty in reversing the hash on the password with rainbow tables

5751833
hash	salt
that said some systems do both django stores salt hash salt+password in database

5751834
switching	screens
this is not the case with the embedded player controls but the user can easily switching between embedded and full screens modes so you can t really use this to maintain no status bar when the controls are shown

5751836
hash	salt
actually it s salt + hash salt+password salt is part of the hash computation - but you must also keep it in the clear

5751874
bmp	png
i almost forgot to mention it is possible for a jpeg or png file to be encoded as a bmp but this is not common

5751898
gif	png
png jpeg and gif are the supported formats

5751960
put	get
i am trying to put a structure named holder into the heap by using the following code but i get a segmentation fault when i try to use memcpy

5751971
width	height
to ensure that this works even if the image has been scaled it s svg right you would need to multiply the position to which you scroll by the ratio between the total width of the svg and the width of the dot drawing as set by the size graph attribute same thing for height

5751978
free	malloc
btw i always forget to mention that - when you allocate memory using malloc don t forget to free it later

5751981
vb6	vba
in vba or vb6 i do something like this

5752030
for-loop	arrays
the idea is to have one function that uses a for-loop on the arrays and calls that function in the params for every element in the arrays

5752062
nsmanagedobjectcontext	nsmanagedobjectmodel
you will create instances of nsmanagedobjectmodel nsmanagedobjectcontext and nspersistentstorecoordinator

5752084
profiling	debugging
create install the development profiling make sure you have the correct bundle and device list set and set code signing for debugging to use that profiling

5752103
free	malloc
plus you shouldn t be using malloc free at all and avoid using new delete where it s not necessary

5752104
free	malloc
in addition there s no requirement for a c++ implementation to even use the same memory areas for malloc and new so it may be that you re trying to free memory from a totally different arena something which will almost certainly be fatal

5752106
free	malloc
mixing new with free and malloc with delete could cause a catastrophic failure at runtime if the code was ported to a new machine a new compiler or even a new version of the same compiler

5752110
free	malloc
now if you allocate with malloc and free with delete the info delete expects won t be valid and you ll end up with a corrupted heap

5752122
inherited	properties
this is a properties of the form itself you ll need to set this on every form in your app unless you have some sort of inherited structure setup

5752130
stdout	stderr
i don t have a windows box to test this on but perhaps you could do something like making a tied handle which will print to both stdout and a log then redirecting stdout and stderr to it

5752142
ubuntu	debian
on ubuntu debian based distributions and you really want to use mysql

5752147
width	height
how can i calculate font width and height especially non-fixed width font with some bold italic style

5752158
updatepanel	scriptmanager
for every page that requires your scriptmanager such as using updatepanel control simply have that page inherit from scriptmanagerpagebase and you ll get that functionality only when you need it without having to duplicate code

5752171
children	parent
recursive step the immediate children of the current parent become the new current parent

5752172
post	put
with a little tweak you can use the class you linked in your first post put the throttle and reset in a static class

5752182
ant	maven
the exact name depends on whether you re using the command line ant or maven

5752205
prepare	execute
what i do now is prepare the update statement then loop through all the possibilities and execute each

5752218
move	drag
i want when treenode is adding to treeview the ui do not lock form can move by drag ...

5752226
pull	push
with ssis you can basically create packages that are scheduled to run at whatever interval you want and push the relevant data to the main server push not pull

5752230
multiplying	add
what you can do is left shift the hex-digit stored in a byte by 4 places alternatively multiplying my 16 and then add the 2nd byte which has the 2nd hex digit

5752237
pull	push
when i push via ssh to my repository the prime hub is successfully mounted and the pull command is executed

5752238
superclass	subclassing
if you want to access behaviour thatâ s specific to the subclassing and hasnâ t been defined by their common superclass you canâ t escape from doing some sort of checking

5752238
superclass	subclassing
polymorphism is usually related to behaviour defined in a superclass or interface that can be overridden by subclassing and the system knows which behaviour is appropriate according to the actual object type

5752312
post	get
isset to ensure the get post variables are set

5752324
int	chars
i want the database to get the int alone but if i give chars also it is getting entered

5752333
keydown	keyup
to summarize you ll want to either target the keydown or keyup event and check for the keycode property of the event object that is generated

5752364
int	chars
make sure the column in your sql table to store the contact number is an int and not a varchar chars

5752377
width	height
you can see this in the inspector timeline view most scroll events result in a repaint of window width x some small height but occasionally there will be a full-window repaint

5752408
qwindow	qwidget
i am implementing a popup window by inheriting qwidget with flags qt qpopup | qt qwindow

5752448
width	height
i tried giving width height and fill property but still getting the same result

5752461
google-chrome	firefox
content in firefox 17 disabled by default for google-chrome in firefox 20

5752464
getter	setter
but there can be other scenarios too where referring to your ivars as self.ivar instead of _ivar can be helpful such as when you are using custom setter getter instead of the default synthesized ones

5752472
autodesk	3ds
it also is the most powerful with complemented tools with superb autodesk 3ds max maya integration

5752586
free	malloc
even if new calls malloc to get its memory there may not be a 1 1 correspondence between the new delete and underlying malloc free behaviour

5752586
realloc	malloc	free	malloc	free	realloc
someone may overload new or link in a debug version of malloc realloc free either of which could break if you re not using the functions properly

5752586
free	malloc
not all heap implementations allow you to free a pointer that s been shifted from the value returned by malloc

5752649
put	get
it seems silly to use nsstringfromclass to put the class in the dictionary and then nsclassfromstring to get the class again

5752668
iwa	adfs
turns out the adfs website that performs authentication of users this website gets setup in iis during the installation of adfs v2.0 is by default configured for integrated windows authentication iwa

5752668
google-chrome	firefox
apparently most other browsers don t support epa yet which is why firefox google-chrome continually prompt for credentials in a loop

5752669
nstextfield	nstableview
i d then change the name to tableview with the intention of having the iboutlet be connected to an nstableview but i ll forget to change the nstextfield to nstableview

5752691
switching	screens
however when i switching it to landscape mode the pdf is too large and goes off of the right side of the screens

5752702
stdout	stderr
i want to start a child process and read its stderr but so far i can t read anything at all using subprocess.popen even stdout

5752702
stdout	stderr
i m trying to use subprocess.communicate to read from stdout and stderr

5752702
stdout	stderr
anyway how can i read stdout and stderr from a process started with subprocess.popen

5752715
qstatusbar	qdialog
you can add the resize grip by calling qdialog s or qstatusbar s function setsizegripenabled or directly in qtcreator form designer

5752715
qstatusbar	qdialog
i didn t use it myself but you can check the qt source code on git for qstatusbar or qdialog

5752734
vb.net	vb6
the style was common in vb6 with optional parameters but imho and according to microsoft in vb.net overloading is usually more elegant than optional parameters

5752736
stdout	stderr
you need to specify the stdout subprocess.pipe and stderr subprocess.pipe when you create your popen object

5752743
stdout	stderr
read data from stdout and stderr until end-of-file is reached

5752789
post	get
first of all if you re saving large data better to use post rather than get

5752827
macports	homebrew
but you can also use macports or homebrew or do it yourself

5752883
folder	directory
to check the folder directory has been created inside your application bundle .app right click on your .app file and select show package contents

5752883
folder	directory
now check if folder directory appears in your .app file

5752883
folder	directory
as a side note an easier way to add a folder directory to your .app bundle is to add folder instead of group in your xcode project

5752883
folder	directory
as a result you ll see a blue group folder instead of the usual yellow group folder for your html directory in your xcode project and building the .app will create html folder inside your .app bundle

5752898
portrait	landscape
but it thinks it has for example if i use this when in portrait mode then the whole view is too short if i then rotate it to landscape the height is made even shorter

5752906
for-loop	arrays
i always assumed caching the length of an arrays in javascript is a good idea especially in the condition of a for-loop because of the expensiveness of calculating the length of an arrays

5752968
glassfish	weblogic
in order to reduce reload times should i move to a more advanced web container like glassfish sorry i can t afford a weblogic or websphere here. or anything

5752969
onclick	preventdefault
preventdefault is not working on div onclick i tried preventdefault and stopimmediatepropagation also nothing works please see the below sample

5752984
cldc	midp
i think you should be more specific what device are you aiming at and what java me cldc midp versions or specifications are you using

5752991
google-chrome	firefox
well i would have said it was expensive but then i wrote a little test jsperf.com and to my surprise using actually was faster in google-chrome and in firefox 4 it didn t matter

5753018
subtract	add
allowed moves add or subtract 1 from any of the 4 digits in any order you cannot add to 9 or subtract from 0

5753018
subtract	add
you cannot add or subtract from the same digit twice to get from 1000 to 3000 you cannot do 2000 - 3000 as youâ ll be adding 1 twice to the first digit

5753045
ant	maven
ant task is suitable to be used within automatic building or continuous integration system like maven or jenkins

5753067
inherited	properties
my thought is to inherited from print class and allow additional string properties which would hold the tranlation and alow to create print class from it in the background i heard that automapper library might be helpful with this

5753084
toolbar	tabs
when browsing the add-ons manager about addons in firefox 4 the toolbar and urlbar are hidden when tabs on top has been set

5753084
hide	show
or whether it must hide and show the urlbar and toolbars in listener of window-mediator

5753091
firefox	safari
in safari and firefox the cached length was consistently about 2x faster than the non-cached version

5753094
vim	emacs
also php.net offers a the php manual as man pages installable via pear - it s awesome to integrate into emacs or vim

5753098
min	max
rather i want to a background service or whatever that continuously listening mic if it detects some voice then it should record it let say max length of recording is 1 min and on voice recording finishing either there is no input or 1 min recording completes then it should play it automatically

5753163
scheme	racket
there are many cross-platform scheme implementations namely racket formerly plt-scheme chicken gambit-c guile

5753163
scheme	racket
disadvantages are run-time type checking racket support compile-time weak standard r5rs as it does not include modules utf8 networking and so on and programmer usually have to stay with chosen scheme implementation forever

5753171
oncreate	setcontentview
oncreate method eg setcontentview r.layout.main

5753187
folder	directory
what i do in my application is that smtpclient delivers mails to a folder by using smtpclient.deliverymethod smtpdeliverymethod.specifiedpickupdirectory and setting the pickupdirectorylocation to the wanted directory

5753205
cobertura	checkstyle
setting up a pom.xml for generating reports cobertura findbugs checkstyle and surefire unit test results

5753246
uiview	subviews

i m using string unpack to unpack a bunch of int and double from a binary stream

5753609
int	chars
edit i haven t gone through the code you posted but i did notice an error on first glance fgetc returns an int not a chars as its name might lead you to believe

5753625
versioning	upgrade	draggable	droppable
however it still renders in ie9 mode and the ie9-incompatible javascripts a very old jquery versioning and a similarly old jquery ui draggable droppable versioning which i can t simply upgrade for reasons that do not matter here don t work

5753628
int	double
actually i plan use int double and two enum types as t

5753638
versioning	upgrade
yes exactly - you have the same product installed same upgrade code but from an earlier versioning

5753662
cos	sin
it should support + - sin cos

5753669
bufferedreader	fileinputstream
to read the file i use a bufferedreader in combination with an inputstreamreader and fileinputstream

5753806
autoresize	scrollbar
now what happend to me some times is that the autoresize from facebook doesnt work correctly on some browsers so it miscalculates the height and you still have a scrollbar on the right side so because of this scrollbar your content becomes too large and you also get an horizontal scrollbar

5753806
margin	height
here the height i choosed is 900 but you have to set your own height the height of your iframe content + some security margin like 50px or so

5753810
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
i changed from uiviewcontroller to uinavigationcontroller in the mainwindow.xib

5753838
int	chars
the second thing is what data type c use to store this symbolic constant which is not a chars enclosed in single quote nor an int or floating-point number

5753840
folder	directory
rmv also makes incredibly easy to remove a ruby version and all its data since it installs everything in a folder within your home directory

5753853
jar	war
say if you re developing a web service a web application consuming that service and a library that both the service and the webapp uses then with a single and not even long or difficult ant file you can build them create the aar war and jar files and deploy them all in their correct places eg

5753859
super	self
ther are only six keywords that are reserved in smalltalk true false nil self super and thiscontext

5753865
bufferedreader	fileinputstream
note that the position of the fileinputstream is going to be a multiple of 8192 because the bufferedreader is using a buffer of that size

5753880
put	get
for my project the get data is dynamic so i can t just put a set url in the php proxy and i dont understand php well enough to figure out how to get the get data into the proxy url.

5753889
powerpc	i386
--arch choose a specific architecture from a universal binary powerpc ppc64 i386 x86_64

5753912
google-chrome	firefox
firefox google-chrome etc have no problems

5768220
matlabpool	parfor
after that there s really not much redundancy left in what that code does so your only room left for improvement is to parallelize it if you have the parallel computing toolbox convert your outer loop to a parfor and before you run it say matlabpool n where n is the number of threads to use

the statement in question thus is invalid per the above restriction though in fact it is not ambiguous by productions of the grammar as it omits the function identifier it cannot be a functiondeclaration

5770489
jar	manifest.mf
as a sub-option if it s really just for you you can make a jar with a meta-inf manifest.mf containing a class path with absolute pathnames.

5770604
mouseleave	mouseenter
what ive learned from researching jquery is that hover is a function to facilitate mouseenter and mouseleave

return-value-optimization	nrvo
this optimization is typically called nrvo named return-value-optimization and it is slightly less common for compilers to implement it

5770757
return-value-optimization	nrvo
msvc always implements return-value-optimization and performs nrvo in release builds

5770757
return-value-optimization	nrvo
i believe recent versions of gcc always perform both return-value-optimization and nrvo

5770763
return-value-optimization	nrvo
of course the compiler could easily apply return-value-optimization nrvo here anyway because it can statically determine that you never call the function with nullptr and in addition the function could be trivially transformed so that return-value-optimization nrvo can be applied even if that couldn t be proven and finally that doesn t even prevent return-value-optimization nrvo as the result can still be constructed in

5770974
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
it s safe to use inherited when both subclassing and superclass are in the control of the same programmer but implementation inherited can lead to a fragile api

5770974
superclass	subclassing
as you mentioned if superclass implementation changes then subclassing can break or more worst - will do unintended things silently

5770977
google-chrome	firefox
this footer stays put in google-chrome how can i rewrite the html or css to make it stay the same in firefox

mouse	keyboard
it provides the basic framework for building gui environments drawing and moving windows on the screen and interacting with a mouse and keyboard

5771121
many-to-many	one-to-many

5771257
put	get
my problem is also i didn t get how i can access to data like this for every view this should be a main menu so i should use this in every view but if i put it in default.ctp every model deosn t exist because i cannot access it from a view

5771265

you can use the jquery fadein and fadeout to do it

5771335
oncreate	recreate
i mean situations when activity is not recreate and it s oncreate is not called

stdout	stderr
i need to be able to spawn child os processes write to the child s stdin read from both stdout and stderr send kill signals and get notified of exit codes

5771379
super	extends
however osgi and the hopefully forthcoming super packages attempt to extends this concept to classes in a some higher lever grouping of classes

5771487
hash	hmac
it is called hmac and involves two invocations of the underlying hash function but one of them is on a short input so this is efficient nonetheless

5771487
hash	hmac
security of hmac more precisely how hmac can be considered to behave as a random oracle can be proven reduced to some hash function internal properties which are believed true in the case of sha-256 see new proofs for nmac and hmac security without collision-resistance by mihir bellare for the gory details

5771501
iboutlet	ibaction
my view consists of simple button connected to and ibaction called buttonclicked and an uiimageview called qrimage and being set as iboutlet

i m sure that it is configurable to put recently commented post threads to the top

5771646
for-loop	arrays
i m not sure how to call it during the for-loop arrays

mp3	wav	mp3	ogg	wav	ogg
i tried different path relative absolute and formats mp3 wav ogg but nothing changed

5771664
width	height
although one benefit with using the bitmapfactory.options is that you can check for the width height of your bitmap without allocating memory for the actual bitmap s pixels

5771699
pull	push
however i would want to at some stage allow users the ability to push or pull nations cities from each other s database

5771763
client-side	server-side
i have not personally built anything where i ve used the same template server-side and client-side but here is one way that i can think to do this

5771802
yesod	hamlet
27 816 downloads hamlet -- yesod framework templating

5771820
width	height
you can calculate the aspect ratio by doing window width over height if you wish

5771847
awt	swing
quite likely the java application actually uses swing not awt

5771880
goto	break
putting an empty gamedata.dat file into that dir on my mac and running it on the simulator now finds a file run it on the simulator but a break point in there and look at the full path and goto that dir in a shell and try it

5771918
udp	tcp
i ve always wanted to learn tcp or udp i hear udp sucks though in c# but i can never find any tutorial that can teach it

5771962
google-chrome	firefox
if i d use a similar function to get style from firefox google-chrome and so on it would result

5771962
google-chrome	firefox
it would return backgroundcolor in firefox google-chrome

5771963
ready	each
i have a text input field which on dom ready i want to have pre-populated with some random text i dont want to have the same text each time i reload the page just a slight variation between the text would be fine

you should always use tcp until you have a performance problem that you know can be mitigated with udp

5771999
spaces	delimiter
obr.repository.url spaces delimiter list of urls

5772007
mouseup	mousedown
by using jquery mousedown and mouseup events calculate first clicked and last upped rectangle coordinates and highlight all rectangles between these two

5772024
allocator	stl
stl allocator

5772071
udp	tcp
they have a lot of tutorials with pretty good code samples about tcp udp communication among other things

5772075
put	get
but also you re trying to get array extra however you don t put it inside intent

5772096
udp	tcp
i think it s difficult to find tutorials for tcp and udp specifically because they are specific protocols although very frequently used and microsoft are trying to abstract all these concepts so that your application is not dependent of the underlying technology

5772144
udp	tcp
now tcp udp are fully separate items

5772144
udp	tcp
saying udp sucks would be quite ignorant towards a lot of programs i know that would never work with tcp and require the fast and easy data distribution of udp which contâ rary to tcp also supports multicast

5772193
int	chars
i would like to store 4 chars 4 bytes into an unsigned int

5772210
pascal	delphi
to obtain the proper long pascal string you need to recast the string to a pchar and let delphi convert it back again properly to a string

5772214
int	chars
you need to shift the bits of each chars over then or combine them into the int

5772245
nsdatecomponents	nscalendar
change the birthday to this year or next year if the birthday was already in this year and calculate with nsdatecomponents and nscalendar

5772299
folder	directory
if this file is directory in the htdocs folder you should be able to go to and get the php info page

5772306
implements	extends
why do we have two ways to create a thread in java - extends the thread class or implements the runnable interface

5772309
cvs	rcs
at a prior job i would guess around 500 devs we used because of the era rcs and cvs

5772309
cvs	svn	perforce	cvs	perforce	svn
at the company i m with now well in excess of 10000 devs but i doubt more then 1000 are on what most people would think of as a single project although they are that many on a single product we have used cvs for historical reasons svn because it was an easy migration path svk nice at the time but i wouldn t recommend it mercurial sorry no direct experience perforce ditto and git

5772309
cvs	rcs
unless you get warped into the past and trapped there i wouldn t recommend rcs or cvs

5772309
cvs	svn
svn is stable and mature and branching is way way way faster then cvs seconds not minutes for a large project

5772309
perforce	svn
my second hand info about perforce is it is kind of better then svn and kind of not

5772311
children	parent
i don t think there is directly method to get sibling but its not that hard to get index in list of children of parent and getting next item

5772323
int	double
get widened to int or double if the argument is a float first

5772354
hide	show
and they dont work when i use this jquery script to show hide the div

5772391
int	double
these conversions promote float to double and anything smaller than int to int or unsigned int

5772416
getter	setter
i found out why it didn t work all of my annotations extended a base annotation the base annotation then had a getter and a setter that failed when used in the proxy class

5772417
google-chrome	firefox
to take into account firefox webkit and google-chrome you d need to do something like this

5772419
getter	setter
and in asp.net i can simple run the linq to sql command on my database and get the whole schema of my class without typing out a custom class with getter and setter

5772456
preferenceactivity	preferencescreen
so the workaround recommends creating top level preferenceactivity for nested preferencescreen and then invoking this new activity via intent

5772459
git-rebase	amend
just mention edit in the commit list and you will be able to amend your commit and then issue a git-rebase --continue to go ahead

5772476
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
as i wrote in some of my last posts i am still quite new to the c# world so it comes that i wrote small benchmark to compare dictionary hashtable sortedlist and sorteddictionary against each other

5772480
getter	setter
i am not looking for alternatives to properties that require parenthesis to get or set the property such as overloaded methods separating the getter and setter

5772492

5772574
nexus	artifactory
download nexus for free from sonatype or artifactory or any of the other repository managers

5772594
ienumerable	ienumerator
i found that the delphi s declaration delphi 2010 of ienumerator and ienumerable are not using the stdcall calling convention so i declared them like this

5772594
ienumerable	ienumerator
the class implements ienumerable ienumerator and ienumvariant

5772609
nexus	artifactory
you can use a maven2 repository implementation such as nexus artifactory or archiva

5772696
serializable	deserialization
just generic serializable and deserialization

5772703
width	height
dr when an image takes up 100 width and height and the user resizes their browser down the width and the height of the document don t change because the image keeps it from shrinking

5772703
width	height
i have a dynamically drawn svg image created by raphaeljs that takes up 100 of the screen width and height

5772703
width	height
the space it takes up includes space that is not visible but can be seen by scrolling so it s not just viewport width and height it is possible for it to go beyond that

5772703
width	height
basically the getdocwidth and -height needs to ignore the dimensions of the image when it calculates the width and height of the document

5772804
put	get
but something goes wrong when i get this table into my app and put it in a datatable

5772882
git-rebase	undo
usually you would use git-rebase --abort but that does some extra resetting that you probably want to avoid it moves head back to the original branch and resets it back to the original commit which will undo some of the work we did above

5772885
int	chars
however in practice a comparison of a simple value type such as a chars int float etc is likely to be atomic

5772885
atomic	interlocked
if you want proper guarantees there are various interlocked functions on windows and the atomic builtins on gcc

5772903
hex	binary
to convert from binary to hex convert to decimal first and then that to hex

5772969
selecteditem	selectedindex
i ve constructed a simple example displaying how i would process the eventhandler function if i was going to use the selectedindex property however it s the tab that has mouse focus which may or may not be the selecteditem that i d like to reference and i haven t been able to figure out a way to do it

5772974
int	chars
i am trying to read 3 values from a file with a format as int chars whitespace int

5772982
express	node.js
for this app i m using node.js mongodb mongoose express

5773001
google-chrome	firefox
could some one tell me what i am doing wrong or is it a problem with google-chrome and firefox

5773015
punctuation	words
the default delimiter is the whitespace pattern so punctuation symbols will be included in the words

5773031
post	get
feel free to provide those tips here but my main intention for this post is to get it to work correctly

5773049
atoi	strtok
have a look at the man pages for strtok and atoi

5773067
metaclass	superclass
metaclass and its superclass if

5773093
width	height
or just use a div in the repeater and then solve the height width issues with css

folder	directory
the following command will update the french version mynib with the changes you ve made to the english version with the assumption that you ve in the directory that holds the lproj folder

5773131
fseek	fread
you can use fread to read bytes from the file and fseek to seek to a different position to throw away bytes

5773215
submit	submission
the form is submission these to iframe so the page is not refreshing after every submit

5773218
google-chrome	firefox
i have a client who needs the ability to preview content and form pages on the various os but in their desktop browser google-chrome firefox ie ugh

5773228
public	protected
then create fake stub subclass with public method that calls this factored out protected initialize

5773287
free	malloc
to have an allocation for a built-in array be portable between c and c++ you must use malloc and ensure that later you call free on everything you got from malloc which can sometimes be very hard to get right

5773348
int	chars
my next thought was to convert int and float to array of chars and the setvalue methods would add this array into stringbuilder

5773407
prepare	execute
in the end when you have the query built you make is of prepare and execute to run it

5773449
min	max
and since it s the max you want invert all mentions of min to max and decrease to increase when reading the article.

5773453
glfw	glew
the glew header defines all the magic necessary to disable the inclusion of most gl headers so including the glew header before the glfw one should work

5773468
google-chrome	safari
i tested it in safari and google-chrome on os x with the same result

5773538
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
in all the other browsers i ve tested firefox google-chrome ie 8 safari things are looking good

ubuntu	linux
target linux ubuntu 8.04.4 lts hardy

5773567
g++	gcc
i need gcc g++ and fortran

5773591
innodb	myisam
note this solution only works correctly if the tables used are innodb and not myisam

5773591
innodb	myisam
innodb uses primary key whereas myisam uses insertion order. in particular with myisam tables the two sets of ranks generated in the copy grandchild s section are not in-sync with each other

5773594
gridview	linqdatasource
use a gridview and the linqdatasource

5773600
post	get
in this case the response for resource1 which is a get request to page1.aspx is a form which has a post action to resource2 which is a post request to page2.aspx which responds with some data

5773681
consistency	acid
by duplicating data you run the risk of allowing inconsistent data to be in your database thus nullifying one of the core principles of relational databases consistency the c in acid a

put	get
then on whatever basis you want to get the value and put elsewhere do an evaluate of that source

5773799
setinterval	settimeout
can i avoid using setinterval settimeout or other functions in javascript

5773813
width	height
it does not matter what width and height i give it

5773817
put	get
if you can put some more details in your question i m sure you will get more detailed responses

5773825
profiling	instrumentation
maybe fire up instrumentation and look for some kind of timeline evidence with one of their profiling

5773851
for-loop	arrays
use a for-loop to go through the 2 arrays and add each element

5773874
jtextfield	jlabel	jtabbedpane	jtextfield	jtabbedpane	jlabel
right i have a jtabbedpane that has a jpanel that contains a jlabel and a jtextfield

5773874
jtextfield	jlabel
what i wanted was that i had the jlabel and next to it a full grown jtextfield on the left side not in the middle

5773893
for-loop	arrays
if you re attempting to add corresponding elements of each arrays to come with with a third arrays where x i y i + z i then you simply need a for-loop with the previous statement in it

5773923
scrypt	pbkdf2
hashing a username and password should always be done with an appropriate hashing algorithm like pbkdf2 bcrypt or scrypt

5773928
hash	salt
for user login i have stored salt password hash inside of mysql

5773956
jtextfield	jlabel
assuming the default jpanel layout flowlayout give the jtextfield a non-zero number of columns and give the jlabel a jlabel.left constraint

5773986
google-chrome	firefox
it currently works with firefox and google-chrome but has one enormous hiccup with internet explorer version 8

5773986
google-chrome	firefox
again it works great in firefox and google-chrome but in internet explorer it refuses to display the list items

5773993
try-catch	exception-handling
thus i was guessing while i m trying to fix bugs is there a way to catch all types of exception-handling in my entire activity lifecycle with one try-catch

5774002
google-chrome	firefox
due to time constraints we ve only tested on firefox and google-chrome

5774040
lotus	sametime
there are tools like ibm lotus notes ibm sametime bittorrent client vuze

to get comfortable with class based views i d start by subclassing django.views.generic.base.view which implements only a few methods namely attempting to call a function on the class based on the request method post get head - look at source

5774134
alarmmanager	wakelock
regarding the wakelock from the alarmmanager reference

gif	png	gif	bmp	gif	ico	bmp	png	png	ico
ico windows icon image format bmp jpeg wbmp gif and png

5774222
put	get
put everything inside your models.py file and get rid of the directory unless you have a good reason for having a models directory

5774259
folder	dir
what i saw is it created a folder .bundle in my home dir

5774296
serializable	deserialization
the names used to serializable the object s values with the serializationinfo.addvalue method which are stored in the output file so values can be used during deserialization with the same name

5774297
post	get
what rails gems are used for things like http requests get post and for connecting to a ftp server

5774339
ienumerable	ilist
can you return ienumerable a instead of ilist a

5774339
ienumerable	ilist
ienumerable a is covariant unlike ilist a

5774341
margin	height
you have a fixed height on .infohold so the .albumhold div will only add up to the height of .infohold 20px + .albumpic 110px plus any padding or margin which i haven t included there

5774395
floating-point	integer
if it is left as an integer the subsequent division will be either 0 or 1 on python 2.x so we need to convert it to get a floating-point output

5774419
post	get
our first problem is that we are trying to get it to post the elapsed time in hours

5774437
hide	show
the uiutils#showerror displays a joptionpane with a button that show hide the stack trace

5774464
rss	feed
i d use rss or json on the first site and make a feed of all the changes

5774470
nullpointerexception	runtimeexception
to catch nullpointerexception or any runtimeexception for that matter as well as your ioexceptionjust catch the most general exception type

5774521
try-catch	exception-handling
there is no try-catch statement in c but you can build an exception-handling mechanism using jump buffers

5774531
filesystems	fat
no lba 0 is not always cluster 2 it s filesystems specific in case of fat cluster 2 is the first available sector on the disk but not always lba 0 - see answer 5

5774531
filesystems	fat
interpretation of cluster number 0 and 1 are also filesystems specific in case of fat cluster number 0 represents an empty cluster in the file allocation table and cluster number 1 is reserved

5774547
prng	random
would it maybe be wise to use this somewhat dynamic memory usage as a seed for a prng to generate more quickly random numbers

5774557
floating-point	integer
i think this is because in python 2.x the division operator gives an integer result when dividing two integers while in python 3.x it gives a floating-point result in the same situation

5774580
jruby	rubinius
for example rubinius and jruby returned the same results when given

5774580
prng	random
random number generator so even when given the same prng seed it d

5774613
hash	md5
this little script scans the filepath of the current php script and creates one link per file in that directory to another php script that uses the file md5 hash value as a parameter

5774629
put	get
i presume that you want to get the information in the two tables call options and put options

5774636
integer	unsigned
is the first commandline arg and strtoul converts to an unsigned integer

5774707
integer	fractions
the fractions answer is correct but if you want to use integer texture coordinates for example in a vbo you can use the gl_texture matrix to change your texture coordinate system

5774708
textview	simpleadapter
so i m trying to retrieve data via different tags and insert them into different textview using simpleadapter

5774750
width	height
each section has a dimension width and height

5774758
integer	unsigned	integer	fractions
as long as scores never have a fractions part in which case you should probably be using an integer type such as unsigned long you won t notice the bug since a b â len a â len b

5774782
oncreate	onstart
how can i write my abstract class #2 to force my example class to override methods in android.app.activity like oncreate and onstart

5774792
uiapplication	uiwindow
off the top of my head you could subclass uiwindow or uiapplication and override and take action from there

5774794
post	get
yet on the windows machine in our lab i consistently get the heap corruption related error message from vs described in my referenced post

5774796
width	height
ads have a width and height but there s a 1 1 relationship so width and height are just fields in the ads table

5774796
width	height
sections also have a 1 1 relationship to width and height

5774819
dictionary	map
dictionary map so you may store any strongly typed array also while not having to worry about needing to convert one array to another now it s just type casting

5774843
oncreate	onstart
it s more elegant to create an interface with oncreate and onstart methods instead if you need force others to override in their implementation

5774870
oncreate	onstart
however you can create abstract functions myoncreate and myonstart and call those in your abstract class implementation of oncreate and onstart

5774870
oncreate	onstart
you might also want to make oncreate onstart final although it s difficult to see what the benefit is of forcing myoncreate instead of oncreate

5774879
folder	directory
so one thing you can do is dump your site into a sub directory in your views folder then create a master controller which does nothing but load full html pages

5774890
typedef	struct
fixing that is still an error because at the time of the struct definition the typedef hasn t taken effect

5774890
typedef	struct
or put the typedef first then define the again named struct

5775004
put	get
in the called activity you get the information you had put into the intent by either

5775004
put	get
getting a bundle from the intent via getextras and then getting everything put in using the various get methods on the bundle not the intent

5775081
maven	m2e
you should look at m2e plugin to work on maven projects in eclipse

5775081
maven	m2e
assuming you have installed this and m2e extras for wtp support import the project in eclipse as a maven project

5775085

for to work properly either medbaseid must be a struct or you have to define a field based equality on your class medbaseid by overriding equals and gethashcode

5778744
equals	gethashcode
did you override gethashcode and equals

5778747

realloc	malloc	free	malloc	free	realloc
my suggestion to you would be to find an appropriate malloc realloc free source code such that you can implement your own malloc_first alongside the others in the same source module and using the same memory structures which simply allocates and returns the first available block greater than or equal to a passed minimum_bytes parameter

5780003
queue	fifo

i was able to easily file documentation for doing this in a jar file using the maven-jar-plugin but that does not work on a war file

5780436
getter	setter
having magic handling like that can allow you to do some neat stuff like even making read only properties and can prevent you from bloating your class with a messy load of getter setter

5780457
getter	setter
in the tutorial you ve linked to the getter and setter get set up to automatically call the appropriate individual get set functions

5780472
getter	setter
if you make your own getter and setter you ll be making two functions for each property getpropname and setpropname

5780472
getter	setter
by using php s magic method setter getter you don t write individual methods for each property

5780472
getter	setter
i personally prefer to do as you do and write separate methods for each property that i need a complex getter setter

implements	extends
the best you can hope for here is that if your various kinds of model classes all implements the same interface or perhaps all extends from the same abstract parent class you can put the interface or abstract class name as the return type

5780659
implements	extends
however if your various concrete model classes do properly implements a top-level interface or extends from a common abstract parent class then using the interface abstract as the return type will allow for some level of autocomplete to work in the ide

the icons are aligned properly in google-chrome and safari but in ie and firefox they are not

5780924

in both google-chrome and firefox the dom produces either required as the attribute no value or empty value

5781355

quicksort	mergesort
among quicksort mergesort and binary insertion sort is there ever a situation to use any one of these over the other

5784610
quicksort	mergesort
i know things like quicksort can become problematic on an almost-sorted list but i believe the random assignment of the pivot can eliminate the worst case time so it may be better to use mergesort

5784610
quicksort	mergesort
mergesort may use more space than quicksort i m not entirely sure and merge may be better for linkedlists

int	chars
then since chars can actually be added together like int we look at the ascii table 0 is represented by value 48 1 is represented by 49 and so on

now i need both stderr and stdout

5784865
filtering	grouping
some other things in lucene apply to a field as a whole or index as a whole and you should know that they can t be really changed on a per-customer basis if you grouping indexes together things like omittf if you set it on a single document for a field its omitted across the board for that field similarity in any released version of lucene you can only set similarity across the board so customers wouldn t be able to tune the ranking model spellchecking you would have to hack something up where each customer has their own filtering spellcheck index .

5785324
profiler	yourkit
you should be using a profiler like yourkit or similar on your application as a whole

however i have both myisam and innodb tables on my server and there seems to be conflicting suggestions on how to do full backups in each case

5785434
innodb	myisam
if it were strictly innodb i could do mysqldump with --single-transaction but that option warns me that myisam may still be changed

5785434
innodb	myisam
2 is the only way to get a proper full backup with both myisam and innodb tables to use --lock-all tables

5785434
innodb	myisam
do a full dump of the slave while no changes are being made to it myisam or innodb

5785572
hash	md5
take the first 4 bytes of the md5 hash of the user s login name

5785572
hash	md5
take the first 4 bytes of the md5 hash of the user s login name

5785572
hash	md5
xor these together to produce the first 4 bytes of the md5 hash of the 14-digit binary string

5785572
hash	md5
there s a small chance that the first 4 bytes of the md5 hash of all those 14-digit binary strings will not be distinct

5785572
hash	salt	hash	md5	salt	md5
if you re concerned about savvy users being able to fake their own progress codes by undoing the xor of someone else s progress code and re- xor ing with the md5 hash of their own username you can always salt the usernames first by appending a fixed string known only to you to each username

5785576
int	double

the first pair is known as measured width and measured height

5786040
width	height
the second pair is simply known as width and height or sometimes drawing width and drawing height

5786040

width	height
if you specify only the width of the image the height will automatically be adjusted to keep the aspect ratio and vica-versa

5786248
width	height
so remove the css height declarations or the width declarations depending on what should determine the size

5786248
width	height
eg tall skinny windows should have the width as the deciding dimension and height should be used for wide short windows

5786248
width	height
i think i got the css syntax correct and the width height would have to be defined using css not attributes

5786250

i tried the sed version both on my mac laptop and my mac desktop and then i tried it on our solaris server and on our openbsd server

5794213
hash	md5
the two strings are base64 representations of a 128 bit value so it might be some sort of 128-bit hash of the input but it doesn t seem to be as simple as md5 of the input string

5794217
width	height
just copies and resamples the image1 into the first half width wise and then copies the second image into the second half width wise if you wanted to do it by stacking on height it would just be changing where the dest_h is

5794217

if they are laid horizontally then the width would be and the height would be and opposite if the images are stacked vertically

5794680

the actual class i want to deserialize to is exactly the same in each assembly version but on deserialization because the objects are serializable include the assembly name they came from the binaryformatter is complaining that it can t find the right assembly

5795113
width	height
in my box example you change the width and height of fillrect instead here you should just be changing the dw and dh values of drawimage

ps please do not use the reply space below to pontificate the advantages of stl boost

inline	inlining
this still confuses me because i don t see how a simple getter could be rationally not inline and performance is significantly better with them inline as my profiler clearly shows me but apparently the cli jit compiler is refusing to inline anything just because the method is already large playing around with slight variations showed me that this limit is a code size from idasm of 1500 above which no inlining is done even in the case of my getters which some testing showed add no additional code overhead to be inline

5812498
cpu	processors
in a 64-bit computer most recent amd and intel processors fall into this category the cpu is optimized to handle 64-bit values at a time

5812498
16-bit	64bit
conversely on a 64bit platform 16-bit integers would need to have 48 bits zeroed 32-bit integers would need to have 32 bits zeroed and 64bit integers could be operated on immediately

5812498
cpu	processors
each platform and cpu has a native bit-ness like 32 or 64 and this usually limits some of the other resources that can be accessed by that cpu for example the 3gb 4gb memory limitation of 32-bit processors

5812498
x86	64bit
the 80386 processor family and later x86 processors made 32-bit the norm but now companies like amd and then intel are currently making 64bit the norm

5812640
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
i have ascertained that one or more items is being shed from the main form s components while this loops is executing so eventually loops tries to access one past the end of the arrays once this has happened presumably it would be better to code this as a downto for-loop to prevent this

5812646
textview	imageview
in an activity i have three views among others a textview an imageview and a linearlayout--the latter i call controlsview

i am assuming you want to get the phone numbers from a form which contains a listview or gridview and write them to a file or some other control

5812888
for-loop	loops
the fix is to use a copy like greg says or you can fake a c-style for-loop with a counter and a while loops

5813001
verilog	hdl
code hdl in verilog

5813015
width	height
call the width and height of the input array w and h respectively

5813015
width	height
run this clever o wh algorithm for determining the largest rectangle but instead of tracking just the single largest rectangle for each x y location record in a w h matrix the width and height of one or all of the largest rectangles whose top-left corner is x y updating these values as you go

5813015
width	height
loop through this matrix adding each sufficiently-large rectangle in it to a max-heap ordered by area width height

5813015
width	height
with every entry read whose top-left corner is x y and which has width w and height h mark each of the w h locations included in the rectangle as used in a w h bit array

5813061

5813109
post	get
in insert.php you would get your post data

5813113
equals	gethashcode
also while i understand equals comparing references gethashcode returns different values for these two arrays also which i feel shouldn t happen since they have the same internal values

5813117
free	malloc
if you need a large array you should allocate it on the heap using malloc so that you can free it when you re done with it

5813128
children	parent
i m struggling with xpath that would return the parent node of the node with the iscurrent attribute along with its children

the first function will show the text on first click and the second function will hide the text on second click and so on.

5813280
free	malloc
however if you choose to use malloc to allocate a block of memory you must use free to deallocate it

5813280
free	malloc
using delete on a malloc d memory block or free on a new d memory block results in undefined behaviour

5813280
free	malloc
in fact some implementations of new and delete use malloc and free under the hood but that s compiler-dependent so don t ever do it

5813280
free	malloc
note that you can use malloc and free in the same program but that is not recommended because you could easily forget which one allocated a specific block of memory and use the wrong deallocation function on it

5813356
sorting	grouping
i feel that perhaps your problem is how to grouping or select on time + 1 hr rather than sorting

5813385
melt	reshape
you can do this by combining melt from reshape package upper.tri etc.

5813393
ready	each
try a social engineering approach to your managers desire to not use branches - use git with each feature done in it s own git clone and pushed into the release clone when it s ready

5813695
try-catch	exception-handling
a programmer is expected to check for these exception-handling by using the try-catch block or throw it back to the caller

5813695

5813747
width	height
i want to resize images but it should keep the height width ratio when doing the resizing

5813747
width	height
what i do is first i check whether which side width or height is the long

5813747
width	height
if the width is long i ll give 150 to the width s size and resize the height without affecting to the shape of the image and vise versa

5813747
width	height
in this case one side of width or height the image is 150 and other side is less than 150 vary from image to image

5813974
width	height
the tb_iframe is a parameter as well as width or height is so why you couldn t

5814086
lpwstr	bstr
i believe that the default marshaling chosen for strings is bstr and _tuchar should expand to wchar_t so i d guess that lpwstr is the correct marshalling method pointer to a wide character string

5814124
int	chars
it s casting the port pointer to a volatile unsigned chars 8 bit int

5814128
jquery	scriptaculous
i think this is what derek above was trying to say --- once you ve called .noconflict jquery releases the variable back into the open for scriptaculous to use for example

5814184
setinterval	settimeout
the second is the settimeout and setinterval functions available on the window object in a web browser

5814184

5814235
google-chrome	safari
i have same problems with google-chrome and safari

5814252
implements	extends
or make your loginthread extends thread instead of implements runnable

5814259
int	chars
the problem is that in c register originally meant storing values in a register which is why only int and chars can be used for it

5814272
atomic	interlocked
the atomic operation implementations differ depending on the specific target platform windows uses the win32 interlocked apis some platforms use various inline assembly etc

5814312

in my program i am spawn child processes by using fork and execv

5814318
put	get
or is it something specific to basic-apps that somehow didn t get put in

5814332
int	chars
so the chars will be converted to int which is 32

5814335
google-chrome	safari
to prove my point try actually going to google.com and opening up firebug or inspector if you re using safari or google-chrome and doing

5814350
queue	fifo
the only way to overcome this is to create a dual data structure which has all items in the dictionary mirrored in a queue for fifo or a stack for lifo

5814365
postgresql	mysql
i know with mysql and postgresql you have to modify config files to allow remote access is firebird the same

5814757
post	get
i have no problem to get login.html but i have a problem with post request on login.action

5814862
listview	gridview
if it s gridview or listview a lazy loading implementation will do the work

5814876
width	height
possibly that the image using the imageprovider doesn t declare its width and height correctly

5814876
width	height
column s get a bit funny with items that don t declare their width and height

5814876
width	height
try hard coding the width and height in your image in your second example and it should work

5814900
accessor	ivar	accessor	properties
it s just a bit of syntax that lets you specify the ivar that you want to use to back the properties for which you re telling the compiler to create accessor

5814900
accessor	properties
update as of the middle of 2013 llvm defaults to synthesizing accessor for properties so in most cases you no longer need to specify synthesize at all

5814905
rsa	aes
in both cases the plaintext has been encrypted using aes256 the only place rsa is actually used is to encrypt the key that has been used for the aes operation

5814970
children	parent
most nodes can be parent of children and children of other parent

upon first access to any property of the bitmapimage that serves as source the image is actually decoded and those properties are set to the final width and height of the decoded image so the image can be drawn

5815583
width	height
when you specify the size of an image with either width or height you should also set either decodepixelwidth or decodepixelheight to the same respective size

5815595
children	parent
attaching a click event to the children of an element when the parent already has a click event doesn t seem to work

5815595
google-chrome	firefox
as noted by kevin babcock the firstchild was indeed one of my problems the second problem was that the href attribute in ie is different from retrieving the href in firefox or google-chrome

5815675
udp	tcp
i thought tsunami is based on udp but still having some features like that of tcp tcp fairness friendlyness etc

5815688
oncreate	recreate	oncreate	ondestroy
the expected behaviour for an unhandled orientation change is to recreate the activity which means going through the entire activity lifecycle ondestroy oncreate and so forth - obviously the reason your label is being reset

5815688
portrait	landscape
one activity is locked to portrait as it makes no sense to view it in landscape by setting the screenorientation flag in the manifest

5815704
put	get
you could use a virtual module like this you can define your module somewhere put everything you want inside and every time you import it you ll get this virtual module and not the original one

i have experience with using mstest and nunit

5815939
nunit	mstest
from my experience mstest is much slower than nunit

5815939
nunit	mstest
note that i have run the mstest unit tests through the integrated vs gui which is probably why it s so slow compared to the light-weight nunit gui

5815939
nunit	mstest
mstest is missing a bunch of features that nunit has and nunit has been around longer is more mature

5815939
nunit	mstest
also bug fixes will arrive much faster with nunit than mstest how often are service packs released

md5 is a hash function -- it mixes input data in such a way that it should be unfeasible to do a number of things including recovering the input given the output it is not encryption there is no key and it is not meant to be inverted -- rather the opposite

however there are other hash functions which are as public as md5 is and for which no weakness is known yet the sha-2 family

5819470
hash	md5
on the other hand the case of md5 shows that apparently getting from known structural weaknesses to actual collisions to attacks takes a substantial amount of time weaknesses in 1996 collisions in 2004 applied collisions -- to a pair of x.509 certificates -- in 2008 so the current trend is to use algorithm agility when we use a hash function in a protocol we also think about how we could transition to another should the hash function prove to be weak

5822537
postgresql	mysql
if i have dbconn a database connection and i don t know if it s mysql mssql or postgresql can i tell what type of connection it is

5822556
crypt	salt
try using the php crypt function and use the database to to store the salt as well to follow up with what neal says make sure you try to use some obscurity to hide it as well...but you ll need the salt to compare the user input against later

5822590

you might want to use onchange instead of onclick onclick will probably be called before the value on the given checkbox is changed

5822657
int	chars	int	boolean
the reason std vector is nonconforming is that it pulls tricks under the covers in an attempt to optimize for space instead of storing a full chars or int for every bool taking up at least 8 times the space on platforms with 8-bit chars it packs the boolean and stores them as individual bits inside say chars in its internal representation

i have been trying to figure out a way to take the tomcat 5.5 stderr and stdout log files and roll them over when they get too large but i have been unable to do so

5822763
stdout	stderr
this is just the stdout and stderr logs that are automatically created by tomcat

5822763

5822852
for-loop	arrays
however i need to push 4 more records to the arrays which i can t do in this for-loop

free	malloc
otherwise you run the risk of using stdlib malloc in one place and then your own free in another leading to messy bugs

5822862

use post method in the form this is default in codeigniter - so action url will not be populated with the get string

5822867

the above code wont work because at first the element is empty and it moves to .show method.what i want to acheive is either on the oncomplete or onload how can i check using js jquery that the content or the element is loaded fully so that i can show if the content is loading and hide when the content is fully loaded

5822891
dlsym	dlopen
in linux for example in order for your functions to co-exist if you want to use system malloc in your own implementation of malloc you have to open the standard library manually using dlopen look up functions you need there using dlsym and call them later by address

5823409
put	get
i would just get list of all .txt files is directory using os.listdir then read and parse all of them and finally put all information in some database

5823411
distance	polygons
you could just add two more planes at your depth buffer distance and use those to further filter out visible polygons

5823441
put	get
why you put in is the same object that you get back out

5823496
error-handling	exception-handling
errors vs exception-handling â â methods are inconsistent in which they use thanks again to cof design and error-handling is half-baked

best practice code states that if the variable is not a static final then you should create getter setter inside the class

5823860
int	chars
int main int argc chars argv

5823869
udp	tcp
udp sockets are connectionless so there is no real sense of openness state attached to them - this is unlike tcp sockets where a socket may be in any number of connection states as determined by the exchange of packets up to a given point

5823894
uilabel	uibutton
each one of these subviews is composited of several different components several uilabel a uiimageview and some uibutton

5823912
postgresql	mysql
the problem is that i need to make the code work for mysql mssql postgresql oracle and sqlite

5823922
public	protected
you ll just probably prefer to use php5 specific syntax for your own application as you pointed out such as declaring methods classes as public protected private static etc.

5823984

client-side	server-side
you could do this server-side or since you are using html 5 and assuming you have the canvas available you could do this on the client-side

5824152
width	height
however this will make you have to have a static width height on theelement or it will change size when you change the text

5824155
icmp	tcp
regarding this async errors means if you send something and that send call results in an error occuring later when the tcp ip stack actually sends the packet or an icmp packet is later returned a subsequent send will return that error

5824155
icmp	udp
the linux udp 7 manpage suggest errors are returned whether the socket is connected or not but testing shows this is not the cases at least when a sent udp packet generates an icmp error

5824155
icmp	udp
if you connect your udp socket and send to a port noone is listening to an icmp packet is normally returned and a subsequent send call will fail with errno set to econnrefused

5824177
put	get
my initial thought is that there might be some way to put a buffer in front of the actual invokes to the ui thread to make sure that the gui does not get overloaded or when it does to back off the dispatches to it

5824201
implements	extends
implements a windowlistener or extends windowadapter use the windowclosing if errors in the process should prevent the window from closing or something like that or windowclosed method

5824209
post	get
wmi can be used to get the status of the web server see this post for an example

5824230

what i think is strange is that as soon as i remove the getter setter the application crashes on launch and spring complains about the missing setter getter which leads me to think that the xml-configuration is in fact correct

5824259
maven	pom.xml
the correct pom.xml file to do that is provided on some github project such as the maven guide fr

5824263

5824645
g++	gcc
when i had a bunch of files mixed c++ and c code i just compiled everything using gcc because g++ by default treats .c as being c++ code which breaks the build when the c code uses such things as new as identifiers

5824645
g++	gcc
g++ is a program that calls gcc and treats .c .h and .i files as c++ source files

5824673
g++	gcc
despite this gcc and g++ not interchangeable for c++ files

5824673
g++	gcc
gcc runs g++ with a few additional arguments that i can t remember off the top of my head

i would supply both the default and mouse-over values to the and use jquery hide and show to hide and reveal the value

5825396
virtualenv	setuptools
i think i always ended up solving it by indeed using a virtualenv or by accepting the fact that the global setuptools should be updated and doing that manually with something like sudo easy_install -u setuptools or maybe use distribute as package name

5825432
google-chrome	firefox
the above code works correctly in firefox and google-chrome but in ie8 causes it to make two requests to the server

usually one uses a lighter weight static server like nginx as the reverse proxy to apache running the app server

5825935
google-chrome	firefox
oh and firefox google-chrome work fine too did i even need to mention that

5825942
post	get
is it possible to post from a php file to a js to a php and get the results from the external php file to the js file that posted the information

5825963
multibyte	substr
you re using a multibyte character set and should use mb_substr or mysql s own substr function in your sql query

5825978
width	margin	width	height	margin	height
i want the view to go away whenever bottom top margin height or right left margin width

5825989
perforce	svn
what i would like is the ability to mark files like these as keep history on server much like traditional centralized vcss like svn or perforce

5826013
memcpy	strcpy
problem #4 in new_entry you should memcpy or strcpy the value of stringone instead of assigning it

5826013
memcpy	strcpy
since you do that a lot someone wrote a function that will do it for you strcpy or memcpy that where mentioned before

5826025
ubuntu	linux
i ve been testing my program on ubuntu linux and it seems to work in many scenarios for instance clicking on minimize maximize and close buttons works properly

5826047
firefox	safari
works fine in ie8 firefox safari etc - nothing super complicated just using the built in .validate function

5826087
pull	push
selecting push pull etc

5826099
put	get	folder	directory
if i had to take a guess that public_html folder is your public directory where you should put things that anybody can get to like through a browser

5826102
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it works perfectly locally on ie firefox and safari but not on google-chrome

5826123
comparator	comparable
another often overlooked condition for a comparator and comparable is temporary consistence the result of comparing two objects should not change as long as they are used as keys in the treemap or any other structure where you use the comparator comparable like a sorted array used for collections.binarysearch or a priorityqueue implemented by a minimum heap - even for arrays.sort you should not change the elements before the sorting is finished

5826224
docx	xlsx
for the newer formats you can just use xml open xml sdk is a fine choice but you can also just access the docx xlsx pptx file formats with system.io.packaging in .net if you don t want to be all that heavy handed with yet-another-dll

5826239
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
when i started implementing a piano keyboard i simply used a big image of the keyboard and worked out what key was being pressed in my controllers touchesbegan touchesmoved methods

5826239
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
the simplest solution i think is to go back to the original controller touchesbegan touchesmoved method

5826253
stdout	fflush
the following script works with chartbot.rb even without stdout fflush

5826283
implements	extends
it implements default regex validation logic in a regexvalidator and then extends these classes for other validations

5826293
button	checkbox
so whenever i change this property via left mouse button down the checkbox shows the isvisible state if it s true

5826353
for-loop	arrays
no you ll get an error if you mutate the arrays while in a fast enumeration for-loop

5826358
bash	zsh
you can use pwd -p at least in bash and zsh to print the path to a directory given a symlink

5826379
rvm	bundler
what does bundler do that rvm does not

5826380
hash	md5
anyway that s kinda cryptic an example would be nice but have you though of using an md5 hash of the serialized dump of the array to uniquely define a key

5826436
implements	extends
you can extends objectoutputstream and implements replaceobject method that checks if object is serializable

5826444
min	max
i have found started a python script to do this code below but can t figure out how to write the captured x y max min into the shape file that is created for this

5826453
accessor	properties
note that thereâ s nothing preventing access to private class extension instance variables or the accessor methods for properties declared in a class extension during runtime

5826453
clang	llvm
edit using the clang llvm 2.0 compiler you can also declare properties and instance variables in a class extension.

5826462
accessor	properties
when you synthesize accessor for properties which don t have corresponding instance variables the new runtime os x 10.5 and later and all versions of ios i believe will create the instance variables automatically

5826470
g++	gcc
passing -e to gcc g++ stops the compiler after the preprocessing step which might also be useful

5826488
actionlistener	focuslistener
i searched through a few pages but most seem to be just having comprehension issues as to what static means.the problem i have lies in that we are using a static class focuslistener and actionlistener

5826503
rvm	bundler
even if you are using rvm it makes sense to use bundler to manage gem dependencies so that your gemfile can be tracked in whatever code repository you are using

5826512
rvm	bundler
so i think you should consider rvm as the configuration manager for your development environment and bundler the gem manager for an application

5826512
rvm	bundler
bundler on the other hand does care about those missing parts in rvm

5826522
yacc	bison
my other system had yacc symlinked to bison so i had to change the makefile to use bison rather than yacc

5826568
temp	tmp
this could be because of non-existing temp directory on linux it is tmp or the user running the app does not have read write permissions for that

5826577
mvp	presenter
2 not breaking where it should in a gwt mvp project i have set breakpoints in a presenter and they no longer trip used to

5826592
min	max	minimum	max
i want the minimum value and maximum values to be display on the color bar the max should be 2.0 and the min -0.1

5826597
hash-collision	key
it will only really matter if you have lots of hash-collision since then the get key call gets slower than o 1 - it gets o k with k being the number of entries in the same bucket the number of key with same hash code or a different hash code which gets still mapped to the same bucket - this depends on the capacity size and load factor of the map as well

5826599
prepare	execute
prepare a statement to insert new values it s execute later

5826606
multiplying	transpose
currently i transform the ray direction from primitive space to world space by multiplying the directional component by the transpose of the source objects inverse transformation matrix and then i transform the ray from world space to each primitive space by multiplying by the transpose of the destination objects transformation matrix

5826606
factors	matrix
i want the scale the cylinder by a factors 6 in the x and y directions but not the z direction so my affine transformation matrix are as follows

5826609
hide	show
i m not looking for css hide show functionality that can be achieved easily

5826651
for-loop	arrays
i m using a dynamic arrays in my program and am using a for-loop to cycle through the items in the arrays

5826667
width	height
you never adjust the width and the height of the overlay box when you resize although you set it when you initialize

5826667
width	height
try using percentages for your width and height

5826674
rvm	bundler
what does bundler do that rvm does

5826674
rvm	bundler
there are many small things like these that bundler does but rvm does not

5826674
rvm	bundler
in general as the good people above explained rvm has a different set of goals from that of bundler

5826678
nerdtree	rails.vim
if you want a recommendation i would say vim with three plugins - rails.vim make vim more aware of rails and its structure command-t great for jumping around between files quickly and nerdtree - a graphical tree based file browser

5826680
rss	feed
rss readers load feed in background with assumption that user will want to read them sooner or later

5826731
portrait	landscape
it would be nice if when the application switches from portrait to landscape that it keeps the uilabels bools and other objects

5826784
submit	submission
how do i make a self-posting self-submitting form a form that submit the results to itself instead of submission to another form

5826797
strcpy	strncpy
from the man page the strcpy and strncpy functions return s1

5826815
post	get
i ve collected this data with jprofiler but i can t post the capture so this what i get

5826823
button	checkbox
there s a class that upon clicking on a button checks whether a checkbox is checked or not

5826823
children	parent
because the tree is traversed in-order this means that parent will draw before behind their children with siblings drawn in the order they appear in the tree

5826829
hex	binary
you would take the binary signed and unsigned forms then represent them in hex as you would any binary number

5826835
put	get
well you get what you pay for when you get your legacy code from overseas sometimes and the time it would take me to take apart their system and put it back together is greater than the time i have to implement the whole solution

5826853
xslt	schematron
or you could go with mixed and validate the structure outside of xsd with xslt or schematron or your own parsing code

5826861
hex	binary
for example you d have the following representations in signed 32-bit binary and hex

5826861
hex	binary
as you can see the hex representation of negative numbers is directly related to the binary representation

5826864
post	get
if i understand you correctly and i m not sure i do you re confused as to why racesviewmodel.raceinvm.eventu isn t populated on the post action even though you set it in the get action

5826864
post	get	post	put	put	get
if so the answer is that the get and post are completely separate actions as far as your server-side local variables are concerned - the only state that is maintained across calls is whatever is round-tripped down to the client and up to the server which only happens when you explicitly put form elements in the view that will cause that data to be included in the html and posted back up to the server

5826864
post	get
the solution is to either replace the html.dropdownfor with an html.hiddenfor or else just repopulate the variable in the post action in which case i m not sure you d need to populate it in the get action at all.

5826915
actionlistener	focuslistener
by reading your code the only thing i see is that your class wellparameters implements the interfaces focuslistener and actionlistener not static classes

5826964
put	get
1 is to put the entire table as a variable in the application delegate in this case i need to use objectforkey twice every time i need to get a string

5826972
implements	extends
i think you can easily implements this by extends a fileoutputstream

5827011
for-loop	loops
sometimes it makes the most sense to return from the middle of a for-loop but frequently it makes more sense to re-write to a loops or loops instead

5827021
post	get
then change your jquery call to use post instead of of get

5827043
super	implements
this is pretty similar to how one would implements a thread pool by themselves if you are in the runtime you could do some other things to help you out but it s not a super big deal

5827053
children	parent
i m having a hard time figuring out how to have the parent tell the children where to position themselves and at what size

5827064
post	get
that s means a get post cookie gpc name do has been submitted

5827064
post	get
when you submit a request url with persistent cookies url-based get variables and post d variables from forms or other means your browser sends html headers that contain key value pairs that are identifiable by type gpc and then by name to get a value

5827069
post	get
it would be something submitted either via get or post

5827094
xwpf	hwpf
for word hwpf and xwpf from apache poi don t really do page level things - the page breaks aren t stored in the file but instead need to be calculated on the fly based on the text + fonts + page size.

5827095
inherited	properties
ie gets wonky on for in loops and includes all inherited properties and methods

5827105
mongodb	bson
user photo are both resources because they each have an id mongodb bson objectid on the server

5827123
post	get
i ve read dozens of post but can t get to the solution

5827144
filesystems	fat
for fat filesystems you can find some c code from microchip here as part of the microchip application libraries

5827160
stateless	stateful
web ui uses completely different paradigms because a web front end is stateless with unbound data whereas access apps are stateful and bound

5827164
folder	directory
edit so after messing with the file associations to use java.exe instead of javaw.exe thereby providing a window for print-outs then modifying the startup mechanism a little to print out the current working directory i discovered that the jar is running from c windows system32 instead of the folder on my desktop i put it in

5827174
post	get
my guess is that this is because you are using custom sql to get your custom post type

5827174
post	get
i would use this to get my custom post

5827188
inherited	properties
uitextview inherited from uiscrollview which has a properties called scrollenabled

5827256
put	get
the numbers needed to align the text may change if the controls get a custom template but you don t need to put a different margin or style on each element in the collection

5827261
draggable	droppable
i ve been trying to implement some simple draggable droppable code link below with no success

5827261
draggable	droppable
however when dropped in the droppable area the item gives the alert as it should but it is then no longer draggable

5827268
width	height
the problem seems to be that the span is being rendered with width and height of 0px regardless of what s specified in the css

5827277
hide	show	superclass	subclassing
i basically want to create a subclassing that hide methods on the superclass so that they don t show up in a dir or hasattr call and the users can t call them at least not through any of the normal channels

5827314
chunked	transfer-encoding
this question seems related how can i set transfer-encoding to chunked explicitly or implicitly in an asp.net response

5827364
width	height
i am trying to precisely lay out a page so even if the image is not found i would like the alt text to occupy the given height width

5827377
width	height
if you re generating the page using php you can just fix the width height of the div

5827383
width	height
and add a style attribute to the wrapping div that states your desired width and height

5827433
hash	md5
is there a chance that we have a similar md5 hash with a different value when it is converted

5827445
hash	salt	hash	md5	salt	md5
if the md5 is a salt md5 there is a good chance it ll never be the same as a normal md5 hash

5827483
hide	show
you can adjust it to use toggle instead of hide show

5827493
opera	google-chrome
opera and google-chrome use the specified dimensions and display the alt text in that space

5827535
put	get
if i could do a group by name then put the results in a temp table and then select again and do a group by address then i would get exactly what i want - but that seems too complicated

5827569
gitolite	gitosis
and coming to access control i would advice you to keep it simple and have an access conf file svn or even gitolite gitosis and write simple hooks in the git repo in python ruby etc

5827643
groupbox	panel
i am looking for something like a c# or .net groupbox panel

5827674
websphere	ibm
there is a built in limitation of 2 mb for the ibm websphere mq jms interface

5827700
keydown	keyup
as for as i know there is no key movement involved so i would rule out keyup and keydown

5827764
google-chrome	safari
this also does not work in ie google-chrome safari i have used a few different machines to try to eliminate setting errors of some kind

5827784
pull	push
a dvcs like git or mercurial introduces a publication workflow push pull which is orthogonal to branching

5827784
pull	push
they can pull fetch + merge regularly in order to not diverge too much from the work of others on the same topic but they will push when ready

5827784
pull	push
those branches are available for active publication push by the developer or passive publication pull or fetch from an upstream repo without direct intervention from said developer

5827800
rjava	jri
copied the rjava jri examples rtest.java to eclipse jri src

5827800
rjava	jri
after examining the run shell script which comes with the rjava package inside . jri i have set up these in the eclipse run configuration

5827832
post	get
you want to do either a post or a get and i think you may want to pass back a string or json

5827864
width	height
then i ll check if it s 0 or 180 degrees after that i ll get the display height and width and see which one is longer than the other

5827864
width	height
let s say the user is rotating the screen as this piece of code is executing if the device changes orientation in between the time i use the getrotation method and check the width against the height with some if statements and what not i think it could throw everything off

5827865
pecl	pear
note yes i am already familiar with the pecl bbcode extension as well as the pear library

5827885
g++	gcc
g++ gcc are very important

5827899
aiff	caf
try converting one of the files to aiff caf or some other uncompressed format

5827938
mouseup	mousedown
from a conceptual perspective i ll be beaten with actual code no doubt shortly i would register the mouse coordinates on mousedown and compare them against the mouse coordinates on mouseup to determine the angle at which to move the div this would allow the div to continue moving in the correct direction even when the mouseup was close to the div

5827938
mouseup	mousedown
the easier way would be to just move the square towards the mouseup coordinates mousedown coordinates don t really matter in a small div but this doesn t work as well if the mouseup is very close to the mousedown

5827938
mouseup	mousedown
except on mouseup mouserelease instead of click ideally towards a projected point along the line between mousedown and mouseup at a specified distance

5827938
mouseup	mousedown
i ve included a prototype example below it s very rushed and could use plenty of optimisations + clearer concept on the differences between page graph y-axis as well as some better handling of steep slopes as well as calculating distance to fling based on distance between mousedown mouseup as fauxtrot mentions in comments as well as perhaps disabling fling after the first fling as you can keep flinging it around at the moment as well as out of bounds checks and perhaps reverse bouncing off the edges

5827966
inherited	subclassing
as i understand it you want to be able to have a base class then inherited the base class functions and define them in subclassing

5828046
google-chrome	firefox
everything works fine on firefox ie google-chrome

5828049
folder	directory
this static method returns you full http path to root folder of your application web site or virtual directory

5828050
pop-up	dialog
this sample will pop-up dialog to select the color and after selecting the color and click ok button then color variable will contain the selected color

5828054
versioning	upgrade
for the xperia in particular i was unable to get adb to find the phone until it was upgrade to 2.1 so you may need to do this if you are using an older android versioning

5828072
post	put
you need to escape your post values before you insert put them into your query

5828082
fgets	getline
for reading lines you are best off using either posix 2008 linux getline or standard c fgets

5828086
vmware	esx
for example vmware esx citrix xenserver or microsoft hyper-v

5828086
vmware	virtualbox	virtualbox	parallels	cpu	processors
vmware workstation server player fusion parallels virtualbox are all examples of type 2 hypervisors that support hardware-assisted virtualization - this means rather than emulating the cpu instructions the cpu instructions can pass through directly with no emulation or translation -- effectively running with no loss of performance if the processors supports it

5828110
folder	directory
the idea is to simulate handling files folder changing directory and so forth

5828111
kerberos	ntlm
for forms this will always return forms for a windows identity it typically ntlm although it can be negotiate or kerberos

5828122
nemerle	boo
it supports the following languages c c++ c# 1.0 2.0 and 3.0 vala boo java nemerle ilasm asp.net and vb.net

5828132
free	malloc
the difference from doing malloc is that you do not have to free the memory

5828151
portrait	landscape
i ma having a view whose xib is in landscape mode.in my one view controller i want to show the view in landscape mode and it is working f9.in another view controller on a button click i want that view to come in portrait from bottom to top so basically i need to transform that landscape view to portrait view .i have done by shouldauto rotate methodbut it does not work.i have attached the screenshot so that the question will be more understood

5828199
folder	directory
this static method returns you full http path to root folder of your application web site or virtual directory

5828219
post	put
as my first rails app i m trying to put together a simple blog application where users can vote on post

5828241
mouse	keyboard
likely you want to create a global mouse hook to listen to mouse up and a keyboard hook to listen to esc or something

5828255
minimum	max
for example i want to make this all have max value as later i need to compare a minimum

5828265
post	get
what im trying to do here is get the json result from a post request data.contents and dump it in my trolley after the animation has completed

5828282
width	height	screens	tablet
the application occupies the complete tablet screens height and width after setting the min sdk version equal or greater than 4

5828293
int	double
even if compatible types are sent like value is int and you do - because unboxing an int into a double is not allowed

5828297
subtract	add
this will give you the offset just add subtract the offset to gmt utc

5828331
xamarin.ios	xamarin.mac
supports xamarin.ios xamarin.android xamarin.mac wpf windows forms windows phone 8 and windows store apps

5828407
min	max
also consider using the rtree virtual table of sqlite3 which is dedicated to speed up access to double min max multi-dimensional data it may speed up a lot your requests

5828424
post	get
as of right now i m populating hidden fields and using a post function instead of load to get around it

5828443
switching	screens
not sure what the memory implications are though is the view being disposed of when the window manager removes it from the screens upon switching activities but at least it will keep the hud up throughout the entire app

5828452
width	height
i d probably want to stick to powers of two for the width and height of the sub-images for ease of translating one larger sub image into multiple sub images but if i can find an algorithm which didn t do that it d be better

5828495
google-chrome	firefox
trim is not working in internet explorer it s working properly in google-chrome and firefox

5828539
put	get
in some map-reduce implementations you incrementally get key value pairs put together in the reduce

5828593
nswindow	nsapplication	nsdocument	nsapplication
and should fall through to your nsdocument or nsapplication subclass but i would probably try to grab it at nsdocument if document based nswindow subclass or delegate if not

5828645
portrait	landscape
so keep this in mind persist the variables while rotating from portrait to landscape and vice versa

5828652
put	get
i m trying to put the value from an edittext into a database and then get the value from that database

5828753
ubuntu	linux
how to find a process start time on ubuntu linux machine using c language

5828894
put	get
this is a good use of case classes since what you put into the constructor also is what you get out when you use pattern matching match

5828922
integer	unsigned
for example if you are extracting an integer from a byte stream say 16 bits for simplicity with unsigned values you could do

5828926
opera	google-chrome
in google-chrome ie8+ and opera donâ t know since which version this is supported

5828957
inherited	properties
i assume because forms don t have any display properties themselves that either jquery or the ui.layout plugin are forcing those rows to inherited that lack of display

5828957
inherited	properties
maybe the form tag needs some display properties placed on it so those rows inherited it

5829081
opera	firefox
this feature is supported by internet explorer firefox opera and konqueror browsers.you can get it here

5829103
hide	show
i ve seen plenty of examples that are close to what i m trying to achieve but with the hidden div right next to the element that is to be clicked to show hide and that doesn t affect already open divs

5829142
stdout	stderr
you ll need to redirect both stdout and stderr to make it return immediately

5829142
stdout	stderr
try redirecting stdout and stderr to a log file so that you can investigate the output

5829153
antivirus	norton
was thinking about upgrading my pc but later i find out that not vs but norton antivirus was causing slow down

5829181
ready	each
that way i could choose another method for rendering with a higher resolution 1 ms for example and then each ms check if the buffers are ready to swap if they aren t just wait another ms so as to not busy-wait

5829193
internationalization	localization
multilingual user interface mui is a internationalization localization technology introduced in windows 2000 that adds support for multiple interface languages language packs in windows and some helper functions for use by isvs

5829269
hide	show
the first script block says when the document is ready show and hide the elements with these classes

5829269
hide	show
the second script block says show and hide the elements with these classes immediately

5829308
int	double
the first one is a little trickier if you intended to define the symbol but did not match the declaration declared void foo int double

5829308
int	double
but defined void foo double int

5829328

when application loaded now i drag mouse over the user control then the user control scrolls according to the mouse move

5829426
button	checkbox
i d only mark the item on checkbox click and perform all the logic on different button click that would be outside of a listview similar to how iphone handle editing the table

5829506
serializable	deserialization
the serializable runtime associates with each serializable class a version number called a serialversionuid which is used during deserialization to verify that the sender and receiver of a serializable object have loaded classes for that object that are compatible with respect to serializable

5829524
button	checkbox
i m just trying to use different checkbox whose appearance should looks like an radio button which is like a round button with a green light inside

5829546

you can make it visible by giving it a width height

5829588
vmware	virtualbox
run insider a virtual machine vmware virtualbox and simply kill the vm process

i am doing a matlab-style heatmap plot in android and decided to use an overlapping combination of a glsurfaceview to do the heatmap if you don t know what a heatmap is don t worry about it and a surfaceview to do the axes labelling bitmaps on top of the heatmap etc

5834460
int	double
64bit host which double the size of int and could account for your purported 2x difference

5834479

you need to put the snippet you showed into the emacs lisp part to get that configuration at startup the .emacs configuration file

5834496
strlen	strcpy
strlen returns the length of the string without the 0 chracter at the end so while strcpy copies the string including the 0 character so it copies more bytes than you allocated

5834522
multiplying	add
i am using yii so my dreams should come true easily so i expect the answer should not guide me to add a special field to the data provider or access the pager and get the current page number and then multiplying numbers bla bla bla

cpu	hyperthreading
first assume you have just one cpu with no hyperthreading magic so on your machine only 1 thread is running at any given time

5834826
int	double
using double to store large int is dubious

5834826
int	double

#img src width 16 height 16 alt delete

5835172
setinterval	settimeout
the alternative is to use setinterval which sets the function to repeat regularly as opposed to settimeout which schedules the next appearance only

5835212
move	drag
when you drag or resize the rectangles this function is called and move the corner divs over the four corners lines 116-126

5835261
post	get
because there s no way to make an actual post request from a link rails fakes it with a get request so that means if you try to pass additional parameters to some_path it builds it into the query string

5835271
jlist	jtable
it works for jtable so you d have to change it to use jlist

5835334
vbscript	jscript
related tags include vbscript cscript jscript wsh and wsf

an class may implements several interfaces whereas it may only extends one class abstract or concrete because java does not support multiple inheritance

5835371
jobs	cron
is there a limit excution time when i run a php script by cron jobs

5835373
cvs	svn
in contrast i believe cvs and svn give separate revision numbers to the individual files

5835373
cvs	svn
so in cvs or svn the tag operation goes out and attaches stable-pre-new-spec to file1 version 1.0.3 file 2 version 1.0.2 file3 version 2.0 file 4 version 1.3.7 etc

5835536
affinity	processors
that said it could be accomplished by creating a number of threads that matches the number of logical processors cores in the system set the processors affinity of each thread so that there s one per core and then just have each thread run code like this

5835536
division	modulo
the purpose of the rand call is to keep a compiler optimization from realizing that your loop doesn t actually do anything and optimizing it away and the purpose of the modulo is to prevent creating an overflow exception you could use simple division as well

5835536
affinity	processors
because i don t think you should do i won t share the code on how to determine the number of processors core or detect thread affinity

5835569
cpu	affinity
to make sure you are using every cpu i d suggest creating a process to run your cpu eater with the cpu affinity set or cpu 0 and then another for each other cpu the system has

5835577
mouseover	mouseout
what you need to do is either leverage a different attribute ie use dboxtitle rather than title or you re going to need to dynamically remove and re-add the title on mouseover mouseout so that the browser doesn t see it ref disabling browser tooltips on links and abbr s

5835579

or you could look at use malloc and strncpy to copy it and take care of the nul-terminator by hand but make sure you allocation bytes for your copied string

5835961
getter	setter
so i ve been reading up on coding best practices and the importance of using setter getter to access and change the instance variables of my custom classes rather than making the variables public and accessing them directly

5835961
getter	setter
for the non array instance variables bools etc i understand how to properly access them use dot notation and setter getter methods

5835961
getter	setter
but for my nsmutabledictionary variable the setter getter just accesses the entire dictionary right

5835961
getter	setter
i m accessing the instance variable mydata directly rather than using setter getter methods

5835961
getter	setter
but how do i use setter getter for values within a dictionary

5835961
getter	setter
but that seems bulky and still brings us back around to the question of the implementation within the class itself and how to properly use setter getter technique to access a dictionary s member variables instead of directly modifying the dictionary itself

5835977
coffeescript	haml
good news there s a new coffeescript haml filter that s designed to work independently of rails

my first thought is to get the handle of the window and use unmanaged system calls to set the height width and position of the window to my docking area

5836234
oncreate	ondestroy
the broadcast is more loosely coupled and so might be easier to code up though you just broadcast the intent in the activity and don t require any more thought and in the service you don t have to do any work dealing with binders just register a receiver in your oncreate and unregister it in ondestroy

5836261
int	chars
if you just want to get the int value of a chars simply use

5836290
freemarker	velocity
i m not sure how it works with freemarker but with the velocity template engine you can configure certain properties in the model that you would like to always appear

5836290
freemarker	velocity
you would therefore wire up the freemarker velocity config bean with your lists of custom properties where the value for suffix could come from a value stored in a properties file accessed with propertyplaceholderconfigurer

setinterval	settimeout
one option would be to get rid of setinterval altogether and just call settimeout every iteration that doesn t result in a border hit

5836428
setinterval	settimeout
use settimeout instead of setinterval for greater control

5836443
mp4	webm
before it was doing converting for mp4 ogv and ogg and didn t do for webm and then i ask them to update ffmpeg on server and they update it so now only mp4 works.

this approach has been used because the grid contains 20 wideish columns and it is easier to edit update in the detailsview format the detailsview takes any amendmends and writes them back to the table fine but the underlying gridview is never visually updated unless of course the page is completely reloaded i tried to use the windows.reload function but i get the annoying winddows is trying to reopen etc error so that is useless

5837583
public	protected
in order to maintain backward compatibility with php 4 php 5 will still accept the use of the keyword var in property declarations instead of or in addition to public protected or private

5837583
public	protected
if you declare a property using var instead of one of public protected or private then php 5 will treat the property as if it had been declared as public.

the advantage of going down this path is that through a single call to create a new instance of a class i can also build the associated dom element and once initializer the class-method that have been wired up will execute against the element to do things like position it relative to a target object respond to relevant browser events etc

5845533
qtableview	qabstracttablemodel
i have a custom qtableview connected to a qabstracttablemodel

5845575
opcache	apc
modern well-designed autoloaders won t break apc or php 5.5 s opcache and are not any worse for performance than require_once except for the function call overhead of course

5845575
profiling	benchmarking
check out this presentation by php creator rasmus lerdorf in which he increases the performance of wordpress through benchmarking profiling and careful removal of slow operations like stat calls

5845575
opcache	apc
it s only a major win when you disable apc.stat if you re using apc or fiddling with opcache s validate_ revalidate_ and enable_file_override ini options if you re using opcache

5845601
google-chrome	firefox
i ve tested my scripts in google-chrome and firefox 3.6 windows xp and ubuntu without any success

5845604
ant	maven
groovyc ant task gmaven maven and gradle are all options

5845626
distance	polygons
i know i can cull polygons not in the frustum and that will help alleviate some of the load but would i be able to say choose to not render polygons that are a certain distance from the camera

5845643
google-chrome	firefox
what it does perfectly in google-chrome 11 and firefox 4

5845643
google-chrome	firefox
i m only interested in google-chrome 10+ firefox 3.6+ and ie8+

5845651
distance	polygons
i know i can cull polygons not in the frustum and that will help alleviate some of the load but would i be able to say choose to not render polygons that are a certain distance from the camera

5845691
width	height
when i did this it turned out that i didn t want my path to be exactly on the 0 0 since that sent it over the canvas as well -- might take some adjustment depending on the height and width of your element

5845717
width	height
mapwindowchecked was an obvious choice but i can t seem to find how to actually configure the width height

5845717
width	height
last time i called it i used xcb.xproto.cw.eventmask but none of the flags in cw seem to be related to width height

5845756
bluetooth	usb
while the base board will cost 2-3x what a small controller will once you have usb host you can take advantage of cheap pc peripherals that are typically cheaper than their spi or bare-bones embedded equivalents for storage networking i know you said no but its great for debugging you can disconnect it in application perhaps a cheap bluetooth dongle as an alternative to a more traditional wireless solution like zigbee etc

5845759
try-catch	exception-handling
you need to wrap it in a try-catch block that catches that exception-handling if it arises and then handles it in a way that s sane for what you re doing

5845762
subtraction	addition	division	addition	division	subtraction
i have created division through subtraction but i cannot figure it out through addition

5845786
apache-poi	docx4j
however if all you want to do is to transform to xml then docx4j and apache-poi for that matter are overkill

5845789
subtract	add
instead of starting from divide and subtract until you drop below 0 instead start from 0 and add until you exceed divide

5845836
typedef	struct
i have problem about referencing a typedef struct from separate files

5845836

5845869
post	get
anyways if somebody knows a working code to get this done and then post it in a text field it would really appreciate it

5845894
base-class	derived-class
you ll only get into trouble if you instantiate a base-class object or a derived-class object with no override and then try to invoke virtualfunctionname on it because there s no definition for it so the linker will complain

5845919
tvos	ios
airplay is a streaming technology made by apple inc to stream media to multiple devices wirelessly or to the airplay sdk that offers deployment to many platforms including ios macos tvos watchos windows linux android symbian and more recently through the airplay arcade all major consoles and handheld devices

5846074
union	distinct
as you said in your comment previously you were getting a distinct result set because of using union

5846095
x86	64bit
no dll exist for 64bit access to access database files so you must go to the project properties and on the compile tab go to advanced compile options and set target cpu to x86 i hope this helps

5846098
put	get
so if i print out the url and put it into my browser i get a nice json back - works perfectly

5846111
put	get
needless to say every place i ve tried to put it i only get more errors.

5846138
put	get
however you can create a package object and put type definitions in it so that you ll get aliases for classes you think are relevant

5846141
picturebox	mdichild
i have an mdichild and an eventhandler for draganddrop so when i drop an image file in my form a picturebox name dpic is created with that image

5846152
actionlistener	propertychangelistener
these methods belongs to actionlistener and propertychangelistener

5846161
getter	setter
in java java beans make a lot of sense to implement such objects declare all the properties of your object and create getter and setter for each of these properties

5846169
min	max
then you get the min and max

5846169
min	max
if you only need a min or max array_reduce might be faster

5846191
sysv	systemd	daemons	systemd
when i ve seen respawning too fast on sysv init systemd etc inittab entries it s been because the program in question was using the traditional double fork then exec strategy to become a daemons

5846241
cout	cin
this can be a bit more subtle than it initially seems because very little is guaranteed about the order in which global variables are initialized compared to each other so for example when the constructor for your global variable executes std cin std cout and std cerr may not have been constructed yet so if you want to initialize something based on input from the user you may have to take special steps to either ensure the order of initialization or else for example use c-style i o for that particular job

5846284
width	height
use a fixed position div that is the height width of the containing div uni-form and probably jack it s z-index up so it is definitely on top of the form when visible

5846368
nsview	ikimagebrowserview
while i haven t used nscollectionview myself my gut feeling is that there s probably going to be a greater overhead with numerous nsview s compared to ikimagebrowserview which uses the standard coupling of an nsview with an nscell -like reusable drawing mechanism to help improve performance

5846370
button	checkbox
i need the yes no button to actually be the approval value the checkbox is merely there so the user can select which entity to vote on

5846404
google-chrome	firefox
btw this was the same on both google-chrome and firefox

5846442

if you want to extends it you must implements the unimplemented methods

5846446
google-chrome	firefox
i have it working great in google-chrome but when i tried it in firefox and ie it s not loading the image at all

5846452
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this will force safari google-chrome firefox reload every time you hit back button

5846461
google-chrome	firefox	mp3	ogg
the ogg file is for firefox and the mp3 file for google-chrome and ie

inherited	properties
however it seems that you want to create a base class planet and have other classes such as mercury and venus inherited properties from it

5846474
public	protected
regarding efficiency friend does not really relate to efficiency since the public protected private checks are applied at compile-time

5846495
oncreate	setcontentview
oncreate metho with super.oncreate setcontentview and extra code for the timepicker

5846503
fgets	strtok
if each of your lines corresponds to a polish sentence and if you re able to conveniently store an entire line in memory very likely i d guess then the simplest way might be to just read the entire line into a buffer with fgets then use strtok to build an array of pointers to each token and finally traverse that array from its end to its start basically reading the sentence from right to left processing each token in a manner similar to the pseudocode given in the aforementioned wikipedia entry

5846523
public	protected
friend is more like protected than public or private in that it grants partial or selective access

5846569
post	get
if not you need to learn about the difference between get and post

5846637
google-chrome	firefox
why the following example shows the image in firefox 4 but not in google-chrome 10 and internet explorer 8

5846652
ssl	https
my guess every time a ssl connection start the proxy take my https request get the certificate let s call it ssl_chase for both ssl and the symetric key for data encryption from the website like chase change the certificate to our own it certificate let s call it ssl_it and send it with the respose to me

5846660
lifting	combinators
apparently the block above was causing the code to generate combinators which were calling the avfunctor.arr lifting method to be called -- something in there must be violating laziness

5846683
post	get
also even though i tried to change .getjson with .post ... json firebug is still showing a get request not a post so it s got me even more confused now

5846684
hide	show
furthermore in the current code the notion that the two functions either hide or show the same two elements is not factored out so could be

5846691

5846765
google-chrome	safari
i image the ie safari and google-chrome equivalents offer the same ability

5846808
min	max
it is interesting to note that both the solutions above use extra storage in form of arrays first one two of them and second one uses one array and then you find min and max using extra storage array

5846808
min	max
the problem of finding min and max can easily be solved with just two extra memory slots

5846823
folder	dir	folder	directory
from the error message you provided you have to have a virtual directory defined for your app with the pysical path pointing to your asp.net app folder and also have the virtual dir as an application convert to application in the context menu of the virtual dir node i think

otherwise you can use html post get to post the data to your script synchronously you are on the right track by adding the value to an element

5846932
post	get
i m not entirely sure why you want to post fb user id s into a mysql database but assuming you were able to get the fb uid you should be able to use an xhr to post it to your php

that is first get the fb id client side then using an ajax post deliver it to a php db accessor

5846932
post	get

g++	gcc
it seems to me that gcc can deal with both c and c++ projects so why is g++ gcc-c++ needed

5853686
g++	gcc
as far as i know g++ uses the correct c++ linker options whereas gcc uses the c linker options so you may get undefined references etc.

5853689
post	put
i can have my lighttpd backed python services focus on doing more involved work while the comet service is tied to a message queue to handle light message notifications ex batch request is finished you ve got a new message etc while the lighttpd servers handle db requests or process post put delete requests

5853689
apache	lighttpd	apache	nginx	nginx	lighttpd
for a platform with an array of apache servers that wants to add comet support it would make sense to go with an out of the box solution versus rolling one with lighttpd or nginx

hash	md5
i think md5 has a generic length depending of what it s encrypting so you can t pre define the length of the md5 hash

5854246
hash	md5
md5 creates 16-byte hash

5854246

to exhibit polymorphism f must be able to operate with values of at least two distinct types int and double finding and executing distinct type-appropriate code

5854862
int	double
a consequence of this say a program only called f above with int arguments - depending on the polymorphic mechanism used and inlining choices the compiler might avoid generating any code for f double or generated code might be thrown away at some point in compilation or linking

5854862
int	double
for example you can add to int s and double s using the same notation and the compiler produces

5854862
int	double
to be polymorphic a must be able to operate with values of at least two distinct types int and double finding and executing type-appropriate code

5854862

atexit	main
there is at least one reason to prefer exit if any of your atexit handlers refer to automatic-storage-duration data in main or if you used setvbuf or setbuf to assign to one of the standard streams an automatic-storage-duration buffer in main then returning from main produces undefined behavior but calling exit is valid

postgresql	mysql
postgresql has long been labeled more advanced but slower - is that still generally the case comparing mysql 5.1 to postgresql 8.3 or is it more balanced now

5868125
postgresql	mysql
some people who know mysql well and want to try postgresql don t factor in the fact that they need to re-learn some things and read the docs as a result a really badly configured postgresql is benchmarked and that can be pretty slow

5868125
postgresql	mysql
you care about the ways your database can compute big aggregates and big joins and a properly configured postgresql with a good io system will usually win against a mysql system on those because the optimizer is much smarter and has many more join aggregate types to choose from

5868138

5868274
hide	show
you would need to enter a formula that conditionally show hide them they should be hidden by default

5868907
range	minimum
the second and i think more promising option would be to have a row represent a range of values with a minimum and maximum value

5868907
range	minimum
this would make queries a bit more complex i m assuming the query for checking if an identifier was in use would be to query for range with minimum lower than x and a maximum higher than x but would result in far fewer rows and would likely be easier to manage and update

5868913
int	chars
i have created a simple memory manager that supports some basic datatypes int float chars string array

you may have to play with the height and width

that seems relevant except that this only happens with opera i ve tried with ie 8 firefox google-chrome and safari

5870792

5870813
client-side	server-side
if you re already running scripts on the client the only real benefit to generating html for ajax updates server-side as opposed to pure client-side dom manipulation is to reuse existing control generating code that you don t want to port to javascript

5870843
public	protected
even if you were to solve the current warning the next thing it ll probably hit you with or if it doesn t it should and fxcop definitely does catch this is that arrays should never be exposed as part of an interface meaning marked protected or public

5870851
int	chars
my idea was to create a judyhs array using an hash function in order to convert the string dna sequence which is 76 letters long and has 7 possible chars into an int to reduce memory usage 4 or 8 bytes instead of 76 bytes on many millions of entries should be quite an achievement

5870905

5871236
lisp	scheme
if you ve got no background in language implementation and have never had the pleasure of reading about the classic lisp and scheme metacircular evaluators i would recommend structure and interpretation of computer programs

5871236
lisp	scheme
in the last two chapters of sicp the authors present a few different interpreters for lisp scheme and a few variants as well as a byte-code compiler and a virtual machine

5871236
lisp	scheme
even though it s very short and intended for newcomers to lisp and scheme if you ve never seen a lisp interpreter written in lisp they do present one and it s quite a delightful book but might not be for everyone due to the cute style

5871236
lisp	scheme
lisp in small pieces presents a number of interpreters written in scheme as well as a byte-code compiler and a compiler-to-c

5871412
backgrounding	multitasking
so what a colleague finally suggested was that we close all apps running in the backgrounding multitasking

5871430
keydown	keyup
keypress is raised for character keys unlike keydown and keyup which are also raised for noncharacter keys while the key is pressed

5871430
keydown	keyup
this is a higher-level event than either keydown or keyup and as such different data is available in the eventargs

5871453
google-chrome	firefox
ie tends to be finicky about bad syntax wheres firefox and google-chrome tend to try to interpret your code and fix it up as needed

5871696
int	double
i would use double instead of int

5871772
addition	multiplication
i m using system.windows.vector but any custom vector class will do as long as it supports basic multiplication and addition

i would set the width and height explicitly to ensure consistent rendering across multiple browsers platforms as there is no guarantee that every browser will implement the same default dimensions

5871799

google-chrome	firefox
well on google-chrome and firefox all works great

5872065
actionscript	mxml
since it is not possible to pass parameters to a mxml component s constructor i figured i should create my list in actionscript

5872065
actionscript	mxml
i would prefer to have the list in mxml because it will be easier using states later but if i am forced to use pure actionscript so i can instantiate it and pass in parameters any help would go a long way

5872150
free	malloc
in c dynamic memory is allocated on heap using the function malloc the same memory is reclaimed by explicitly calling the function free

5872234
junit	testng
so this means you have to name your integration test like myintegrationit.java...to define the order of executions you have to use a different framework than junit may be testng which supports this kind of needs but you already excluded it

5872248
post	get
then from within your post or get handler create a python dictionary with the desired data and pass that into the function you created

5872258
submit	submission
if you don t want to block the form submission you can just ignore the if statement and submit the form regardless and build out your errors from validationengine

versioning	upgrade
i m attempting to upgrade my versioning of scriptsharp from 0.6.2 to 0.7.1 to take advantage of the new generics feature

5872273
getter	setter
i think the issue ids that your getter and setter names are not consistent

5872273
getter	setter
in your code it is assumed that the getter and setter are named -immediate and -setimmediate respectively

5872273
getter	setter
the point is that you do not need declared properties to use dot syntax but if you are going to use dot syntax then declared properties are the recommended way of declaring the getter and setter

the reason is the separation between server-side jstl and client-side javascript code

5872585

note the way i m going to get around this if i don t solve it is to use the database as a message queue and make the fast console app poll for messages and put results back into the database maybe a temp table i don t know by dumping the datatable out to xml

5876649
cpu	processors
to sum up what the above answers have said if you are in user-mode attempting to emulate a virtual processors at a specific frequency you should implement some sort of manual scheduling of the thread that processes cpu instructions either via sleep calls or more advanced functions and features like fibers in windows

5876774
pop-up	dialog	client-side	server-side
we ve developed an event-based ajax architecture for our application which allows us to generate a piece of content in response to the result of an action and essentially send back any number of commands to the client-side code to say use the results of this rendered partial view to replace the element with id x or open a new modal pop-up dialog with this as the content. this is beneficial because the server-side code can have a lot more control over the results of an ajax request without having to write client-side code to handle every contingency for every action

5876775
put	get
given you can put multiple classes in one file the latter will likely never be done. if you are used to the renamings being done automagically in eclipse like i am you re bound to get caught on this

5876828
fgets	fgetc
if you re using any higher-level input functions like fgets or worse fgetc or fscanf enough time will be spent searching for delimiters or in function call or parsing overhead that the number of read syscalls really doesn t matter that much as long as the buffer is at least 1kb or so

5876829

5876875
post	get
post uses the message body to send the information back to the server as opposed to get which uses the query string everything after the question mark

5876875
post	get
it is possible to send both a get query string and a post message body in the same request but that can get a bit confusing so is best avoided

5876875
post	get
generally best practice dictates that you use get when you want to retrieve data and post when you want to alter it

5876875
post	get
conversely you can use post to retrieve data without changing it but using get means you can bookmark the page or share the url with other people things you couldn t do if you d used post

5876896
post	get
if you followed the above and have a specific wierdness then post the specific thing as a question and you ll probably get help

the main difference between memmove and memcpy is that memmove can be used to relocate a piece of memory to somewhere that overlaps the memory block that you re trying to move

5877219

maven best practices encourage you to use pom-packaged projects to group dependencies but with the added step of mvn install on the pom.xml project

5877317
maven	pom.xml
maven lifecycle documentation says a project that is purely metadata packaging value is pom.xml only binds goals to the install and deploy phases

division	subtract
you might be able to work something out where you constantly subtract the previous payment from the total amount and do the division rounding up to the nearest penny

5877369
subtract	add	multiplying	add	multiplying	subtract
this is obviously more math intensive than the add subtract code above since we divide and multiplying in every iteration

firefox	safari
however safari and firefox appear to suffer somewhat

5877407

google-chrome	firefox
it work for ie6 firefox and google-chrome

5877585
profiling	debugging
bear in mind that it s much easier to test debugging and profiling programs that are broken up into functions

5877588
zoo	xts
dat is a zoo object rather than xts

5877642
google-chrome	firefox
it work for ie6 firefox and google-chrome

5877664
int	double
but sometimes what i pass is an int like 7 and not a double like 7.0 so if i use tostring method then 7 will be 7 but i want it to be 7.0 now i also need to consider the culture because some times maybe french is using for decimal so it should be 7 0 .

5877683
width	height
i m designing a website where the administrator can choose some options like where to align the text font size for certain elements what height width of the thumbnails etc

5877696

you ll see that the width and height are tremendous and what s more the left side is a large negative number

5877698
nicedit	fckeditor
some nice ones are the fckeditor tinymce and my favourate nicedit

inherited	subclassing
how does one set the values of the validatable data structures at the subclassing level instead of in the inherited validatable class

5877707
throttling	throttle
first for cookied users throttle connections so you can see at most one page view per second but once your one-second timer is up you experience no throttling whatsoever

5877714
post	get
i would first define what style the administrator wants through get or post and then i would echo the html and the style

5877728
directwrite	direct2d
edit1 does opengl have a 2d drawing api or lib like direct2d directwrite

5877769
touchesmoved	touchesended
the touchesmoved would allow dragging of the selection box and the touchesended would allow tap selection

group 1 will capture the height and group 2 the width

5877828
rss	feed
we use this plugin extensively to republish content from other websites that s exposed in an rss or atom feed

the code submitted looks good however i would include the extra lines to cover firefox and opera

5877982
maven	pom.xml	maven	m2e	maven-install-plugin	pom.xml	m2e	pom.xml	m2e	maven-install-plugin
configuring maven-install-plugin to run during the compile phase and copy the relevant pom.xml to the repository seems to accomplish what i wanted as far as maven itself is concerned though m2e still is not happy it throws failed to read artifact descriptor errors with no additional description for the pom.xml that has a dependency on the other pom.xml project

5878004
pull	push
so people in the know can push pull the secret overlay repo and people w o access to it can use the base repo

5878018
rss	feed
use the rss variant of google data api with any rss feed reader widget

5878064
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this issue does not happen google-chrome or safari or firefox 4.

5878101
inherited	properties
edit 22-apr-2014 in version 1.10 jquery includes a support.ownlast properties based on testing a single properties apparently this is for ie9 support to see if inherited properties are enumerated first or last

5878101
inherited	properties
this continues to ignore the fact that an object s properties can be returned in any order regardless of whether they are inherited or own and may be jumbled

5878101
inherited	properties
however some developers wish to create truly empty objects that have no inherited properties

5878157
min	max
this is what i have done so far but it is going from max to min so i have it subtracting 1 instead of adding

5878192
textview	imageview
i have a gridview that uses an adapter to set imageview and when i open up an alertdialog and focus on its textview the images in the gridview shift positions

i ve put together a quick example of a working fadein fadeout toggle loosely based off the code you provided

5878235
fadein	fadeout
jquery fadein fadeout demo

5878244
width	height
now it matches no matter if width is before height or viceversa and i think the 4 groups give you enough info when doing the replacement

5878244
width	height
i captured the groups height and width for you to know which value matched first otherwise if you obtain 111 and 10 you won t know which one is the height and the width but i don t think that s necessary in your case because all you have to do is duplicate both values but could be useful in case you want increment height and width in different values

5878263
disk	ram
no unencrypted data gets written to ram disk

5878281
createelement	each
i ask because i ve tried createelement and it seems that all of the properties that have to be added to each element slows things down

5878451
maven	pom.xml
if you do everything the conventional maven way then your maven pom.xml is generally very small and everything just works

5878488
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
if the login is successful i want to then create a uitabbarcontroller with a navigation controller as the first tab whose root controller is a uiviewcontroller that i am creating

5878488
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
the rootviewcontroller of my first uinavigationcontroller is actually acting as a delegate to the logincontroller so if a user logs in correctly it calls a method in my rootviewcontroller which is where i would then like to push a uitabbarcontroller onto the stack

5878579
hide	show
why can t you just hide it and show it when you need to

5878579
hide	show
use progressbar.setvisibility view.visible and progressbar.setvisibility view.gone to show it hide it respectively

5878594
post	get
it is because i m using firebug and when i go to net tab under the post tab it shows individual parameters as well as a get string for post submitted requests

5878615
put	get
first to get the environment variable you need to put quotes around it

5878619
for-loop	loops
why must i declare a loops variable outside of the for-loop statement

getter	setter
this piqued my curiosity so i went ahead and used peter hosey s suggestion of overriding +resolveinstancemethod to generate the getter and setter

5878647
put	get
now when it starts with a team who have good understanding of struts 1.x is that they will get the underlying system quickly.but before let me to put one point in a clear manner

5878677
put	get
google.com link which simply doesn t get recognized as a valid html link but does get the anchor tag put with it properly

5878702
folder	directory
even if you wanted to reference a class in the default package it would be in your src folder not in the same directory as your src folder so perhaps you mean something different

5878730
hide	show
or create a dummy textbox for the password and have the real password box hidden -- on focus the dummy box should hide itself and show and focus on the real password box

5878739
rss	feed
i have a basic rss reader i made from three20 tutorials using ttlauncherview as a menu to different feed and tttableviewcontroller to show the feed list

5878745
put	get
if you don t want to get that in-depth with your users create the reports for them but put a few key parameters in the reports

5878746
try-catch	exception-handling
typically i prefer to put one time start-up code in the application start within try-catch and if there is an exception-handling then set the global error flag

5878760
hash	md5
md5 is a weak hash

5878760
hash	md5
edit as omg ponies points out you need to have consistency with the md5 or whatever hash check

5878788
hash	md5
the first one performs string concatenation for the variables e and p additionallying using the md5 function to get the hash of the password for comparison against the user_tb.user_pass column value

5878788
hash	md5
the md5 isn t any good if the values aren t stored as the hash - because there wouldn t be anything to match against

5878821
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i always follow this approach when i have both a uinavigationcontroller and a uitabbarcontroller

5878882
width	height
now for your use you will need to look at the resolution of the preview and then scale down the height or width accordingly based on that resolution

5878963
width	height
now i want a piece of code that would give me the x y or any active current window opened say notepad and its height and width

5878965
width	height
it blindly performs its numerical replacement which results in erroneous results when the width is exactly half the height given the following

5878965
width	height
note that the width gets captured into groups 1 and 2 and height into groups 3 and 4 even if their order is reversed in the target string

5879481
width	height
however i would like to return an image that is the same size as the width and height specified in the iframe

5879481
width	height
in that case i would need the width and height of the iframe to be accessible at the backend

5879503

5879603
memcpy	memmove
in the case of potentially overlapping memory locations which it looks like is the case in your code you should use the memmove function rather than the memcpy routine

5879603
memcpy	memmove
memmove takes the same parameters in the same order as memcpy and so can just be used as a drop in replacement

width	height
as you d like to keep your code structure the main thing you have to do is to not have your ul and li elements display as inline inline elements can t take width or height but instead make the li elements inline-blocks within a block level ul in my fiddle example link below i ve taken your capty.css and your custom.css and changed the relevant bits i ve left your own css in my sheet at the bottom commented out so you can compare

5881396
width	height
the main thing after the inline problem was fixed was that the generated width and height for the capty-wrapper was 125px but in order to allow for your paddings and borders it needs to be slightly different to get the 127px you have on your div.picture example

instead of using webclient you can use httpwebrequest so that you can access the content stream and feed that into your constructor

5881495
gif	png
finally note that you would only be using mime type here to verify that your content is an image - so you explicitly would not load something that is mime type application octet-stream into an image object - but only things like image jpeg image gif image png etc

5884566
maven	pom.xml
the compiler level is taken from the pom.xml configuration of the maven compiler plugin

maven	m2e
but apart from that mvn eclipse eclipse shouldn t be used any more m2e is the way to go for eclipse + maven

5884582

try ordening the items in firefox google-chrome then test it in ie and we ll all facepalm because of bill gates

5884613
uiview	uiwindow
uiwindow is a subclass of uiview so you could just hook into those

5884651
hide	show
use regular visual elements to construct your own dialog and show hide accordingly

5884664
datamapper	activerecord
our schema is far from compatible with activerecord s defaults and it s too large to simply migrate the schema so i ve ditched activerecord and started using datamapper which allows us to hide the schema differences more easily

5884675
dictionary	map
since your numbers don t correspond in any mathematical way to the actual values you ll need to simply map them via a dictionary

5884676
google-chrome	firefox
i created this jsfiddle test and it s behaving correctly based on the specs for those browsers based on the specs like google-chrome 11 and firefox 4

5884681
for-loop	arrays
for example you could have and by knowing that every other character from 0 to 62 won t be 125 you can do a for-loop until you find 125 and return the size of the arrays

5884704
width	height
more complex animations can be built by animating other properties such as width and height including the use of easing functions and key frames

5884714
jar	war
the solution i came to was to build the javafx app using an ant task as it was a netbeans project anyway and including the resulting jar in the war by using this configuration for the maven-war-plugin

5884714
jar	war	ant	maven-jar-plugin
for those looking for a pure-maven solution instead of an ant task i was also able to use the maven-jar-plugin to specifically build a jar the project packaging type still war as well which i then include with the method included above

5884796
mdpi	hdpi
most likely you have icons with dimensions that are under the incorrect resolution level ldpi mdpi hdpi

5884837

this is happening in google-chrome firefox ie

5884852
switching	accessory
in my uitableview each row has a text field or switching as its accessory view a bit like the settings app

5884909
post	get
i m developing a web app that will let users tweet post and links but i can t seem to get twitter and omniauth to play nicely together

5885036
hide	show
this is unfortunately one of the pitfalls of obfuscation with no real workaround the whole point of obfuscation is to hide and obfuscate the very information that you are attempting to show here

5885043
folder	directory
your code looks ok.here the upload folder must he stay in the upper of the directory where you run the code.then it should to work.if your script folder like this test script abc.php then your uploads directory should be test uploads

5885044
nunit	mstest
can run mstest and nunit tests for c# projects

5885045
wakelock	powermanager
the only solution i ve found is using the powermanager and using a wakelock

5885127
nant	cruisecontrol
we use cruisecontrol in conjunction to nant that could satisfy all your need but cruisecontrol is still built in java

5885221
getter	setter
declare the property getter and setter in a default way for your property

5885236
width	height
you already have the width and height

5885245
tabcontrol	tabitem
i have managed to work around this issue by detecting when the user clicks on a tabitem and then committing edits on visible datagrid in the tabcontrol

5885290
qwebview	pyqt
i ve built an application in pyqt with a qwebview

5885318
screens	tablet
this function was used in an application that was called remotely with the help of citrix software set up on users tablet pcs and the application ran in full screens

5885323
for-loop	loops
trying to loops out some pictures using a for-loop and cant get them to be posiotioned directly beneath the previous picture i have set the height number in my xml where i get the pictures from

5885329
maven	pom.xml
maven will only manage dependencies specified in the pom.xml and any transitive dependencies ie

5885329
maven	pom.xml
if you right click on the pom.xml you can select maven - add dependency - which will search the default repositories

5885331
google-chrome	firefox
ie8 and ie9 are much better in terms of speed but they still lack some of the base functions that firefox and google-chrome offer

5885362
getter	setter
the above line tells the compiler that it should automatically generate the setter and getter methods for the declared property

5885362
getter	setter
you can leave that out but then you have to write your own setter and getter

5885423
stdout	stderr
if you want stdout and stderr both everything then the simplest way is

5885423
stdout	stderr
the means stderr and stdout

5885428
salt	md5
i dont want to discuss here the md5 or using a salt but given this is my code already implemented and is already spread in more than 50 files there is a way to transform my code to a pdo approach

5885458
getter	setter
the synthesize is also doing quite a bit of work by creating the getter and setter for that property that also handle all sorts of memory management for you

5885510
children	parent
the reason for this is that when you set the color of red to the parent li the child ul and li inherit the color and this causes the color of the children to be red also

5885534
folder	directory
if i create the directory by hand then everything starts working even though they re empty so one obvious fix is to include a blank.html or similar in each folder so that they get created by the installer

5885545
free	malloc
and you ll have to manage dynamic memory allocation for malloc and free

5885571
pull	push
rather than using a blocking queue and having the worker threads pull from it give each thread it s own queue and have the i o thread push batches of work into each thread s queue

5885572
getter	setter
be sure to setup any getter or setter for accessing link if need be

5885584
free	malloc
certainly you can use malloc to obtain it and give the new thread the responsibility for free ing it

5885584
free	malloc
in many ways this seems like the simplest and cheapest way no synchronization required but the synchronization is actually hidden inside malloc and free and could be mildly expensive especially since most thread-oriented allocators ptmalloc and tcmalloc for example incur additional costs when the thread freeing the memory is not the same as the thread that allocated it

5885589
google-chrome	firefox
maybe some plugin tool used in google-chrome firefox or ie that someone can recommend

5885610
stdout	stderr
mind the difference between file descriptors and io streams such as stderr and stdout

5885626
hide	show
i use this in a hardcoded scenario to hide show some listitems in the listview

5885644
wakelock	powermanager
the only solution i ve found is using the powermanager and using a wakelock

5885644
wakelock	powermanager
please read the powermanager documentation and try a different wakelock

5885680
ubuntu	linux
the whole thing would be developed on a linux ubuntu gnome machine and then used on a windows vista computer

5885701
trie	dawg
i would use a dawg directed acyclic word graph which is basically a compressed trie

5885701
disk	ram
the twl06 scrabble dictionary with 170 000 words fits in a 700 kb structure both on disk and in ram

5885703
vsto	add-in
i m developing an excel vsto document level add-in using composite application guidance prism for visual studio 2008 .net 3.5

5885711
inline-functions	inlining
a debug build disables inlining and also the linker options that discard duplicate code so you get lots of copies of every template and inline-functions

5885716
opencv	emgucv
also a .net wrapper exists for opencv - emgucv

5885722
nhibernate	queryover
the entityframework equivalent implementation is easy as they have an include string prop extension method but i dont see anything like that in either queryover or nhibernate linq

5885735
nsstring	nsdata
why not use an instance of nsstring or nsdata for the instance variable instead of an array of chars

5885737
folder	directory
keep them all under the same folder and set this line in the directory s .htaccess file

5885756
addition	multiplication
i d like to do some simple addition and multiplication with asp .net textboxes and jquery if possible

5885756
multiplying	add
i d like the user to enter quantity 1 and quantity 2 in the text boxes and the script to add those quantities then multiplying by price for total order asynchronously

5885779
children	parent
if loaded children had access to parent a malicious swf could get server access through your loader swf for example

5885820
rpm	yum
my working environment is fedora 15 beta python 2.7.1 usr bin python pypy 1.5.0-alpha0 with gcc 4.6.0 in usr bin pypy installed from rpm using yum easy_install version is distribute 0.6.14 usr bin easy_install

5885854
actionscript	mxml
another usage of this metatag is offering events code completion by ide both in mxml and in actionscript when you re typing addeventlistener

5885866
google-chrome	firefox
for example calling firefox calls the slightly less secure version of the browser by less secure i mean it is running in more of the browser google-chrome than your average user and can do the relevant calls

5885908
codeigniter	pyrocms
i m new to codeigniter and pyrocms and i m stuck on 2 things

5885956
carrierwave	paperclip
if you need to able add images to your textarea through a ruby on rails library such as paperclip or carrierwave you may consider one of these

5885968
int	double
that means if you pass an int type smaller than int it ll be promoted to int before being passed and if you pass a float it ll be promoted to double

5885993
nunit	moq
i am using nunit and moq

5886138
int	double
this version doesn t limit itself to bool int or double but a string comes out as

5886139
getter	setter
to get around this i removed the exception field and its getter setter from my exception handler class your myerrorprocessor class and replaced that with a method to manually extract the exception from the valuestack

5886145
interpolation	splines
a good way to implement this is using splines interpolation between control points

5886168
width	height
there is also height and width but not important here

5886222
lxml	elementtree
use xml parsing modules like lxml or elementtree in python stdlib instead of regex

5886237
cos	exp
the functions applied to the samples are non-linear but smooth exp ln cos etc

5886237
cos	exp
i have assumed the excel implementations of exp cos etc are ok

5886242
range	min	range	max	min	max
what this code does is use random min max to generate a random x and y value between the desired min and max range

5886244
width	height
the view s width is kept the same but the height is given the same value as the width giving a perfect square

5886244
children	parent
i thought that if you change the views dimension of the parent it would have been passed down to the children

5886254
hide	show
i am trying to hide an element then replace its contents while it s hidden with an ajax load and as a callback i would like to show that element again

5886283

i suspect that both requests are going to call the the same getter and setter in some random order because each button click will be in a different phase of the jsf model

5890519
getter	setter
that variable is linked with a getter and a setter to an actuall jsf tag

5890519
getter	setter
jsf will call the getter and the setter linked to that same variable restoring the state or whatever

5890804
getter	setter
way is to just declare fields as public and let the framework generate the getter and setter for you

if you use any avx256 instruction the avx upper state becomes dirty which results in a large stall if you subsequently use sse instructions including scalar floating-point performed in the xmm registers

5890893
sse	avx
avx instruction always modifies the upper bits of ymm registers and sse instructions do not modify the upper bits

5890893
sse	avx
the avx sse transition penalty applies whenever the processor states is â œmodified and unsavedâ œ

inherited	properties
if you create an abstract base class that your view models inherited from viewmodelbase which implements the ichangetracking and inotifypropertychanged interfaces you can have your view model base attach to notification of properties changes in effect signaling that the view model has been modified and which will set the ischanged properties to true to indicate that the view model is dirty

5891022

i strongly suggest that you have a separation between the live server and what you are currently working on another repository where you push your work too and pull from which works as an integration repository

5896162

5896188
prepare	execute
the fact that the lone insert prepare statement seems to be execute against the database rather than being prepare points to either a poor implementation of php unlikely or the dbms not supporting prepare sql

5896188
prepare	execute
if the dbms does support prepare statements and the php implementation handles it properly there is some kind of issue with the insert being execute which also needs some investigation

innodb is often slower than myisam being a transactional db engine with acid properties

5896388

like all transactional dbs innodb has to ensure acid consistency which takes a lot of work and also what kills your performance is that at the end of each transaction it has to wait for the harddisk to say ok the data is written as for the d durability in acid

i would recommend reading up on major upgrade which will allow automatic uninstall of the existing versioning before the new versioning is installed

5897889
uninstall	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
i can t write up the whole major upgrade solution here but basically it involves authoring the upgrade table of your msi to detect versioning to uninstall

5897889
versioning	upgrade
you need to change the package code product code and versioning number only 3 digits matter and keep the same upgrade code two msi files with the same upgrade code know they are related - i.e they are from the same product family

edit the vectorconverter tool is php-based but uses xslt for the heavy lifting - vml and svg are just xml under the hood - so if you can t access the php libraries directly you could probably manage to reuse the xslt in the language of your choice
