am trying to reload apache 2 via init.d apache2 reload command in terminal but i get a command not found error and when i look at the etc directory in finder i can t see any init.d folder

1200051
pop-up	dialog
i would look into using jquery ui dialog for the pop-up since you are already using jquery

1200078
restrict	shared
sometimes they are restrict due to historical unsupported reasons i m developing on windows using zend studio on a samba shared on a linux box and something in that mix means i keep reverting to cp1512 instead of utf8

1200078
hash	md5
sometimes you don t need to use utf-8 for example when storing a md5 hash in a database you only need the hexadecimal range 0-9 a-f why make it a utf-8 field which will take at least a byte extra storage instead of normal ascii

1200100
bazaar	svn	bazaar	git
personally the teams of developers i ve worked with have never regretted switching from svn to git sorry stack overflow won t let me put in the link or bazaar

1200144
width	height
you should use control.getpreferredsize method to calculate width or height needed for control linklabel in your case

1200175
stdout	stderr
so all the log statements are correctly appended to the file but i am losing stdout and stderr

1200232
gif	png
in any case you probably should see better performance using png instead of gif

1200232
gif	png
png was designed as a modern replacement for gif and no graphical browser in use today has problems displaying pngs without an alpha channel

1200232
gif	png
png compresses much better than gif and allows more colors at the same time

1200312
submit	submission
for submission a form normally check out the submit method to at that site

1200321
stdout	stderr
you can reassing stdin stdout and stderr using java.lang.system class

1200340
int	boolean
all-in-all i m expecting there will be 50+ preferences of this type for each user the data being mostly boolean and int

1200383
kerberos	ntlm
for example if the fiddler trace shows that the attempt to authenticat is not using ntlm then its using a kerberos authentication check that the server and client have clocks set within 5 minutes of each other and the domain controller

1200402
ubuntu	debian
installing ubuntu or debian possibly in the server version can be done in a few minutes

1200419
setinterval	settimeout
javascript has timing sources settimeout setinterval that tick only when javascript is idle

1200477
free	malloc
if it is allocating memory with malloc then you should free it when you re done

1200496
free	malloc
if it malloc s dat just for you then you are indeed responsible for doing the free

1200516
nstreecontroller	nsarraycontroller
bind the nstreecontroller s managedobjectcontext directly to the managedobjectcontext property of the appdelegate and remove the whole nsarraycontroller

1200516
nstreecontroller	nsarraycontroller
nstreecontroller can add remove items from the managedobjectcontext but not from the nsarraycontroller s arrangedobjects as it is read-only

1200520
telerik	radcombobox
previously i had used telerik s radcombobox but i m not sure how to make this work in mvc or if it even can be made to work

1200532
int	boolean
i use at the moment int 2 to signal that the datatype is boolean because the program does not allow me to type boolean to the datatype -field

1200594
std	ostream
it will hide all other custom s defined for unrelated classes though again only inside the class and it s subclasses unless they can be found with adl or are members of std ostream already

1200696
set	bag
the where attribute on set or bag looks perfect for this

1200726
cpython	ironpython
i need to port some code that relies heavily on lxml from a cpython application to ironpython

1200726
lxml	libxml2	lxml	libxslt	libxml2	libxslt
lxml is very pythonic and i would like to keep using it under ironpython but it depends on libxslt and libxml2 which are c extensions

1200768
debian	centos
also i read somewhere that on some operating systems you can t store thousands and thousands of files in one single directory is this relevant to centos or debian

1200851
pop-up	dialog
then click on discover in the dialog that pop-up and you should be able to find your wcf service

1200871
spaces	delimiter
- this tells the processor to loop albeit only once and take out the first token that is returned default delimiter of spaces and tab apply from the running of the command in the parens and put it in the var a outside of a batch a single will do

1200899
ostream	istream
the standard defines it for all functions and operators dealing with istream or ostream

1200901
udp	tcp
isn t tcp the same thing as ordered reliable udp

1200913
uiview	subviews
first off uisearchbar is a uiview and the cancel button is also a view which is added into the search bar as a subviews just as you would expect

1200913
portrait	landscape
there only seems to be one -- this could change... you could be doubly careful and look for one that is in approximately the correct position differs in landscape and portrait

1200919
vsto	add-in
can i import a rule through my vsto 2005 outlook 2003 add-in

1200950
accessor	properties
so the properties accessor really should have get and set

1200950
getter	setter
updated my pseudo code to show setter as well as getter

1200959
udp	tcp
tcp is a stream-oriented protocol whereas udp is a message-oriented protocol

1200967
udp	tcp
that s why bit-torrent use udp for control messages and tcp for data sending

1200986
udp	tcp
there s much more of a difference between udp and tcp than just reliability and sequencing

1200986
udp	tcp
at the heart of the matter is the fact that udp is connectionless while tcp is connected

1200986
udp	tcp
tcp - udp comparative analysis

1201043
post	get
what this means is that anything placed in post or get or other similar locations is automatically escaped so that beginning programmers don t have to worry about it as much

1201084
mouseleave	mouseenter
i ve done the exact thing with jquery and the image map area mouseenter mouseleave events but not with 70 areas

1201087
put	get
i really need it and i can t put it to work properly all i get is a striped funny coloured square on my original texture

1201202
client-side	server-side
i avoid viewstate client-side entirely by putting it server-side

1201260
pascal	delphi
consider the following delphi pascal code

1201287
many-to-one	one-to-many
the players on the match mapping would be references many-to-one referencing different playerids in the match table and the matches on player would be hasmany one-to-many

1201319
memcpy	memmove
what is the difference between memmove and memcpy

1201334
folder	directory
i typically will have a processing folder that way i can grant proper permissions just to that directory

1201337
memcpy	memmove
this means that memmove might be very slightly slower than memcpy as it cannot make the same assumptions

1201343
memcpy	memmove
memmove can handle overlapping memory memcpy can t

1201352
goto	break
what you are actually doing is using break as a goto

1201371
implements	extends
if you are able to extends from the abstracttexteditor you might want to do so to avoid having to implements this yourself

1201503
instances	transient
it can be in an instances variable and a transient one at that if your logger is not serializable

1201638
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
the following example was tested and works in both firefox and ie and i would assume to work in google-chrome safari and opera as well

1201685
hash	salt
i have a database of hash passwords that had no salt added before they were hash

1201711
hash	salt
just add a salt to the existing hash and hash it again

1201712
hash	salt
you could add a column consisting of a flag showing whether the user has an old no salt or a new with salt hash

1201714
hash	salt
as a quick fix you could create a salt column in the database and when a user logs in correctly matching the old hash you can then use that password that they entered with a salt and create a new hash

1201721
hash	salt
of course the best way would be to migrate to a salt hash table

1201732
hash	salt
whenever a new salt hash is added set the salt field to true

1201737
pop-up	dialog
one thing i ve found is that 90 of users will never read anything in your pop-up dialog

1201737
pop-up	dialog
if they click a button in your app labeled do foobar and you pop-up a dialog i guarantee you will get many support calls from people saying why did foobar remove all my baz

1201745
getter	setter
2 if your bean is just a value object with nothing much more than getter setter equals hashcode then consider using an aop framework i like spring to wrap the object with advices used to implement property change events support

1201753
ilist	icollection
it could or could not be generic such as ilist or just arraylist thus why i am looking for icollection or icollection

1201777
hash	salt
if you are storing the salt inside the hash it should be fairly straight forward to determine if a salt is included by checking the length of the hash

1201777
hash	salt
if there isn t a salt just hash the password if there is a salt hash the password + salt

1201803
pop-up	dialog
modal dialog to be implemented using divs and css see yui have all the benefits of presenting an interface that users recognize from desktop applications and won t run afoul of pop-up blockers

1201828
haskell	ocaml	erlang	ocaml
thrift has generators for delphi c++ c# erlang haskell java objective c cocoa ocaml perl php python ruby and squeakr

1201884

is there a way i can start a nstimer from a background thread and attach it to the main thread s nsrunloop

1201925
int	chars
a is an int in c a chars in c++

1201979
put	get
i checked my code outside of the notebook and the event handling works but when i put my widget in the notebook the event handler doesn t seem to get invoked when the event happens

1201986
put	get
if you re going to put an access front-end on the user s computer to get the html js solution to work why not just do what you need to do in the access front-end instead of trying to get html js to do it

1202062
portrait	landscape
i have an application that rotates between landscape and portrait mode which works great

1202073
twitter	myspace
i want to make an app that gets your friends profile pics from say your facebook myspace or twitter account and makes an image out all of them

1202100
disk	ram
the bulk of my ram tends to be 8-10gb java heaps that i never want paged to disk ever and the cruft that is available are processes like mingetty but even there the glibc pages in those apps are shared by other apps and actually used so even the rss size of those useless processes are mostly shared used pages

1202117
width	height
i don t love this solution it requires a separate page and extra code to determine the optimal height width of the iframe .

1202121
versioning	upgrade
as you upgrade to new versioning of .net you need only modify the msbuildpath property

1202121
spaces	delimiter
line is used for parameters that need to be delimiter due to spaces

1202182
qmodelindex	qabstractitemmodel
the qmodelindex parent passed is not valid and m qabstractitemmodel is null

1202202
gif	png
in the thickbox module the main .js file thickbox.js does not account for image urls created in drupal via image view 2321 preview instead of image.jpg or gif or png

1202202
gif	png
if thickbox.js does not see the file name itself gif jpg png jpeg in the link anchor tag the a href ... tag it will treat the image like another mime type that is not an image

1202202
shadowbox	lightbox
this causes thickbox to spit out god-awful garbage on top of your page instead of a cool shadowbox lightbox effect

1202220
width	height
the container div has a fixed width but no fixed height

1202238
nstimer	nsrunloop
the nstimer actually just periodically fire events into the enclosing nsrunloop which each thread has or should have

1202238
nstimer	nsrunloop
so if you have a child or background process running in a different thread the nstimer will fire against that thread s nsrunloop instead of the application s main nsrunloop

1202238
nstimer	nsrunloop
accessing the main application s run loop is done with nsrunloop mainrunloop so regardless of which thread you re in doing nsrunloop mainrunloop addtimer nstimer timerwithtimeinterval 20.0 target self selector selector timerfired userinfo nil repeats no formode nsdefaultrunloopmode will always schedule the timer against the main runloop

1202285
chunked	transfer-encoding
transfer-encoding chunked

1202296
imagemagick	im4java
if having imagemagick installed on your maschine is an option i recommend im4java

1202307
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
in both cases the trick to getting it working in ie opera safari and google-chrome is to replace the on the page

1202315
hash	md5
you can split your cache dir effectively by getting the md5 hash of the filename taking the first 1 2 or 3 characters of it and use it as a directory

1202319
hide	show
when you add a web reference to the paypal web service visual studio will create a file in a sub-folder of web references called reference.cs which is the proxy class by default vs 2008 hide it -- you have to show all files to see it

1202357
tcpclient	networkstream
looks like you get the networkstream from the tcpclient using getstream then call the read method on it

1202398
ubuntu	debian
look on one of the debian or ubuntu admin forums -- things like fai et al have long used preseeding for debconf questions

1202399
vbscript	vba
in vbscript the code looks like this adjust as necessary if you re using vba vb.net or another language

1202400
folder	directory
however i am not being able to browse the files in the test folder it s showing a directory listing denied message

1202412
uitabbaritem	uitabbarcontroller
in my testing it seems that using the selectedviewcontroller method of uitabbarcontroller to set the current view does not update the selectedindex property the new view is displayed but the selected uitabbaritem is not changed

1202439
iboutlet	ibaction
yes iboutlet and ibaction are just thrown away by the parser at the precompilation stage so there s nothing in the compiled output

1202439
typedef	struct
you d be better off creating your own class or struct typedef to hold the additional information you want

1202479
children	parent
you could have groups with a parent group and a list of children groups and each group containing a list of members or something similar

1202486
profiling	debugging
the use of java 1.4 is a minor issue here since 1.4 s debugging interface is not great but some profiling still support it

1202527
post	get
you can t get a new window with a post and a user can turn cookies off

1202539
junit	easymock
that s likely to be my fault as i m quite new to erlang and quite addicted to junit easymock and java interfaces.

1202603
x86	64bit
also note that x86 dlls cannot be loaded on 64bit process

1202603
x86	64bit
if x64 version of the dlls cannot be obtained the alternative is to run x86 dlls on a 32-bit wow64 process and do interprocess communication ipc back with the 64bit process

1202623
post	get
however if i make the simple change from method get to method post on the form

1202683
debian	linux
you can check the source of linux file command git git.debian.net git debian file.git

1202708
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
firefox opera and google-chrome use these

1202714
typename	auto
2 can a concept which lists typename be auto

1202758
cakephp	qcubed
i d recommend you take a look at an existing mvc framework - i use qcubed there are others - symfony zend cakephp

1202770
put	get
if you need a finite degree of precision ie two decimal places for fields that represent money store it as an integer anyway but multiply it by whatever factor of 10 you need to get rid of the decimal when you put it into the database and divide by the same when you pull it back out

1202806
margin	height
notice in the body i am setting the height to 100 as well as the padding to 0 and the margin to 0

1202828
freebsd	linux	freebsd	solaris	openbsd	freebsd	openbsd	linux	openbsd	solaris
but it depends on what you mean by portable it supports archtectures x86 and ppc oses linux freebsd openbsd solaris and macosx but .

1202830
typename	auto
2 yes a concept with typename members can be auto

1202851
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i tested it in ie6 ie8 firefox google-chrome and safari

1202856
radiobuttonlist	checkboxlist
the radiobuttonlist and checkboxlist controls end up throwing a nullreferenceexception during rendercontrolinternal obviously not my contribution

1202857
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
ie firefox google-chrome safari at least don t know about others directly will modify this to be

1202868
division	modulo
the idea is to use division since modulo doesn t always give random results

1202901
post	get
don t post to a url with a url argument that basically overrides the post and turns it into a get or delete

1202907
post	put	post	get	put	get
instead of having verbs in your payload try to use for example the http get post put delete methods

1202911
wordpress	joomla
since you re not gonna use wordpress joomla or something to fulfil your project needs i recommend you to google for some membership system scripts tutorials and attach em to your existing project

1202918
post	get
rest--just update via normal get or post

1202925

1202970
speex	ogg
embed an ogg speex file and use an alchemy-compiled libogg and libspeex to decode it

1203019
tiff	png
if a tiff is anything like a png the stream does indeed need to be seekable

1203042
min	max
sure i could just force it to zero in the code if that ever happens but i d rather use a better method like using a udouble unsigned double which doesn t exist in silverlight or even setting the min max values somewhere in the dependencyproperty

1203047
division	multiplication
here is a routine that does a bcd on a 32 bit number and doesn t require division or multiplication

1203090
hide	show
i have it setup to show hide the uiscrollview if the user touches the small images

1203093
gif	png
so for example if i have a gray navigation bar i d render a 256px by 1px in this case solid gray png or gif i suppose and set that to be my body background with the repeat-y css parameter set for the body background

1203158
pop-up	dialog
i m using jquery to create a dialog that should pop-up on top of the page and in the center of the page vertically and horizontally

1203159
width	height
try setting a width and height on the image so the layout doesn t change when it loads

1203163
gridview	sqldatasource
if i bind gridview via datasourceid attribute to sqldatasource and set selectcommand and updatecommand attributes then everything works perfectly

1203167
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
it sounds like you re pushing a uitabbarcontroller onto a uinavigationcontroller

1203185
terminate	timeout
is there any way to execute terminate method on all the threads even if the thread is busy in my case busy means it s waiting for the data where the timeout set is about 30 sec .

1203193
hide	show
i do have code that show hide the image

1203219
terminate	timeout
introduce polling select or equivalent with a timeout or other kind of interruption so_rcvtimeo so_sndtimeo in what would otherwise be long-running blocking routines monitoring the terminate property

1203239
width	height
if you know the element s offset dimensions width height + padding you can use this css

1203248
children	parent
i have some data in a tree structure and i want to represent them in a graphical way with the root node in the middle of the stage his children displaced in a circle around him and so on for every children around their parent

1203249
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
you ll note that the left margin is negative half the width and the top margin is negative half the height

1203290
stdout	stderr
if stdout or stderr is piped to something other than a terminal i would like to suppress this step

1203291
post	get
i read many blog but none of them explain me who to post data and get response

1203378
copying	overwrite
you see when you say passing data to the other program you might be a tricking the other process into copying what you put in front of it b tricking the other program into letting you overwrite its normally private memory or c some other approach

1203389
dictionary	map
instead of operations that would change a dictionary maps provide operations which return a new map which is the result of whatever change was requested

1203389
dictionary	map
that said the immutable aspect of the map may allow you to use it in situations where the dictionary would instead require more complex locking or to write more elegant code with fewer side effects and thus it remains a useful alternative

1203457
apache	nginx
most of the other solutions for it involve running something like apache or nginx just to rewrite urls for couchdb

1203504
ada	pascal
this means that you can write an application in c++ or python or any other language with qt bindings including c# ada pascal perl php and ruby and run your application on windows linux mac or any other supported qt operating system

1203504
kde	gnome
i should add that qt applications generally do a pretty good job of looking native on whatever operating system you are using without very much effort even between gnome kde on linux

1203556
csla	.net
for those who might be interested eventually we went for csla .net for silverlight

1203563

1203586
jtree	jtable
or just follow this tutorial to use native jtable and jtree together

1203688
int	chars
pid_t forkpty int amaster chars name struct termios termp struct

1203703
fflush	gets
as an additional thought you should close the file after writing to make sure it gets fflush to disk and double check that futilis variable is a that contains a valid writeable path

1203709
postgresql	mysql
but i plan to support at least mysql and postgresql down the road

1203718

inherited	properties
is there a way to have my second class that inherited from the first also inherited properties and not just methods

1203823
pop-up	dialog
i tried making a dialog using jquery it works but i have no succes at doing it onclick bacuse it should not just pop-up but only when you click on it

1203904
folder	directory
i think the problem could be related to the separate directory structure--i usually deploy all list files to the same folder schema.xml and weekcalendar.xml in your case

1203957
post	get
darn didn t get first post -

1203979
getdate	dateadd

1204133
post	put
i can navigate my way through the recordsets returned from my database connection as of now i m doing two sql searches one for post and another for comments giving me two recordsets but i don t know what sort of data structure i should put those results into in order to eventually export them into the xml file

1204133
post	get
i think what i need is help defining a clojure-based data structure that i can append both new post and new comments to iteratively for eventual export into the xml file format i need it to finally get to

1204155
cos	sin
for example a sin or cos function

1204200
min	max
given min max amount

1204268
disk	ram
each one needs -xms 512m -xmx 1024m as jvm args to run well and that means you will swap to disk way too much if you only have 2gb of ram or less

1204311
firefox	safari
the webkit developers have started adding various -webkit-transform options in their nightly builds of safari and taking their cue firefox 3.5 just added some -moz-transform properties

1204311
width	height
just for fun i just tested out -moz-transform scale 0.5 on the stack overflow logo and it did work in ff3.5 but the scaling algorithm used is the same as if you had forced the content to a specific width and height using html properties or css

1204359
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
i want to create subclassing b that inherited from superclass a

1204366

i know they do that way but sometimes it seems like a show func tion fires at the same time with hide so the logic fails

1212779
profiling	debugging
from time to time i run the scripts interactively for debugging and profiling usually in ipython

1212779
profiling	debugging
this is a minor annoyance while debugging too minor for me to care but it can mess up profiling results the exit prompt gets included in the profiling results making the analysis harder if i start a profiling session before going off to lunch

freebsd	netbsd	openbsd	freebsd	openbsd	netbsd	netbsd	vms
python believes that some such systems are freebsd openbsd netbsd osx and vms

1212849
min	max
one work around is to set the field to the min or max value of the type and check for this value wherever needed and do the appropriate conversions

1212849
min	max
depending on your setup and use you could create a trigger to convert min max values to null and thus minimize the code required to handle such a work around

yacc	bison
tokens.h is a file generated by yacc or bison that contains a list of tokens within your grammar

1213176
yacc	bison
your yacc bison input file may contain token declarations like

1213176
yacc	bison
running this file through yacc bison will result in a tokens.h file that contains preprocessor definitions for these tokens

1213223
mouse	keyboard
it has a property i define called currentinputtype which is of type mycontrolsnamespace.supportedinputtypes with values keyboard mouse touchpad virtualkey

1213235
yacc	bison
probably tokens.h is a file generated by the parser generator yacc bison containing token definitions so you can return tokens from the lexer to the parser

1213235
yacc	bison
with lex flex and yacc bison it works like this

1213273
int	chars
the type of c should be int so that you can properly distinguish eof from a valid chars read correctly

width	height
i ve tried even declaring the a width and height

1213476
post	get
looking at the http protocol post or get should be equally easy and fast to parse

1213476
post	get
from my point of view performance should not be considered when comparing get and post

1213484
stateless	stateful
the problem you have is really based on http being stateless but the service you are connecting to being stateful

1213511
post	get
just bear in mind that the proper way to speak http is to use get only for actions and post for data

1213515
post	get
there are several misconceptions about get and post in http

1213515
post	get
there is one primary difference get must be idempotent while post does not have to be

1213515
post	get
if i did this with a post and hit refresh in the browser the browser warns me if i do it with a get the browser will simply send the request

1213515
post	get
on the server get vs post is pure convention it s up to me as a developer to ensure that i code the post on the server to not repeat the call

1213515
post	get
to actually answer the question if i use get or post to perform the same task there is no performance difference

1213516
hide	show
i want to hide one show one javascript side

1213584

i m finding that on linux ubuntu 9.04 mostly when i install a python module using apt-get it works fine

1213763
erlang	lisp
i think he did at least three different implementations lisp erlang haskell

1213770
int	chars
the result will be an array of chars rather than an array of int as you appear to be looking for in your example but you could cast the chars to int as you used them or depending on what you re trying to do with it chars could be fine

1213771
post	put
assuming that i m reading your post correctly and you re not trying to access the controller action names in the view but instead trying to do something with them and put the result into the viewdata

1213785
sorting	filtering
the data access repository will return the orders query then an intermediate filtering in the request processing pipeline will decorate this query with a filtering then it gets passed on to a display module that adds sorting and pagination etc

1213796
versioning	upgrade
dump the versioning that you think you want to upgrade into it deploy the code on your testing server and collect the results

1213811
versioning	upgrade
it s a good idea to upgrade to a newer versioning

1213837
telerik	radcombobox
there are some tools such as telerik radcombobox that will allow you to do such things

1213891
post	get
the only way to pass the variable to the next form is to have that variable in the data that is passed when the form is submitted either get or post unless you want to use ajax

1213947
gridview	repeater
if you want to use jquery ajax i d recommend scrapping the gridview and using a repeater instead

1213948
int	boolean
false is a boolean outputindex is an int hence the type exception

1213950
versioning	upgrade
it s not a one stop upgrade via detach attach detach was not in sql 7 anyway because of the versioning gap

1213959
sorting	filtering
in brief i can t figure out how to filtering on multiple properties while sorting on another

1213959
sorting	filtering
let s also assume that i would like to filtering the entire collection using those properties and then sorting the results by one of

1213966
post	get
one of the easiest ways to get related post would be to compare the tags present on that post granted your post have tags

1214032
versioning	upgrade
does anyone know if the upcoming v8 versioning is easier to upgrade or if its easier to upgrade from a certain previous versioning compared to earlier versioning

1214032
versioning	upgrade
so i can upgrade to an earlier versioning say 7.6 and then hopefully its easier

1214036
unsigned	short
note that wchar_t is defined as unsigned short - so it s just missing the define there - not an actual bug of conversion as said above

1214037
int	chars
the developer made assumptions about chars and int types that don t hold when you compile in unicode

1214066
cvs	svn
with git you can have a single public repository the authoritative version of the code managed in any number of ways - for example if all of the developers can push to it it gains everything you want about a centralized vcs except with all the added benefits of git and none of the inadequacies of cvs svn

1214076
getter	setter
use setter and getter or maybe a centralized config like

1214097
gnupg	gpgme
as other have noted pyme is the canonical solution for this since it s based on gpgme which is part of the gnupg ecosystem

1214109
bazaar	git
subversion+svk gives you most of the benefits of git or mercurial or bazaar though i am evaluating those as well

1214122
objectdatasource	formview
i am using a formview with an objectdatasource

1214210
hide	show
when you hide a child form and show it again the mdi container probably considers that it s a new child form and it places accordingly.

1214210
hide	show
i think you need to save the location of the child form before you hide it so that you can restore it when you show it again

1214267
jsf	seam
i use jsf seam and have used seam s built-in authentication and authorization and find it extremely easy to use

1214267
jsf	seam
seam is just a layer on top of jsf so technically you would still be running on jsf

1214267
jsf	seam
if for some reason you cannot use seam maybe you can borrow some ideas from how seam handles authorization and authentication in jsf

1214381
post	get
or better yet post that problem on stackoverflow and get a lot more brains on it

1214388
vsto	add-in
unfortunately f# doesn t have the ui-designers for creating vsto add-in like c# so the simplest way to do office interop is to use the com apis

1214404
int	chars
likewise we can ensure at compile-time that a template function only gets called on types which fulfill certain criteria say they must be random-access iterators while bilinear ones aren t allowed or they must be pod types or they must not be any kind of int type chars short int long but all other types should be legal

1214427
listview	gridview
if you can accept having the names in each row rather than each column you should use the listview with a gridview view property and a custom celltemplate that is just a bound textbox

1214558
width	height
dim buffer as byte new byte width height 4 - 1

1214558
width	height

for a button-like control a typical way to do this is to make a property for your button something like ispressed which your control sets to true in onmousedown and then back to false in onmouseup

1214753
momentjs	datejs
if you are doing a lot of date work you may want to look into javascript date libraries like datejs or momentjs

1214807
pop-up	dialog
though i think i remember seeing a security dialog pop-up after 1.6.0.11 where as before it would just default deny the request

1214865
hide	show
then when you start loading your data hide the table show the activity viewer and label start the activity viewer animating and start loading your data in a background thread

1214865
hide	show
once the thread finishes hide the activity viewer and label and show your table again

1214878
vsto	add-in
i would also take a look at this so post if you want to use clickonce creating a clickonce setup for vsto outlook add-in

1214921
int	boolean
for example it automatically sorts int so that 100 comes after 3 datetimes boolean and everything else sorts correctly too

1214980
int	chars
this will convert 1 hex chars to its int value but needs to construct a sub string

1214980
int	chars
does .net have a built-in way to convert a single hex chars to its byte or int doesn t matter value that doesn t involve creating a new string

1215005
ssl	https
you might also consider ssl encryption on the web services and expose only https endpoints

1215009
mouseover	mouseout
what i am having issues with is when you do the mouseover and mouseout events the buttons highlight correctly

1215048
getter	setter
the problem is that xmlrpcclient has a setconfig method that doesnt follow the java bean spec the setter and the getter dont use the same class

1215048
getter	setter
does the parameter type of the setter match the return type of the getter

1215055
typedef	typename
my question is why does the typedef work when using the bare typename std vector iterator declaration did not work

1215066
put	get
i have actually written some stuff up that if i ever get around to it i might put online about crawler construction since building a proper one is much tougher than people will tell you

1215088

i m trying to serve up excel documents that i have stored in a database via a wcf rss feed the user clicks a link in the feed and it sends down a specific excel document

1215088
rss	feed
so what i d like to do is have a dynamically generated url in the rss feed which would indicate the id of the document

1215092
typedef	typename
the question isn t really about typedef but typename

1215092
typedef	typename
in your typedef example you still have the typename in the typedef declaration but once the typedef is declared that is not a dependent name

1215092
typedef	typename
it s just a type so the typename isn t necessary when referring to the typedef

1215102
jar	war
the .tag files are in a jar file which is included as in the lib directory of my war file

1215148
getter	setter
an alternative to using a factory could be to make a subclass of xmlrpcclient that has a matching getter and setter for xmlrpcclientconfig setclientconfig getclientconfig

1215164
pascal	delphi
martin waldenburg wrote a pascal version of lex yacc named paslex which has been kicking around for way over a decade now and has been converted to delphi although it might not work with the latest versions without some minor work

paslex was a delphi grammar implementation...tply was the lex yacc tool which generated pascal source from a .l file

1215198
ienumerable	ilist
how can i make a completely independent or deep copy of an array ilist or ienumerable

1215236
put	get
the book says that since - and are not commutative operators the order in which the 2 pop functions are evaluated is necessary obviously to get the correct result ...and thus you have to put the result of the first function in a variable first and then proceed with the arithmetic like such

1215239
put	get
besides drawing it urself on the screen you can maybe have an image of the outline and put 2 image views on top of each other to get the picture with it s outline

1215420
getter	setter
for simple getter setter

1215420
getter	setter
so i d like to narrow it down to classes objects with a couple of explicit getter setter

1215429

1215522
hide	show
i wonder if there is a way to hide some document library lists that are show when the user navigates to the all site content page in sharepoint and i wonder if there is a programmatic way to achieve this

1215540
implements	extends
it could be argued that the second extends x implements y is verbose but the extra few chars are a good reminder

1215540
implements	extends
take a look at arraylist etc i m pretty sure they use the long form - extends abstrsvtlist implements list

1215570
rss	feed
i noticed that when i added the fogbugz rss feed to my igoogle page i had to embed my username and password in the feed url

inherited	properties
i have a class that inherited activerecordvalidationbase that contains the following properties

1215807

in many cases the speedup or capabilities you can get by providing custom allocator for a single point-of-use of an stl data structure far exceeds the general speedup you can get from the global overloads

1215868
put	get
so if you put option2 then you get a constant value for the first two options

1215901

put	get	memcached	apc
it would be best to put list of random numbers in memory apc or memcached google stackoverflow search for apc or memcached to get the best performance because disc io is what will make your site slow most of the time

1216379
memcached	apc
for this you should have a box with enough memory 128mb and you can install software apc memcached

1216379
put	get
if you are on a shared hosting provider but then you won t get best performance then it would be best to put the words in an array in the same file because every require statement will fetch the file from disc

gif	png
i am creating a script that can put a 24-bit transparent png image as a water mark on jpg gif png images

1216439
gif	png
in order to combine another image your watermark with the gif image whatever image library you re using i m guessing gd is probably converting the png to an indexed-color format which is stripping out the alpha channel when it does so

1216451
dictionary	map
dictionary are specifically designed to map key-value pairs and will give you much better performance for lookups than a list would

1216472

1216926
stdout	stderr
the 2 is stderr and 1 is stdout

1216926
stdout	stderr
when you run a program you ll get the normal output in stdout but any errors or warnings usually go to stderr

1216926
stdout	stderr
if you want to pipe all output to a file for example it s useful to first combine stderr with stdout with

1216935
stdout	stderr
like cma said it puts stderr on stdout

1216945
stdout	stderr
technically speaking it duplicates or copies stderr onto stdout

1216945
stdout	stderr
will work because it directs both stdout and stderr to the file mydirlist whereas the command

1216945
stdout	stderr
directs only stdout and not stderr to file mydirlist because stderr was made a copy of stdout before stdout was redirected to mydirlist

1216945
stdout	stderr
so read the second one as saying copy stderr onto stdout before it says send stdout to mydirlist

1216945
stdout	stderr
then read the first one as saying send stdout to the file mydirlist before it says duplicate stderr onto that stdout i ve set up

1216950
wordpress	joomla
i haven t used joomla much and have never really needed to tweak wordpress outside the design but have used drupal quite extensively

1216957
getter	setter
avoid getter returning a different value than the one accepted by the setter

1216965
getter	setter
an automatic property is still exposed as a public getter and setter whereas a public field is just that - a single field

1216965
getter	setter
thus implementing an auto property allows you at some later date to change the internal behavior of either the getter or setter like adding a validator without recompiling or re coding any dependant classes that use it.

1216971
getter	setter
if you later on decide you need to add code to the getter or setter you can do that without having to force every other assembly linked to it to recompile

1217011
implements	extends
extends is achieved by public inheritance and implements is also achieved by public inheritance

1217016
mouse	keyboard	testdriven.net	xunit.net

if you re deploying a war file you need to extract it to that directory from within that html folder run jar xvf solr.war or whatever it s called

1217136
rss	feed
also if you re doing some sort of ajaxy stuff then there are better ways of getting the data to the script in the browser than just handing off a full rss feed

1217136
rss	feed
having said all that there are ways to parse rss and similar xml feed on the client side

1217145
put	get
i am about to put a website online and would like to get a good description of my site indexed

1217163
nsis	uninstaller
adding requestexecutionlevel user or admin to the nsis script should get rid of the vista warning programs that are detected as installers will show this warning if no uninstaller entry is added to the registry and the exe does not have a vista manifest

1217168
codeigniter	cakephp
typo3 flow3 imho really the most funky php framework something based on symfony can t find anything but this should be a good start mambo cakephp or maybe something based on codeigniter .

1217183
free	malloc
what you are writing is not c++ but c code that uses new instead of malloc and delete instead of free

1217184
vim	emacs
available on almost every platform true of vi vim too of course - whether gui- or text-based java ides are available on most platforms too but only in gui mode and are significantly larger and need to be installed separately whereas emacs is generally more widely available - bsd nix linux mac systems

vb6	vba
set a reference on the tools menu in vba project in vb6 to the excel object library can t remember the exact name but it ll start with microsoft and have excel somewhere in the name

1217263
nfa	dfa
i further assume that you are doing this by the usual method of first constructing an nfa and converting it by subset construction to dfa since i m not aware of any other way of accomplishing this

1217263
nfa	dfa
in fact because you are eliminating the redundancy of epsilon transitions many simple dfa s actually get smaller than the nfa they represent but there is simply no way to guarantee that

1217263
nfa	dfa
if you are sticking to thompson nfa or dfa implementations then there s not really any notion of greedy or non-greedy matching

1217289
autocomplete	autosuggest
none-the-less if autocomplete and autosuggest are what you are looking for with php u will love phpedit or phpdesigner once you create a new project and point to the source folder you are ready to start working

1217606
dictionary	map
map - dictionary not even quite sure about this one

1217641
dictionary	map
you re right about map dictionary

1217641
public	protected
public private protected the default are for instance variables only not methods and work like c++ s visibility modifiers you declare them as section headers rather than before each variable

1217648
accessor	properties
instance variables are usually accessed through properties instead of explicit get set accessor

1217682
width	height
blockviewdelegate is where i am storing width height and image information it is the controller for this uiview

1217689
min	max
if two corners of that rectangle are x1 y1 and x2 y2 then you simply test given a point x3 y3 that min x1 x2 x3 max x1 x2 and min y1 y2 y3 max y1 y3

1217804
post	get
it handles get and post requests and reads query string parameters

1217812
profiling	instrumentation
the way this is measured is by either instrumentation or sampling within a profiling

1217872
versioning	upgrade
in this case because sql dialects differ you want to run the possibly generated sql against the correct versioning of your rdbms rather than attempting to mock all quirks of your rdbms and so that any rdbms upgrade that change functionality are caught by your tests

1217910
post	put
but remember that this is like print in python what the user type into the quotes is what have to be printed to all remember that the user can choose what put into the quotes then don t put something like a simple cout post something that reads what is inside the quotes and print it to all

1217943
ubuntu	linux
i think that on my ubuntu linux machine the files are stored at usr include

1217966

if you will create an rss feed for each user that you will be able to use flog blog - facebook rss service

1217998
for-loop	arrays
you won t necessarily know how many items you have in the value arrays at the end so you might want to put the printing into a for-loop rather than assume you have a fifth item

1218011
sdl	pyopengl
unfortunately v-sync can be handled in many places including sdl pyopengl your display server and your video drivers

1218036
velocity	xwiki
does anyone know the best way to insert some text into an xwiki document preferably using groovy though velocity will work too

1218057

1218150
post	get
i only know how to get post values via named elements such as

1218168
subtraction	addition
the above example was silly one but this is how addition and subtraction is done in general

1218174
realloc	malloc
the number is to be represented in a buffer array able to take on an arbitrary size which means using malloc and realloc as needed

1218182
submit	submission
since the connect is not protecteded it can be easily tampered with perhaps by making it submit to a non-https page or perhaps submission to an altogether different domain which you will never know until it is too late

1218185
subtraction	addition
you do that by giving each number three int s and using the same rules you should have learned back in primary school for addition subtraction and the other basic operations

1218185
subtraction	multiplication	division	multiplication	division	subtraction
subtraction is similar using subtraction of the base type and borrow instead of carry multiplication can be done with repeated additions very slow or cross-products faster and division is trickier but can be done by shifting and subtraction of the numbers involved the long division you would have learned as a kid

1218185
multiplying	add
multiplying a 12-digit number by a 3 digit number will never generate more than 15 digits add the digit counts

1218185
subtract	addition	subtraction	addition
3 addition of a positive and negative number is subtraction and subtract a negative number is the same as adding the equivalent positive

1218185
subtract	add
you can save quite a bit of code by having the add and subtract methods call each other after adjusting signs

1218185
subtraction	addition
for addition if signs are different use subtraction of the negation

1218185
subtraction	addition
for subtraction if signs are different use addition of the negation

1218324
easymock	jmock
the second version is what i ve usually used in jmock easymock and rhino.mocks - but i don t have any experience with moq so it may be more idiomatic to use the first form there

for-loop	arrays
depending on what you are doing you could consider having each statement be a delegate create an arrays of delegates and run a for-loop across the arrays

1218859
try-catch	exception-handling
what about having those methods throw a custom exception-handling and put a try-catch for the specific exception-handling within your loop

1219423
integer	unsigned
however it may not be properly initialized which means that the unsigned integer count might not be zero

1219441
width	height
could you try putting the autocompletebox control inside of a stackpanel or providing a specific size - height 40 width 120 or something like that to see if it appears better

1219465
dictionary	map
i figured i could pre-load all the relative cgpoints for the cities based on the imageview map into a dictionary so i can reference them during a touchesbegan event but i m quickly getting in over my head and possibly going about this the wrong way

1219478
folder	directory
i then changed the file etc init.d apache2 in order to enable public_html folder for users corresponding to the directory setting -d userdir

1219483
google-chrome	safari
safari and google-chrome donâ t support these events on links and or form fields in all circumstances

addition	multiplication
if the compiler is not awesome then i d say that the second version should be faster if only because i m avoiding the implict pointer addition that comes with the thunk as well as removing the multiplication for the y and z indeces

1219699
persistent	transient
when we deal with transient objects we can use the business key semantics to compare objects and have a merge strategy available if you try to persistent two transient objects with same business key but different values in the remainder attribute

generally speaking when you load a single value and it isn t hot in cache the cpu will pull in a cache line 32 64 or 128 bytes are pretty typical depending on processors

1219792
folder	directory
then when the folder is opened in nautilus you can find the mounted directory in .gvfs and then you should be able to compile it without any trouble at all

qpainter	qimage	qpainter	qwidget	qimage	qwidget
drawpoint draws a pixel on both a internal qimage and using qpainter on a qwidget thats the drawing area

1219831
preorder	postorder
how can i find the preorder listing of a tree if only the postorder listing is given and vice versa

1219831
preorder	postorder
i think that ought to get rid of the ambiguity of a single preorder or postorder being able to uniquely identify a tree

1219854
post	get
if that doesn t fix the problem can you post the full class that is causing the problem preferably cut down to the bare minimum of code that will reproduce the exception in your excerpt for example we don t see the original map get created and saved and don t get to see where mapid comes from

1219892
vim	textmate
i managed to achieve this in textmate and am now looking to start working with vim

1219897
ubuntu	linux
in any case on my linux system ubuntu with a 2.6.28 kernel sigev_callback doesn t seem to be defined anywhere but sigev_thread works as advertised

1219899
hash	salt
for my needs storing the salt in the db next to the hash password has always worked fine

1219904
subclass	abstract-class
myclass contains a method definition public abstract void mymethod but does not specify an implementation - an implementation must be provided by a subclass usually referred to as a concrete subclass so an abstract-class defines an interface perhaps with some implementation detail

1219908
hash	salt
the point of rainbow tables is that they re created in advance and distributed en masse to save calculation time for others - it takes just as long to generate rainbow tables on the fly as it would to just crack the password+salt combination directly since effectively what s being done when generating rainbow tables is pre-running the calculations for brute-forcing the hash thus the argument that by knowing the salt someone could generate a rainbow table is spurious

1219933
hash	salt
there is no need to store them separately - the point is to use a random salt for each password so that a single rainbow table can t be used against your entire set of password hash

1219933
hash	salt
with random salt an attacker must brute-force each hash separately or compute a rainbow table for all possible salt - vastly more work

1219950
migrate	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
you need to upgrade to the latest versioning of the client library migrate to google api 3.0

1219958
superclass	subclassing
it implies that the class can not be instantiated i can only be used as a superclass or that a method must be overridden by a subclassing

1219961
superclass	subclassing
subclassing may want to override the property and have the superclass respect that

1219966
hash	salt
the primary purpose of a salt is to prevent the usage of rainbow tables when cracking password hash - without the usage of a salt one could simply use a pre-generated reverse-lookup table to find the hash and immediately know what password likely generated it

1219966
hash	salt
with a salt the rainbow table approach is defeated because the mapping of hash to passwords is completely different for that particular salt - and thus one would have to generate rainbow tables individually for every salt value and the time it takes to generate rainbow tables is proportional to the time it would take to brute force the hash without the assistance of the rainbow table in the first place

1219988
portrait	landscape
i have all the autoresizingmasks set so they rotate fine but if say the blue view is being displayed i rotate to landscape its fine but then when i switch views the yellow one is all messed up because its never auto-rotated it starts out with portrait dimensions and auto-rotates to landscape fine but when it loads the normal portrait yellow view into the landscape view everything is messed up the yellow view never got auto-rotated with the rest because it wasn t even in view as a subview

1220046
hash	md5
how can i get the md5 hash of it

1220063
for-loop	loops
the problem is that when i create the markers i do so through a for-loop and i add listeners to the marker in each loops

1220117
hash	salt
if you want it for hashing passwords i would say a hash function like mash would fit the bill of being resistant to brute force when used with a salt and rainbow tables

1220152
facebook	fbconnect
if the user does something that will need communication back to them prompt for an email at that time - or wait for facebook to implement sending user-to-user notifications in the fbconnect api and send mail through facebook itself

1220199
width	height
and from there you can sort your images based on the size member which is a width height tuple

1220228
hide	show
i have a list of li tags and i can hide and show no problem through rjs based on user input but what the data gets saved and then the user comes back the next day how do i make it so the page comes with the elements still hidden

1220243
folder	directory
what i ve tried so far is downloading the zipped folder and extracting it to my c++ folder and then setting the ide to search for directory in the fltk folder but that doesn t work - i think it s a bigger problem than just looking for headers

1220264
onkeyup	onkeydown
this seems like an annoying user experience but if you insist then you can use the onkeyup onkeydown onkeypress listeners onkeyup is likely sufficient

1220325
freezable	pathgeometry
here is an msdn article on freezable objects of which pathgeometry is one which states that they can be shared across threads but no longer modified once frozen

1220327
octal	hex
i m assuming you used a hex editor that shows ascii as well as octal

1220328
folder	directory
i did find this method gitdiff.bat and gitdiff.rb that copies the files out to old new temp directory and then does a folder compare on them

1220337
int	chars
wilson is slightly off though you really should cast it to a chars instead of an int as with an int you will see 4 bytes not a single byte as you would with a chars

1220367
moq	typemock
i have been testing mocking frameworks moq and typemock specifically

1220367
moq	typemock
unfortunately i did not record actual numbers in my tests regarding moq vs typemock but the performance benefit of moq is signficant in my experience

1220372
hide	show
so you re user clicks some stuff or submits something and li items show hide

1220451
google-chrome	safari
css is supported better than any other utility as it uses the webkit html rendering engine safari google-chrome

1220496
cruisecontrol	teamcity
also see this so question cruisecontrol .net vs teamcity for continuous integration

1220572
google-chrome	firefox
my website doesn t seem to display any element or content when viewed on ie even though source code is viewable but on firefox and google-chrome it loads fine

1220602
for-loop	arrays
the problem is the following when i extract the nsdictionary key values using nsenumerator - but also tried with a slower for-loop and add the resulting object into the mutablearray the values of the objects inside the arrays get initialized to the same object for all preceeding values

1220605
width	height
a uiscrollview with paging enabled will stop at multiples of its frame width or height

1220605
uiview	subviews
create a uiview subclass clipview that will contain the uiscrollview and it s subviews

1220606
google-chrome	safari
this works as expected in safari and google-chrome

1220632
nant	cruisecontrol
and cruisecontrol will run nant every time you check in your code while monitoring your code repository

1220661
vmware	virtualbox
when i have a powerful enough computer i generally use a virtual machine with eiter vmware or virtualbox in which i install a minimalist lamp stack

postgresql	mysql
i personally use good old manually installed and configured apache 2.2 php 5.3.0 mysql 5.0.x postgresql 8.4

1220770
comparator	comparable
implementing comparable gives your objects a comparator method

1220820
findwindow	showwindow
currently i use findwindow isiconic and showwindow from the windows api

1220820
findwindow	showwindow
i have to check to see if the window is there with findwindow and set my object to the specific window that is returned with that call i then check if it s minimized with isiconic and call showwindow if it is and then finally i have to call interaction.appactivate to set focus to that window

1220847
firefox	safari
on occasion in firefox 3.5.1 at least and safari 3 4 the background will change however my #main-container div will not

1220869
disk	ram
xts mode is the most common if you are encoding a random accessible data like a hard disk or ram

1220932
google-chrome	firefox
the code seems to work fine with firefox google-chrome and ie7 but with ie6 its adding in the middle of the filename

1220967
folder	directory
there are no .svn directory or something like this in this local folder

1220973
post	get
that being said if you want to create html files for the post and then store those locales in a db so that you can easily get to them then that s definitely a good solution a la movable type

1220982
debian	linux
does anybody know a phing task to create .deb packages for debian base linux systems

1221001
move	drag
the easiest way is to right mouse drag the directory and click svn move versioned files here when you drop

1221094
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome download using the same name but ie6 inserts 1 just before the first extension it encounters .pdf so i get test 1 .pdf_check.txt

1221112
yslow	pagespeed
i suggest downloading yslow or pagespeed which is a plugin for firebug which analyses your page and shows how it is slow and gives advice on how to improve it

1221116
entity-relationship	diagram
the lazy solution would requere getting field names from the master shema - its better to list the fields asuming u can autogenerate the sql statements or use any from your aplication or entity-relationship diagram

1221125
mouse	keyboard
service is in fact a program that runs in background takes no input from keyboard and mouse and does not output to directly to the user s screen

1221133
hash	salt
you can use salt to get a more revere sengineering aware hash

1221133
hash	salt
later when the user tries to reach the url first generate the hash again with the salt and compare with the hash from url provided

1221190
hash	md5
i believe all databases have a hash function like sha1 xyz or md5 abc though it might have a slightly different name in each one

1221191
folder	dir
note inside your c program files microsoft sdks windows v6.1 bin folder you will find wsdl.exe or just do a dir s inside your c program files

1221281
rss	feed
i d use jquery to read in the rss feed using .ajax loop through each item in the feed and append flowplayer to the html page

1221282
postgresql	mysql
i have a script that will produce daily rotated backups for mysql but i can t find anything similar for postgresql

1221284
treemap	linkedhashmap
treemap is not an answer to your question because it sorts elements by key while linkedhashmap preserves original order

1221313
hide	show
i m using jquery to show hide a row of a table which contains a form however when i toggle the display of it it isn t working correctly

1221313
firefox	safari
it seems that the issue in question is not occurring in ie only safari and firefox

1221350
width	height
keep an int array the size of your screen into which you will plot your transparent pixels int width height

1221358
postgresql	mysql
you shouldn t copy files from postgresql directory just like in mysql - because chances are you will not be able to use them these files are architecture operating system and compile-options dependent

1221369
put	get
if the value is still 0 after the decrement you get the resource otherwise your entity is put into a queue

1221425
rss	feed
i build a site on drupal cms and added some external rss feed

1221449
super	abstract
you will have to forward the constructor parameter to the abstract super class every time .

1221459
post	get
rather than having different css files for each language you could one file site.css.aspx or similar and process the file output the paths based on the language supplied post get variables or in the accept headers

1221475
salt	md5
you could also use numeric indexes instead of the md5 and salt if you dont like the long md5 strings or the uniqid function

1221488
hash	md5	hash	salt	salt	md5
you should always use a salt md5 hash to secure your session

1221524
implements	extends
any class extends the abstract class will have to implements only its abstract methods and members and will have some default implementation of the other methods of the abstract class which you may override or not

1221524
implements	extends
finally you can implements as many interfaces as you want but only extends one class being it abstract or not

1221525
width	height
if you have a div container that s not really defined height width then its not going to work

1221525
width	height
an arbitrary height and width should do it

1221556
implements	extends
the key difference is that you can implements multiple interfaces in a class but only extends a single abstract class

1221571
width	margin
i have a centered div on my site using a fixed width and margin 0 auto

1221592
listview	gridview

width	height
simply paste this code into a text editor replace the window width and height the timeout and the image file name with your values and save as an .hta file showimage.hta

1221642
queue	fifo
the isrs can be decoupled from tasks by use of a thread-safe fifo queue

1221642
queue	fifo
if task1 is just producing data the same mechanism may be used if you have a queue fifo in which task1 can write data which can be read by task 2 then the tasks are decoupled

1221698
rss	feed
feedapi will parse rss feed and turns

1221698

svg	vml
if the text should rotate you could do it with vml svg canvas but in that case you might just be better off with flash

1221836
children	parent
edit i ve added some sample methods to show you what needs to happen in order to add children or set the parent

1221836
children	parent
objects and then create addchild and setparent methods in order to add children to the node or set the node s parent

1221847
hash	md5
you should have a good reason to go with md5 when we do have other hash algos out there that aren t at least yet broken

1221854
for-loop	loops
a better option would be to use a while loops instead of a for-loop with the check of the flag in the while condition

1221889
client-side	server-side
i want to monitor these updates in order to reset a client-side timer mirroring the server-side session timer

1221902
g++	gcc
this code with a compiles fine in g++ but throws up linker errors when compiled with gcc

1221912
g++	gcc
your code is c++ so it must be compiled with g++ the c++ compiler not gcc the c compiler

1221932
rss	feed
you could probably do something with their rss feed by playing around with the search options you can see how they are represented in the querystring and pull apart the returned xml.

1221933

wsdl.exe	svcutil.exe
actually you should do this with svcutil.exe not with wsdl.exe

1222246
width	height
i can make some assumptions about the images if required i can force the user to specify width and height if required but i cannot really enforce the position it s html after all

1222254
post	get
what i can do now is get the post table with inner join on comments table and then run docount on comments table for each post-id

1222332
inherited	properties
the solution i came up myself was making all my generated entities abstract and all my properties virtual naming them dbcustomer for instance and creating an inherited customer class

1222332
getter	setter
then overriding all properties and call base.propertyname in the getter and setter

1222366

google-chrome	firefox
edit i m thinking that it may involve scripting a solution especially if i want to handle firefox 3.0 3.5 google-chrome

1222484
width	height	public	protected
i would refactor the drawing code out of the paintcomponent method of your implementation of jpanel to a public package protected method in that panel which can draw to an arbitrary graphics object of any width height presumably that the drawing code is general enough

1222536
inherited	properties
2 copy the transformmojo and the abstractxmlmojo .java files from the xml-maven-plugin you need the parent mojo to inherited the properties from its javadoc

1222612
filtering	grouping
just make a select statement grouping by all the fields of a table and filtering using a having clause where the count is greater than 1

1222865
put	get
put a different way if a thread is wating on a mutex and a condition variable is it safe to assume that it will be the next one to get the lock if it is signaled rather than some other thread that may be waiting on the lock

1222910
post	put
apologies for the fact that there are multiple related questions here it s hard to ask these q s in a vacuum w o an example to refer to and i figure it s better to put up the example once in one post than to separate out my questions

invokerequired	begininvoke
but what really needs to be done is access it via the invokerequired and begininvoke technique

1222957
cpython	ironpython
for now multiprocessing instead of threading remains the way of choice for using multiple cores in cpython ironpython and jython are fine too but they don t support python 3 currently nor do they make c++ integration all that easy either

the problem i want to be able to fifo queue outgoing messages

1223695
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
the issue i have run into is that when i navigate in subviews within the same tab using the standard navigation controller push pop mechanism the viewwillappear and viewdidappear on the main view always fire when i navigate back to it

in air 1.5 and flash player 10 the maximum is 8 191 pixels in width or height and the total number of pixels cannot exceed 16 777 215 pixels

1223850
width	height
so if an image is 8 191 pixels wide it can only be 2 048 pixels high. in flash player 9 and earlier and air 1.1 and earlier the limitation is 2 880 pixels in height and 2 880 pixels in width

please add a non-reoccuring nonce to the hash or use the nonce as the key to hmac

1224224
hash	md5
if the purpose is to demonstrate why or how hash functions result in collisions and not md5 specifically the clearest hash function i know of is simple modular division

1224282

if someone has your hash they likely have your salt as well

1225393
hash	salt
a unique salt will per password will prevent a rainbow attack with a pre-computed hash

1225393
hash	salt
using a unique salt per password requires the attacker to calculate the hash foreach individual password for each attempt

1225405
jboss	oc4j
i have also used oc4j and find that it is harder to use and more finicky with it s class loading mechanism maybe i m just used to jboss

1225409
post	get
i have tried switching from a previous post request to a get request

1225409
post	get
which assumes its a get but eventually does a post

1225409
post	get
that completes successfully but later on when i try to reuse the connection and switch back to get using the setopts above it still ends up doing a post internally with incomplete post headers

1225409
post	get
the problem is it believes its doing a get but ends up putting a post header without the content-length parameter and the connection fails witha 411 error

1225433

what i m looking for is a way to have the height and width either calculated at runtime or a straightforward way to pre-calculate them based on the text string

1225545
hash	salt
there are many large tables that contain tons of these hash so a single hash with no salt can be solved in next to nothing

1225545
hash	salt
a dynamic salt that is added to the password will help out much more then multiple hash

1225553
hash	salt
but more important than a multiple hash the use of a salt is essential for a better security

it appears that those are forum post on a moderate-traffic site so it should get crawled a few times a week

1226031
outputstream	inputstream
if you don t want to copy all of the data into an in-memory buffer all at once then you re going to have to have your code that uses the outputstream the producer and the code that uses the inputstream the consumer either alternate in the same thread or operate concurrently in two separate threads

1226409
cldc	midp
each toolkit provides the base cldc midp classes that are required

1226409

user-controls	tabcontrol	tabcontrol	tabitem
the tabcontrol will accept your controls as its controls only if they can be cast to tabitem not user-controls or smartformareaview etc

1226688

so you either fill regular tabitem with your visual tree or you subclass tabitem or you subclass the tabcontrol to override its isitemitsowncontaineroverride method to accept your type as the container

1226692

1227330
hash	salt
instead i will store a randomly generated salt for each user prefix there password with it then hash it which seems to be a relatively common way

1227330

1227349
kerberos	ntlm	kerberos	ldap
my research so far has turned up a lot of keywords kerberos ldap ntlm etc but no solid information

1227356
hide	show
you could also keep about and rentals in the same frame and just hide and show them

1227358
hash	salt
it is common practice to never decrypt a user s password so keep it stored hash with a salt and when the user types in their password you will add the salt and hash it comparing it with the stored hash password

1227358
hash	salt
as added security it is a good idea to remember that the password you store should be stored hash with a salt

1227358
hash	salt
this way when the user submits the password you just add the salt and hash and you compare that version with the stored version

1227398
uiview	subviews
i changed the button s state just prior to adding the uiview to the subviews of the owning viewcontroller

svg	vml
dojo charting also works ok and uses svg vml rather than canvas excanvas which means you can do funkier things with it if you look at its internals but flot is nicer to program with imo

1227549

one of my need to to be able to control the sorting of the grouping ascending or descending

1228146
mbunit	mstest
i am using mstest instead of mbunit

hide	show
do you want to hide show the link

1228154
hide	show
there s also hide and show

1228286

do you need to work on individual children of each part to the nth recursion or do you only ever work with a root part ie those with no parent and it s children as a whole

1228315
plot	heatmap
how do i plot 5 heatmap as subplots which have the same number of columns but different row counts

1228326
redmine	trac
your best bet would be to use one of the various trac alternatives such as redmine or drproject or if i may pimp myself piano-man

1228373
post	get
if you save his xslt file in the post to a file called stripnamespaces.xslt in the web site project you should get your data if you change the asp xmldatasource to be

1228388
sqldatasource	objectdatasource
of odp.net you install it will always have problems with sqldatasource it simly doesn t work so if you try any other datasource like objectdatasource with dataset or other implementation it s working and parametrized too but remember to use param instead of param

1228438
gif	bmp	gif	png	bmp	png
however if you re using something like jpeg gif png or bmp you can use the imageio class

1228452
hide	show
how i did this was to very quickly hide and show the parent object in your case it sounds like the parent to your row

1228478
getter	setter
is it common to have getter setter style methods as in java

1228486
getter	setter
no it is not common to use getter setter style names in c#

1228486
getter	setter
properties should be used for almost all places you would use a getter setter in java

1228486
bcl	fxcop
it s enforced by several tools fxcop and is the dominant style of many libraries including the bcl

1228516
width	height	width	border-box	height	border-box	box-sizing	border-box
box-sizing content-box is not applied to table cells it currently only applies border-box which includes the border in the height width it is non-standard and needs to be fixed

1228516
width	height
if you want add a div above the table with a fixed height width border and see as firefox renders that div s border above the table border overlapping it as if it wasn t even there

1228527
client-side	server-side
as for form validation you can do both server-side and client-side

1228527
client-side	server-side
we always try to show server-side errors on top of the form in a distinctive container client-side - right next to the field in question on submit

1228593
int	chars
unfortunately a lot places use standards such as m_ for member variables i for int no matter how used cp for chars pointers

1228596
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
it works on ie7 firefox opera safari and google-chrome

1228619
haskell	ocaml
in fact i very much believe the popularity of ruby affected the popularity of languages like haskell ocaml scala and f# in a positive way in addition to the other dynamic languages

1228659
cpython	ironpython
so unless ironpython which is written in .net can correctly load c dlls written for cpython you might be out of luck

1228659

1228884
mouseover	mouseout	mouseover	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseenter
initially hovering works and the over class is added on mouseenter and removed on mouseout but after doing some hovering over paragraphs with class risk the toggle class becomes stuck and mouseover removes it instead of adding the class opposite of expected functionality

1228919
mouseleave	mouseenter
why not have two separate functions for mouseenter and mouseleave

1228919
mouseleave	mouseenter
have mouseenter add the class and mouseleave remove the class

1228919
mouseleave	mouseenter
i think the problem is that if for example the mouseleave event is not fired browser looses focus i think can cause this then the mouseenter function will remove the class instead of adding it

1228929
versioning	upgrade
presumably you have some table that contains a db schema versioning so you should make sure to lock that table for the duration of the startup upgrade process

1228954
hide	show
i have this simple jquery function to hide or show a table

1228954
hide	show
the show hide works but the image plus minus is not changing

1228975
queue	fifo
although i agree with nick that the queue s purpose is more for fifo style processing and arsenmkrt s solution will work another option involves using a messageenumerator and piling the messages into your ienumerable

1229012
post	get
both post and get works perfectly

1229012
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	post	get
post and get works perfectly in ie 7 and 8 safari google-chrome and firefox

1229171
imagemagick	graphicsmagick
i decided i would have to deploy imagemagick but in my testing i am running into an infamous bus error and would prefer not to have to compile imagemagick or graphicsmagick with all its dependancies if i can do what i need to out-of-the-box

1229195
postgresql	mysql
but what you propose doesn t work on mysql it seems you have to use now + interval 2 hour and not now + interval 2 hours -- still i don t know about postgresql

1229195
postgresql	mysql
btw i don t have a postgresql server so i ll test everything with mysql -- should work on postgresql too still.

1229273
jboss	glassfish
does jboss seam work well on glassfish

1229336
int	double
but what if your sorting value is a double instead of an int

1229336
int	double
found double required int

1229336
int	double
is there a way to use double for the comparison instead of casting to int

1229394
addclass	removeclass
so the best solution is use addclass someclass and removeclass someclass to make things hidden

1229417
post	get
this is just a simple example of course i can hardcode post url here or get url by location object etc with javascript i hope you get what i mean.

1229492
int	chars
quassnoi can explain better than i but i think there is no visible difference in performance if you use a varchar chars or int in a index to use it later for group ing or other method to find the duplicates

1229522
hid	keyboard
your delegate should have already made the decision to hide the keyboard or not and the event being broadcast is merely to let all the other components know that they keyboard hid

1229537
spaces	delimiter
there are 91 lines in final_file 91 different standard spaces delimiter inputs and therefore the bash script should call the . runnable input 91 times

1229821
google-chrome	firefox
i have this code which is working fine in firefox google-chrome and ie8 but is it not working on ie6 and ie7

1229849
prepare	execute
also database server machines are usually shared resources but the statement is likely to be prepare separately for each user so if you have multiple users hammering the system with repeated queries that are discarded the server will be too busy preparing queries to execute any of them fast

1229947
put	get
i ve pared the logic down to the bare minimum but hopefully you get how to modify the logic to put the hibernate support back in

1229949
width	height
so my question is how can you get the width height of an embedded image swf

1229972
agile	sprint
most agile proponents mike cohn ken schwaber and jeff sutherland for instance recommend that teams use the recent weather to base their future estimations on how much they think they can commit to in a sprint

1229972
agile	sprint
i recommend mike cohn s book on agile estimating and planning to provide an overview of the way sprint estimation and planning all can fit together

1229981
width	height
if you want that widget have the same size in only one direction width or height set the mode property of sizegroup

1229994
photoshop	fireworks
fireworks is specifically web orientated and has preset styles that you can use but it doesn t have the fan-base or tutorials available that photoshop does

1229996
icns	dmg
the app then need to be repacked in a dmg for distribution i could use idmg and also add the icns as an icon for the dmg

1230007
width	height
if you still think you need that transparent sprite you can draw a transparent rectangle beginfill 0 0 or create a transparent bitmap new bitmapdata width height true 0

1230051
inherited	properties
and since a program started by a service inherited this properties it usually is not allowed to get to the desktop either

ienumerable	ienumerator
ienumerable or more properly ienumerator doesn t have moveprev

1230162
rss	feed
parse rss and atom feed in python

1230163
width	height
give it a set height and width say 300 pixels by 300 pixels

1230168
post	put
i think you need to put some default values into your route for the post title.

1230220
free	malloc
you could of course re-build your own crt lib from corrected sources or try to replace the crt malloc free

1230249
maven	pom.xml
when i modify my hibernate dependency to this latest version in my project s pom.xml i get the following error when i run a maven build

1230274
getter	setter
i don t know all the answers to your questions but i ve had this issue before and i now check that the model i am trying to update has both getter and setter on it

1230325
bids	ssis
if so have you considered rewriting in ssis script task and taking advantage of breakpoints in bids

1230327
children	parent
you can make additional parent and children pointers using

1230343
base-class	subclassing
i gather that you have a base-class and two subclassing that you want to map to two subclassing tables using the table-per-concrete-class mapping strategy

1230343
base-class	subclassing
the two subclassing tables need to declare the same primary keys and the primary keys need to be mapped in the base-class mapping

1230350
put	get
or put it in a database where you can get at it via sql client

1230417
button	right-align
i used to be a proponent of dynamic width until i started seeing pages which looked great on 14 and 19 screens displayed on 24 monitors the major issue is with right-align items such as button which become separated from the main content

1230431
notepad++	textpad
put the file in a text editor such as notepad++ or textpad and change the view to show control characters

1230445
spaces	delimiter
i want spaces to be the delimiter and i want the search to be case insensitive

1230450
post	get
i don t post sample code because i get 1263 errors - so i get error in all files - but this is a sample traceback

1230456
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
on my website it seems every updated browser firefox opera safari ie8 ie7 and even ie6 seem to render the separating line between my content div and sidemenu div

1230528
width	height
the dimensions of the watermark image are 179 width 39 height

1230528
width	height
now what if i have another image whose dimensions are 150 width 20 height

1230528
width	height
so how can i determine a smaller width and height to which i will resize the watermark image something much less than 150 width 20 height so that it will appear still as a watermark and wont mask the image completely

1230563
perl	tcl
pl python pl tcl pl perl etc

1230563
ubuntu	debian
interface with r statistical libraries postgresql pl r available in debian ubuntu

1230564
versioning	upgrade
i have upgrade my iphone to the latest versioning 3.0.1 7a400

1230580
min	max
i would use a min-width and max-width css attribute to set absolute min max then let it be fluid otherwise

1230580
min	max
note that min max width are not supported in ie6 but then it ll just default to fluid so it shouldn t be a big deal

1230581
width	height
you need to pick a maximum percentage of height and width of the smaller image that you can allow the watermark to be then scale watermark image to the smaller of these two maximum values

1230581
width	height
for example if you want the watermark to be no more than 25 of the height and no more than 50 of the width of the target image you can see how big the watermark should be if you scaled it to either dimension

1230623
jboss	glassfish
a more direct comparison for jboss 5 would be the glassfish v2 releases which are based on java ee 5

1230623
jboss	glassfish
sun also provides patch releases of glassfish akin to redhat s support for jboss

1230655
width	height
meaning that i separate things that deal with size width height and position from css classes that do font-weight color etc

1230668
postgresql	mysql
it has native support for sql server mysql oracle postgresql sqlite db2 and others

1230749
google-chrome	firefox
now this seems like how it should work however it doesn t happen in ie7 firefox google-chrome

1230773
getter	setter
second if get and set are to be strictly interpreted as setter and getter then if other semantic associated with setting getting a value side effects for example will be surprising

1230797
getter	setter
several languages have different ways of handling getter and setter

1230802
getter	setter
c# getter and setter are first class entities and don t resemble function calls syntactically though any arbitrary code can run in the context of an accessor

1230812
accessor	properties
in python you have the concept of properties and so an accessor might look like obj.foo and a mutator might look like even though methods are called behind the scenes

1230829
metaclass	subclassing
in the class that s really a legacy old-type class the one made the second time metaclass is classobj which isn t a subclassing of type and properties don t work right assigning x.x bypasses the property and after that getting x.x doesn t see the property any more either

1230829
metaclass	subclassing
but in the first case the qt case there s a different metaclass and it is a subclassing of type so it s not really correct to say the class isn t new-style

1230853
children	parent
that is a process stores pointers to it s parent but parent appear to not store information about children

1230875
pseudo-class	visited
i read somewhere to think of the a pseudo-class as love hate link visited hover active one more specific than the previous

1230890
ienumerable	ilist
jamie s suggestion is good but instead of overriding tostring i would just project your ilist order into ienumerable listitem before binding

1230907
uiview	calayer
within -drawrect for a uiview or -renderincontext for a calayer the following code will draw text and apply a glow around it

1230926
getter	setter
the java language currently doesn t have properties so the getter setter syntax has become the de-facto standard

1230926
getter	setter
this isn t just so other programmers can read your code but more importantly hundreds of other java frameworks are built to handle objects supporting java bean style getter setter

1230982
mouseout	mouseenter
the code below will take each of the nav link elements and add the mouseenter and mouseout events

1231004
jsmin	jscompress
this uses the jscompress msbuild task from the msbuild community tasks which i think is based off of jsmin

1231010
width	height
i think the solution is giving percentage instead of absolute numbers like 240px to height and width of divs

1231035
getter	setter
then all the classes can use the singleton getter setter to manipulate the lookup tables

1231108
retaincount	dealloc
assuming your retaincount is then 0 dealloc will be called in 99 of the cases you should never call dealloc yourself

1231130
width	height
note that if you have anything like borders or padding set on any of the divs that will add to the width and height of the element so take that into account

1231133
width	height
and my problem is that when the content is really very large i need to calculate the content s height and width and then add new page..

1231134
actionscript	haxe
mtasc is build around actionscript 2 whereas haxe is it s own language and very similar to actionscrip

1231134
actionscript	haxe
again based on the request to the server you can even generate actionscript haxe on the server compile it and inject it into a swf created by swfmill to then serve it to the user

1231173
range	minimum
it also mandates minimum range but allows for multiple encoding schemes two s complement ones complement and sign magnitude

1231173
integer	unsigned
the typedef name uintn_t designates an unsigned integer type with width n

1231173
integer	unsigned
uint24_t denotes an unsigned integer type with a width of exactly 24 bits

1231229
gridview	objectdatasource
i have a gridview tied to an objectdatasource using paging

1231241
ironruby	ironpython
asp.net + asp.net mvc with ironruby ironpython

1231244

1231255
gmail	hotmail
contacts is a universal interface to grab contact list information from various providers including hotmail gmail and

1231292
mouse	keyboard
you ll probably also want to tweak the keyboard and mouse settings in system preferences

1231298
boost	stl
boost shared_ptr is safe to use in stl containers unlike std auto_ptr

1231323
getter	setter
then you set the getter and setter properties for this column to private in the property manager window which you probably used to rename eventtype

1231342
children	parent
if you re implementing it yourself then to get row highlighting you would just either use the pseudo css class hover or jump to closest parent and apply a css class to background color the children

1231373
getter	setter
you cannot have a pointer to a property because a property is an interface to an object specifying the format of the getter and setter methods

1231420
ffmpeg	libavformat	libavformat	swscale
i m trying to build a c++ cli executable to which i statically link ffmpeg libavcodec libavformat libavutil swscale

1231426
getter	setter
i really like special notation for getter and setter

1231493
nfa	dfa
for more information search for dfa vs nfa in this article about regex matching engines

1231508
inherited	properties
isn t there a rule that you should not set virtual properties in constrcutors since it might cause unexpected behaviour if the class has been inherited from a base class or is it safe to do it

1231553
public	protected
base class base defines protected virtual abstract method v and public non-virtual method m

1231561
inherited	properties
i thought of having a single super pom with all the properties but if i change one of the problem i need to either increment its version and to update all the poms inherited from it or to delete it from all the developers machines which i don t want to do

maven	pom.xml
the irony is that the hibernate artifacts have some fairly intricate inter-dependencies and well-documented minimum versions of those dependencies which would be ideally represented as a maven pom.xml

1231734
put	get
is my first time in this forum i have a problem with the jqgrid i can not get it to work and this problem is by about 2 days that i can not risolvere.il problem is that if i put the code javascript within the jqgrid view home then everything works but if i change my path for example client linqgriddata gives me the following error

1231740
public	protected
however if it is not super important you might consider mapping the columns just as you normally would but as private protected properties and then create a public property in your class that exposes those private public properties as an array

1231775
maven	pom.xml	inherited	properties
the standard set are inherited from the maven super pom.xml and can be overridden by redefining the relevant properties

1231951
free	malloc
but if you want to do something about it it s not free you should be looking at but malloc

1232043
freemarker	velocity
the variant is very common apache velocity freemarker unix shell also used int apache ant buildfiles and springframework bean configurations

1232053
postgresql	mysql
it will mostly depend on the sql engine you use oracle sql server mysql postgresql etc as they ll all optimise in different ways

1232063
hide	show
it should hide and show certain divs when a user clicks on a radio button

1232073
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in firefox but ie ignores the padding rendering it as a flat list quite hard to use and google-chrome doesn t render the s which are technically not valid as an is supposed to contain at least on

1232079
datarow	dataadapter
offcourse the dataadapter only fires the correct sqlcommand which is determined by the rowstate of each datarow

1232080
nsstring	nsdata
i have a rsa exponent key value which is supposed to be a biginteger but i have it in nsstring nsdata with full value in utf8 encoded

vim	emacs
and you can make easily from emacs or vim

1232095
rss	feed
you can use a xml parser to parse the rss feed and display them

1232096
width	margin
edit i already have this working using a containing div for the floating element and specifying a width for the container then use margin 0 auto

1232171
dpkg	apt
if you for some reason need to install the sun packages you can use the make-jpkg command to create a deb file and still have the files managed by apt dpkg

1232203
nsdatecomponents	nsdateformatter
i can easily create an nsdate without hours minutes or seconds using either nsdatecomponents or an nsdateformatter

1232262
free	malloc
i try to do free delete if i am using malloc new but sometimes it gets messy

1232353
stdout	stderr
2 if the .net exe outputs to the command line you can read the output using the standard handle stdout and stderr

1232359

1232455
mutt	msmtp
msmtp an smtp client and smtp plugin for mail user agents such as mutt

1232510
free	malloc
the best way to prevent memory leaks is not to use malloc free in the first place

1232539
free	malloc
the above obviously only works for malloc and free but you can make it work for new and delete as well mfc does it for example

1232543
getter	setter
these would then use the core data-generated getter and setter to access the nsdate property

1232547
stdout	stderr
the stdout stderr streams do not support unicode so visual studio has no way of receiving unicode output from your process

1232555
pop-up	dialog
in short use an interface to separate out all modal dialog pop-up - which are a pain in the neck for ui test automation

1232555
pop-up	dialog
the real implementation of course pop-up the actual dialog modally.

1232583
int	boolean
the closest you re going to get is java.util.concurrent.atomic.atomicreferencearray which offers cas-based operations such as boolean compareandset int i e expect e update

bmp	png
i don t understand where is the problem i tried to change my backgorund image to bmp png jpg etc

1232960
junit	testng
i ve tried a few approaches but the best i can manage is to create a profile for the testng dependency so you can toggle between testng and junit testing there doesn t seem to be a means to run both testng and junit 4 tests

1232960
junit	testng
one other point to note you can launch your junit tests from testng but i think this only works for junit 3 tests

1232967
width	height
div is a block element and as such is a rectangular area with width height margins and padding

codeigniter	cakephp
why don t you try codeigniter or cakephp

1233052
trac	cvsnt
we are currently considering to move away from cvsnt very probably to subversion because we are already using trac which is well-prepared for svn-integration

1233052
folder	directory
for a build of projecta the build server would now simply have to check out the virtual module named projectafull to get all interdependent modules needed for that particular build - and even create the directory structure favoured by the compiler external and internal libs both placed below a common lib parent folder

1233052
folder	directory
should each project and library become its own svn project with its own set of trunk tags and branches folder or should i simply import the existing directory structure as-is

int bool float chars string names will be different between different languages

1233331
int	chars	int	boolean
often these include int float boolean chars string or something similarly named

1233336
integer	unsigned
for example an unsigned integer is a data type that can only store positive whole real numbers i.e 0 1 2 3... usually up to a specific number due to the fact that the memory allocated to the unsigned integer is limited

1233344
bazaar	svn	bazaar	git
i want to use svn mv bazaar mv or git mv instead of just renaming so that i can register the extra metadata in the source control system

1233399
boost	allocator
it could be that just reducing the number of allocator will boost performance enough for the time being

1233400
boost	stl
for this reason i would like to use the stl boost naming conventions instead of symbian s which i think are hard to get used to

1233402
int	double
some examples of so-called built-in types are int double string float byte and short

1233405

gridview	sqldatasource
but i also have asp sqldatasource bound to a gridview

1233562
public	protected
however if your class has a mix of private protected and public data members it may be a good idea to specify that a member is private for the sake of readability

1233569
post	put
indeed depending on one s reading of the post and put method definitions rfc 2616 9.5 9.6 one might argue that the body is implied to be required - but a reasonable way to handle no body would be to assume a zero-length body

1233575
solaris	bsd

pascal	delphi
the with preserved word in pascal delphi is only used for easily accessing the members of records or objects classes in order not to mention the record s object s class s name

cvs	svn
otherwise you ll try to apply your svn cvs knowledge and that just won t quite work

1234020
pull	push
in general the merge a push or requested pull back to origin trunk is trivial since by regularly merging from origin you have ensured that your head branch tip has origin s head in its past so when origin merges your work it merely has to move forward through the history rather than actually perform a merge git calls this a fast forward

1234084
opera	firefox
it works perfect in firefox but in ie and opera nothing happens - the image is reloaded but not rotated

1234183
inherited	properties
the codebase i ve inherited seems to have a bunch of public variables and as i come across them i tend to convert them into properties document them and format them according to our stylecop rules it s my own little version of kaizen - eventually the codebase will be clean but i was just wondering if there is a good search string that i could use in vs to find all of the public variables in the project

1234205
google-chrome	firefox
this is possible in firefox ie google-chrome and more importantly vs2008

1234246

1234594
toolbar	tabs
i want to create an app with tabs like selectable toolbar from bwtoolkit i try it but still has lots of bugs

1234620
multiplying	multiplication
don t divide a bazillion times by len_best compute its inverse one outside the loop and multiplying by that inverse -- also you don t need to do that multiplication inside the loop you can do it at the end in a separate since it s the same value that s multiplying every item -- this saves no memory but avoids wantonly wasting cpu time

1234623
post	get
this post sounds similar except they get a message undeliverable error and i don t

1234631

1234649
rss	feed
as usual -- if you re a powershell geek you owe him a spot in your rss feed

1234651
integer	fractions
however if your primary key s are integer by nature you better specify precision as 0 to make sure no fractions value ever gets to your table

1234672
post	get
is there a way for me to access its local get and post functions in a way that i can call them

1234689
post	get
note though that if you want to use your x and y variables in get or post you should make them a list

1234698
getter	setter
that s the trick of flex actionscript 3 s getter and setter methods

1234716
post	put
since struts is already available as an osgi-bundle in the central maven repository see accepted answer i put that solution in a separate question answer post

1234732
ethernet	wireless
because to connect broadband he needs to be connected to an ethernet port so then he cannot be wireless

1234817
google-chrome	firefox
the problem is that on google-chrome the stream works ok but on firefox 3.5.2 it stopps after a few seconds

1234865
int	double
if you will be storing value types structs int double etc. then the cost of boxing unboxing will most likely balance things out and i would recommend the dictionary t instead

1234930
post	get
i added support for updating build steps and a few other minor things which outside the scope of this blog post but this should hopefully get you started

1234945
pull	push
you can fake different ones especially in .net because after all they are presented as managed streams which would be fine at the push pull and of the pipe

1234957
put	get
you then put a comma after each item in the array and you can get to the requried string that you are looking for

1234985
post	put
you could post a message when put is called and the consumers could listen to the message

1234991
rss	feed
you may want to consider grabbing the rss feed for the search and parsing that

1235025
getter	setter
it s like a simplified way to create getter and setter letting you make for instance public getter and private setter

1235029
getter	setter
a property is i ll qualify this with usually - i m not sure that it s a technically clear word that has unambiguous meaning across multiple languages is a publicly accessible aspect of the object through getter and setter methods

pop-up	dialog
if you look at the value in my_variable now it will be whatever was typed in the zenity pop-up entry dialog

1235077
implements	extends
by the way extends thread is not generally as good as implements runnable for quite a few reasons

1235114
post	get
you could also implement this a method on the postrepository to get all of the post by a given user

1235116
firefox	safari
in firefox the jquery file shows as a 19k request but safari shows it as a 56k request

1235125
implements	extends
conceivably you could extends a and implements runnable and use

1235147
getter	setter
not all languages have properties java only has fields that must be accessed by getter and setter

1235179
for-loop	loops
i know i could write this using a for-loop but i wish to avoid for loops whenever necessary and a simple direct method should exist somewhere

1235181
public	protected
this public constructor is then able to call the protected super constructor

1235182
expression-blend	silverlight
register the silverlight toolkit s controls with visual studio s toolbox and expression-blend s control library

ant	maven
an additional path for those not so keen on maven unable to port or perfectly happy with ant ivy

1235273
put	get
you cannot put checkboxes in a dropdown unfortunately the closest you could get is something like

1235282
button	checkbox
if your team or company uses a regular set of styles for all controls of a certain type button checkbox you name it consider using the implicit style manager functionality a value-add for silverlight to do implicit styles

1235300
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
i would do the regular ie check except early versions of firefox do not support it nor does early safari or opera

1235305
versioning	upgrade
the other suggestion was to upgrade the versioning which also makes a lot of sense

1235306
next	except
control will pass to the next finally or except

1235349
stdout	stderr
normally unhandled exceptions go to the stdout or stderr

1235368

i m using the fb.connect.showpermissiondialog function to initiate the connect process and grant permissions how can i force it to always use the pop-up window connect dialog instead of the overlay method

1235396
iequalitycomparer	iequatable
so if you implement iequatable correctly you do not have to pass a custom iequalitycomparer

1235430
pull	push
you should make the action of the radio button be to change the visibility of the div that is push the status to it rather than to pull the div status via the radio button status at render time which as andrejs said will be unset

1235481
versioning	upgrade
when browsing the repository i see revisions prior to the move so if you aren t i guess it s time to upgrade to a more recent versioning

1235540
put	get
i ve managed to get the data out of the database and i put it into a two-dimensional array

1235549

1235574
vim	emacs
the main reason you seem to think people like emacs vim is for code completion

1235574
vim	emacs
people like emacs vim cause they are both made for editing text

1235574
vim	emacs
emacs vim can handle all of them natively or by exntensions

1235578
pthreads	fork
pthreads does offer a pthread_atfork function - in theory you could take every lock in the program before fork release them after and maybe make it out alive - but it s risky because you could always miss one

1235585
children	parent
how can you constrain the parent when no children have been added yet and how can you add children without a parent

1235585
children	parent
you could create a new table called something like validparents that only has the parent ids that have n children and keep it in sync with triggers

1235612
restrict	shared
the reason its not easy to restrict memory usage is there is only one heap which is shared

1235652
post	get
i am using a post verb but even after setting the webmethod cacheduration attribute the json doesn t get cached

1235658
uilabel	uitextview
if you don t want to use uitextview as recommended you can continue to use your uilabel and set to make it multiline

1235690
int	double
double float int long short string

1235692
folder	directory
if the directory returned by one of these methods does not point where you thought it did you ll need to move the location of your application or the location of this folder so that it is within the same directory as the app

1235721
profiling	benchmarking
similar to codeigniter profiling class the profiling class will display benchmarking results queries you have run and _post data at the bottom of your pages

1235722
accessor	properties
i think the way to go would be to add an x header in the asp generation code then test for that looking at the email headers in your addin using properties accessor

1235766
qgraphicsview	qgraphicsitem
i have a single main window with a qgraphicsview and lots of qgraphicsitem objects

1235792
for-loop	loops
but that would require a for-loop in a while loops every time i would want to loops through some data

1235867
fflush	gets
finally the number of cck fields and content types you have does affect how much work gets done when caches are fflush and rebuilt

1235869
children	parent
create a materialized join view that joins them together and counts the number of children grouped by the parent

1236027
versioning	upgrade
in each of the versioning folders are the sql scripts to create the database initially v100 and to patch upgrade the database structure in subsequent versioning v110 etc.

1236040
domcontentloaded	onload
this takes advantage of domcontentloaded - which fires before onload - but allows you to stick in all your unobtrusiveness.

1236044
prototypejs	mootools
the closest standard alternative addeventlistener is not supported by internet explorer it uses attachevent so you will likely want to use a library jquery mootools prototypejs etc. to abstract the cross-browser ugliness for you

1236101
lisp	scheme
scheme or any lisp variant

1236230
post	put
rather than post all my html css markup here i have put up a version of the site here

1236291
rss	feed
here is an example of the rss feed its trying to parse

1236302

in other words when you hit back in a landscape view controller instead of animating to the right off the screen it animates vertically down as if it was in portrait orientation

1236310
union	distinct
union is doing an implicit distinct on oracle

1236350
updatepanel	ascx
the problem is whenever i place a asp.net button or an updatepanel the ascx doesn t load

1236351

1236354
puts	gets
the web server gets one of the connections runs some queries puts the connection back in the pool

1236370
stdout	stderr
you can redirect stdout stderr somewhere to get the output

1236397
ienumerable	iqueryable
i used the asqueryable to get the result as a iqueryable rather than ienumerable

1236458
mouseover	mouseenter
i could be wrong but i think there may be inherent problems with using a mouseover or mouseenter event to control a vertical accordion -- unless you really know what the submenus are going to be like

1236458
mouseover	mouseenter
you fire all the mouseover out or mouseenter leave events for #3 #4 #5.

1236546
comparator	comparable
implementing the comparable interface means that the class supports certain functions which the interface requires specifically the comparator method that the sorting or other operations being performed on the class will utilize to do their work without having to care about the rest of the class

1236551
comparator	comparable
it means that class a can be sorted using the comparable comparator method

1236551
comparator	comparable
comparable only gives you one way to do it but you can have several comparator instances

1236552
nsurlconnection	nsoperation
take a look at dave dribin s blog post on concurrency with nsoperation that shows how to encapsulate an nsurlconnection session

1236552
udp	tcp
if you are not talking about accessing a web service or site where nsurlconnection is appropriate you can instead use cocoa async socket if it s straight tcp ip or udp

1236555
superclass	subclassing
you can t just cast a superclass to its subclassing

1236559
integer	fractions
in c++ 5 4 1 not 1.25 - because 5 and 4 are both integers so the result will be an integer and thus the fractions part of the result is thrown away

1236563
vim	emacs
i am used to emacs but i am trying out vim to see which one i like better

1236572
rss	feed
the reason i am attempting to do this is to create an rss feed out of a website that has a username and password part where the user has to log in

1236586
vim	emacs
i m not sure exactly what you re trying to achieve i ve never used emacs but you can run commands in vim by typing

srp	principles
the solution to your problem lies in remembering srp single responsibility principles and soc separation of concerns

1236787
monodevelop	sharpdevelop
use sharpdevelop windows or monodevelop nix

1236798
post	get
in your post you mentioned that it use libpcap to grab packets but as i know libpcap will just get a copy of the incoming packet and then that packet will still pass into the normal kernel stack path and that may be not what you want

1236825
equals	gethashcode
for example if a base class you inherit provides a gethashcode and an equals method overriding equals but not gethashcode breaks platform-documented rules developers are supposed to follow when they override equals

1236826
int	double
lastly i changed your assumption that the parameter be an int between zero and one-hundred to be a double between zero and one

1236826
multiplying	subtract
if the parameter is greater than 0.5 multiplying lambda by two and subtract one this maps onto and return the interpolated color between color b and color c

1236854
gif	png
you can make the green part of the arrow transparent and save it as a gif or png since the slope appears to be 45 degrees no jaggies in gif

1236864
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
internet explorer ie 8 and later performs case-sensitive search while ie 7 and earlier performs case-insensitive search

1236880
serializable	deserialization
automatic serializable deserialization might not suffice for the object

1236880
serializable	deserialization
while the system could typically serializable these raw values without trouble deserialization could easily result in something that is not usable

1236884
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
firefox is temporarily lagging behind but both google-chrome and safari are extremely fast

1236923
versioning	upgrade
my best guess is that its something caused by the upgrade between .net versioning - maybe something wrong in the web.config

1236954
sdlc	methodology
risk management doesn t replace any part of the sdlc or a typical methodology

1236975
autocomplete	multi-select
i don t think the ajaxhelper can produce a multi-select autocomplete box it s not what it s designed to do

inherited	properties
i would defintly recommend using as few static properties methods as possible especially if you are trying to work with inherited at least with php 5.3

1236993
awt	swing
i want to support the native look and feel and thus i have to use awt instead of swing

1236993
awt	swing
am i correct in thinking that in order to support the native look and feel we should use awt instead of swing

1237008
button	checkbox
. because i have seen in dojo.js they have their own controls as we create in dojo. button checkbox etc...

1237072
accessor	properties
this way you can defined funations static frunctions instance properties by its accessor and constructor

1237135
pull	push
is it possible to set up git as a cgi program so that one can push as well as pull from it

1237146
pull	push
you re still each going to have to use local repositories for your changes but when you want to work with the central repo use the git push and pull commands

1237164
mouse	keyboard
the change event fires fine when the current item is selected using the mouse but when i scroll through the items using the keyboard the event is not fired and my code never executes

1237194
post	get
interpreting the captured packets takes some experience so if you get stuck feel free to post more data here

1237200
vb.net	vb6
from my readings it is possible to use a vb6 com library in vb.net or at least it is supposed to be able to. as it should be possible in vb.net and since .net runs on the clr and since ironpython does to logically can t i access this ancient dll from ironpython

1237208
g++	gcc
you can use -static or -s option for static linking in gcc or g++

1237226
mouse	keyboard
you ll want both onchange and onkeypress to account for both mouse and keyboard interaction respectively

1237242
vb6	vba
you simply go to the add reference dialog select the com tab select the library much like in the vb6 vba references dialog and you re basically done

1237306
freebsd	linux
this is not the case on other x86 platforms such as linux win32 freebsd .

1237323
hide	show
you can call is when the movie is 100 loaded and then again from the last frame of the movie so you d be getting the flash movie to say show me and then later hide me

today i can easily support linux opensolaris freebsd and even cygwin

1237360
fastcgi	scgi
this is web project that uses apis that popular in unix world like cgi fastcgi and scgi that implemented in most unix web servers

1237360
decltype	auto
i probably would never be able to support visual studio maybe 2010 with c++0x support because i relay on c++0x decltype auto feature or typeof __typeof__ extension that is supported by most compilers i worked with gcc intel sun studio

1237360
fastcgi	scgi
the project relates to standard web server api as fastcgi or scgi that allows to accept many requests over sinlge socket

1237360
apache	nginx	apache	lighttpd	nginx	lighttpd
thus implementing one or two standard protocols i open communication with any existing server apache lighttpd nginx cherokee.

1237390
getter	setter
fbjs has its own getter and setter

1237434
crypt	md5
if i will store an array of information account - fullname address userid password in a various servers and i would want to encrypt the password using md5 question is everytime i ll add the account into ldap servers since that s what we re using then does that mean that everytime i save password i ll have to use crypt function

1237483
salt	md5
an md5 encrypted password usually includes a random salt to make it more difficult to perform dictionary attacks

1237504
jobs	cron
in fact it s invoked by several simultaneous cron jobs that run at 2 mins 5 mins and x mins interval - so yes compile-time is crucial here.

1237524
maven	m2e
i am trying out m2e the eclipse plugin for maven and have noticed that the resources are now excluded from the build path of all my projects

1237527
sin	sqrt
when you use the sin and sqrt kind of functions they will work at double anyways

1237527

to convert a double to an int value check this page

1237527
floating-point	integer
how can i convert a floating-point value to an integer in c

1237538
inherited	properties
try inherited the class you want to modify and override the corresponding properties

1237553
mvp	presenter
in the past years i have been using my own implementation of mvp with a very passive view that enslaves itself to whatever the presenter tells him to do

1237553
dependency-injection	factories
the constructor parameters of the views enable super-easy testing but without a solid dependency-injection framework one will have some ugly factories setup code inside onmoduleload

1237561
hide	show
create the page dialogs with the main dialog not the tab as their parent and as the user switches between tabs simply show and hide the relevant page dialog

1237595
google-chrome	firefox
the next code removes the textarea tags in firefox google-chrome so the content can be accessed in arr 1

1237602
width	height
d- d- s. s width height md5hash original_extension

1237609
geocoding	geocode
app engine doesn t have built-in geocoding or routing so you re left with two options load map data into app engine and geocode route locally or call out to a web service

1237629
listview	gridview
i have got a listview item with a gridview child bound to a list of objects

1237659
int	chars
added also be aware that the chars that separates the fractions part from the int one differs from country to country

1237667
int	chars
that means llist is a type just like int or file or chars that is a shorthand for struct node your linked-list node structure

1237670
typedef	struct
c requires that you reference struct with a struct prefix so it s common to introduce a typedef for less verbose mention

1237722
hide	show
the hide and show will run for each element found hence this might explain why it seems a infinite loop is occuring

1237732
typedef	struct
typedef creates a new type in your program so the return value and types of parameters of those functions are just your struct

1237760
postgresql	mysql
the nemo collaboration building a cosmic neutrino detector underwater had much of the same problems and they used mysql and postgresql without major problems

1237787
post	get
from what i get from your post you want the dynamic typing goodness and that stuff is implemented in ironrubymvc

1237803
cstring	bstr
oh and you have to do a detach before assigning bstr value of variant to cstring

1237826
debugdiag	debugging
a very relevant article is debugging heap corruption with application verifier and debugdiag

1237862
spweb	spsite
i ve looked as the close method in refelector for spweb which is called by spweb.dispose and there is nothing in it to indicate the actual spsite member field is disposed of

1237862
spweb	spsite
put it in a loop which runs 100 times and use the sprequeststacktrace registry key described in troubleshooting spsite spweb leaks in wss v3 and moss 2007 to check that your test code is the source of the problem.

1237897
min	max
other idea would be to use several loops for generating and each loop having it s own set of min - max values

1237916
division	modulo
then you pretty much just have modulo and division operations to split the value down

1238002
hex	binary
i have a string that has both binary and string characters and i would like to convert it to binary first then to hex

1238003
children	parent
you can create your tables as normal with a 1 m relationship then on the child table have a count column with a check constraint that determines how many children can exist for a parent as well as a unique constraint over the parent id + count column

1238003
children	parent
the only thing this doesn t guarantee is that for each parent there are at least five children

1238017
junit	testng
to run them together there are few options available but i have chosen using different profiles for junit and testng

1238017
junit	testng
since if we add testng dependency to main project in maven it will skip all junit i have decided to put it in separate profile

1238027
spweb	spsite
there is stefan s blog that states you need to ensure that you only dispose spsite and spweb objects that your code owns

1238027
spweb	spsite
put it in a loop which runs 100 times and use the sprequeststacktrace registry key described in troubleshooting spsite spweb leaks in wss v3 and moss 2007 to check that your test code is the source of the problem

1238050
getter	setter
you can view and modify the reference using a getter and a setter

1238100
installation	upgrade
the basic idea is to develop an automatic upgrade framework that knows how to upgrade from an existing sql schema to the newer sql schema and can build an upgrade path for every existing db installation

1238110
inherited	properties	webclient	webrequest
the webclient doesn t have a timeout properties however it is possible to inherited from the webclient to give access to timeout on the internal webrequest used

1238113
division	multiplication
converting between units mathematically merely involves a simple one or two step process of division or multiplication depending on which way you are going between units

1238135
serializable	deserialization
when you have to read only 3 properties i suppose you can write code that manually read from that node and have a full control of how it is executed instead of relying on serializable deserialization

1238166
inherited	properties
could you inherited from the class and hide the properties

1238181
getter	setter
- a viewmodel which wraps the service proxy classes intercepting the setter and getter

1238248
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
opera safari google-chrome and firefox 3.5 also support the nth-child n selector so you can target specific columns

pull	push
or if you have a thick client app you can pull down the records to the client show the report and - if approved - push them back up

1238271
versioning	upgrade
you ll either need to upgrade django or roll your own selectdatewidget perhaps by copying the versioning from trunk into your own project tree if you can t upgrade django

1238295
ant	maven
as far as making the filtering quicker i don t know of any other simple mechanism that will help as you ve said you need either ant or maven to run the filtering and they both take some time to set up before building resulting in the slow down

1238296
put	get	textarea	pre
for ff use a pre behind textarea paste text before cursor into it put a marker html element after it cursorpos and get the cursor position via that marker element

1238296
textarea	pre
notes | code is ugly sorry for that | pre and textarea font must be the same | opacity is utilized for visualization | there is no autocomplete just a cursor following div here as you type inside textarea modify it based on your need

1238308
pascal	delphi
i ve programmed since i was very young on several languages mostly pascal delphi c c++ sql python sometimes in other languages such as java php or perl so i m not a newbie programmer but apart from basic html i ve little experience on the front-end side of web programming css html javascript and ajax because on my former professional projects if there was web programming somebody would do the frontend part

i have tried --trace-children yes option of valgrind memcheck ...but my application xyz signals another application zzz to start a new intance of xyz process which i want to analyze

1238424
pop-up	dialog
this could be with a onclick handler like tsvanharen posted or with a simple text dialog inside the page instead of a nagging pop-up

1238424
hide	show
i use prototype hence the tag and the show hide for it

1238494
hash	md5
i need to create the hash of a the html of a webpage from its url using sha1 or md5 in java but i don t know how to do it.

1238502
spweb	spsite
it seems that you cannot really have a spweb without having a spsite

1238502
spweb	spsite
so if you got the spweb without going through spsite to get it either by doing a new spsite or one being provided to you then you probably do not need to worry about disposing the spsite

1238509
post	get
if you re deleting something you should always use post and not get so using confirm is a bad idea

1238549
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
it works in opera and firefox but doens t work on safari under the windows

1238549
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
it works in opera and firefox but not in safari

1238549
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
local link works well in firefox opera and safari but safari shows alert1 alert2 and then alert with src for some reason while other browsers show alert1 alertsrc alert2

1238549
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
google link opera firefox - works well alert1 alertsrc alert2 but safari doesn t - show alertsrc

1238583
put	get
probably the most straightforward way to do this in vanilla javascript would be to put the javascript function in the page and use the server tags to get the rendered clientid

1238601
hide	show
if you re using the textbox because later you want to be able to select all the output to copy and paste it i would have the textbox hidden by default and have a button that says like toggle raw output that will show hide the text field so users can get the text easily

1238628
hash	md5
my plan was to use md5 hash as the existing passwords can be easily altered with the mysql function and i was expecting to find an easy solution for the gwt-ext side as well

1238628
hash	md5
but as i found out java.security is not supported by gwt and there doesn t seem to be any other implementation that can be used to change the password string to a md5 hash on client side

1238792
unsigned	short
what could it do set a flag on the pointer saying by the way when you load from this you have to also do a sign conversion and then check this flag on all unsigned short loads

1238794
inotifypropertychanged	ieditableobject
by implementing idataerrorinfo in your domain entities and possibly ieditableobject and inotifypropertychanged you give them the ability to get databound on many .net presentation technologies windows forms wpf asp .net... without much code

1238799
children	parent
children get a copy of the parent s state at the time of the fork

1238799
children	parent
so if the parent has a counter or other property then the children will see the value at the time of they were forked but not if the parent subsequently alters it

1238808
sat	np-complete
if you can define your problem in terms of a boolean formula you could throw a sat solver at it but note that the 3sat problem boolean variable assignment over three-variable clauses is np-complete and its first-order-logic big brother the quantified boolean formula problem which uses the existential quantifier as well as the universal quantifier is pspace-complete

1238849
google-chrome	firefox
the trouble is choosing a good value for x since for this particular page google-chrome is so very much faster than firefox which is faster than ie

1238857
uninstall	upgrade
it is a free tool offering a user friendly install upgrade uninstall of sharepoint solutions

1238881
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and probably google-chrome but not ie8 text-decoration none is ignored and the underline stretches unattractively across the bottom of the url

1238896
superclass	subclassing
unfortunately it s usually pretty difficult to implements a nice non-brittle solution since it more often than not requires the use of subclassing and intimate knowledge of the superclass internals something which may or may not require monkey patching

1238934
udp	tcp
this makes it possible for a udp or bsd socket based application to establish a wwan connection by using the cfsocketstream api to establish a connection with a tcp server including http web servers

touchesbegan	touchesmoved
every touch sequence beginning from touchesbegan until a bunch of touchesmoved has an execution delay that looks like this

1239140
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
firefox google-chrome and safari all implement it according to the css 2.1 specification

1239140
google-chrome	firefox
thus in firefox and google-chrome the text-decoration you re encountering is not on the inserted content but rather on the parent anchor element that contains the inserted content

1239699
datediff	difference
use datediff to calculate difference between two dates in required units

1239735
idictionary	ilist
if you don t want to implement a version of ilist idictionary as statenjason suggested you could create a wrapper

jlabel	jslider
if your jlabel is a member field of the class that contains the code you can refer to the jlabel within the jslider s change listener like so

1239798
hide	show
what i would like the code to do is exactly what it does now but instead of just show hide i want it to slide down and up revealing more or less content

1239825
versioning	upgrade
if you are deploying via clickonce even if you get around the gac issue you note above perhaps by having your it department push out a gac registration of the interop assemblies if this is a corporate environment you will need to handle situations where users have a different versioning of office than the standard -- and heaven help you when office 13 comes out and users start to upgrade and it breaks your application

1239828
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
when touchesbegan i d start a interval that pulls at 60hz until touchesmoved takes action

typically you ll also want to pass through the array size as another parameter or image width height bpp which provides the same info since there s no way in c c++ to tell that easily

1240134
range	minimum
the standard only defines the minimum range for each of those types

1240134

1240205
hide	show
but i think the challenge for me is to show the one that i choosed and to hide the other ones..

1240216
versioning	upgrade
in clickonce when you install a new versioning of your application applicationsettingsbase will detect it and automatically upgrade settings for you at the point settings are loaded

1240216

this will ensure that upgrade is called only the first time the application runs after a new versioning is deployed

1240227
dmz	was
take the router out and put your target computer where your router was or enable dmz this only makes sense if there was only one computer behind the router

all hash will be salt

1240718
hash	salt
generation - does hash salt + auto_increment_pk + created_timestamp suffice

min	max
error 1140 42000 at line 1 mixing of group columns min max count ... with no group columns is illegal if there is no group by clause

1240795
min	max
if you are going to use aggregate functions like min max avg etc. you need to tell the database what exactly it needs to take the min of

1240806
post	get
one thing if you don t trust the users with their ids sending them over get or post will not work

1240845
sorting	filtering
paging filtering and sorting right now happen within the sql query

1240851
hash	md5
the password is hash md5 and stored in the registry

1240852
hash	md5
i thought that it wasn t possible feasible to decrypt md5 hash

1240858
ubuntu	linux
where are include files stored - ubuntu linux gcc

1240859
width	height
.moo .attr href width 600 height 300e

1240869
hash	md5
md5 is not encryption though it may be used as part of some encryption algorithms it is a one way hash function

1240869
hash	md5
that means that there are 2 128 possible md5 hash

1240869
division	modulo
next perform integer division using some large probably primes n and take the remainder see modulo

1240869
hash	salt
that is one reason why you should always salt hash passwords so that two identical values when hash will not hash to the same value

1240871
spaces	delimiter
something like this should work - for the exact formatting you ll need to tweak the portions - add more spaces or other delimiter

1240875
hash	md5
because of the pigeonhole principle there is likely more than one value that hash to any given md5 output

1240875
hash	md5
moreover md5 is made to make it difficult to find any such reversed hash however there have been attacks that produce collisions - that is produce two values that hash to the same result but you can t control what the resulting md5 value will be

1240880
hash	md5
cryptographic hash md5 etc... are one way and you can t get back to the original message with only the digest unless you have some other information about the original message etc

1240882
hash	md5
md5 is considered broken not because you can get back the original content from the hash but because with work you can craft two messages that hash to the same hash

1240882
hash	md5
you cannot un-hash an md5 hash

1240890
hash	salt
it is pretty feasible if your passwords are hash without a salt

1240929
hash	md5
i d don t really know what excel interop can do but in standard c# .net the quickest way to hash a password in md5 format is use

1240945
superclass	subclassing
in my domain model i ve modeled the different types of benefits as subclassing with an abstract superclass which has the common properties

1240960
inherited	properties
what does the inherited bool properties on attributes refers to

1241019
put	get
put this all together and you get

1241027
vmware	esx
i did a write-up about it on my blog a while back titled simulating slow wan links with dummynet and vmware esx

1241049
inherited	properties
i want to be able to generate a strongly typed class that inherited from configurationreader and exposes properties named for the keys in the xml template file

1241102
free	malloc
malloc is free to do anything it wants as long as you get your single seat

1241110
int	boolean
1 with regard to other data types such as value data types int float boolean etc and reference types user-defined objects etc how are arrays and strings in java different

1241121
inherited	subclassing
when inherited true which is the default it means that the attribute you are creating can be inherited by subclassing of the class decorated by the attribute

1241336
comparator	comparable
you can either have your beans implement comparable in which case you just compare them directly or you create a comparator -

1241338
post	get
i m sure there s a work around to use get for emails but the alternative post is much more easier and doesn t require any hacks to get around

1241340
put	get
if you put date in a file template it will get transformed when the file is created to the current date

1241358

i have the need to trigger the opening of the browser ie firefox safari etc context-menu via javascript

1241530
post	get
so take advantage of that feature post like 300 questions to them to get your work done

1241554
hide	show
my problem is when i hide the widgets they are hidden as intended but the custom css is used on this and as these are hidden the border still show up

1241558
ggplot2	lattice
the most obvious methods that come to my mind are to use either lattice or ggplot2

1241558
ggplot2	lattice
i think you should be fine with either lattice or ggplot2

1241564
width	height
saying that form size left bottom width height will be modified

1241567
subtraction	addition
there is a family of operators we can call assignment by xyz where xyz here represents a binary operation on operands of the same type such as addition subtraction concatenation

1241594
int	chars
in fact the table contains exactly one row and the blob column contains some valid ascii chars data a serialize d php int

1241628
post	get
when generating htlm output like you re doing to get data into the form s fields when someone is trying to edit a post or if you need to re-display the form because the user forgot one field for instance you d probably use htmlspecialchars it will escape and -- depending on the options you give it

1241628
postgresql	mysql
it is better safer to use a function that fits the engine mysql postgresql ... you are working with it ll know precisely what to escape and how

1241636
jboss	glassfish
i have done certain research using mom with jboss and glassfish but one of the most important impact was the permanent storage if you are going to use any

1241645
width	height
i m trying to reuse swing s built in html support and it works perfectly if i hard code the height passed to view.paint but i can t figure out how to determine how tall the bounds of the rendered content would be at runtime given a specific width

1241665
jobs	cron
now i wouldn t recommend this but would suggest that you use sql instead as this approach is very hacky and possible a bit insecure to run cron jobs with admin privs

1241756
mouse	keyboard
i would like to have program a timer that will count the seconds during which there is mouse movement or any keyboard movement

1241820
mouse	keyboard
it sleeps for a second before getting the information so it reports a time of around a thousand milliseconds assuming you use the mouse or keyboard to run it

1241822
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in firefox google-chrome but in ie the only thing that pops up is a box asking to download the .gz file which contains the html document for the page

1241829
bazaar	git
the merge resolution in git and in mercurial and in bazaar is very very good

1241838
post	get
however when i run these commands against the processid for a coldfusion application server on this vista64 machine i get the error message in the title of this post

1241840
post	get
you mean you want to send data over get or post

1241843
filtering	grouping
grouping by month is innesessary in mysql since your month is filtering and mysql supports selecting an ungrouped column in a select list of a grouping by query returning a random value within the grouping

1241875
width	height
the height can t be calculated until the width is known

1241876
jar	manifest.mf
i suspect it s vastly simpler to find the manifest in a jar file from c# than the assembly version from java though - it s just a case of loading a zip file and finding the meta-inf manifest.mf file

1241942
uppercase	ord
i tried using a validator and transforming the value of the key event object to the uppercase letter char value using ord however i could not find any set methods

1241953
rss	feed
you could include inline blocks as part of each entry s body but this rather defeats the entire purpose of rss atom feed imo and is likely to be filtered out by many readers

1241958
public	protected
it s even neater to make the provided method private or protected depending on your needs and create public convience methods so you can hide the implementation details

1241964
rss	feed
i want to publish more data in the rss feed under different fields but cannot figure out if this is even possible

1241969
for-loop	loops
the only difference between java s for-loop syntax and c s is you can declare variables in the initialization field 1st section of loops

1241995
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and firefox return the html supplied by the original document in this case

1241996
swt	swing
the two most popular options are swing and swt

postgresql	mysql
if you are worried about the cost of purchasing a database there are very good proven open source databases out there such as mysql and postgresql that won t cost you anything

1242132
put	get
still it s another project to put in your portfolio to help you get more professional work

1242154
irc	icq
i have icq and irc applications that essentially just sit there waiting for the server to send it something

1242165
put	get
since you put the initialize_devices one on top it renders that one with higher priority which is why you always get that

1242185
for-loop	loops
is the condition in a for-loop re-evaluated on every loops

1242207
post	get
i think your post table will have to get very large for the query times to really become an issue

1242243
put	get
instead you could create an attachedproperty previouslyused to put on the togglebutton s and use bindings so they get their value a bit more automagically

1242261
min	max
i suppose that old windows stored min max and close buttons icons as a truetype font

1242263
hash	md5
and then check the cookie against the column ex which contains the md5 hash in the database

1242335
nsmutablestring	nsstring
i have extended both nsstring and nsmutablestring with some convenience methods using categories

1242335
nsmutablestring	nsstring
for i have implemented the ruby strip function that removes space characters at the endpoints for both but for nsstring it returns a new string and for nsmutablestring it uses the deletecharactersinrange to strip the existing string and return it like the ruby strip

1242335
nsmutablestring	nsstring
the problem is that when i declare nsstring s and run s strip it tries to run the nsmutablestring version and raises an extension

1242356
post	get
i may try to post actual working code later if i get a chance

1242374
nsmutablestring	nsstring
you ve been bitten by an implementation detail some nsstring objects are instances of a subclass of nsmutablestring with only a private flag controlling whether the object is mutable or not

1242374
nsmutablestring	nsstring
since i went through nsstring and not nsmutablestring this object is not mutable

1242376
datalist	repeater
datalist or repeater

1242390
mockups	balsamiq
we use balsamiq mockups to create our website wireframes

we use telerik and before that we were using componentart

1242533
put	get
what s the best place to put this code and how can i make it accessible from the models that need to get at it

1242535
int	chars
still that wouldn t work because you want a chars array for write and not a raw int which will print garbage

1242599
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
i tested the layout on ie7 mozilla 3.0.1 google-chrome 2.0.xxx safari 3.1 and opera 9.51

1242613
instances	transient
object references an unsaved transient instances - save the transient instances before flushing

1242622
switching	screens
our users were quick to point out that with the current character based interface they could have over a dozen telnet based terminal sessions going at the same time on their pc screens which enabled them to multitask or task switching with high efficiency

1242645
min	max
i would like to set different zoom min max levels for each map but

1242645
min	max
seems to set the same min max for both maps i can t set them to different levels

1242659
bazaar	svn
bazaar fundamentally works with one branch directory the branch are visible at the file system level so if you need to clone each branch from your repository not unlike svn in a way

1242693
width	height
then just set the border width and leave the height alone

1242725
gif	bmp	gif	png	bmp	png
we managed to get the code to work very well for bmp png and gif files and pf1bit pf4bit pf8bit pf16bit and pf24bit images

1242727
free	malloc
if possible it is better to do malloc free in the same scope imo it makes the code much more readable - memory allocation in c is already hard enough

1242727
free	malloc
in your case you would first malloc call the function and free after outside the function

1242739
pull	push
when i ve finished a feature i push it up to the master and then log in to the production server and pull it to the working directory there

1242741
opera	safari
opera has the best css3 support followed by webkit safari

1242741
lan	intranet
if you re writing an intranet application on a lan this would probably have a negligible impact but on a slow connection that could make your pages appear unresponsive

1242747
instances	transient
instances - save the transient instances

1242747
instances	transient
if you google object references an unsaved transient instances you will find several matches for this

1242761
rss	feed
i m trying to use curl to grab an external web page to put into my own website it s basically a ladder of a sports team i contacted them but they do not have a rss feed of the ladder so i m trying to obtain the ladder by other means is it possible to grab everything between table and table using curl

1242771
for-loop	loops
to aleviate the boilerplating of the second type where the third clause was often unused and to compliment the generics introduced in java 1.5 the second of your two examples - the enhanced for-loop or the for-each loops - was introduced

1242771
for-loop	arrays
this new style for-loop can be used with arrays as well

1242852
free	malloc
if you are using linux with a recent glibc and are using that malloc you can return free d memory to the os

1242865
nsmutablestring	nsstring
so while it s not legal to change the return type of method from nsstring to void it would be legal to change it from nsstring to nsmutablestring

1242868
umbraco	dotnetnuke
we build cms s with asp.net using tools such as umbraco and dotnetnuke etc

1242910

1242953
listview	gridview
i have a wpf listview that i am replacing the view with gridview to give me columns etc

1242981
width	height
personally i find that inline styles are usually code-smells unless used for last-minute width and height purposes in variable-size boxes situations

1243004
put	get
you can put the timer in an iframe if you can t get rid of the postback

1243023
stdout	fflush
if you write to another file handle that is also associated with the terminal and might be unbuffered make sure you first explicitly fflush stdout

1243032
post	get
i am trying to get bulletin type post on my site and only show ones posted by a friend of a user but some users have a few thousand friends and bulletins could be in the thousands but only some of them a user is allowed to view

1243055
post	get
if you d post a bit of each array not all 10 000 items the first 10 would do you may get more bites

1243057
postgresql	mysql
if the answer is a relational database mysql postgresql then this should be done using a sql query as it is quite trivial and much more efficient than anything you could do in php

1243069
sorting	filtering
you could do the sorting and filtering using join s and where s on the right tables

1243111
google-chrome	firefox
of course none of this happens in google-chrome or firefox

1243162
post	get
how can we get post the request to server with scriptaculous.js or prototype.js

1243173

1243178
post	get
and for post replace get by post

1243180
powerpc	i386

int	double
if you do that everywhere you use int 3 you will then have a nice list of places which you can double click on to take you straight to the offending code

1243476
children	parent
there is an alternative solution to force each parent to have exactly either 0 or n children without materialized views using just check foreign key and uniqueness constraints

1243476
children	parent
the uniqueness constraint and the check for the child_nr field take care that a parent has at most 5 children

1243489
apache	lighttpd
it is supported by lighttpd and newer versions of apache

1243506

1243570
config	ini
you can then simply parse the ini file and use your config settings like that

1243583
system.in	system.out
the only useful methods in a socket are getinputstream and getoutputstream but if youâ re running as a cgi you already have those theyâ re called system.in and system.out

cvs	svn
newer tools like git have much better merge support and tracking than old-style tools such as cvs and svn

1244316
public	protected
if the shared code can use just the public interface of the class so it doesn t access private member variables protected functions etc. you should consider whether other classes might want to use the same code

1244364
for-loop	arrays
the for-loop in your code leaves a trailing at the end of the arrays

1244371
children	parent
the id of the parent is then the id of the direct children with the last character removed

nsstring	nsdata
a kind of nsdata nsstring nsnumber

1244418
nsnull	nsdata
depending on the type of data you could put in a placeholder instead of nsnull and then do a process before after loading the .plist like for example using a zero-length nsdata object to represent your nsnull in the plist

1244418
nsnull	nsdata
then after loading translate the empty nsdata back to nsnull

1244434
button	checkbox
what i would like to do this is the reason why i m interested in the api of the generic baseclasses like powerobject or windowobject is to recursively iterate over all gui elements windows tables button checkbox you name it using powerscript in powerbuilder 11.0

1244471
folder	dir
although when i launch dir c directly from the command line i get the expected result so there is no dir particular setup on my system. trying to pass a token -w or on any other option seems not to work i just get the name of the folder files contained in the drive but no other information whatsoever

1244551
solaris	bsd
solaris bsd should probably be supported too if you do it right

1244557
textmate	bbedit
i agree textmate is great for mac yet so is bbedit lots of nice features plus with html tidy it can clean up and validate your code

1244576
bazaar	git	vim	emacs
if you re doing web development you probably should use the tools every good coder use a programmable editor like vim or emacs and some version control system i d recommend using a decentralised one like mercurial git or bazaar

1244588
innodb	myisam
this is especially efficient on myisam since the is instant but even in innodb it s 10 times more efficient than order by rand

various flags are used at the windows api level to controls certain aspects of each window instance the existing of a control box border min max buttons etc. but the border width for resizable windows is determined by a system setting to ensure uniformity and is not configurable on a window by window basis

1244676
min	max
this entails rendering your own caption bar min max buttons and window border

1244737
width	height
just use the width of the char to inset from the right side and the height of the char to offset vertically between chars

1244770

while it is true that the visible line surrounding an icon in a jtogglebutton can be made invisible by using setborderpainted false the same is not true for jcheckbox and jradiobutton

1245227
jcheckbox	jradiobutton
i can not use the jtogglebutton and therefore need to use either the jcheckbox or jradiobutton or some derivative of jtogglebutton i am not aware of but need the square or circle respectively to be non-visible when there is no icon on the button

1245248

width	height
the ie box model known as the traditional box model includes the padding and border in the width height of an element

1245736
width	margin
under the ie box model a box having a width of 100px with 2px padding on each side a 3px border and 7px margin on each side will have a visible width of 114px

1245736
width	height
the w3c box model which is the standard box model excludes the padding and border from the width height of an element

1245736

is svcutil.exe really supposed to be a replacement for xsd.exe

superclass	subclassing
now you are no longer concerned with having some superclass responsible for building subclassing which i think is better design

portrait	landscape
but if it s a non-square object and has to move position for example if it s at position 40 60 in portrait but moves to 20 100 in landscape and maybe even needs a bit of scaling to look better then you may want to try the two-step process and see if it looks smoother

support for older versions of firefox is a lot trickier since any workaround you created would need to be hidden from safari

safari google-chrome and ie6 all have

1246928
set	bag
many valued end the set or bag

you can connect to sqlite mysql postgresql oracle and more

1247227

if you re looking for painless rails deployment with apache or nginx i d have to suggest using phusion passenger aka modrails

1247229
postgresql	mysql
a decent web application ror can handle many types of dbms s including mysql postgresql sqlite

1247231
postgresql	mysql
a lot of rails applications use mysql so support for that is very strong but there are easy options for postgresql and many other popular rdbms platforms

1247295
inherited	subclassing
that doesn t prevent subclassing but it is a strong signal to users that it is not designed for inherited and it means you have to be very careful when using the derived class

1247298
vb6	vba
vba is all late-bound it is not pre-compiled into a dll like a vb6 dll or a .net assembly

1247323
public	protected
i realize that this forces you to have a public parameterless constructor on your singleton subclass but there is no way to avoid that at compile time without a where t protected new construct

1247666
hex	binary	octal	hex	octal	binary
i think the issue may be that language designers are always balls-deep in hex octal binary whatever and just think this way

1247685
width	height
if i know the height and width of an image that i m going to display with an image tag should i include the height and width attributes or just put the information in css

1247693
width	height
according to google page speed you should always define the width and height in the image tag

1247693
width	height
also you should always specify the same height and width as the actual image so the browser doesn t have to do any modifications to it like resizing

1247693
width	height
to prevent reflows specify the width and height of all images either in the html tag or in css

1247702
width	height
you should always specify the height and the width of an image if only to help the browser lay the page out even before the image has been downloaded

1247702
width	height
the height and width attributes give

1247716
width	height
the height and width functions gets the actual dom object height

1247723
width	height
the height and width attributes give user agents an idea of the size of an image or object so that they may reserve space for it and continue rendering the document while waiting for the image data

1247731
gif	png
problem is i get errors when i try to upload a png or gif image

1247731
gif	png
what can i do to adjust this easy if possible so that it can either work with png s and gif s or convert them before trying to work with them

1247735
google-chrome	firefox
it s likely that visual studio and ie share the same implementation so that s why you re experiencing the error in just those two programs and not in firefox or google-chrome

1247756
jar	war
i ve put the jar file under war web-inf lib and added to my classpath in eclipse and added to my html file

1247758
width	height
it seems that the width and height properties of the textifield don t respond.

1247768
width	height
the only thing that comes to mind is that the entire document hasn t loaded rendered yet therefor the element doesn t have a width and height

1247794
postgresql	mysql
the web application itself will be written with django so i have a few choices of database including mysql and postgresql

1247794
innodb	myisam
if mysql is an appropriate tool for the job i would also like to know if it makes sense to use innodb or myisam

1247794
innodb	myisam
i understand the basic differences between the two but some sources say to use myisam for speed but innodb if you want a real database while others say all modern uses of mysql should use innodb

1247801
innodb	myisam
innodb supports better locking semantics so if there will be occasional or frequent writes or if you want better data integrity i d suggest starting there and then benchmarking myisam later if you can t hit your performance targets

1247866
realloc	malloc
the c solution is to use malloc instead of new -- this makes realloc available

1247867
realloc	malloc
you can do this using the function realloc though that may only work for memory allocated with malloc rather than new

other svgs might benefit from a new viewbox derived from the advertised width and height these are often the same numbers

i just changed keyup keydown to keypress so all went well

1248103
spaces	delimiter
i want spaces to be the delimiter and i want the search to be case insensitive and i want special characters such as

1248256
gif	png
and it supports jpeg png gif gd .

1248265
getter	setter
most implementations of javascript don t support creating getter setter properties so it wouldn t be super useful on the web

1248265

below the friend list is already in the query the reason for that is i plan to get the friend list into an array and store it in memcached or apc cache so it will be 1 less query

rss	feed
for example if i pass it i want it to tell me that it isn t a valid rss feed

for expediency i d love to be able to do this server-side so i can just show hide an asp panel accordingly

1249086
tostring	gethashcode
if i have a struct but i don t explicitly override any of the methods that derived from object such as tostring gethashcode etc then if i declare a local instance of my struct class and call tostring on it would my struct get boxed i.e would the clr convert it implicitly to an object on the heap and then call tostring

1249093
post	get
if you want te freedom of passing variables as either get or post you can use the _request superglobal

1249095
tostring	gethashcode
no it s not boxed when you call tostring or gethashcode if it s implemented by your struct why should it

1249133
width	height
it should default to uniform which sounds like what you require however from your description you may either have it set to fill which will fill the cell resulting in cropping none showing it as the original or have specified the image width or height this may override the stretch

1249133
width	height
setting it to uniform or leaving out the stretch property and not specifying the width or height will mean it will resize to the maximum possible with out being cropped from either direction

1249134
min	max
aggregation can be by sum min max etc

1249144
rss	feed
i have worked extensively with rss and atom feed but haven t used any special class to handle.

perl	tcl
that s great if you know tcl as there are very few surprises introduced by the bridge to perl but if you don t it s awkward to translate from an unfamiliar language

1249322
fastcgi	scgi
i m building a browser game in c++ and yes some parts definitively suck such as using fastcgi which does not support multiple connections at once unless you re implementing your own fastcgi-handler cgi even worse scgi doesn t support multiplexing either but is a charm to implement and using a custom server api isn t portable however once you have the environment set up developing isn t that difficult

1249333
easymock	powermockito
powermockito extends easymock and allows you to mock concrete types even final and static methods

1249333
easymock	powermockito
powermockito is a framework that extend other mock libraries such as easymock with more powerful capabilities

1249363
rational-numbers	fractions
as a further twist as you appear to want fractions results while the input values are integers remember to use a fractions rational-numbers type for your computations - not sure if c# comes with one but worst case you can find plenty on the net

1249407
octal	hex
these power of 2 numbers also look nice in octal or hex notations

1249413
debian	linux
i m running debian linux and for a lua script i need to create a sha256 checksum to authenticate requests to amazon web services

vb.net	vb6
i am currently converting an old vb6 application to vb.net prefer to work in c# and have been developing in .net a fair amount

1249577
vb.net	vb6

1249594
dreamweaver	phped
some editors such as dreamweaver or phped can save to both your working directory and also your webserver directory ftp or otherwise in one key short cut.

1249594
folder	directory
this is really bad because your .svn folder will end up on the webserver directory

1249600
vb.net	vb6
microsoft did a lot to make vb.net easy for vb6 developers to pick up on so you can easily code on vb.net very similarly to what you did in vb6

1249618
division	modulo
on machines that don t implement a division modulo instruction that little could take several hundred cycles so you would need something like

jsf	seam
from what i have read it seems that seam is the next step of jsf

1249638
perl	tcl
so we used perl just because it was easy to do string manipulation some of us even used tcl shudder

1249652
postgresql	mysql
i don t like mysql because there are so many ways you can get bad data into the database where postgresql is intolerant of that behavior see comparing speed and reliability the bad myisam behavior is just a subset of the concerns there

1249652
postgresql	mysql
given how fractured the mysql community is now and the uncertainties about what oracle is going to do with it you might want to consider taking a look at postgresql just so you have some more options here in the future

1249712
typedef	struct
to define a typedef for struct cpu

1249712
typedef	struct
typedef struct cpu cpu_type

1249722

1249752
firefox	safari
it affects performance on safari as well when i try -webkit-box-shadow though it isn t as noticeable as in firefox

1249756

instead just toggle its visibility with show and hide

1249761
getter	setter
kmiyashiro is mostly right except for the getter and setter for the class name

1249761
getter	setter
check out this list for more getter and setter

1249765
profiling	instrumentation
if you are doing this via profiling instrumentation setilfunctionbody then you need to supply a new il code map as well setilinstrumentationcodemap so that the debugger becomes aware of the il modification

1249769
public	protected
to have the compiler satisfied you might override or new the baseclass method as public not a good advise if method is protected in baseclass

1249789
post	get
edit 2 8 10 09 apologies if this is incorrect usage i couldn t get the interface to allow me to post an answer nor could i add a comment.

1250121
draggable	droppable
i will be adding scriptaculous draggable and droppable effects to allow interaction by moving many dynamically generated divs from one div to another

1250160
width	margin
both of the last two divs have a 50 width no margin and no padding

1250172
width	height
the solution to escaping is to give the containing element a height or width any will do it will stretch to fit so usually 1 is what i use.

1250172
width	margin
also if setting widths keep in mind that any borders or margin you set are in addition to the width of the elements so if you set two divs at 50 with a border or margin you will get a line break

1250175
ubuntu	linux
if you aren t on linux you can use virtualbox to create a ubuntu vm

i can add all the labels buttons interface and then hide show them at events

1250375
vim	emacs
powerful editors such as emacs and vim seem very popular among python programmers

1250375
getter	setter
this may confuse java programmers because in java each file generally requires boilerplate code such as a package statement getter and setter

1250375
vim	emacs
emacs and vim are very powerful and general but have a steep learning curve

1250412
ubuntu	linux
i assume i ll need to use the gcc but don t know what else i need on my ubuntu linux workstation to get this going or how to compose the files

1250425
mp4	h.264
newest flash player can use the excellent h.264 codec what youtube uses for hq and hd video in mp4 container take a look at this tutorial

1250429
vim	emacs
me i use vim i have to admit emacs is at least as powerful but my fingers are deeply trained by over 30 years of vi and any other editor gives me the jitters especially when it tries to imitate vi and never really manages to get it 100 right

1250435
addition	multiplication
specifically scalar vector multiplication of your parameter t and the vector n and vector addition of a and t n

1250454
aho-corasick	rabin-karp
i suggest to start with reading the aho-corasick and rabin-karp wikipedia pages and then decide whether that would make sense in your case

1250522
boost	stl
i am fairly good with c++ stl and boost

1250522
boost	stl
i like stl boost style very much and i use them with c++ whenever i can in uni projects

1250522
boost	stl
qt does have a good collection of containers but i am greatly familiar with stl boost stuff

1250522
boost	stl
what should i take care of when learning qt and using it side by side with stl boost

1250527
getter	setter
well in the second case you re adding a getter setter method for that particular iboutlet

1250527
getter	setter
any time you add a getter setter method you almost always want to have it set to retain for memory management issues

1250531
button	checkbox
this will take all text checkbox radio button etc and add them to an appropriate value to be sent

1250533
put	get
and if you put an empty path string you get even closer to ordinary string concatenation

1250544
subtract	add
then for every next bit subtract the first bit from the sum and add the next bit and see if the sum matches the pattern s sum

1250589
boost	stl
yes qt works just fine with both boost and the stl

1250589
boost	stl
however nothing prohibits you from using stl boost counterparts of the qt constructs or functionality therein that qt lacks

1250589
qstring	qvector
for example a qstring can be converted to a std string and a qvector can be used with std for_each

1250589
boost	stl
mixing qt with stl and boost - are there any bridges to make it easy

1250593
accessor	properties
there isn t any difference between the way those two interface definitions work until you start using the accessor provided by the properties

1250594
width	height
i have some divs with just a width height and border

1250597
unix	aix
do you have a shared object usually a shared library on aix a unix shared library or a windows dll

1250605
width	height
also setting the width and height of the div is probably a good idea too

1250613
onclick	onkeydown
you could add an onclick eventhandler to anchors on your page that remove your onbeforeunload event to avoid it and you might be able to do the same with an onkeydown event on the window body page however i don t believe there s a way to catch users pressing the browser s refresh button

1250630
google-chrome	firefox
jquery ajax default browser behavior happens in ie firefox google-chrome

1250681
post	put
first off you re sending a post with curl but you ve got the magic _method parameter on your url and it s set to put

1250681
put	get
if you re using a standard restful controller that makes good sense because you re accessing a member people 12 which by default only allows get put and delete

1250722
folder	directory
you can do this by deleting the .netbeans folder in your user directory in c documents and settings

1250767
gridview	sqldatasource
my problem is that when you use the sqldatasource wizard to connect the paramters to the gridview control it doesn t let you select which datakey of the gridview to bind it to

1250805
uiview	subviews
the uitextfield will also be a subviews of the top level uiview so it will have an additional retain on it being in the subviews array of the top level view so at this point the text field has been retained twice

1250810
strcpy	malloc
malloc could return null and strcpy could try to copy data to memory address 0

1250823
int	chars
the toupper function expects its input to be an int in the range of unsigned chars 0 - 255 while in some cases a chars variable can be in the range of a signed chars -128 - 127

1250824
ffmpeg	libavformat
for programmatic decoding encoding you might want to check out libavformat libavcodec and libavutil parts of the ffmpeg project

1250827
int	chars
a signed chars above 127 would be treated as if it were a negative number if you did not cast it to unsigned chars since the argument is an int

1250937
django	web2py
and web2py is more lightweight than django rails whatever on pretty much all counts

1251011
disk	ram
the narrow part is important because the clustering key will be added to each and every index page for each and every non-clustered index on your table - and if you have a few of those and a few million rows in your table this amounts to a massive waste of space - and not just on your disk but also in your sql server s ram

1251032
internationalization	translation
how do you guys handle translation internationalization of your asp.net applications

1251043
int	double
you could specialize lexical_cast for int and double types

1251043
strtol	strtod
use strtod and strtol in your s specializations

1251047
tcplistener	tcpclient
for transferring the files data you can use the tcpclient tcplistener classes which is nice abstractions over the grittier socket functionality

1251051
int	boolean
source and target being of whatever type you want including built-in types like boolean or int which is possible in c++ because of templates

1251053
folder	directory
if the jar will always be in that directory you can use a full path my folder rybka.exe

1251093
rtp	rtcp
you have to manage an rtcp connection and a rtp connection per channel audio video

1251093
rtp	rtcp	rtp	rtsp	rtsp	rtcp
it is pretty complex to code a rtsp rtcp rtp stack from scratch

1251109
strtol	atoi
boost.spirit 2.1 which is to be released with boost 1.40 seems to be very fast even faster than the c equivalents strtol atoi etc

1251130
hide	show
you could hide show each panel when required

1251135
put	get
note the storyboard sitting in the resource of the second rectangle i couldn t get it to work inside the controlstoryboardaction.storyboard but it did work if i made the rectangle a contentcontrol and put it in the template

1251176
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine on firefox google-chrome and even ie6 7

1251177
stdout	stderr
you can pass streamconsumers to capture the stdout and stderr the commandline handling will pass the output to the consumers one line at a time

1251218
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
everything works fine with firefox 3 ie6 ie7 ie8 opera 9 and google-chrome but i have issue with firefox 1 firefox 2 and seamonkey

1251261
stdout	stderr
note that you should consume stdout and stderr concurrently to prevent blocking

1251261
stdout	stderr
note that you may be able to get away with just taking stdout and not stderr

1251297
unix	aix
it uses dir -c on windows df -kp on aix hp-ux and df -k on other unix

1251308
solaris	aix
the pattern could lead to subtle compilation error across compilers and as i currently work both on windows visual c++ linux g++ oracle solaris cc and aix xl this is not acceptable

1251352
superclass	subclassing
what i also found irritating was the fact that self is always the subclassing even when called in the superclass

1251352
superclass	subclassing
from this i first expected the code from the superclass is executed in the context of the subclassing

1251374
getter	setter
and provides a getter and a setter to it

1251386
put	get
put a clearing div where you need it at the bottom of your div and get on with life

1251416
google-chrome	firefox
it works perfectly in firefox and google-chrome

1251430
apache	nginx
is there a directive in apache or nginx preferably that allows to replicate an incoming stream to multiple upstreams simultaneously

1251435
google-chrome	firefox
the username and password user entry controls show left justified in the panel in firefox and google-chrome but internet explorer shows them centered in the panel

1251435
google-chrome	firefox
how do i determine what firefox and google-chrome seem to figure out but internet explorer struggles with so every browser is consistent

1251449
multiton	singleton
the multiton pattern is a variation on the singleton pattern but that allows for n instances of an object

1251449
multiton	singleton
much like how the singleton class has a static variable to hold the single instance the multiton is often implemented with a static array or map of instances depending on how you want to access the instances - arrays only allow for numerical access but by using a map you could provide string keys to your instances making them named

1251460
button	checkbox
i am trying to add a checkbox in a listview with value as ids of the records from the database so i can allow the user to check the ones they want to delete and when they click the delete button i can get value collection of checkbox with request.form

1251462
client-side	server-side
telerik and infragistics both have extensive control libraries for asp.net that include both server-side and client-side components

1251469
hash	md5
md5 always creates a 128 bit hash

1251471
hash	md5
you can just take as much of the md5 hash as you need and throw the rest away

1251472
folder	directory
i would like to be able to add two different additional include directory so that if i have the file on my local machine midl will take that version otherwise it will take the file from the server so chdir ing to the root folder is not an option

1251488
hash	md5
however if you re interested in losing fewer bits of fidelity and thereby decreasing the risk of collisions you could take the 128 bit value returned by the md5 hash and encode it using ascii85 also known as base85 encoding instead of a hexadecimal-based encoding

1251488
hash	md5
after obtaining the md5 hash from the md5.computehash call you can use jeff atwood s ascii85 encoder

1251499
put	get
now in order to get a list of all the users in the mailing list i cannot simply do a database query as the asp.net profile table is simply put awful

1251502
pop-up	dialog
after some use visual studio 2008 when opening a solution that is checked into visual studio team foundation will pop-up a dialog saying

1251524
bash	subshell
edit the motivation for this question is a bash script that does export -f foo and then uses perl in a subshell to invoke the function directly via system foo

1251535
versioning	upgrade
go around and get everyone upgrade to the latest service pack for your vs versioning

1251552
inherited	properties
instead of setting strangearray.prototype to array.prototype this will let you set strangearray.prototype to a new instance of array so it inherited array.prototype s properties without calling array s constructor

1251568
children	parent
if the parent owns the children and there s no possibility of creating a child without a parent then it should be just parentdao and no childdao at all

1251574
width	height
can you write same function but to fit width and height of a div

1251574
width	height
i have a div with fixed width and height where i need to put text from database

1251580
subtract	add
add subtract

1251586
x86	64bit
you need to set the project to compile for x86 processors since on x64 systems the 64bit webbrowser is used which when i last checked didn t have a working flash plugin yet

1251595
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
i ve read on the wiki that the accepted path of xd_receiver.html depends on the browser and firefox accept the full path while ie opera and safari want a path relative to the current page like xd_receiver.html or .. xd_receiver.html

1251602
getter	setter
no default constructor no getter setter noise just a pojo with my own annotations

1251651
trie	tree
you can also check out patricia trie or radix tree algorithms

1251669
folder	directory
i have a external js file named test.js that i have kept in script folder in my root directory

1251690
post	put
to put the results in the order you want is not so easy because the first ordering key is the created_date of the thread-starter post

1251703
button	checkbox	checkbox	dropdownlistfor
one other asp.net button one checkbox with autopostback property true one dropdownlistfor with autopostback property true

1251784

i want to programatically change the hour which certain cron jobs execute

1251784
jobs	cron
here is the command which has been working with all of my current cron jobs during debugging

1251819
post	get
scott hanselman has a good post on doing a hybrid version of debug and release that could get you the best of both worlds here

1251912
mockups	balsamiq
for mockups i go with paper and pen or a cheap whiteboard substitute but balsamiq is an interesting tool for creating mockups

1251924
hash	salt
it has info like their alias their email address their salt password hash and all the usual candidates

1251970
put	get
edit for those that want to use this code you d have to put something in your controller in order to set session has_location true when you get the location

1251973
getter	setter
if you ever have problems with myproperty it s easy to add logging code to the setter or even getter to find out every time it s changed or even accessed

1251993
profiler	yourkit
you might try a memory profiler such as yourkit

1252008
innodb	myisam
1 is myisam the other innodb

1252016
accessor	properties
properties accessor hiringcompany on

1252034
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
however you can use a plain uitabbar and implement your own view switching in a uiviewcontroller subclass rather than a uitabbarcontroller

1252047
listview	gridview
i have wpf listview with gridview view and i want to remove any trace of row highlight

1252047
listview	gridview
in this case of listview gridview i am unable to find the corresponding chrome and template to change

1252056
ubuntu	debian
i have used pdftk before for such concatenations as pdftk happens to be readily available to debian ubuntu

1252077
jsf	seam
it s not correct to say the seam is the next step of jsf. seam doesn t have to use jsf as the view layer

1252077
getter	setter
excessive calls to getter setter

1252077
jsf	seam
there are more than enough pages detailing the shortcomings of jsf elsewhere note that these aren t criticisms of seam - rather of jsf1.x and many are resolved in jsf2.0

1252077
jsf	seam
i don t believe that seam is the next step for jsf but it and facelets are crucial if you re planning to use jsf1.x right now

1252084
post	get
my question is upon the post how do i get a collection of objects that are populated with the right properties as a parameter to the controller post handler method

1252094
google-chrome	firefox
and here s the correct layout as rendered by firefox and google-chrome .

1252114
subscript	superscript
is there any way to make superscript and subscript work in wpf in any font without looking laughably bad when underlined

1252116
rss	feed
i d like an rss feed from this google scholar search scholar fish oil search

1252125
post	get
i would like to get the name of the form used to post parameters from a java httpservletrequest object

1252126
jsf	seam
i like jsf and i evaluated seam not long ago

1252126
jsf	seam
jsf is a web ui framework whereas seam is a more general web application framework that integrates not just jsf but conversational contexts workflow jbpm and object persistance preferably ejb3

1252126
jsf	seam
also icefaces is great with jsf and facelets it works perfectly well with or without an application framework like seam or spring

1252129
rss	feed
see 7 tools to make an rss feed of any website

1252134
int	chars
but what if i use chars instead of int

1252135
innodb	myisam
i need to implement something like a full text search on a couple if index s in a large products table using innodb myisam is not an option due to its lack of transactions and relationship support

1252140
post	put	post	get	put	get
i put the variables email and password from post to get such that

1252159
google-chrome	firefox
this is my first jquery script which works great in firefox and google-chrome but fails in internet explorer

1252159
rss	feed
the first script is a jquery plugin that parses rss feed for me

1252159
rss	feed
the effect is that an rss feed containing the path to a random image in the item s description is used to set the background of the div #page

1252159
rss	feed
the rss feed is generated by the cck and views module

1252161
subscript	superscript
wpf has the typography.variants attached property that lets you do superscript and subscript

1252161
getter	setter
i also didn t see anything obvious on fontfamily and the only thing i could find on typography was the variants attached property itself and its getter and setter

1252182
int	boolean
the boolean is one byte and the int is four bytes

1252186
maven	pom.xml
there s a maven pom.xml that references flickrj by name you may find the listed dependencies useful

1252186
maven	pom.xml
you can also see the dependencies for flickr-api a wrapper for flickrj in its maven pom.xml

1252206
width	height
image name image type image width image height image horizontal resolution image vertical resolution image bit depth and finally actual image data

1252218
width	height
i kinda thought that image.thumbnail does it but what it did was that it scaled my image to 150 px by its width leaving height 100px

1252229
width	height
in pixels given as a width height

1252293
post	get
i ve never seen this before i ve always known there was either get or post

1252315
post	get
htmlâ s method attribute only allows get and post

1252328
post	get
but i assume the only useful response would be a 301 redirect but that could also be used with get or post so i don t see how head would solve any issues

1252328
firefox	safari
a quick test in the current versions of both safari and firefox on a mac shows that actually a get is invoked

1252328
post	get
maybe for some time spam robots were in fact fooled into using head which would then be rejected on the server or might be fooled into skipping this form if they would only support get and post

1252420
width	height
you could set the width and height of the parent page s html and body tags to 100 as well as the iframe tag that contains the page you want to load

1252450
mouseover	mouseout
here is a working example it just uses a click to change it once but i ll leave the mouseover mouseout to you - you may want to speed up the animation

1252452
width	height
although the tab panel properly occupies 100 width it ends up scaling its height to the interior flextable rather than forcing scrollbars upon it

1252461
post	get
if you re not sure which request method was used use the superglobal which contains both get and post variables example

1252518
webclient	webrequest
in response to the comments you said you are using webclient - that is considerably more substantial than using webrequest

1252534
disk	ram
maybe you could run the tests on a db stored on the disk but using a ram disk

1252534
disk	ram
in windows you can install a driver to set up a ram disk some instructions here

1252534
disk	ram
a ram disk will act exactly like a hard disk but will operate completely from memory so that you will lose some of the overhead of loading files to from the hard disk

1252550
junit	testng
note that i am only interested in developer tests written with junit or testng

1252563
fadein	fadeout
the fadeout and the fadein function have a complete handler you need to use for example

1252567
fadein	fadeout
fadein and fadeout cause asynchronous animations so javascript continues executing further statements while those effects occur

1252582
division	modulo	bitwise-and	modulo
bastien lã onard s answer has a more idiomatic function to do the conversion using bitwise-and instead of modulo 2 bit-shifting instead of division and the ternary operator instead of if else

1252585
free	malloc
for this particular case i wouldn t bother with malloc since you free in the same function

1252585
stdout	stderr
error message should probably go to stderr rather than stdout

1252605
post	put	post	get	put	get
put another way as soon as the page knows whether it s been called via get or post it will know the correct super-global to retrieve the id from

1252605
post	get
in fact there may be some pages that will always be called with post and others always with get

1252659
cairngorm	puremvc
also i ve looked into puremvc cairngorm and these methods seem equally tedious except with another layer of abstraction

1252702
ubuntu	debian
if you don t find anything i d suggest using your distribution s tools to obtain the source that corresponds to the binary that you have installed on your sytem apt-get source libgtk-2.0 on debian or ubuntu

1252731
udp	mtu
udp s maximum transmission unit mtu size is 64kb

1252738
cos	sin
if t 90 degrees then cos 90 0 and sin 90 1

1252742
x86	64bit
you could get the 64bit drivers installed or run the package use the 32-bit version of dtexec located in c program files x86 microsoft sql server 100 dts binn

1252743
post	put
they post partial xaml code i can t even put into my xaml code correctly vs highlights them in red

1252756
udp	mtu
although the ip layer may allow udp packets of up to 64k in size i think you will find that the maximum in the wild udp packet size will be limited to the smallest mtu of the devices in between your source and destination

1252756
udp	mtu	icmp	udp	mtu	icmp
if you are determined to use udp you will have to implement path mtu discovery in your protocol and prey that the routers firewalls don t block the fragmentation needed icmp packets

1252756
mtu	icmp
but like i said i ve seen cases in the past where fragmentation needed icmp packets are blocked or discarded and i had to manually tweak my own mtu

1252762
gmail	hotmail
i tested gmail outlook 2000 2007 yahoo old new hotmail thunderbird successfully

1252805
freemarker	velocity
are you using the spring mvc jsp tablib or velocity freemarker macros

1252808
cpython	ironpython
ironpython has real multithreading unlike cpython and it s gil

1252878
put	get
however you can put which don t get copied maybe in word

1252881
pop-up	dialog
instead of worrying why the dialog doesn t pop-up add a class library project to your solution that references your testing framework

1252915
int	double
but this only works for double well int work too because of the implicit type conversion

1252936
tapestry	struts
are you using any kind of web framework spring mvc struts tapestry etc...

1252964
children	parent
i write the parent object to xml which of course involves among other things writing out its children in no particular order and due to the possible circularity i replace these references between the children with unique ids that each child has

1252980
dictionary	map
as each object comes out shove it in a dictionary or map with the uid as the key

1252986
keydown	keyup
instead of only looking at keydown events any solution which is going to be caring about multiple keys at once is going to have to be looking at both keydown and keyup events and keeping track of the state of the keys in question

1253013
int	double
because of implicit type conversions like float to richfloat you can even use your sort function on lists of int or float or double

1253039
uiview	calayer
in my answer here i describe a way to apply a glow effect to any text or vector elements drawn within a uiview or calayer

1253059
iprincipal	iidentity
our identity model relies on the iidentity and iprincipal classes not the windowsidentity windowsprincipal so using an alternative identity implementation is fine

1253071
strcpy	strncpy
strcpy - you should use strncpy instead to explicitly define the number of bytes to copy and avoid a buffer overflow

1253080
fgets	fgetc	fgets	strtol	strtol	fgetc
a better alternative here is to use an input function like fgets or fgetc to read chunks of input then scan it with sscanf or parse it with string handling functions like strchr and strtol

1253080
printf	strcpy	strcat	gets
strcpy strcat and printf suffer from a similar problem to gets - they don t allow you to specify the size of the destination buffer

1253080
printf	strncpy
it s still possible at least in theory to use them safely - but you are much better off using strncat and printf instead you could use strncpy but see above

1253120
udp	tcp
you mention datagram in your question which implies that you are using connectionless udp sockets not tcp

1253153
put	get
i work on c# window ...vs05 ......i want to put space on enum string ....i do it below code have this.....my problem is after select a value from the combo how can i get the index number of this value .....and if i gone to edit mode then i need to show the value what is user already selected .....how to get enum selected value on basis of index number

1253154
disk	ram
how to get the cpu ram and disk drive usage of the system in c# code

1253188
strcpy	strncpy
most people agree that strcpy is dangerous but strncpy is only rarely a useful replacement

1253203
post	get
you could use one site for login purposes and exchange data via post or get but you d still have to maintain two separate cookies

1253248
mouse	keyboard
but to handle all the events keyboard and mouse you have to use javascript

1253277
public	protected
there is no reason to specify public private protected since it will always be public as interfaces cannot have non-public members

1253293
width	height
the problem is actually that the table is set to 100 width height when you set it as a tab child

1253293
width	height
overflow only works if you set the width height using pixels

1253305
pop-up	dialog
if that is the case then you should keep in mind that the user may not respond to your dialog for some time after it pop-up

1253350
int	double
the master key generated consists of 5 numbers 4 double precision floating-point values between 0 and 1 and 1 int between 1 and 1 000 000 000

1253360
cos	sin
q1 cos yaw 2 cos pitch 2 sin roll 2

1253360
cos	sin
- sin yaw 2 sin pitch 2 cos roll 2

1253360
cos	sin
q2 cos yaw 2 sin pitch 2 cos roll 2

1253360
cos	sin
+ sin yaw 2 cos pitch 2 sin roll 2

1253360
cos	sin

1253360
cos	sin
- cos yaw 2 sin pitch 2 sin roll 2

1253366
jsf	seam
seam certainly is far better than using plain jsf refer the link posted by damo a couple of answers above

1253366
jsf	seam
see this article for details speed up your data-driven jsf seam application by two orders of magnitude - part 1

1253366
jsf	seam
since seam 3 is imminent and supposed to make use of 2 new specs jsf 2 and webbeans that leaves questions on what happens to projects on seam 2 and how long it will take for things to get stable

1253402
hide	show
bonus there is a faster way of doing this show hide thing

1253402
hide	show
this article showed me the light show hide performance

1253526
versioning	upgrade
from a corporate perspective sometimes its a big decision to upgrade to a later versioning of ie - the use of an internal bespoke web client being one reason

1253566
hide	show
then show hide populate the controls there

1253621
xsl-fo	xslt
xsl-fo is a common standard that tool implementers can follow to ensure compatibility in the same way that html is the common standard for web pages xslt is the standard for xml-to- translation etc

1253621
xsl-fo	xslt
if your html can be considered well-formed xml ie short tags are closed properly such as br and img - not br and img then you should be able to use xslt to translate that directly to xsl-fo which you can then pass directly to a tool like apache fop for conversion

1253670
ceil	floor
why do all rounding functions ceil floor return a floating number and not an integer

1253742
set	bag
to prevent this problem you must use a bidirectional association with the many valued end the set or bag marked as inverse true

1253742
set	bag
please note that nhibernate does not support bidirectional one-to-many associations with an indexed collection list map or array as the many end you have to use a set or bag mapping

1253742
set	bag
otherwise you might have to map your collection as a bag or set instead of a list

1253747
hide	show
in each of them is a picture where i have an onmouseover onmouseout event on it which show a message in a div and hide the message

1253747
mouseover	mouseout
my problem is after a user moves quickly from left to right over a lot of images all mouseover and mouseout events of the images are executed which looks stupid.

1253766
mouseover	mouseout
we ve had the exact same problem what we ve done is on the mouseover event is to set a variable _mouseon to true set to false on mouseout then set a onetime event over that fires in say 500 ms

1253770
opera	firefox
it doesn t work only in firefox opera and ie8 are ok

1253794
put	get
to be restful you have to follow rules like get for read put for create etc.

1253832
nunit	moq
for a long time we had only .net 2.0 assemblies and applications but still created .net 3.5 sp1 class library projects for testing with nunit and moq

1253836
websphere	ibm
if they are different things what are the products in ibm s websphere stack that can do these two different jobs

1253845
vim	textmate	vim	emacs	macvim	textmate	macvim	emacs	emacs	textmate
other than using macvim s own find as you type tool or a command line editor like vim or emacs i use textmate as my main editor what are my options here

1253883
gcov	lcov
i m unable to make any suggestions on this for windows but for linux projects i highly recommend gcov and lcov

1253885
hide	show
since now you won t be able to rely on event-model and will have to manually code lots of javascript to interconnect controls enable disable repopulate show hide etc.

1253910
onclick	onkeyup
to generalize the question javascript events are handled by associating an event type onclick onkeyup onfocuse etc with a function or multiple functions

1253990
pthreads	fork
i would suggest gradually moving to more cross-platform libraries like as you suggested refactoring pthreads to boost thread or going from fork to multi-process with ipc probably also using boost s facilities

1254003
multiplying	subtract
oftentimes pay periods are on the 15th and the end of every month so in that case you d count the number of months and multiplying by 2 checking the end conditions if start is before the 15th subtract one pay period

1254063
versioning	upgrade
the problem i have is that when we upgrade to a new versioning of our websites users may be half way with a long-running task

1254100
stdout	stderr
who checks if the output to stdout or stderr succeeded

1254105
listview	gridview
i have a control template in xaml that contains a listview with a gridview

1254126
innodb	myisam
on a site i work on we recently switched to innodb from myisam and we found that some simple select queries which had both where and order by clauses were using the index for the order by clause resulting in a table scan to find the few desired rows but heck they didn t need to be sorted when it finally found them all

1254132
post	get
how should i choose between get and post methods in html forms

1254132
post	get
when do you use post and when do you use get

1254147
post	put
such as post put and delete in a

1254159
post	get
when do you use post and when do you use get

1254159
post	get
how should i choose between get and post methods in html forms

1254169
post	get
there is a nice paper by the w3c about this uris addressability and the use of http get and post

1254169
post	get
1.3 quick checklist for choosing http get or post

1254192
post	get
if you use complex data types then it must be in a post it cannot be in a get

1254192
post	get
using get and post where it is expected helps to keep your program understandable

1254204
daemons	launchd
you can run your server as a service windows o daemons linux and when you want the gui you have to launchd and operate with it

1254249
onfocus	onblur
you could use the onfocus and onblur events of the select box and then update the style.width property accordingly

1254274
google-chrome	safari
in the home page of my app i try to implement something like most visited websites that google-chrome safari have in their home pages

1254274
google-chrome	safari
do you know how safari google-chrome do it in the home page

1254350
fortran	ada
fortran java and ada as well as

1254353
ubuntu	debian
getting everything you need on debian ubuntu is very easy

1254376
unix	solaris
if you are using any linux unix solaris os it is available unless you have explicitly not installed

1254435
equals	gethashcode
if it hasn t you might be using different object instances that represent the same actual cluster and you perhaps haven t provided a suitable equals implementation you should also update gethashcode at the same time

1254475
post	get
i managed to get a checkboxlist working and i can t somehow get the values back when i post the usual way

1254570
hide	show
is there any way to use databinding to show or hide a paragraph within a flowdocument

1254572
google-chrome	firefox
i would like to make a link from a web page to a file on a local filesystem and make it work in all browsers or at least in internet explorer firefox and google-chrome

1254572
google-chrome	firefox
but not in firefox and google-chrome

1254581
post	get
how can i get the view to post all items in listbox1 and not just the selected ones

1254614
prepare	execute
make a prepare befor the loop and in the loop just give the values and execute

1254627
postgresql	mysql
i m rather interested in the actual algorithm not ready solutions although i d be ok with taking a look at something implemented in ruby or python or relying on mysql or postgresql

1254629
post	put	post	get	put	get
it s not the same to post to an url than to get it delete it or put it

1254633
textblock	itemscontrol
is there an equivalent of itemscontrol for text content inside a textblock or flowdocument

1254655
prepare	execute
the idea behind prepare statements is that you call db- prepare once and execute can be called multiple times on the same statement object

1254672
post	get
i believe the decision for django was made because usually just get and post is enough and that keeps the framework simpler for its requirements

1254726
bash	zsh
how can you get similar highlightings to zsh s less than bash s less in ubuntu

1254726
bash	zsh
both zsh and bash use the same less at usr bin less

1254738
width	height
in the above example i have used width 100 to give layout to ie but you could just as easily use zoom 1 or height 1 if you would rather

1254740
webrat	cucumber
i am using the selenium-client gem with webrat and cucumber to test a rails project

1254761
rss	feed
for example if the web service is more wide-ranging xml like a html document or an rss feed you want to use a parser like hpricot or nokogiri

1254822
subtract	add
solution would be to either create your dates in cocoa with the reference date of 1970 or to add subtract the offset in cocoa or php

1254847
sorting	grouping
i have list of objects i need to sort the list based on object s property1 and i need to sort again the resultant list with object s property2 without loosing the grouping done in first sorting ...

1254861
set	bag
each document is reduced to a sparse vector of pairs and you can throw a naivebayes or some other classifier at the set of vectors that represents your set of documents or compute similarity scores between each bag and every other bag this is called k-nearest-neighbour classification

1254870
jsf	seam
if you re going to be using ejb and jsf already seam is killer

1254870
jsf	seam	richfaces	icefaces
if you re going to be using jsf plus any of its related tools like icefaces or richfaces seam pojos can simplify your setup a lot as well as give you access to the life-cycle states that seam provides conversation etc.

1254870
wicket	seam
if you re using ejb with wicket or gwt seam might be able to save you some configuration as well though i ve not personally used it in this configuration

1254951
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
the other thing to note about the onbeforeunload event is that at this time opera does not support it safari firefox and internet explorer do though

1254961
min	max
you could pass in the min max values but calling person.iseligable would be a better solution in my opinion

1254980
put	get
you can specify the ordering of the items within the aggregates put order by in the derived table you can group and join so you get more than one result row you can change delimiters and so on

1255035
tableview	nsoutlineview
note that nsoutlineview is a subclass of nstableview so all the tableview features work on an outline view as well

1255043
solaris	aix
here s the patch applied to esql c 3.50 on solaris - you ll need to adapt it to aix

1255045
profiling	debugging
well you can see the entire query in sql profiling admittedly that is after it s been sent to the database but it gives you an easy way to copy-paste the statement so you can debugging with that inside management studio

1255061
width	height
the reason why you can t access the width and height properties of a control with width or height set to auto is that the run time system is querying for the property values before they ve been set

1255061
actualheight	actualwidth
the properties actualwidth and actualheight claim to get the rendered height of controls so in theory you d think you could simply wait until the sl application had finished loading and then perform your query since the controls would be rendered by then and therefore the actualheight actualwidth values should be set

1255061
width	height
sizechanged is triggered whenever the width and height properties of a control are changed so if i handle that event i am guaranteed that the values are set to something other than nan

1255086
caanimation	catransition
i had a problem where i had a series of overlapping catransition caanimation sequences all of which i needed to perform custom operations when the animations stopped but i only wanted one delegate handler for animationdidstop

1255086
caanimation	catransition
however i had a problem there didn t appear to be a way to uniquely identify each catransition caanimation in the animationdidstop delegate

1255086
caanimation	catransition
when you start your animation use the setvalue method on the catransition caanimation to set your identifiers and values to use when animationdidstop fires

1255086
caanimation	catransition
are there better techniques for caanimation catransition identification in the animationdidstop delegate

1255089
put	get
if you do get stuck by accident know that local admins on the application tier machine are tfs super-admins who can bypass all security checks and put things back in order

1255091
dictionary	map
the version with the synchronisation dictionary doesn t work properly as you are not protecting the map dictionary inside a lock before using it

1255091
dictionary	map
you have to protect the map dictionary inside a lock so that only one thread at a time can access it

1255094
ssl	https
java client certificates over https ssl

1255129
freebsd	linux
freebsd might be a certain way today but maybe in the next release it will copy a feature from linux that would erase the need for you to build your program two different ways

1255129
freebsd	linux
say that on freebsd these are the a and b features and on linux they re the x and y features

1255129
solaris	sunos	solaris	bsd	sunos	bsd
it could be that feature a comes from the original bsds and is in solaris because it has bsd roots from sunos in the 80 s and solaris also has feature y from it s system v based redesign in the early 90 s

1255129
freebsd	linux	freebsd	solaris
by testing for these features your program could run on solaris too because it has the features your program needs just not in the same combination as on freebsd and linux

1255275
putty	winscp
winscp to interact with the development server with norton commander like interface as well as the good putty integration

1255291
mouseup	mousedown
now this mouseupdownfilter will fire an mouseup mousedown event when they occur on a watched control for example your textbox

1255353
innodb	myisam
for mysql the data is stored in var lib mysql or something similar path and depending on the database format you are using with myisam the database information will be stored in a directory of its same name in .frm .myi and .myd files and with innodb the database information will be stored in the ibdata1 and ib_logfiles

1255358
width	height
the danger with this is that some browsers adjust the font which can alter the width height of the font

1255366
hex	binary
i d like to append the int to the string but in human readable form hex notation rather than in binary gibberish

1255390
gcov	lcov
code coverage - gcov lcov .

1255398
innodb	myisam
the precise structure of these depends on the storage engine used typically myisam or innodb for mysql

1255403
stdout	stderr
it handles escaping of the arguments environment specific execution and allows you to attach consumers to stdout and stderr leaving you to focus on the handling

1255423
implements	extends
either make trackthread implements runnable and not extends thread anymore or just write

1255431
svg	vml
the image transformation is for browsers not supporting svg or vml

1255438
background-image	background-position
my strategy roughly involves a setting the css height of the html node to 100 and setting the background-position of the background-image to bottom

1255490
children	parent
selects all elements that are children of elements that have a class of title that are the first children of their parent in this context

1255490
filtering	grouping
to apply a predicate to a filtering set of nodes you need to make the grouping clear with parentheses

1255496
debian	linux
i m using a qmail vpopmail combination on linux debian so i d rather that fire an event to my java daemon than poll the mail accounts through the java mail extensions

1255499
implements	sealed
i m trying to implements the gethttpcontext function from htmlhelpertest.cs in vb.net using rhino mocks but i m getting type httpcontextbase is not defined. the compiler suggests changing it to httpcontext but when i do that i get a run time error that a sealed class cannot be mocked

1255505
put	get	ready	each
edit all silence here so i ll add the suggestion to remove the locking and instead put each stdout_value on a queue.queue instance -- queue is intrinsicaly threadsafe deals with its own locking so you can get or get_nowait etc etc results from it once they re ready and have been put there

1255594
debian	linux
i m using a qmail vpopmail combination on linux debian so i d rather that fire an event to my java daemon than poll the mail accounts through the java mail extensions

1255603
post	put	post	get	put	get
from my limited knowledge of rest it is utilizing http get post put delete verbs to perform crud-like operations on remote resources denoted by urls which lends it into a more chatty and remote-method like style aka rpc style

imap	nntp
i use the term network services to refer to things such as nntp imap pop3.

1255686
google-chrome	firefox
everything works flawlessly in firefox and google-chrome but not in ie7 haven t tested 8

1255693
rss	feed
my question is - how can i show stuff like this in a rss feed

1255700
gif	png
i would also put in the encoding jpeg gif png bmp... the mime type image png etcetera so you don t have to parse the file name every time

udp	tcp
that s what a binding is a level of abstraction built on a basic protocol typically udp ip or tcp ip

1255747
cvs	rcs
i learned rcs and then cvs there and how to use make files

1255775
int	double
if the expression that denotes the called function has a type that does not include a prototype the int promotions are performed on each argument and arguments that have type float are promoted to double

1255775
integer	unsigned
one promoted type is a signed integer type the other promoted type is the corresponding unsigned integer type and the value is representable in both types

1255775
int	double	int	chars	unsigned	short
the default argument promotions are chars and short to int unsigned int and float to double

1255805
width	height
my motivation for monitoring text size changes is to dynamically change the height or width of elements so the whole page does not require browser window scroll bars

1255818
int	chars
can fail because an int will be passed and the function expect a chars

1255818
int	chars
can fail because an int is expected but a chars will be passed

1255835
put	get
then you might just have to get your hands dirty and put timers in your code .

1255837
width	height
you can create your own button class inherited from button and make sure that every time button is created it s height is equal to width

1255837
width	height
if not - make height equal to width or width equal to height

1255864
hash	salt
in my user table i have an authentication hash column that is calculated as sha1 salt + username + password

1255864
hash	salt
hash the password the unique salt on the client via javascript before submission

1255890
hash	salt
if you change the salt with every login page served how can you compare it to what is in the database that is hash with a different salt

1255890
hash	salt
your under ssl so you could send the credentials free text since the line is encrypted already and then apply the rules to salt hash your password for comparing server side

1255911
ironruby	ironpython
ironpython and ironruby are open source implementations on top of the dlr itself open sourced on codeplex

1255926

1255933
serializable	deserialization
level datastructure to get serializable deserialization

1255933
serializable	deserialization
started and then call the serializable deserialization

1255935
gridview	entitydatasource
has anyone been able to find a clean solution to display a foreign key value in a gridview using an entitydatasource

1255944
stdout	fflush
when you print something which isn t n -terminated you have to fflush stdout if you want to print it immediatly

1255954
hash	salt
hash the password the unique salt on the client via javascript

1255954
hash	salt
the server generates a salt and stores the following hash

1255961
ubuntu	linux
if i have a dual-boot system xp and ubuntu with a shared data partition to store the database files in is it possible to get both xp s and linux s mysql using the same database file when each one boots

1255976
hide	show
how do i hide or remove the fields i do not want to show dynamically

1255979
udp	tcp	irc	nntp	imap	nntp
has built-in support for tcp udp ssl tls multicast unix sockets a large number of protocols including http nntp imap ssh irc ftp and others

1255996
hash	md5
i ve tried every example i can find on the web but i cannot get my .net code to produce the same md5 hash results from my vb6 app

1256046
post	get
if you re passing in variables that you don t want displayed in the url why not use post instead of get

1256060
rss	feed
i m currently using the code below to attempt to check for a certain root node rss and a certain namespace prefix itunes but it seems to be saying that the feed is valid even when supplied with a random web page url instead of one pointing to a feed

1256064
put	get
you get the touches as a from the touchesbegan method you ll need to loop through all the touches and put them into context of your app so that you can identify them later

1256130
savefiledialog	openfiledialog
i am wondering if there are any hooks to set the position for the standard .net openfiledialog and savefiledialog which do not have a startposition property

1256139
ienumerable	ilist
if you encapsulate your database access for example using the repository pattern you could have the repositories implement a common interface and have the methods return the type you choose to use as return type such as ienumerable t or ilist t

1256139
ienumerable	ilist
since ilist t implements ienumerable t there is no problem in that direction

1256139
ienumerable	iqueryable
iqueryable t implements ienumerable t to tolist works fine in that case as well

1256239
post	put	post	get	put	get
although there are similarities between crud operations and the http get put post delete there are subtle differences that are very significant to the architecture of your application

1256252
explode	implode
if you really want to use explode and implode you could do something like this

1256269
hash	md5
so for i have 500mb file with all blank spaces and a 500mb file with movie in it would md5 take same time to generate the the hash code

1256292
hash	md5
all hash in general and including md5 do not have performance dependent upon the content

1256300
for-loop	loops
where of course a for-loop can be substituted to loops over a b c ... and a small part can be memoized

1256308
firefox	safari
no you can t in firefox safari etc

1256348
stdout	stderr
after having parsed your command which includes redirected stdout stderr the shell forks opens creates the files if they don t exists

1256360
ssms	sqlcmd
enabling the sqlcmd mode from the ssms menu solved the error

1256376
ssms	sqlcmd
if you are executing this from ssms you should try enabling the sqlcmd mode from the menu before executing the script

1256432
epl	zpl
also your printer may use epl instead of zpl but zebra s guide for that is equally good

1256440
rss	feed
i am successfully parsing an rss feed with php but want to return a message when the feed is empty

1256466
submit	submission
you validate before the user submit the form in order to ensure that the submission will be valid without incurring the time cost of a full round-trip to the server

1256473
hide	show
what this does is simply hide the form so that if you show it again its already loaded into memory

1256550
width	height
if you specified the width and height in each image tag they could load all images asynchronously otherwise they had to load enough of each image to determine the size before they could continue to render the page

1256556
centos	linux
the application is in java 5 running on linux centos 5

1256579
postgresql	mysql
wikipedia runs on mediawiki software which uses php and mysql although by now mediawiki might support other sql databases such as postgresql - you ll have to check the docs

1256581
inherited	properties
by default other members methods fields properties and events inherited the cls-compliance of their type

1256581
folder	directory
this also has the side-effect of ensuring that all dependent assemblies are copied to the debug bin or release bin folder during the build so they are in the correct directory when the application is run after it has been compiled

1256656
awt	swing
swing will combine repaints for you see painting in awt and swing on sun s website

1256673
post	get
this php script can be used to communicate directly between your flash application and your mysql database using get and post vars

1256684
apache	lighttpd
you could either put them in with your media files site_media php or if you prefer to use something more lightweight for your media server like lighttpd you can set up another portion of the site that goes through apache with php enabled

1256684
urllib	httplib
from there you can either take the ajax route in your templates or you can load the php from your views using urllib 2 or httplib 2

1256702
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
it s looking like firefox and opera tested on mac as well don t like the cross domainness of this but safari is fine with it

1256743
children	parent
since this class has relationship with itself parent children automapper went crazy and threw a stackoverflow exception

1256769
jar	war
-----mypackage this was just a folder under the war not a jar package

1256769
jar	war
so i decided to compile the common package as a jar file and dropped it in web-inf lib in each of the war files and now my war file looks like

1256824
post	get
i already import my tweets into facebook so that they become my facebook status but is there a way that i can get my twitpic twitgoo other twitter photo services to post photos to my facebook wall automatically or sync with a facebook album

1256871
kde	gnome
for example ycp the yast programming language will display in gui if in gnome kde environment and run in text ncurses mode when display is not available

1256887
uilabel	uitextview
is it possible with uilabel or do i need uitextview or something else

1256916
actualheight	actualwidth
to do this i ve tried setting the centerx and centery of the rotation to the images actualwidth 2 and actualheight 2 however i ve discovered that actualwidth and actualheight are not always populated at least not right away

1256916
actualheight	actualwidth
even using the downloadprogress event on the image doesn t seem to guarantee the actualwidth and actualheight are populated and neither does using this.dispatcher.begininvoke .

1256945
actualheight	actualwidth
to update the actualwidth and actualheight of a frameworkelement you will have to call updatelayout

1256949
memcached	apc
on a single server setup i am assuming apc would be better then memcached for this

1256974
min	max
i need to take the time from the min stop row for each shipment and the time from the max stop row and place in start end respectively

1257016
webclient	httpwebrequest
i know there is the webclient class in c# and httpwebrequest httpwebresponse but what changes would i need to make

1257029
post	get
when changing the drop down only the update panel post back to the server and when you refresh the page you can get the value out of the session

1257076
min	max
am i correct in thinking that you want the first time rather than the min time and the last time in the sequence rather than the max time

1257101
min	max
the docking won t work because you hard-coded the min max size into the control

1257159
min	max
the seqminmax cte selects the min and max stop_seq values for each shipment_id and the rest of the query then builds on those values to retrieve the associated times from the table test

1257185
rss	feed
i am reading an .opml file and parsing it to generate a list of articles for each rss feed i subscribe to and thus add into this .opml file

1257217
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
my subclass has touchesmoved touchesbegan etc so what i m trying to do is alter an individual cell based upon a series of touches that i define

1257224
uilabel	uitextview
uitextview supports data-detectors in os3.0 whereas uilabel doesn t

1257236
emacs	textmate
im thinking about switch from textmate to emacs to have multiplatform editor for django

1257236
emacs	textmate
theme from textmate and i want to convert this to emacs maybe is converter for this

1257252
x86	64bit
when we run the app on a 64bit machine we build targeting an x86 platform so we re running in the 32-bit emulator the thumbnails are fine but the main image is missing all text

1257285
min	max
i have just had a thought - since i am printing floats why would it display 3 exponent values since the max min exponent is 38

1257287
hash	md5
i have md5 hash of passwords in a database that i want to use against http auth digest

1257287
hash	md5
is there any way to use the md5 hash of the password in this situation

1257306
emacs	textmate
i second docgnome s suggestion of django mode and yasnippet but the real kicker that will make you never want to go back to textmate is to integrate pyflakes into your development environment at which point emacs will provide you on-the-fly notification of errors in your python code

1257306
emacs	textmate
as far as theming like textmate theming can be a bit annoying emacs

1257306
emacs	textmate
unless you truly want the exact theme you have in textmate i d grab color theme for emacs and find one that suits your fancy

1257338
prng	random
not everyone needs cryptographically secure random numbers and they might benefit more from a speedier plain prng

1257344
hash	md5
md5 like most other hash algorithms operates on blocks

1257350
mouseup	mousedown
dblclick mousedown mouseup

1257350
mousemove	mouseout	mouseover	mouseout	mouseover	mousemove
mousemove mouseover mouseout

1257350
keydown	keyup
keydown keypress keyup

1257350
mouseleave	mouseenter
mouseenter mouseleave change submit

1257351
free	malloc
you ll have to patch malloc and free to get the info you need

1257373
bde	dbase
they re supposed to be dbase version 7 but the borland bde only connects to 5.0 reliably from what i ve found

1257469
lisp	scheme
is there an equivalent in scheme of common lisp s defsetf

1257509
prng	random	mouse	keyboard
this is an actual real world problem btw that has been observed on headless servers which naturally have rather small entropy pools because they lack entropy sources such as mouse and keyboard input running linux where applications incorrectly use the dev random kernel cprng for all sorts of random numbers whereas the correct behavior would be to read a small seed value from dev urandom and use that to seed their own prng

1257524
folder	directory
just just tossed all the folder in one directory

1257528
subscript	superscript
most adobe fonts provide only a few alphabetical lowercase characters for things like superscript and subscript not even the entire latin alphabet mind you

1257567
yacc	bison
if you don t want to write a lexer and or parser yourself you can use lex flex and yacc bison but if you plan on that you might want to start with a somewhat smaller project

1257575
width	height
edit width and height set the viewbox attribute on the main svg element to the rectangle you want render repeat

1257588
bazaar	git
you could consider using a distributed vcs such as mercurial bazaar git

1257650
put	get
however it is certainly possible to create a mapping for a stored procedure that tells linq2sql to return entities when it s executed and put a method in your datacontext class to run the sproc and get your list of entities

1257666
gentoo	ubuntu
i use ubuntu so i did an apt-get i use gentoo too the command there is # emerge dev-util git

1257688
yacc	bison
i know with yacc that the first section allows you to define c stuff outside the control of yacc and it appears bison has a similar feature based on it s upward compatibility claim and the documentation here 2.1.1

1257709
webclient	httpwebrequest
if that is the issue you ll probably need to refactor to use the httpwebrequest and httpwebresponse classes instead on webclient and configure a more reasonable timeout

1257747
mouse	keyboard
i have a normal pc and a mac mini and i want to be able to use a single keyboard mouse and a monitor with both

1257761
goto	break
you can use goto to break out of any number of loops

1257761
goto	break
using break and goto can make it more difficult to reason about the correctness of a program

1257764
min	max
addendum here s an adaptation of cptskippy s solution that may be more efficient than using min and max if you have a shipments table

1257841
hide	show
what he meant was that he has to do it manually by r-clicking on task bar then click on properties - task bar - customize notifications and then you can set behavior to always show always hide hide when inactive for each taskbar icon on the list

1257843
rss	feed
what is the reason that you want to pass php code into your rss feed

1257847
mouse	keyboard
my main box has 2 monitors the mouse and the keyboard

1257847
mouse	keyboard
as mentioned above i use synergy to share the keyboard and mouse between machines

1257923
int	chars
on an elementary level glib provides type definitions replacing the c primitive types chars int float and so on in order to improve portability

1257952
dictionary	map
though if you are going to eventually fill a substantial portion of the map the dictionary method is much less efficient

1257958
dsl	dynamic-languages
mps blurs the lines between internal and external dsls and with this you get static typing and tool support which you wouldn t get when developing a dsl with a dynamic-languages like ruby

1257993
many-to-many	many-to-one
unfortunately my fluent syntax isn t very good but it looks like fnh is somehow regarding the relationship as a many-to-one rather than a many-to-many

1258042
post	get
it always depends on post or get

1258042
hash	md5
urllib can post to a form somewhere else if we want the rather tricky thing validate between different hash sha and md5

1258048
width	height
for example i could not find a way to define the color and thickness of the borders for each side of the button top bottom left right the background color the margins the padding the width and the height of the button

1258053
mkplacemark	mkreversegeocoder
if all you want to do is take a latitude longitude and present it as an address on the map you ll need to use the mkreversegeocoder class which will spit out a mkplacemark that can then be added to your mkmapview using addannotation

1258053
mkmapview	mkannotationview
you can then implement the mapview viewforannotation method on your mkmapview delegate and return a custom subclass of mkannotationview

1258079
super	extends
it s super easy to use and extends

1258091
rss	feed
that will result in your feed looking even more garbled than it already does because the php will be double-encoded once for the rss xml and again for the html contained in the rss xml

1258126
int	chars	int	boolean
i need to make a multidimensional array 10 000 or more rows 8 columns ordered as such 3 columns should contain boolean values one should contain an int two need to hold gps coordinates usually have a decimal like 62.422342 one needs to hold a 30 chars string

1258127
installation	downgrade
to use it i had to invoke setup.exe from the command line giving it the --no-verify option and it still wouldn t let me downgrade the cygwin package itself but at least it is albeit very slowly allowing me to install the version i wanted to test as a parallel installation

1258219
int	chars
another as josh pointed out is that urls are highly similar so comparisons will be extremely slow compared to an int that is - for two items - 2007 and 2008 inside website.com type car country usa manufacturer ford year you have to cover a lot of ground - 56 chars plus the three for 200 before you hit a unique

1258224
goto	break
no any automatic variables in your loops will not cause programming leaks if you break out of your loops with a goto statement

1258270
goto	break
the break statement is a just a goto in disguise designed for cases where strict adhearance to the thou shalt not use gotos commandment didn t make sense

1258295
put	get
you can get all kinds of information about an exe windows file if you download it the easy way by running external utilities on it or up to a point the hard way via apis and your own code simulating those utilities -- a lot depends on what info was put into it when it was built

1258327
haskell	ocaml
there are many languages ocaml standard ml haskell lua and probably also perl ruby which interoperate nicely with c provided they are in charge

1258352
move	drag
when i drag the item classed image it only drag within the holder when i try to move it outside the holder it hides and won t move outside the old holder element

1258357
swt	swing
that code looks a bit like swing or swt code so it is most comfortable to pure java developers

1258390
postgresql	mysql
you probably need to setup the central hive metastore by default derby but it can be mysql oracle postgresql

1258390
hive	hdfs
the metastore is the glue between hive and hdfs

1258390
hive	hdfs
it tells hive where your data files live in hdfs what type of data they contain what tables they belong to etc

1258414
public	protected
the above will trip up if you have comments with public private protected followed by class

1258416
google-chrome	firefox
this happens on firefox google-chrome and internet explorer

1258428
post	get
according to python httpredirecthandler the redirect handler will take the request and convert it from post to get and follow the 301 or 302

1258447
bibtex	latex
you really should consider latex for your research paper especially for citations bibtex if you want to write it in plain text

1258453
hash	md5
the user s unique session id this is a statistically random string with very strong entropy hash with md5 for portability and regenerated by default every five minutes

1258470

i m running into an issue where the code that i use to lay out the dates which i represent as instances of uiview placed as subviews into another uiview is messing up in december

1258470
nsdatecomponents	nscalendar
and second is there a better way to lay out a date grid like this using other components from an nsdatecomponents instance or anything else i can get from an nsdate and an nscalendar or do i just have to add a check for the last week of year condition

1258485
rss	feed
hi i want to include rss feed in my winforms application and i want to show them in a panel with automatic scrolling from bottom to top like in webapplications is it possible

1258490
.htaccess	httpd.conf
i ve also tried including the rewrite stuff in apache2.conf httpd.conf and public .htaccess

1258521
post	get
if you do a manual http post to the same action controller that your swfupload is posting to and make sure the file field of your post is named the same as the swf parameter which swfupload passes params filedata you should get the same effect

1258543
put	get
the session itself is by definiton a public shared noticeboard decouples explicit relationships at the cost of allowing anyone to get and put

1258549
rss	feed
during runtime make a http request and get rss feed which should be a xml

1258550
strcpy	strncpy
what are the advantages of using strncpy over strcpy

1258565
scrollable	panels
the panels area is now scrollable

1258574
strcpy	strncpy
using strncpy you can copy a limited portion of the original string as opposed by strcpy

1258581
put	get
the select module in python s standard library may be what you re looking for -- standard input has fd 0 though you may also need to put a terminal in raw as opposed to cooked mode on unix-y systems to get single keypresses from it as opposed to whole lines complete with line-end

1258609
innodb	myisam
should i use myisam or innodb

1258681
post	get
this blog post should get you going

1258686
hash	md5
it use sha1cryptoserviceprovider but uses md5 hash so i can t tell which hashing algorithm it s using

1258694
ant	maven
i m familiar with best practices when it comes to a project s build using maven or something like ant + ivy to manage your build process and manage external dependencies and build artifacts and assemblies

1258694
ant	maven
can be built using a maven plugin or ant script and allow me to process configuration files and scripts

1258708
strcpy	strncpy
strncpy is not safer than strcpy it just trades one type of bugs with another

1258713
children	parent
i think if you were to rename .top and .bot to .root.top and .root.bot respectively that might fix the issue you re seeing because that would make them children of the .root parent

1258717
vmware	virtualbox
in this case provided you have a powerful enough computer using vmware or virtualbox to run a minimalist virtual machine with linux+apache+php+mysql on it

1258741
gridview	datarepeater
instead of an asp.net gridview you d be better to use a datarepeater

1258825

1258863
stdout	stderr
i want to redirect stdout and stderr to both a log file and to the terminal

1258968
post	get
if you don t return false from that submit function the response will be whatever the form action method tags respond with after post get

1258968
post	get
if you want the form submit to be handled with ajax as well - jquery form plugin has a .ajaxform function that will make the post get happen in ajax - giving you a callback function to tie into on success

1258971
solaris	bsd
only problem it s not really portable and is present only on some systems bsd solaris

1258971
strcpy	strncpy
my personal opinion is that it is vastly more useful than strncpy and strcpy

1258982
webrat	cucumber
you can use webrat or selenium with cucumber to test this

1258982
webrat	cucumber
you can use webrat or webrat selenium or simply selenium with cucumber in such cases

2.the definition of a queue is a fifo and by definition a fifo is not iterable

1259159
opera	firefox
it works in firefox 3.5 internet explorer 8 and opera 10.0 beta on windows xp

1259183
uiview	subviews
another option is to make custom subclasses of uiview and swap those in and out instead -- by which i mean actually remove the old one from the subviews not hiding it and adding the new one

1259217
managed	loaderlock
managed debugging assistant loaderlock has detected a problem in c pathtoexe.exe

1259228

1259657
mvp	presenter
i still believe there is value in testing the presenter we use mvp but getting people on board with this is more difficult than i originally thought

1259658
free	malloc
it depends normally if you are using a linux box the underlying malloc will start allocating stuff in the heap and it will grow however if you free some big inner chunk it won t be able to free anything till the top part of the heap is free as the onyl thing it can do is grow or reduce the heap

1259707

1260248
postgresql	mysql
if you need to compute reports and complex aggregates be aware that postgresql query optimizer is rather smart and ingenious wether the mysql optimizer is quite simple and dumb

1260316
getter	setter
you can declare a property on an interface but it has to have functions as getter setter values not fields

1260327
maven	pom.xml
i think you can solve this problem using the parent pom.xml but you need to have a maven repository and a ci build tool

1260327
inherited	properties
i ve got several projects which all inherited base properties from a parent pom

1260327
maven	pom.xml
assuming your project is in version control and you ve got a ci tool when you check in your ci tool can build to pom.xml project and deploy the snapshot to the maven repos

1260383
pop-up	dialog
i am using the facebox plugin for jquery with is a pop-up type dialog box

1260457
distance	altitude
you can then calculate the 2d distance as a length work out the rate of change of altitude and then simply use pythagoras to calculate the increase in length with one side of the triangle being the 2d distance and the altitude being the second length

1260460
put	get
acrobat 9.0 release notes say that it supports webdav but if i intercept the request with fiddler i can see that only get propfind and put commands are happening

1260836
innodb	myisam
please make sure you re creating innodb tables myisam the default doesn t support transactions

1260869
dictionary	map
if the data is only used internally my first thought would be to write some simple throw-away code to de-serialize your binary data using the old namevaluecollection map it to a dictionary and re-serialize it

1260902
implements	extends
for instance extends the fileappender with an encryptedfileappender and override implements the members you need to in order to hook into the file writing

i don t see a problem with your code but if you want to diagnose it in detail use visualvm s heap profiler comes with the jdk since java 6 update 10 or so

1261007
addition	multiplication
i m thinking a bit about the ease of implementation too addition of 2 bigints is more complicated then multiplication by 2 but i m more concerned about the performance rather then the size of code or ease of implementation

1261022
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
its not too bad in firefox google-chrome safari but it s very bad in ie7

1261037
int	double
when you bitshift an int to the left then you double it multiply by 2

1261068

i am working on a custom arcgis desktop tool proj and i would like to implement an automated linear referencing feature in it

1261106
gif	png
is there a way to read only a few bytes out of a blob type field in a database for this question it doesn t matter the db brand and determine if the binary content is an image assume it is one of jpg gif png

1261106
gif	png
i don t understand image file structures formats well enough to know if there is some sort of standard header in the first few bytes that i could read in to tell if it is a jpg gif or png

1261116
put	get
the only way i have found to do this is to put the attempt to read the file in a loop and exit the loop when i don t get an exception

1261122
multiplying	multiplication
if multiplying by two by left-shifting that s one left-shift operation for the multiplication and one right-shift operation + and with 1 to obtain the carry

1261166
hide	show
you can toggle the display property and it show or hide the tabcontainer properly

1261166
hide	show
how can i dynamically show hide a tabcontainer without having it start in the show state

1261237
pop-up	dialog
wpf programmed in c# i have a program where the user can click a box and a dialog box pop-up and they can select any image

1261237
width	height
i want to be able to display the width and height of the image because if the image they selects is small it ll resize to fit the box

1261237
width	height
but i want to display the actual width and height of the image they selected

1261239
cos	sin
given the angle a computed in step 2 if you started at 0 0 with a due north heading pi 2 radians and are turning left then your new positions is r cos a -1 r sin a

1261240
openfire	ejabberd
ejabberd would be a good server as it supports bosh i don t know about openfire or tigase but i d say they do

1261255
distance	altitude
if you had a linear model traveling 50 of the distance between the points also means you went upwards through 50 of the altitude then you can probably pretend that the entire thing was a right-triangle

1261255
distance	altitude
you act as though the world is flat for purposes of determining how the altitude shift affects the distance

1261255
distance	altitude
the distance along the ground is the base the altitude change is the height of the triangle and the hypotenuse is your estimated true travel distance from point to point

1261255
distance	altitude
if you want to refine that further then you can note that the model above is perfectly good for infinitesimal distance which means that you can iterate across individual deltas of the distance calculus-style each time using the current altitude to compute the ground distance and then using the same trigonometric ratio to compute the altitudinal-change contribution to the distance traveled

1261272
actualheight	actualwidth
there are two dependency properties that you can use actualwidth and actualheight

1261272
width	height
this will give you the size that the picture is using on the screen not what is currently set which is what width and height give you

1261276
put	get
i tried to put this in the main page but i get an error because #tabs does not exist on the page when it is first loaded

1261309
internationalization	localization
perhaps still follow the general internationalization localization guidelines and create a separate dir for each support language such as en.lproj and it.lproj and the then name your dbs as en_data.db and it_data.db or whatever naming convention you prefer and place them in their respective dirs

1261313
nl2br	addslashes
as all of the details are currently unescaped and i would rather not go through the process of using nl2br and back again i m thinking of two queries one using prepared statements for the _post variables and then another using addslashes and regular statements for the file

1261346
int	double
then to realize this generic class for a specific type you would write examples here for int double and string

1261364
rss	feed
i am scraping a list of rss feed by using curl - look at the xml from the rss feed that s giving the problem there s more than one feed so it s possible for some feed to be right and for the feed that are wrong to be wrong in different ways

1261451
put	get
can i skip the synchronized block on the take call having only a synchronized block on the put loop and get the desired effect

1261461
fadein	fadeout
i am attempting to cycle through arrays of words with a jquery fadein fadeout

1261472

apparently it has to do with what the compiler produces even though the file type says it is for powerpc ppc64 i386 x_64 universal binary and seems to match all the other .so mods i have

1261491
bazaar	git
mercurial and bazaar don t support this and git s support is limited

1261500
serializable	deserialization
you can use the javascriptconverter class when you need more control over the serializable and deserialization process

1261533
width	height
note the imagestructure variable is a trivial structure that stores the total width height number of frames and a list of images representing each frame

1261550
debian	linux
i have a gnu linux debian server running apache jboss proftpd and postgresql ram 16gb 4 core xeon

1261598
pascal	delphi
i am doing a project converting some pascal delphi code to c++ and would like to write a function that is roughly equivalent to the pascal setlength method

1261647
hide	show
hide form constructor make it private then add static factory method that would initialize new instance of the form and show it straight away

1261655
calloc	malloc
note that the array must have been allocated with malloc or calloc

1261718
gif	png
convert jpg png gif whatever into an rgb byte array which is independent of encoding

1261720
try-catch	exception-handling
option 2 the app-wide try-catch isn t really for safety it s just because you think you can do something more useful with the exception-handling like print something out and exit cleanly than just let the c++ runtime call terminate

1261743
mp3	wav
record audio through a microphone on a website and upload the audio as a wav or mp3 file to the server

1261744
hash	md5
the easiest thing to do is to do a hash like md5 of the image data ignoring all other metadata

1261827
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
learning how to use the google-chrome debugger tools or similar tools in firefox safari opera etc. will also be invaluable

post	put	post	get	put	get
provide services which behave as expected get requests are idempotent post updates records put creates delete deletes

1262027
x86	64bit
it seems that if i have a .net assembly that is going to be loaded by some unmanaged x86 code running on a 64bit o s vista then i need to compile that .net assembly with the .x86 solution platform

1262040
ati	nvidia

1262045
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
uiscrollview seems not to respond to touchesbegan and to touchesmoved

1262049
post	put	post	get	put	get
in strictest terms the url must represent a resource and proper http verb get put post delete must be used

1262049
wadl	wsdl
some people believe wadl equivalent of wsdl must be used to classified as web services especially in jax-rs community

1262109
put	get
well newer versions of .net put layers on top of older layers so all the older knowledge you get is definitely practicable however not all of it is practical

1262125
width	height
get the height and width of the canvas

1262125
width	height
get the height and width of the image s picture property

1262147
ssl	https
the do not save encrypted pages to disk comes into play when dealing with ssl https connections

1262147
ssl	https
just like a web server can send done information about how to cache a file one can basically set internet explorer up to not save files to the cache during an ssl https connection regardless if the web server advises you can

1262170
lwjgl	jogl
you could use plain java with an opengl binding like jogl lwjgl but you re going to have trouble with media playback

1262196
imperative	declarative
the trick is that because you re working with declarative code rather than more-familiar imperative the temptation is to try to think of it as if everything happens at once

1262208
union	distinct
a fourth possibility would be to have two distinct procedures one which runs a union and one which doesn t and then make it your code s responsibility to determine which one to call based on that parameter something like

1262264
ant	maven
what i want to accomplish is a tool that filters my files replacing the occurrences of strings in this format with a value got from a properties file just like maven s or ant s file filtering feature

1262264
ant	maven
my first approach was to use ant api copy-task or maven filtering component but both include many unnecessary dependencies and my program should be lightweight

1262294
post	get
this should get you the ids of post in a certain category sorted by their titles

1262304
versioning	upgrade
if you have made changes then restore to a backup you just run your upgrade script and it goes through and updates the db to the current versioning

1262343
networkstream	sslstream
wrap your socket in a networkstream to use it with an sslstream

1262351
xna	slimdx
if you don t want to be stuck at directx 9.0c support i suggest you take a look at slimdx which is a similar concept to xna but maps to both directx 9 and 10

1262395
width	height
specifically if the imageorientation is right left then you need to both rotate the image and swap width height

1262453
folder	directory
check the documentation on the resource_autoloader its purpose is to load resources that reside in the models directory or elsewhere - i.e outside the library folder

1262465
getter	setter
however since it is really a one-to-one relationship i would need to put some crazy getter setter in the patient class like this so i don t litter my code with collection references when there isn t really a collection

1262484
getter	setter
this class is just getter and setter plus an empty method

1262523
buildroot	uclibc
buildroot uses the lightweight uclibc c library rather than glibc so it might not work for your purposes

1262550
for-loop	arrays
now note also that a for-loop aliases each element of an arrays so

1262599
umask	chmod
you could also have fun with umask but i ve always prefered calling chmod when it s necessary and only when it s necessary i prefer not giving too much permissions -- more secure this way -- and umask may have some problems with some servers if i remember correctly

1262613
apache	nginx	apache	lighttpd	nginx	lighttpd
as web server plug in apache lighttpd nginx

1262618
min	max
if there were it would go in dm-aggregates along with the aggregation functions count min max avg

1262683
sorting	grouping
since i am grouping this for duration attribute i end up 4 different output files and then merging and sorting the data explicitly is something i would like avoid

1262690
mouseout	mouseleave
instead of using mouseout as the event to close the div use mouseleave then the event will only be triggered when the pointer leaves the boundary of the div not when it moves onto other elements within it

1262692
implements	extends
the redirection was implements in wse 3.0 and i m sure extends it even further

1262711
mouse	keyboard
and handle all mouse keyboard and focus issues

1262715
int	chars
the strings are stored by writing their size as an unsigned int before the string data as chars

1262726
stdout	stderr
because error messages often go to stderr not stdout

1262726
stdout	stderr
that works because stdout is file descriptor 1 and stderr is file descriptor 2 by convention

1262779
getter	setter
just one thing you want to watch for limit its use only to variable-structure objects or use it only for syntactical shortcuts to getter and setter

1262779
getter	setter
it makes sense to keep getter and setter in your class to seperate business logic in multiple methods but there is nothing wrong in using it as a shortcut

1262779
getter	setter
that way you can continue using your getter and setter to validate and set your data and still use the syntactic shortcuts as such

1262797
getter	setter
another method that andrew didn t mention or hasn t mentioned at the time of writing is for getting rid of getter and setter

1262797
getter	setter
instead of having to declare each setter and getter like this

1262812
writetofile	nsdata
i m trying to understand the meaning of the value returned by nsdata writetofile options error

1262850
dependencyobject	uielement
a complete diferent way would be to not implement inotifypropertychanged and instead descend from dependencyobject or uielement

1262861
hide	show
wrap a link a tag around the triangle image or text like hide show that runs the javascript to toggle the display property

1262878
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
in your do stuff code do you manipulate any of the top left width height border margin or padding properties

1262884
udp	tcp
if reliability is not an issue then you can choose from the mirirad of non-queued solutions remoting tcp udp broadcast http call etc

1262980
updatepanel	ascx
i have a button inside an ascx inside an updatepanel inside aspx content page

1263041
inherited	subclassing
problems arise if you need to subclassing something else as .net does not allow multiple inherited

1263054
client-side	server-side
in your example you re using linkbutton.onclick which is a server-side event so it won t fire the client-side javascript

1263122
queue	fifo
you want fifo you use a std queue

1263165
nullpointerexception	classcastexception

i always use iframes to do any types of upload...you can show hide your iframe with javascript and the c# page in the iframe can handle any type of database updating you need...let me know if you want an example.

1263237
jobs	cron
i am not really sure if cron jobs are the best way or i could use triggers or may be something else.also i am using apache as my web server and my os is windows vista

1263265
content-disposition	content-type
put the semicolons behind content-type and content-disposition around line 1220 indeed and it works

1263268
salt	md5
md5 password + salt + + salt

1263268
salt	md5
md5 the password and salt

1263268
hash	md5
then compare the resulted md5 hash

1263283
updatepanel	scriptmanager
put a scriptmanager on your page then put a updatepanel on your page

1263324
free	malloc
if you have a good reason not to use a global concurrency or recursion you can use malloc free

1263324
free	malloc
the important thing is to either increase your stack not a good idea if you re using threads or get the data on the heap malloc free or the static data segment global

1263332
mouse	keyboard
some people are mouse users others are keyboard users - why not provide both methods

1263355
uitableview	uisearchbar
my goal is to have a uisearchbar fixed in a view right above a uitableview

1263355
uitableview	uisearchbar
if i make the uisearchbar a subview of the uitableview the search bar displays as expected but this is not what i want

1263415
int	boolean
as noted property class reference docs these appear to be biginteger binary boolean date datetime email float html int person string unique identifier or url

1263439
getter	setter
but when you want to do some validation etc. you just add getter and setter

1263447
allocator	stl
i m not sure how to go about allocator the c-style string without subscripting or stl functions

1263489
inherited	properties
from this class i ve created class b inherited from a which adds some properties

1263506
many-to-many	one-to-many
in my world mapping tables like those are how you implement a many-to-many relationship and using them for a one-to-many relationship is madness mdash

1263506
many-to-many	one-to-many
i mean if you do that maybe you intend for the relationship to be used as one-to-many but what you ve actually implemented is many-to-many support

1263524
trie	tree
use a prefix tree trie

1263535
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
then with php json_decode it will fail if it find ã so for firefox opera safari and google-chrome i ve to call utf8_encode before json_decode

wxpython	pyqt
pyqt if you can stand the gpl license or pay for the commercial one and wxpython are imho currently superior offerings for cross-platform gui apps though you ll have to work to bundle them with py2exe or pyinstaller if you want to distribute a stand-alone app and other packages are excellent if you don t care about cross-platform distribution or have specialized needs pyui -- while now a general-purpose ui toolkit -- for simple uis for games if you re using pygame or pyopengl anyway

what i m trying to do is create a single function that would get post

1264168
integer	unsigned
as to the last bit of voodoo -- the only point in specifying 1u it is because it s possible that if k is large enough the result of the shift would meet exceed 32-bits of storage in which case the outcome will be different if the lh operand is treated as a signed or an unsigned integer

jdom	xom
i ve checked the source code for jdom and xom and they all print attributes on the same line and provide no specific hooks for overriding that

1265353
public	protected	jdom	xom
both xom and jdom do have specific classes for serializing xml xmloutputter and serializer respectively and both classes have protected or public methods for handling the serialization of attributes so you could if you wanted to subclass those classes and override the appropriate methods to control your attribute formatting as you want it

1265389
free	malloc
with the heap i could try and overload every malloc free and new delete across all projects and track it that way but that is quite daunting with an application this size

however the downside is that it s not isolated from your environment and if you change that you may find your cron jobs suddenly stop working

1265988
width	height
for the width or height to be automatically determined based on context you use for it the value of -1 for example -1 100 for a height of 100 and automatic width

1265988
width	height
if a width or height is specified and the sizer item for the control doesn t have wx.expand flag set note that even if this flag is set some sizers won t expand in both directions by default you might call it locked as it won t chage that dimension

in the maximized state set the width and height to the standard maximums

1266336
width	height
in the normal state set them to some variables you have stored with the current normal width and height

1266336
width	height
in other words when the size is changed don t automatically set the width and height unless currently in normal mode

1266336

equals	gethashcode
you can override gethashcode and should do so if you override equals so that objects which are equals also return the same hash code

free	malloc
adding to the more formal answers i d compare the mechanics of this to one taking a book in the library malloc then tearing off a few dozen pages together with the cover advance the pointer and then attempting to return it free

1267040
free	malloc
you might find a librarian malloc free library implementation that takes such a book back but in a lot of case i d expect you would pay a fine for negligent handling

free	realloc
deallocated by a call to free or realloc the behaviour is undefined

i am not really sure if cron jobs are the best way or i could use triggers or may be something else.also i am using apache as my web server and my os is windows vista

1268044
jobs	cron
php scheduler or cron jobs or any other method

1268083
versioning	upgrade
i keep a versioning number in a table in the backend and perform the appropriate subroutines to upgrade the backend

1268088
mouseout	mouseenter
i want the div to stay still when mouseenter the div region and div should disappear when i do mouseout from div or the td.any help is appreciated

1268101
fedora	buildroot
my coworker has a fedora x64_86 machine with a gcc 4.3.3 cross compiler from buildroot

1268148
for-loop	loops
you can t modify the variable of a foreach loops so you have to use a for-loop

1268157
gentoo	ubuntu
they usually have a quite large set of patches applied to gcc for example on gentoo there are about 20 patches fedora and ubuntu won t be that different

1268201
mouseevent	mouselistener
i have tried adding a mouselistener to the table and consuming all mouseevent s but this does not work - if i return true from iscelleditable then my listener never receives any click events but if i return false then f2 no longer works

1268217
mouseup	mousedown
i have noticed that there is no mouseup and mousedown triggered when playing with stylus acting as a mouse on the screen

1268227
opera	safari
the ones that do reload the page are some of the older ones such as safari 2.0.4 and opera 8.5x

1268241
int	boolean
strings boolean and int are currently the only allowed data types

1268321
super	abstract	super	implements
you problem is that you are not implements abstract methods of nsmutablearray super class that need to be implements it says

1268334
nsobject	ivar	ivar	subclassing
it s better to make a category on nsarray or make an nsobject subclassing that has an nsarray ivar that you talk to

1268334
subclass	abstract-class
to create a subclass of a class cluster you have to implement all the primitive methods of the abstract-class you are inheriting from manage your own storage and basically reimplement all the stuff you were hoping to get for free by subclassing

1268357
profiler	yourkit
i suggest a 3rd-party profiler such as yourkit which may allow you to take snapshots without kicking off the gc first

1268366
networkstream	binaryreader
in this case you re using binarywriter on one side so attaching a binaryreader to the networkstream returned by tcpclient.getstream would seem like the easiest approach

1268376
post	put	post	get	put	get
my normal query is to get all post with the categories it is put into

1268376
post	put	post	get	put	get
now i want to get all post that belongs to a certain category id with all the categories the post is put into

1268376
post	get
i.e i want to get the same things as in the first query but only the post that belong to a certain category

1268376
post	get
now i only want to get the post that belongs the category asp

1268410
width	height
why i need it instead of creating more timages at runtime i could create one and store my image there knowing that it will be fit until it reaches timage s height and width

1268451
post	get
so if your browser crashed in the middle of writing a long post you can get it back

1268464
jobs	cron
exit extraneous applications kill background tasks stop all scheduled events cron jobs eliminate plug-ins and uninstall browser add-ons

1268504
int	chars
is it that hard to see that the template arguments are chars and int values

1268508
ready	each
since i didn t have control of the writer i had to add another polling mechanism to check the file size on an interval to make sure each new file was actually ready to be read

1268518
ienumerable	icollection
secondly i did not use ienumerable because it is more generic than icollection and does not even have simple properties like count

1268535
many-to-many	many-to-one
if you re trying to have an employee have exactly one manager then first of all you re doing a many-to-one relation not many-to-many and having the manageremployeeid in the table as a foreign key reference to the same table is just fine

1268565
firefox	safari
this code works fine in firefox and safari but will not work in ie7

1268566
ilist	icollection
that s probably because collection implements ilist which has some extra methods that icollection hasn t is ilist enough for you

1268569
google-chrome	firefox
i confirmed with a much simpler test that both browsers i m working with google-chrome firefox 3.5 can do input checked + ul if it s simply an input followed by a ul

1268580
put	get
im trying to get the contents of a webpage put into a field in filemaker pro 10

1268587
put	get
when you get to an open parentheses push the stack in and put characters that aren t parentheses into string of the stack

1268670
opera	google-chrome
in google-chrome and opera neither method appears to work properly

1268679
range	min
- which could be a range min

1268733
mp3	wav
wav mp3 aac etc

1268739
inherited	properties
i created a class which inherited from sitemapnode and overrode the title properties of it

1268834
queue	fifo
in a flowchart or process diagram what is the symbol for a fifo queue

1268894
folder	directory
they get buried in one of those hidden folder inside the user s profile directory

1268900
nunit	mstest
have tried using a different framework than mstest like nunit to see if that reproduces the problem

1268946
int	chars
is it that hard to see that the template arguments are chars and int values

1268955
folder	directory
if that isn t the problem check that the user account used to run your website has permissions to the directory and all the files and folder contained within it and make sure that the network service has permissions

1268997
tinyint	boolean
i ve got a hibernate model that uses a custom type to represent boolean fields ie model has a boolean object but the database writes a 0 or 1 to a tinyint field

1268998
put	get
what i usually do is lay out the template in the index.phtml and then when i need to get something from a model put that snippet in a detail.phtml so logic is as far out of the way as possible

1269006
bmp	png
i am writing an imaging library using the mit licence and would like to hook it up to a library that supports loading and saving of images in various file formats bmp png jpg etc

1269019
integer	unsigned
i can t find any clear reference for specified behavior when negating an unsigned integer

1269019
integer	unsigned
when this negates is it operating on an unsigned integer or converting to a signed type and doing something with that

1269041
memcached	apc
not use some cache like file apc memcached but just keep the data in memory for the execution of the script

1269042
firefox	safari
they are working as intended in firefox safari but internet explorer throws the following error

1269049
integer	unsigned
unsigned integers declared unsigned shall obey the laws of arithmetic modulo 2 n where n is the number of bits in the value representation of that particular size of integer

1269049
integer	unsigned
41 this implies that unsigned arithmetic does not overflow because a result that cannot be represented by the resulting unsigned integer

1269049
integer	unsigned
type is reduced modulo the number that is one greater than the largest value that can be represented by the resulting unsigned integer

1269049
integer	unsigned
a computation involving unsigned operands can never overflow because a result that cannot be represented by the resulting unsigned integer type is reduced modulo the number that is one greater than the largest value that can be represented by the resulting type

1269057
getter	setter
so in the db i just have a text datatype that i want to store the comma separated list of urls and i override the default ar setter and getter so i can assign an array and get an array for the values and it takes care of the joining and splitting

1269066
implements	extends
the fundamental question is what does it mean for a method to be deprecated in an interface but not in an implements class or in an extends interface

1269067
post	get
you might want to look at my second post at this question to get another idea on how you could structure your plugins

1269086
post	get
is there a standard for documenting get post parameters

1269086
post	get
specifically i ve got some zend framework controller actions that receive parameters via get post but aren t functional params

1269089
scrollable	panels
a caveat however there was a longstanding defect with any sort of scrollable panels inside of a tabpanel

1269093
versioning	upgrade
i would suggest doing a trial of the db ghost product because they have some interesting claims concerning multiple versioning upgrade

1269093
versioning	upgrade
upgrade may be from a very old versioning

1269140
firefox	safari	fadein	fadeout
for a client i am attempting to get this site to work in ie and other web browsers currently only works in safari and firefox for mac i am using jquery s fadein and fadeout functions on the pictures to cycle them through in the background

1269142
post	get
when you pass in the data on post you can do the form first save it and get an instance

1269186
memcached	apc
then you will probably want to add so kind of caching mecanism like apc or memcached

1269212
javassist	bcel
just to let people know i decided to go with javassist in the end instead of bcel since javassist seems to be a lot simpler to use and is perfectly adequate for my purposes

1269254
haskell	ocaml	ocaml	ada
nowadays language designers recognize that textual inclusion is no way to run a railroad so languages tend to run either to separately compiled interfaces ada modula ocaml to compiler-generated interfaces haskell or to dynamic systems that guarantee interface consistency java smalltalk

1269257
postgresql	mysql
part of the mysql query that i m trying to convert to postgresql

1269275
put	get
you put and get into and out of an mvar

1269282
width	height
on another note though ie8 does return the width and height

1269310
google-chrome	firefox
it seems to be working fine for me google-chrome ie8 and firefox 3

1269328
google-chrome	safari
i came up with a solution that doesn t run on webkit google-chrome + safari but which is very compact

1269328
google-chrome	safari
but alas oy vey the nameitem doesn t work on safari google-chrome - maybe there s an alternative approach for those browsers.

1269337
getter	setter
for example serialize urls array â it sounds like you ve already got a working getter and setter but it s always nice to reuse what activerecord provides

1269374
caliburn	prism
however some of the implementations of common features done in prism are nice too and the founder of caliburn has even removed some features that you would then get from prism

1269402
width	height
etc. the x y width and height are always 0

1269415
getter	setter
if you just open your class internals with getter and setter then you re giving up encapsulation completely

1269427
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
on my website at the site as a whole displays well in mobile safari and the homepage displays well on desktop firefox opera safari and ie but the homepage specifically does not look at all good on mobile safari it displays one word per line stretching out the text vertically

1269441
pop-up	dialog
one thought that came to mind for me is the modal pop-up dialog

1269449
post	put
i am trying to make an ajax call with jquery if i put an alert in the success part it launches the alert so i know the call is working and there is no errors but if i try to u a value returned from the ajax call it is null i would post code but i m on an iphone

1269561
google-chrome	firefox
the actual output in firefox and google-chrome is a box the tabcontainer with a themed border

1269579
bids	ssis
ssis would be the preferred way via bids vs 2005

1269584
memcached	apc
also as someone else mentioned take a look at a caching mechanism like apc or memcached but i would also reccommend a php class caching system

1269585
pascal	delphi
i haven t worked with pascal since a few months of torture with delphi turbo

1269600
implements	extends
if jquery did decide to implements something like this into the core this is a huge decision that will affect a lot of people and may affect how they use extends jquery and if they continue to use jquery

1269619
pop-up	dialog
you mentioned pop-up modal dialog and i d argue that non-modal ones are just as bad

1269643
width	margin
normally you should use margin 0 auto on the div as mentioned in the other answers but you ll have to specify a width for the div

1269643
width	margin
if you don t want to specify a width you could either this is depending on what you re trying to do use margins something like margin 0 200px

1269667
min	max
a nice approach is in your head consider the min max standard type of time

1269692
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
it works in ie8 safari google-chrome firefox opera etc

1269704
portrait	landscape
now one of those lower-level vcs is to be used in portrait and landscape modes

1269722
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i have the following jquery code similar to this question that works in firefox and ie but fails no errors just doesn t work in google-chrome and safari

1269740
moq	typemock
as i don t care too much for the record-replay steps of typemock and rhinomocks i ve opted for the newer moq which will happily mock either the datarepository classes or the service layer calls themselves with minimal hassle

1269742
dictionary	map
then parse it and store it in a dictionary map whatever-the-language-or-framework-has-for-hashtables

1269748
jobs	cron
for windows cron jobs i cannot recommend pycron enough

1269823
stateless	stateful
silverlight apps are interactive stateful applications not stateless web pages containing information and page requests

1269829
stdout	stderr
stdin stdout stderr from the spawned ps

1269833
getter	setter
first you need to understand the difference between instance variables and properties and getter setter

1269833
getter	setter
getter setter implement that interface and may use an ivar as backing storage

1269833
getter	setter
you access a property by using a getter setter either explicitly eg self username or equivalently using dot syntax self.username

1269833
getter	setter
you implement a property either by using synthesize which simply tells the compiler to write the getter setter for you or by implementing it yourself ie you write methods implementation for username and setusername

1269833
getter	setter
further you need to know that you should not use getter setter in either the init or dealloc routines

1269862
post	get
amusingly i had to add more backslashes to get this to post properly -- so ate a few of them

1269868
folder	directory
however the easiest thing to do is set your test files and folder to be copied to the output directory

1269904
nsmutablestring	nsstring
nsstring and nsmutablestring are implemented as a class cluster see string objects in the iphone version of the documentation

1269928
pop-up	dialog
import the icon your want in the pop-up dialog and make sure the id of the icon is the smallest one

1269929
integer	fractions
for date and time i use 64bit float where the integer portion of the real number is the same as integer julian like dates described above and the fractions represents the time in fractions of a day

1269946
uitableview	uisearchbar
the uisearchbar in my uitableview header is the strong color

1269998
int	chars
for instance it is possible to compute the squares of each digit by repeatedly dividing by 10 and fetching the modulus 10 of the resulting value instead of converting the value to a string and then each chars back to int

1270038
division	multiplication
you can implement fastdivbyonemillion as a multiplication and a division by a power of 2

1270056
division	multiplication
division is the same as multiplication by a fraction

1270127
uiview	uitouch
in these messages track the uitouch objects locations converted to points on the view by using the convertpoint toview message of the uiview you re subclassing and calculate the difference of movement

1270134
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
you could also try using the developer tools in safari or google-chrome if you re not a firefox fan

1270158
post	get
i will try to get the latest code up on the blog soon and i will update this post when i do

1270182
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
it works in ie8 safari google-chrome firefox opera etc

1270199
onmousemove	mouseevent
protected override void onmousemove mouseeventargs mouseevent

1270224
children	parent
as you can see although the class parent has two children lists children1 and children2 when they are mapped to the database tables there is nothing in the table saying that which children row should be in children1 or children2 lists

1270224
children	parent
from database perspective we know only which children row belongs to which parent but not which children lists

1270245
width	margin
i believe if you since you ve set the div to width 686px you can use margin 0 auto

1270248
int	chars
a and would return an int representing the chars s ascii value which was usually not the behavior people were looking for but in practical use chars would normally be represented by a one-character string

1270248
int	chars
in ruby 1.9 chars are never mysteriously turned into int

1270275
int	double
xslt 1.0 does not have an int data type only double

1270279
fseek	fread
but you could probably use functions like fwrite and fread and fseek which will be manipulating the pointers and allocating more space if necessary

1270294
width	height
but when i set width and height on the canvas my image disappears

1270351
textmate	bbedit
for example textmate stores the selection for a document this way much as bbedit mpw and others used to store tab settings window size etc

1270381
postgresql	mysql
you can always look at something like spec for example that shows both postgresql and mysql at least

1270387
strcpy	strncpy
there was a question recently on so why on earth would anyone use strncpy instead of strcpy

1270393
postgresql	mysql
postgresql supports some more security features than mysql for example integration with gssapi or kerberos for logins last i checked mysql didn t have these

1270393
postgresql	mysql
traditionally postgresql has had fewer security issues than mysql but they are both doing very well on that

1270393
perl	tcl
both have stored procedures these days but postgresql has much more flexible so far for example support for stored procedures in perl python tcl r etc

1270403
floating-point	integer
in the book they use an example of mixing an integer and a floating-point number 40 + 3.14 and proceed to explain that the result of this expression would be a floating-point number because python converts operands up to the type of the most complicated operand

1270500
firefox	safari
per this post here on so firefox 3.5 safari 4 and ie8 support html5 storage

1270502
boost	stl
by using the stl container classes and the various boost smart_ptrs there s little need to ever explicitly call new or delete in your c++ code

1270505
post	get
they have freed my mind a bit and so in response to my own question i would like to propose an alternative set of restful url conventions which actually embrace the two methods get and post of the non-ajax world instead of trying to work around them

1270505
post	get
but if javascript is disabled clicking the link will instead send a get request which returns a delete confirmation form from the server and that form sends the post to perform the delete

1270538
hide	show
in jquery you could move to the correct layer and hide or show it relatively easily

1270553
vb6	vba
so i ve learned that i need to user interface to make it work and i need to regasm the dll to create a type library file which i can reference directly from the vba vb6 app

1270570
multiplying	division
as joshua haberman mentioned your compiler will probably already convert the division by a constant 1000000 to a multiplying by a magic number followed by a shift if the division is an integer operation

1270594
min	max
the two main problems of using datetime are the min and max constants

1270594
min	max
what will your min and max constants be for this object

1270626
jlist	jtree
i have designed two components i.e calculator and engine source codes below which need to be inside any of the swing components either jlist jtree or any

1270628
rss	feed
by using different xslt files i can use the same xml source to create multiple polyglot x html files presenting the same data in different ways a rss feed an atom feed a rdf descriptor file and fragment of a site map

1270665
maven	pom.xml
i write short xslt transformations to do mass edits on our maven pom.xml files

1270707
xslt	xquery
i ve used xslt and also xquery extensively for various things - to generate c++ code as part of build process to produce documentation from doc comments and within an application that had to work with xml in general and xhtml in particular a lot

1270761
put	get
headers get applied afterwards and then the message gets put directly into the requestcontext s requestmessage property

1270814
width	height
ensure you have installed above gems and make changes to the width and height in the has_attachment then you could see the changes

1270901
width	margin
reduce the width of one div you should have width set on your floats until their combine width including padding margin borders fits in available space

1270917
submit	submission
the last action was the loading of the success page not the form submission which means if users do an f5 it will just reload that page and not submit the form again

1270934
google-chrome	safari
i have sifr v3 revision 419 running fabulously on ie7 ff3 and safari but in google-chrome and ff2 the text renders really tiny

1270960
filesystems	fat
windows fat does not so you will have to come up with another way to handle garbage collecting your session if you are stuck with a fat filesystems or any other filesystems where atime tracking is not available

1270979
width	height
your canvas should have a width and a height and you can use the autoscale maintainaspectratio properties to make the image behave

1270981
sqlconnection	sqltransaction
right now the traditional sqlconnection sqlcommand approach is used and to make sure everything works the two steps delete old entries then insert new ones are wrapped into an ado.net sqltransaction

1271020
getter	setter
you should create yourself setter and getter for the properties you want to modify and a refresh is required afterwards

1271023
plot	heatmap
i m creating heatmap sub plot that differ in aspect ratio according to the data used

1271024
min	max
my numbers table contains a max of 288 since thats the total number of 5 min slots you can have in a 24 hour period

1271069
post	get
i m going to tweak it a bit more to see if i can get it 100 consistent before i post it

1271094
solaris	procfs
while you ask for a c solution maybe you could look into the perl module solaris procfs to see what it does to extract information

1271136
int	double
is for int or long not float or double

1271193
pull	push
my personal feeling is that microsoft have invented the notion that the xmlreader is better with the explanation of the push pull model but i don t really buy it

1271229
post	get
i have been tweaking my code to fit these patterns but i got no results oscillating between not working and not working and i get an extra record so i decided to post my original code

1271254
put	get
after a while i tend to get a lot of small static classes usually with only one method which i usualy put in a utility namespace that gets bloated with classes

1271259
gzipinputstream	bytearrayinputstream
put the data into a bytearrayinputstream then you should be able to decode it with gzipinputstream

1271260
folder	directory
but when its installed as a virtual directory it breaks because it is looking for files in root folder and not in virtualdirectorypath folder

1271268
ant	maven
any copying of modules to a deployment installer-input directory must be done outside the context of maven s core functionality with the ant maven copy command

1271345
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
the same scenario works just fine on firefox opera and google-chrome

1271354
wav	caf
i have a directory with about 50 wav files that i need to convert to caf because audioservicescreatesystemsoundid returns an error for some of them but not all

1271367
for-loop	loops
is there any way that i could rework my code so that i have just one for-loop for the 7 iterations or will i need one for-loop that will run once and another loops below it that will run 6 times before returning the completely sorted list

1271402
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
it should therefore be possible to do what you want by implementing the viewwillappear or viewdidappear methods in your controller

1271402
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
your viewcontroller will get the viewwillappear viewdidappear messages in that case - by maintaining state and receiving those messages you can then implement logic to decide whether or not you need to play the movie

1271456
inline	inlining
to summarize there are few scenarios where you should attempt to take manual control of inlining by placing or omitting inline statements

1271472
portrait	landscape
in my app when the phone rotates i want to change the view like the calculator app does when it is in portrait it shows the normal calc and when it is in landscape it shows the scientific calc

1271472
portrait	landscape
for example in one of my uiviewcontrollers for portrait mode i will have a grid with images and when it is in landscape i want it to show an image and to be able to swap them like in the photos app

1271516
opera	google-chrome
if i remember correctly in google-chrome and opera simply calling

1271559
children	parent
the number of paths should be o n log n but the algorithm could be much worse depending on what representation they use for children of a parent

1271575
apache	nginx
nginx uses less memory than apache given the size of your setup i would definitely recommend that

1271575
apache	nginx
an added bonus is that nginx serves static and cached content even faster than apache

1271592
width	height
window size width 160 height 78

1271592
width	height
buffer size width 160 height 78

google-chrome	firefox
it looks different in all 3 browsers that i use google-chrome ie and firefox

1271643
union	distinct
but i want to know the difference between the methods of distinct union group by keyword method for this purpose

1271646
geocoding	geocode
you can try a very ugly hack which consists in geocoding your full adresse and all subsets of the words your adress contains you get a lot of geocode that you use to get the adresses related to them with reverse geocoding tool

1271700
hard-drive	hdd
since in-memory ops are mostly trivial anyways given a hard-drive based database an update can change a database field in-place on the hdd while a delete would remove a row leaving an empty space and insert a new row perhaps to the end of the table again it s all in the implementation

1271702
hide	show
the basic idea is that you show the container element when you hover over the trigger then when you leave the container you hide the container

1271746
mouseover	mouseout
why have mouseover mouseout on the

1271806
versioning	upgrade
otherwise i d have to stay with the current versioning or be very careful with any upgrade since i couldn t be sure what it would break

1271817
draggable	droppable

1273141
folder	directory
you can programmatically check to see if an update has just been downloaded using applicationdeployment.currentdeployment.isfirstrun and then write your own migration code to move the appropriate folder from .pre into the parent directory

1273141
folder	directory
a different answer and the one we ve used is to bypass the clickonce datadirectory completely and set your own folder up in the user s application data directory remembering to use the .net alias for that folder

1273141

1273919
udp	tcp
and my conclusion is pretty similar to yours the only currently available methods are using the net ftp net ssh net scp being the easiest solution and the standard tcp udp protocol

1273919
udp	tcp
the problem with the latter tcp udp is that you have to write custom code to slice and dice the binary file and package it in such a way you can send it as a packet and on the receiving end you have to authorize it validate it and unpack the damn packet

1274784
width	height
are you specifying both height and width in your image tags

1274786
width	height
thus an image with a width of 100px and a height of 100px will appear as 60x100 in your thumb class which could give the illusion of vertical stretching

1274786
width	height
you need to either write code which evaluates the resolution width and height and resizes both directions appropriately or if all your images are a fixed size specify both width and height

1274843

1275587
portrait	landscape
like if one view autorotates to landscape you select a different tab in the tab bar and the view associated with that tab comes up and its all messed because it never got autorotated it got initialized with the frame that makes it fit in portrait mode even though the autoresizingmasks are set to have it look fine in landscape it never got rotated

1275589
pop-up	dialog
but if my background thread that periodically ran it was an events scheduler similar to the event reminder dialog in outlook accessed the web service and tried to pop-up the form and the user hadn t yet show n it then the worker thread s touching invokerequired would cause the heartburn-inducing behavior described above

1278328

you could try using malloc and free from msvcrt.dll instead maybe they ll free the memory

1279909
postgresql	mysql
for fulltext search compare sql server vs lucene.net vs clucene vs mysql vs postgresql

1279915
width	height
conceivably you could wrap the cell contents in a and use that to enforce a particular height width

int	double
f is a function that takes a single int parameter and returns a pointer to a function that takes a double parameter and returns int

1279962
getter	setter
the data capsule is a simple class with lots of getter and setter properties it uses a di framework and consistently use the ioc container to provide instances of the data capsule lucky me

1279962
getter	setter
would using an interface prevents jit from inlining the calls to getter setter

1279992
firefox	safari
it seems that firefox and safari ignore this while ie does not allow scripts to overwrite this

1280047
bash	tcsh	tcsh	dash
update this works in bash 4.0 as well as tcsh and dash if you change source to

1280067
octal	decimal
the thing is that 027447002 in terms of numbers is octal base-8 - not a zero-filled decimal base-10 integer

1280141
accessor	properties	put	get
if i put a breakpoint on the line of code under test vs tells me the properties or indexer presenter.iqueryform.queryresults cannot be used in this context because it lacks the get accessor

1280181
octal	binary
the real question is why haven t more languages adopted octal and binary notations in a more regular fashion

1280186
octal	binary
in c# there are no binary or octal literals perhaps the reasoning is that you shouldn t do as much bit fiddling that the language needs it.

1280203
hide	show
and finally one more option show hide different panels on the page

1280232
slider	jcarousel
i am using the plugin jcarousel and rather than the images slider in like in the carousel with autoscrolling demo

1280239
set	bag
use set instead of bag

1280256
floor	sqrt
that obviously would take n comparisons...you can just go up to floor sqrt n

1280256
floor	sqrt
and we re done because 4 is floor sqrt n

1280315
button	checkbox
some form controls automatically have labels associated with them press button while most do not text fields checkbox and radio button and menus

1280342
getter	setter
the actual implementation of datagridview isn t under mocks control so it can t intercept the getter and setter for selectionmode

1280348
range	infinity
i will say that the integration over infinite range is a problem that i addressed and upon execution of the code it states the round off error at infinity which numerically just means large

1280362
int	chars	unsigned	short
1 an rvalue of type chars signed chars unsigned chars short int or unsigned short int can be converted to an rvalue of type int if int can represent all the values of the source type

1280368
post	put	webkit	gecko
i found that webkit would crop everything if i put overflow hidden on the element but gecko wouldn t see my blog post for code and screenshots

1280378
children	parent
is it ok to have id names for children of an element the same as the ids of children of another element provided the parent id is different

1280387
hide	show
i m looking for some non-javascript techniques by which to reload a page of tree items basically divs within divs while remembering their show hide status

1280387
hide	show
basically my goal is to be able to show hide the tree whether js is enabled or not

1280418
g++	gcc
i want my code to compile with the intel compiler s or with gcc g++ depending on a configure argument

1280464
next	except
almost the same in python 2.5 except you have to use g.next instead of next g in the append

1280470
ant	maven
i have the ant script call maven to set up the local repo and then call svn to commit it to google code

1280488
boost	blitz++	blitz++	ublas
you could try blitz++ -- or boost s ublas

1280492
superclass	subclassing
let s say we have a superclass called super and a subclassing called sub

1280492
super	extends
now you would probably expect since sub extends super that sub would now inherit all of super s methods however it seems to only receive references to the sub s methods

1280492
inherited	subclassing
so my question is can i ever extend a static class call one of the inherited methods and have the subclassing s scope

1280525
google-chrome	firefox
i just tested this out in firefox 3.5 ie7 ie8 google-chrome 3

1280556
nstimer	nsrunloop
nstimer created by this call is owned by current nsrunloop object so it is not going to be autoreleased by any autorelease pool drain

1280583
ready	each
each developer gets their own branch that they can do with as the please then when they are ready to share their changes with the other developers they just merge their changes back into the main branch

1280590
bazaar	git
any dvcs such as bazaar mercurial darcs or git supports private branches

1280628
inherited	subclassing
the code uses inherited to do its thing you have to use that subclassing to store your values

1280631
stdout	stderr
his favorite trick was to have shell scripts calling shell scripts calling shell scripts and explicitly redirecting stdout and stderr to dev null sometimes 2 and 3 layers deep

1280670
google-chrome	firefox
the following code works fine in firefox google-chrome etc but not ie anyone know why

1280672
width	margin	puts	gets
the wrapfig package takes an entire column away so text below the images gets wrapped to a fixed width even without the image there and pushes the description environment past the left margin and the floatflt package puts the image exactly where i want it but no text gets wrapped

1280686
trie	tree
a somewhat simpler trie is the burst-trie which essentially gives you an interpolation between a standard tree of some sort like a bst and a trie

1280693
postgresql	mysql
if you are just doing development work look into mamp which has a whole bunch of extensions including pdo for mysql and postgresql built-in

1280705
tax	shipping
id | subtotal | tax | shipping | datecreated

1280717
min	max
2 ttrackbars 1 for min 1 for max

1280717
range	min
2 ttackbars 1 for min 1 for range

1280717
min	max
you can click and drag 3 different points to the min max or both

1280741
spaces	delimiter
it gets a list of changed files filters it to just mergeinfo only changes strips everything but the actual file path converts the one-per-line paths into a spaces delimiter list and the calls revert on that list

1280797
inherited	subclassing
since the subclassing inherited from the double class you still get all the functionality of the double class and the added functionality of your custom mydouble class

1280820
src	attr
this always works for me #foo attr src url

1280862
opera	safari
you might be looking for the elementfrompoint method that exists in msie ff3+ and in some form in safari and opera

1280872
junit	testng
this happens because it keeps track of the current test being executed by the test runner which can be a junit 3.8 a junit 4.5+ or a testng 5.8+ runner

1280872
junit	testng
so when not running in the context of a testing framework junit or testng it lacks the necessary test tracking information

1280872
junit	testng
but what would be the point of running a test suite that is neither written with junit nor with testng or with any other test framework if one existed

1280888
put	get
group the data by question_id such that i can put tags to my questions i have tried to manipulate the data by php but i get only this far

1280903
firefox	safari
safari 4 is perfect firefox 3.5 is great etc

1280967
min	max
it won t move min and max simultaneously but since you ve got the source you could probably add that functionality if you really need it

1280998
subtract	add
you should have done a search - i posted a complete answer to this question over here just the other day for utc at least - to adjust for other timezones just add or subtract the timezone offset in seconds from the unixtime before you call the function

1281087
mouseleave	mouseenter
what you are looking for is mouseenter and mouseleave

1281087
mouseover	mouseenter
a good example can be found at this link they have compared both mouseenter and mouseover

1281094
perl	tcl
tcl might be easier to embed than perl but i do have to agree matthew scharley s reasoning

1281114
i2c	spi
it uses a samsung micro and the development hardware has some generous peripherals including uart spi i2c and usb interfaces

1281143
gif	png
so is this method reliable for gettting the photo s file type like jpg gif png

1281214
content-disposition	content-type
if you re attempting to output binary data look into php s header function and ensure you set the proper content-type and content-disposition

1281233
client-side	server-side
tracking can be done either server-side or client-side

1281236
gridview	sqldatasource
i have a gridview that shows a list of contacts via a sqldatasource

1281236
gridview	sqldatasource
gridview and sqldatasource here

1281239
submit	submission
one common approach to classic form submission is to display the code on say index.php submit it to say save.php and then afterward redirect back to index.php or an alternate page so that theoretically the post will no longer be the most recently displayed page and refreshing the page will not resubmit the form noting of course that not all browsers obey that logic all the time

1281244
bazaar	svn	bazaar	git
if you were managing leading a large or distributed team i d strongly recommend dvcs hg is my choice but git and bazaar are very popular too but as you appear to be working on your own svn s just fine

1281244
vim	emacs
what ide or editor you like -- eclipse vim emacs zend stuff w ever -- is really secondary

1281258
actionscript	mxml
mxml is simply declarative actionscript so there is no difference between creating your instance in actionscript or using the mxml notation

1281299
superclass	subclassing
when you create a new subclassing a new type of structure is defined with all the superclass s ivars followed by the new class s ivars

1281299
nsobject	ivar
in the case of nsobject and indeed object the base class structure only contains one ivar - a pointer called isa to the class structure representing this object s class

1281368
vsto	add-in
the code is similar to the first sample except that the current excel.application instance is available to the add-in via globals.thisaddin.application vsto generated and i can see that it is really a microsoft.office.interop.excel.application instance because i can use things like app.activecell.value2 test this actually puts the text into the active cell

1281368
vsto	add-in
my question is how can i pass an instance of microsoft.office.interop.excel.application from a vsto generated excel 2007 add-in to a hosted powershell instance so i can manipulate it from powershell

1281369
children	parent
the cardinality one-to-many defines just this a parent has many children but a child has only exactly one parent

1281372
maven	pom.xml
it s worth following the maven conventions in your pom.xml regardless of your build method

1281372
maven	pom.xml
as the point of putting your jar in a maven repository is to make it accessible to maven users you will therefore need to define a pom.xml for your published artifact

1281372
maven	pom.xml
for example adding the scm details to the pom.xml will amongst other things allow your users to import the project into their workspace using the ide integrations for maven

1281372
maven	pom.xml	ant	maven	ant	pom.xml
set up a maven repository do your builds with ant and use maven to deploy the jar and pom.xml

1281372
ant	maven
set up a maven repository ad use an ant http task to publish the artifacts

1281372
maven	pom.xml
note that the maven deploy goal will automatically translate the pom.xml to project-name - version .pom

1281372
ant	maven
if you want to use ant to deploy to a maven repository you can use an ant http library note i ve not tried this myself

1281372
ant	maven
if you want to avoid maven completely and use ant to deploy to an svn-backed repository you can use the svnant subversion library

1281390
filtering	grouping
when you want to sort by any date you need to add a date filtering located in the date grouping

1281397
rss	feed
trying to write a python application that downloads images from an rss feed and makes a composite background

1281399
nfa	dfa
one of the other major differences between dfa s and nfa s is that badly-written nfa s are prone to serious even catastrophic performance problems and sloppy alternations are one of the easiest ways to trigger them

1281422
getter	setter
from what i can tell django follows the gorm model more than it does the ar model so that model might be something worth looking into especially given that java probably wouldn t lend itself to dynamic getter and setter as ruby does unless you starting delving into generating bytecode on the fly but your compiler and ide wouldn t like that very much

1281428
exponent	modulo
the integers are the modulo and the public exponent

1281430
post	get
if somebody has it working and can help me get it working that s great and i ll post code errors

1281460
post	get
using both get and post requests this cached as expected

1281460
post	get
if you re running osx use this awesome tool to create get and post requests

1281485
pop-up	dialog
edit i ve just compiled and tested this and it works pop-up some dialog with folder appearance settings

1281490
getter	setter
cheat and bind to a string property in my viewmodel whose setter getter does the conversion loading values into the combobox using code-behind in the view

1281510
ubuntu	linux
could you please give me a assembly code in linux ubuntu 9.04 to print floating point number

1281511
rss	feed
first work out what you want to show and where this information comes from could be a bunch of reg keys in the case of an mru list and an rss feed for news headlines

1281549
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
example objectinputstream and objectoutputstream keep references to all objects they have seen in order to send subsequent occurences of the same object as references rather than copies and thereby deal with circular references

1281552
svg	vml
not quite charting but lightweight svg vml cross-browser graphic library raphaeljs.com

1281568
solaris	bsd
sure it s easier but won t work on mac linux bsd solaris and probably nor very later windows version

1281572
hash	salt
alternatively use cryptographic hash sums that include a salt and the client s ip address to ensure data has not been tampered with

1281618
gif	png
is it possible to include an external image gif jpg or png into a gd generated image

1281618
post	get
what i m trying to do is get the latest wordpress blog post like 5 and generate an image from it

1281651
tostring	string.format
i run this separately for each approach the + operator string.format and stringbuilder calling tostring so the memory used will not be affected by other approaches

1281659
width	height
with that you can also grab the width and height

1281683
jobs	cron
now i am working on my own project and would like to find good practices for web development when using shared web hosting and not working from a unix based environment with all the magic i could do with perl bash scripting cron jobs etc

1281714
actionscript	mxml
besides xml configuration spring actionscript also supports mxml configuration

1281770
treeview	tabcontrol
currently i populate the treeview or tabcontrol manually iterating through the xml adding the nodes to the appropriate leaf

1281870
folder	directory
in the latter case your deployment script would simply move the bits to a staging web folder accessible via beta.mysite.com and then another deployment script could move that to the live web directory

1281894
perl	tcl
nearly all of the scripting languages perl python lua php ruby tcl are intended to be embedded into c and c++

1281974
firefox	safari
i would not doubt that this could be something wrong with firefox but if safari does it too it is likely your code

1281998
children	parent
you need to set the parent property of each child instead of adding children to the parent

1282043
slider	jcarousel	fadein	fadeout
the slidein effect used by jcarousel isn t what the guy wants he wanst it to fadein fadeout the slider with each slider shown for 7 seconds

1282043
fadein	fadeout
i have tried to ask if anyone has created a fadein fadeout effect for jcarousel but the question hasn t had any response so now i am willing to change the plugin for one that does this specific task

1282053
firefox	safari
i am seeing consistent rendering in firefox 3.0 firefox 3.5 and safari 4.0 all on windows

1282163
ant	maven
i realize you are using maven but in ant you would

1282169
inherited	subclassing
you shouldn t need to subclassing the uisegmentedcontrol - remember composition over inherited is preferred

1282202
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
i have tried current version of opera google-chrome and firefox and i have not encountered such problems

1282231
svg	vml
depending on what do you want svg vml raphael for cross browser could be taken in consideration

1282265
wordpress	joomla
if you re using a piece of software like drupal joomla or wordpress you ll want to ask around within the community as there s probably modules available for them that allow you to get this information without needing to manually integrate anything

1282373
width	height
as you can see flash swf are considered images and actually getimagesize is able to read the width and height of a swf object

1282403
chaiscript	c++
i like to use languages that are specifically made to be embedded in c++ or c like lua falcon or chaiscript

1282403
chaiscript	c++
chaiscript looks like a simplified c++ so it might not be the best choice for people not used to such syntax but otherwise it s easily bound to your real c++ code

1282420
coalesce	isnull
i only have to change isnull to coalesce

1282452
hide	show
i am able to animate my text field and able to make it larger however to show the sliding animation i first have to hide it

1282473
128bit	64bit
because your data access here is aligned for a 64bit value 8 it must be trying to execute an instruction that fetches a 128bit value such as compare and exchange instruction cmpxchg16b

1282476
mockups	balsamiq
another option i stumbled on recently which looks really keen is balsamiq mockups

1282493
post	put	post	get	put	get
remember rest only really has 4 verbs get post update put and delete

1282502
client-side	server-side
i have always thought of javascript as a client-side scripting tool for augmenting the functionality of html which in turn is usually generated by some other server-side technology - java .net rails django php etc

1282548
button	checkbox
basically on hover over any radio button or checkbox i load the additional info for that item into an informational div

1282549
udp	tcp
one more thing that needs to be considered it that the multicast will be all udp and the unicast can be either tcp or udp

1282593
put	get
i m looking for what i would get if i put the document through a black-and-white scanner

1282635
button	checkbox
field1 can be literally anything a checkbox a radio button a select a text area a text box or anything else

1282682
width	height
how come you cannot use an img tag inside the table which you dynamically alter its source to the new image and set the height and width to whatever

1282682
width	height
or if your problem is with the user dragging the images you could simply use a div rather than an image set its height and width and place it over the images

1282687
cvs	svn
svn has a lot of cvs baggage in its terms eg the word tag

1282725
sse	avx
new avx instructions that extend two-byte sse instructions will either have a 2-byte or 3-byte prefix

1282736
post	get
when the server uses bcprov-jdk14-143 and the client uses bcprov-jdk14-124 the post succeeds but when the client is upgraded to 143 i get this error

1282757
google-chrome	safari
notably google-chrome and safari performed much faster for the javascript test but i don t include those here because those tests were recorded in a different environment

1282769
hex	binary
if i break out this hex to binary -- in particular the last double word i get the following

1282772
for-loop	loops
that is a for-loop is a special kind of while loops

1282772
for-loop	loops
personally i don t see how converting the while loops you give to a for-loop will reduce errors

1282781
free	malloc
you are always supposed to pass free a pointer obtained from malloc or one of its relatives

1282785
junit	jmockit
i am currently working in incremental testing for junit 4 which is part of the jmockit coverage tool in the jmockit developer testing toolkit

1282846
vbscript	jscript
ecmascript is used in many browsers as javascript it s used in flash as actionscript and microsoft have their own implementation called jscript which is used instead of javascript in internet explorer and as a server side language in asp an alternative to the more common vbscript

1282860
mouse	keyboard
i m looking for or trying to write a testing suite in python which will control the mouse keyboard and watch the screen for changes

1282860
mouse	keyboard
the obvious parts i need are 1 screen watcher 2 keyboard mouse control

1282867
memset	malloc
allocated 20mb with malloc and memset with 0x55 and stopped thread of my application

1282895
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
youâ re using inherited give priority to creating a sensible superclass subclassing

1282909
submit	submission
this issue is happening regardless of whether a form is submission via ajax or a regular form submit

1282928
gif	png
i have a watermark script i am working on the results are good on png and on jpg images however a gif image not so good

1282941
client-side	server-side
finally since the server-side code will look about the same regardless of which client-side submission method you use submitting via ajax is more effort which is not always justified

1282941
submit	submission
however even forms that have the option to submit via ajax should also support traditional submission

1282960
width	height
-s wxh should specify width height

1282961
terminate	timeout
watchdog timeout distinguished by exception code 0x8badf00d timeout occur when an application takes too long to launch or terminate

1282979
aggregate-functions	sum	min	max
aggregate-functions sum min max count etc

1282996
vb.net	vb6
this property is exposed in vb.net but not vb6

1283066
pexpect	subprocess
i suggest you consider instead using pexpect or on windows wexpect to defeat such buffering and get smooth regular output from the subprocess

1283072
mouseover	mouseout
so your best best in this situation would be to apply a concrete class let s say .hover via a function bound to the mouseover and mouseout events of the desired target elements

1283156
portrait	landscape
i wrestled with portrait landscape for hours but determined that if you attach the view controller to the top level view which contains my landscape transform then it slides in as a landscape window

1283159
titlebar	window
in wpf the titlebar is part of the non-client area which can t be modified through the wpf window class

1283195
daemons	systemd
configuration of the server both apache php mysql other possible daemons and systemd

1283195
rss	feed
for instance if you have some rss feed we generally tend to forget those when trying to optimize for performances that are requested very often having them in cache for a couple of minutes could save hundreds thousands of request to apache+php+mysql

1283195
xdebug	xhprof
thanks mikushi for the comment another possibility that i haven t used much is the the xhprof extension it also helps with profiling can generate callgraphs -- but is lighter than xdebug which mean you should be able to install it on a production server

1283205
google-chrome	firefox
ok i must admit barely know anything about using the canvas i just started learning it and my example below is probably done completely wrong but it works with firefox google-chrome not ie

1283258
folder	directory
pathmakesystemfolder is the documented way to mark a directory as a system folder

1283272
int	boolean
i dont want to have to parse those boolean to int every time etc

all i get when i put this in is error code 500 mod_rewrite is enabled but this doesn t work

1283349
width	height
i have a javafx applet with the stage s initial height and width defined as such

1283349
width	height
additionally i have elements laid out in the scene that are bound to the height and width for layout purposes

1283349
width	height
however when i embed it into an html page as an applet using the following code the applet is sized right but the width and height properties of my scene are set to zero even though there s plenty of space

1283349
width	height
how can i inside the fx code get the actual height and width of the applet

1283409
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
use strutils.ansistartsstr for case-sensitive strutils.ansistartstext for case-insensitive

1283422
accessor	ivar
in the meantime using the accessor directly is the only way to do it without providing an explicit ivar

1283424
onfocus	onblur
are you looking to do some onfocus or onblur

1283446
ati	nvidia
even if you know what the error messages look like now nvidia and ati are under no obligation to keep them the same in the next version s of their drivers

1283456
domcontentloaded	onreadystatechange
for mozilla opera and webkit jquery binds the domcontentloaded event for ie jquery uses the onreadystatechange event

i m afraid i don t want to waste lots of cds testing it out so i haven t run it but by you re comment it looks like it s not outputing the info to stdout but to stderr

1284215
stdout	stderr
i suggest running a sample command directly on the command-line and redirecting stdout and stderr to different files

1284215
stdout	stderr
then you can work out which things come out on stdout and which on stderr

1284220

children	parent
lets call them parent and children

1284463
children	parent
the parent table has many records in the children table

1284463
children	parent
my approach is to select all records from parent then loop through each one selecting the data from children

children	parent
the data needs to be displayed like the name of the parent record then a list of children records

1284464
post	get
i want to use ajax to post the form and i want it to get all fields even if they are disabled

1284480

1284491
children	parent
any ways if you want to know what sql to use checkout select parent record with all children in sql

1284493
children	parent
as has been pointed out in the comments if you use the inner join of course you ll only get back parent and their child records - parent without children will be left out

post	get
i was thinking of maybe adding a new column on the forum_categories table and updating it each time a post is made however that could get messy

1285239
post	get
the only hit you get when you delete a post then you need to update cache for the question and the forum

1285254

you will need to build some other jscript functions to assist converting the object into something more easily consumed in vbscript

1285486
post	get
a post or even a get request by the client implies that the client expects a response back from the server

1285486
post	get
however your post handling action method will not return a concrete answer but will return a redirectresult to the get handling action method thus the client will request that and wait for its response in turn the get handling action method will contruct the view and return it

1285493
post	get

1285960

to grab a property i just do path- propertyname but i ve noticed its more practical to have setter getter

entity-relationship	entities
so at the risk of certain flames...i personally am not a huge fan of the entity framework i can see where it would be pretty good to take a legacy system and entity-relationship model and map it but i think in the longer term and my use case is more built around a domain model design and for my entities to be mapped to that

however for the code to work as intended i think line and therefore tempstr must be already null terminated strlen line will count to the first null terminator so for the code to work as expected it must also be utterly redundant as strcpy will have copied the null terminator when it copied line in the first place

1291741
apache	nginx
i ended up running nginx with passenger and ruby 1.9 on port 80 and then proxying off my other virtual hosts to apache 2.2 on port 8080 with passenger and ruby 1.8

1291743
getter	setter
i left only methods signatures for java example and skipped getter setter

1291747
trie	dawg
it sounds to me like you want to store you dictionary in a trie or a dawg data structure

1291757
mouseover	mouseout
the live event does support mouseover and mouseout - if you were to use those events instead of hover you d be able to wire them outside of the click event

1291777
punctuation	words
then you d consider any words with two or more punctuation consecutively

1291778
metaphone	soundex
sounds like based on soundex or metaphone is not uncommon option for proprietary full text search in databases oracle ms sql server or open source search engines such as lucene

1291812
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
edit also firefox 3.5 opera google-chrome etc seem to be adopting the html5 postmessage api which allows secure cross-domain data transmission between frames iframes and popups

1291854
int	chars
length positive int number of chars in input

1291954
hash	md5
you could md5 the resulting mysqldump on the server and the transfered locally by rsync then compare the two hash to ensure they match

1292009
accessor	ivar
in objective c if the using the getter and directly accessing the ivar do exactly the same thing no lazy loading code in the getter all it does is returns the ivar would you still use the accessor or access the ivar directly since there is no difference

1292032
firefox	safari
it refreshes safari and firefox but as i said it only works the mac

1292033
public	protected
first of all the default visibility for ivars in objc is protected so unless you explicitly make them public you have to use an accessor

1292033
subclass	accessor
aside from this you use the accessor because you never know if you or someone else might subclass your class and change it enough that using the accessor is necessary

1292033
accessor	properties
if you re talking about within the class you don t have to use the accessor but if you set up properties values there s no reason not to use the dot notation even if you re synthesizing everything

1292033
getter	setter
using both getter outside the class and setter is good practice

1292083
width	height
your best bet would be to catch your window s onsize event get the size that the user wants the window to be which is stored in the wxsizeevent calculate the new width and height according to the aspect ratio and then immediately call setsize with the new size

1292102
unix	aix
nick meyer s answer is correct on windows and aix but is unlikely to be correct on every other unix platform by default

1292104
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
it works fine with any modern browser firefox google-chrome safari ie7 + 8 but is falling over on 6

1292109
put	get
and don t use a wildcard when you both want to get and put from to a structure

1292116
min	max
you are missing some characters the beginning of the tags and you will need a comma to separate the min and max options

1292176
draggable	droppable
i have a jquery ui draggable and several separately-defined droppable

1292176
draggable	droppable
because one of the droppable is configured tolerance intersect it s possible for a draggable to be dropped on more than one kind of droppable at the same time

1292176
draggable	droppable
none of the droppable overlap but the draggable is large enough to overlap a droppable with tolerance intersect while the mouse pointer is over another droppable with tolerance pointer

1292209
draggable	droppable
are you going to calculate percentages of the draggable on each intersecting droppable

1292219
folder	directory
i have all my web application contents inside a directory ui page of web folder

1292258
google-chrome	firefox
i have a page that renders differently in google-chrome when compared to firefox

1292298
rss	feed
ok here is my rss feed link

1292329
implements	extends
1 you are right you cannot extends this but here are two alternatives one is to avoid the need for extends this at all and making use of what is provided such as using viewdata and the other is to implements your own

1292346
button	checkbox
i have a button while clicking the button i just produce a div containing some checkbox

1292359
pop-up	dialog
if you are using asp.net you can check out the ajax control toolkit which has a modal pop-up dialog

1292359
pop-up	dialog
jquery pop-up dialog

1292380
profiling	debugging
the difference is in the profiling you are using for code-sign where for debugging build you re using your developer profiling and for the distribution build ad-hoc or appstore you need to create ad-hoc or appstore profiling respectively

1292393
rss	feed
try an rss parser which also caches the feed to save everyone time and money

1292432
draggable	droppable
maybe in the over event of the less preferred droppable you could check if the draggable is also over the preferred droppable and if it is disable the less preferred droppable

1292510
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
if you wanted a finer grain control over the process you can use the writeobject readobject methods that the objectoutputstream objectinputstream use as part of the serialization process and you could combine that with some custom annotations or any logic you wanted

1292511
int	double
i ve kind of solved this problem by changing the sorting to sort double instead of int

1292511
int	double
my problem is that i want to sort the double values by int using the function stable_sort

1292574
fink	macports
can anyone recommend a good fortran debugger for the mac other than installing gdb etc via fink or macports

1292604
int	chars	short	base
if your base types and not int types chars int short long long long types will not be promoted so assignment will fail

1292688
hide	show
however from a software design view i ve always tended to have each layer have their own collection of members when doing editors - it makes operations on the layers better encapsulated show layer hide layer select only from one layer move layer to top etc

1292729
rss	feed
i want to integrate an rss feed in my .net based site

1292729
rss	feed
also are there any javascript libraries for the same rss feed reader

1292744
gif	png
anybody knows of a good java library for retrieving mime type and dimension of a jpeg gif and png image file in java

1292755
min	max
i need the select statement to return the min and max sizes from the table of sizes

1292755
min	max
however as the actual size is stored as a string i need to run the min and max functions against the sizeorder column but return the value of the sizename column

1292759
inherited	properties
maybe its doing the properties inherited thing and using the binding mode of the ui control underneathe it

1292767
tax	shipping
you can collect personal company payment details then shipping payment addresses and then present the user with a final confirmation screen showing tax delivery charges before processing the order

1292769
rss	feed
i answered a similar question some time back net has a class to parse atom and rss feed

1292802
width	height
during a re-layout due to a change in width or height java s scrollpanelayout requests the preferredsize of it s children before setting the bounds of it s viewport

1292807
post	get
get and post that usually involves the

1292860
width	height
if i trace i see the width and height is 200 x 200 but there is still nothing visible in my component

1292876
post	get
in fact what you need to do is post some data to a webserver and get a response

1292883
int	double
the simd primitives can pack eight 8-bit int operations or two double or 4 floats etc into a single operation that gets parallelized in hardware

1292896
switching	screens
sending cameraarguments when invoking the app which appears to be useless and now i was thinking a solution could be as simple generating a back key event before switching back to my app which would theoretically dismiss the annoying edit screens

1292954
updatepanel	scriptmanager
we use the asp.net updatepanel and the scriptmanager scriptmanagerproxy for ajax related functionality

1292961
int	chars
for chars stats in a database driven game i would generally advise to stick with the naã ve approach of one column int or float per statistic

1292988
public	protected
also consider to add visibility to your methods and members public protected private

1293040
slideup	slidedown
for example lets assume i want to slideup element with id id1 on view1 and slidedown element with id id2 on view2

1293055
emacs	textmate
i use ii2 to manage latex software for the back end and i have used both textmate it has a very nice latex bundle and emacs with auctex as front ends

1293055
emacs	aquamacs
you can get a nice baked-in latex experience in emacs by using the aquamacs distribution i can t use it because i have a non-english keyboard with no aquamacs-specific mapping

1293057
hex	binary
i ve just reverse engineered a binary with ida and loaded hex ray to check out a specific function

1293121
submit	submission
we have a comments form where users can submit their comment about news articles and after that submission every comment is accepted and listed in the same page

1293130
mouse	keyboard
if you really want an element that isn t a link but which can be activated as normal by mouse or keyboard what you want is a or is just as good for simple textual contents

1293131
post	get
i would also make the action a hidden post form submitted by javascript since this is not really something you want driven by a get

1293158
width	height
i can t use the css sheet for this as the width and height variables are dynamic

1293183
width	height
you can change the size of a thickbox window by adding width and height parameters in href attribute of a element

1293188
serializable	deserialization
so currently my question is around how serializable and deserialization works in spring remoting

1293188
serializable	deserialization
currently all consumers use the respective stubs and serializable and deserialization happens accordingly

1293193
superclass	subclassing
subclassing that have constructor parameter lists that differ significantly from their superclass is another example of a class doing too much

1293193
superclass	subclassing
if a subclassing truly is-a superclass then it shouldn t require significantly more data to do its job

1293195
getter	setter
for a typical hierarchy like you will have getter and setter to retrieve and change the various properties of the object

1293199
yslow	pagespeed
1 install yslow and pagespeed extensions for firefox and follow their advice where possible

1293200
inherited	properties
in addition to the other answers marker interfaces can also be used to specify additional properties of a class that is not inherited by some other already-implemented interface

1293211
inherited	properties
however if you find that you absolutely need this and a long inherited chain consider using a hash properties bag like object as the sole parameter

1293227
firefox	safari
firefox 2 firefox 3.5 safari 3 and

1293234
firefox	safari
in case it is any solace to you the url you posted here works nicely in firefox but it does not work in safari 4 safari 4 only shows the image at the end not the countdown

1293257
pull	push
but there is also part of the git distribution a git-shell command a non-interactive shell used as a login shell for ssh accounts you want to restrict to git pull push access only

1293257
pull	push
it permits execution only of server-side git commands implementing the pull push functionality

1293266
min	max
- maybe i should only avoid creating new instances in the for-loop to have the min and max points.

1293317
versioning	upgrade
this happened because as soon as a client sees a working copy it upgrade it to its current versioning

1293324
listview	gridview
i don t think there is any point in using a listview if as you say you cannot use gridview or any other view

1293337
easymock	jmock
jmock and easymock both choke on final methods and i don t see a nice way to test the static calls

1293344
mockito	easymock	easymock	powermockito
alternatively you can use powermockito which extends easymock and mockito to allow mocking of final and static methods

1293344
easymock	powermockito
powermockito is a framework that extend other mock libraries such as easymock with more powerful capabilities

1293348
versioning	upgrade
upgrade one of your svn clients so that they are at the same versioning preferable

1293368
disk	ram
is there a way of keeping the index in ram instead of keeping it on the hard disk

1293381
disk	ram
a ram disk could be a solution for this

1293381
disk	ram
mount the ram disk as your index directory and you should be done

1293424
javassist	bcel
alternatively you could use a library like bcel asm or javassist

1293480
disk	ram
is there a way of keeping the index in ram instead of keeping it on the hard disk

1293499
postgresql	mysql
has a significant algorithmic performance benefit in postgresql or mysql implementations when scanning the indexed column s or whether the unique keyword simply introduces a unique constraint alongside the index

1293513
innodb	myisam
an index always contains some kind of a pointer to the row ctid in postgresql row pointer in myisam primary key uniquifier in innodb and the leaves are ordered on these pointers so in fact every index leaf is unique is some way though it may not be obvious

1293562
config	ini
basically you are asking for a solution to serialize a given object in your case a config to ini files

1293592
width	height
information like the width and height

1293598
rss	feed
i m not a strong asp classic developer but i am tasked with supporting this application at work well i ve been trying to convert an rss feed date to a short date format

1293598
rss	feed
so far i have been tinkering with this rss feed script for asp

1293628
viewdidload	viewwillappear
i m checking the view outlet at viewdidload and viewwillappear with nslog statements

1293628
viewdidload	viewwillappear
when i select an item from the table view though viewdidload gets called again followed by viewwillappear and i get these

1293640
getter	setter
know that wpf optimizes dependency property access such that the getter and setter of your clr wrapper are not invoked

1293652
children	parent
children are idle the parent will

1293713
rtp	sdp	rtp	sip	sip	sdp
i ve read that this is possible with sdp and rtp and i ve found multiple examples on how to define a sdp rtp body in a sip packet

1293741
hash	md5
if an md5 hash is almost unique for a unique id then what is wrong from md5 ing a uniqid

1293764
hide	show
i also want to show and hide this panel control onmouseover and onmouseout event

1293769
hash	md5
a md5 hash is 128 bits wide and doesn t guarantee uniquess only a low probablity of collision

1293769
hash	md5
the md5 hash is no smaller than the uuid so it doesn t help with storage

1293772
intersect	contains
then just put another image over the top with combinedgeometry contains the same objects as the geometry group with a geometrycombinemode of intersect and that will highlight the intersect in your custom brush

1293775
inherited	properties
an approach i have taken with a number of forms mainly multipage but same applies for single page is for each form page to inherited from a common base class which has a number of properties

1293780
hide	show
you can use the display property to show and hide panel

1293783
prng	random
you could use the linear congruential generator lcg one of the best known pseudo random number generator prng

1293806
width	height
if the ratio of the width to the height is 8 3 its a good chance they have 2 standard 4 3 monitors side by side

1293836
int	double
byte to short int long float or double

1293836
int	double
short to int long float or double

1293836
int	double	int	chars
chars to int long float or double

1293836
int	double
int to long float or double

1293836
int	double
conversion of an int or a long value to float or of a long value to double may result in loss of precision-that is the result may lose some of the least significant bits of the value

1293836
floating-point	integer
in this case the resulting floating-point value will be a correctly rounded version of the integer value

1293860
salt	md5
the advantage of md5 -ing the output along with an application-specific salt string or random number is a way harder to guess string

1293861
width	height
using maxpower47 s suggestion about resolution the only way to display the page on the other monitor would be to open a popup and use the options to set the top right width and height properties so the window will appear on the second monitor in a decent size

1293866
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
the site loads and displays perfectly when viewed with google-chrome firefox and safari but breaks when viewed with ie8 both sidebars disappear and only the main content window is visible

1293867
int	double
the choice could certainly have been made to require all implicit conversions to lose no information at all - so int and long to float would have been explicit and long to double would have been explicit

1293867
int	double
int to double is okay

1293867
int	double
a double has enough precision to accurately represent all int values.

1293888
restrict	shared
assuming your setup allows this of course - on a shared host you may be restrict

1293893
pascal	delphi
but delphi was pascal and he knew nothing about pascal and couldn t be bothered to learn more about it so he chose to develop in powerbuilder for new projects

1293902
int	boolean
that is it s roughly identical to an array of boolean except you pack your boolean into a large int

1293902
int	boolean
for instance if you had 8-bit int you would store 8 bits boolean per int which would further reduce your space requirements

1293911
post	get
essentially phil s sample project covers the get side of things and i ve implemented the post

1293916
jsf	stripes
but if you do decide on using a framework from my experience of having used stripes struts1 and jsf myfaces recommend stripes without hesitation

1293922
jboss	glassfish
i am working with a team of programmers developing web applications for a java ee application server currently using jboss but switching to glassfish in the near future

1293934
int	double
byte - short - int - long - float - double

1293956
post	get
when required to restore all i do is get to a httphandler class with querystring parameters that parses the intended id and deserilizes the state for restoration which renders hidden fields to simulate the user doing a post from the original page

1293984
ironruby	ironpython
in which part of your current project will it make your code cleaner or simpler or enable things you could simply not do outside of the obvious interop with dynamic languages like ironruby or ironpython

1294050
multiplying	multiplication
let s just say the above code is a lot easier to read it s nice that it works but it was also very slow about 10 000 times slower than a regular multiplication doh and about 100 times slower than an icalculator interface with a multiplying method

1294066
versioning	upgrade
the app uses an old versioning of html mime mail to prepare messages i ll try to upgrade to a newer versioning

1294113
box-sizing	border-box
off topic but important when using inline-block on spans it is often very useful to turn on box-sizing -moz-box-sizing border-box

1294143
versioning	upgrade
since then we have upgrade to .net 3.5 and this may not be an issue using the latest versioning of the toolkit

1294146
octal	decimal
would 09 be a decimal number or octal

1294152
getter	setter
when is the point when it s not good to put some code to getter setter and when to create own method that is used to change my property and other parts of my class

1294178
getter	setter
whenever i ve come across the need to put code in a getter setter i put the code in a private method and call that method from within the getter setter

1294208
post	get
now i m trying to get a list of post for a specific user in order of date

1294208
post	get
i know i can get a list of all post for all users by

1294230
idictionary	icollection
i was trying to create a visualizer for idictionary or icollection

1294230
ilist	icollection	idictionary	icollection	idictionary	ilist
i want to use something similar for icollection or ilist idictionary etc

1294260
jar	manifest.mf
is the manifest file meta-inf manifest.mf in the jar file correct

1294272
pygtk	pycairo	pygtk	pygobject	pygobject	pycairo
i have an application which depends on pygtk pygobject and pycairo that i built to work on linux

1294272
pygtk	pygobject
is there any way to install pygtk pygobject in a way that will work with python 2.6 on windows without having to recompile one or the other from source

1294288
getter	setter
getter and setter get internally translated into standard methods such that the runtime has no idea whether some getter or setter is associated with a certain property

1294288
getter	setter
however there is an important software engineering benefit your code tends to be easier to understand if you restrict yourself to use getter and setter with get and set semantics

1294288
getter	setter
your class could provide two properties kilometers and miles with respective setter and getter

1294295
put	get
put it simply methods are actually doing the work...properties either instigate action or get the status

1294323
width	height
also if it s a background-color you may need to set the height and width of the a element to match the parent s

1294356
cdr	cons
and then for lists you re going to need to define cons car and cdr methods for ruby s array type

1294366
children	parent
however i can imagine circumstances where parent controls need to dictate their children behavior

1294397
serializable	deserialization
you can create a dummy class to represent that immutable object during serializable deserialization

1294409
firefox	safari
opacity works for firefox and safari

1294464
inherited	properties
to use this make your controller inherited from ajaxiancontroller and use the isajax properties instead of the isajaxrequest extension method then all redirects on the controller will automatically maintain the ajax-or-not flag

1294472
serializable	deserialization
but it s rather unwieldly in this case because you need to not only go from builder to immutable but also from immutable to builder so that the serializable deserialization is symmetrical

1294486
ssl	https
every now and then and since the last week more often i get questions about https ssl

1294538
mbunit	mstest
i am using gallio to integrate mbunit s test runner with the mstest test runner in visual studio

1294552
try-catch	exception-handling
i expected that i could put a try-catch around the process method and receive the exception-handling

1294562
fadein	fadeout
you can preload the images maybe see here and then call the the fadein and fadeout methods sequentially in a loop

1294658
gif	png
to change it just go to the library right-click on your image choose properties and in the new window just change the compression combo-box to lossless png gif

1294687
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
this is having the intended effect making the field no longer editable but its contents are submitted with the form in firefox safari and google-chrome but not for ie7

1294709
width	height
images are set 100px in width but they vary in height

1294738
depth-first-search	backtracking
usually a depth-first-search is a way of iterating through an actual graph tree structure looking for a value whereas backtracking is iterating through a problem space looking for a solution

1294739
children	parent
in a depth-first search you start at the root of the tree and then explore as far along each branch then you backtrack to each subsequent parent node and traverse it s children

1294774
unsigned	short
a cast to unsigned short would probably prevent that from happening but the best way to be sure is to mask off the bits

1294795
width	height
i am trying to dynamically adjust the width and height of a web part in a sharepoint web part page so that it fills up the entire available space

1294795
width	height
it appears that there is no way to choose a percentage for width and height from the web part property editor window in sharepoint

1294801
versioning	upgrade
when application starts the db upgrade code compares current db versioning and code versioning and if the code is newer - looks into scripts folder and applies all db changes automatically

1294801
versioning	upgrade
this way every instance of application on production or developers machines always upgrade db to their code versioning and it works great

1294810
queue	fifo
for a fifo queue you need two stacks -- to quote the

1294814
children	parent
i have two entities in linq to sql setup as a parent child relationship parent can have many children

1294824
config	ini
each unit doesn t care if the config is stored in a table ini file xml file or even gasp the registry

1294826
queue	fifo
typically a queue is fifo while a stack is obviously last in first out

1294826
queue	fifo
a fifo queue would just be a stack with enqueue being push and dequeue being pop

1294826
queue	fifo
that doesn t make any sense as an exercise so i d definitely assume a fifo queue was intended

1294828
hide	show
the msdn entry to animatewindow says it is used to produce special effects when showing or hiding windows and the aw_hide flag determines that the function either show or hide a window

1294832
allocator	stl
i have implemented a custom allocator to be used by stl containers within my memory debugging utility without them using my overridden new operator

1294905
versioning	upgrade
users that wish to upgrade to the next latest versioning must apply the package which will execute all the database scripts to update the database and replace the assembly that contains your data access layer

1294912
ready	each
by versioning you can prevent each project from using the new dll until you re ready to migrate

1294912
versioning	upgrade
this provides a level of safety - you know you won t break a client s project because somebody else changed something underneath you but it s very easy to upgrade at any time to the new versioning

1294946
button	checkbox
say i wanna put a checkbox inside a button

1294960
ubuntu	linux
i ve used aws and various forms of linux over the past few years but am wondering if anyone has any experience using canonical s aws ubuntu images and can compare them to hammond s

1295001
post	get
if you re using prototype you can get the protohover plugin to achieve the same result or view this blog post

1295001
hide	show
that would accomplish the show hide effect for the following

1295005
post	get
tamper data will show you both post and get methods

1295009
hide	show
position the link as you d like it to appear on hover then hide it with javascript and use the onmouseover event to show it

1295054
awt	swing	swt	swing
i m not aware of a drop in host awt swt in swing component but you should be able to build a work around yourself

1295058
awt	swing
swing and awt run on a separate thread

1295060
pull	push
a push is like a fetch done backwards not like a pull done backwards

1295073
int	chars
to expand on this the difference between var_type_ and type where type is something like chars int binary etc. is that the non-var version will get padded to the full length that you specify if necessary

of course being a relational database i have to delete rows from the children before i can touch the parent

1295127
strcpy	malloc
strcpy does not call malloc

1295168
sorting	filtering

1295193
vsto	add-in
is it possible to do this with office interop or with a vsto add-in

1295216
int	chars
usually the bool type is just a glorified int or chars

1295216
int	chars
in older code that i ve worked with bool is just typedef d to int or chars

1295216
int	boolean
and i m not sure but i think the result of bitwise operators is going to be an int even for boolean

1295226
int	boolean
java has primitive types int boolean float etc and anytime you wish to use them as an instance of an object they are wrapped in an associated class type

1295226
int	boolean
for example boolean get wrapped by boolean int as int etc

1295235
maven	cargo
when i m using maven with the cargo plug-ing to handle hot deployments to tomcat maven fails on the clean task if the .war artifact doesn t currently exist

1295307
int	boolean
and b1 and b2 will be promoted to 0 1 int and then converted back to boolean on the rule that anything other than 0 is true

1295309
content-disposition	content-type
things you will want to be sure to do are to set the content-type response header to text javascript technically incorrect but most common mime type and for internet explorer which tends to not respect the content-type header also set the content-disposition header to inline

1295364
hudson	bamboo
not to mention it seems to get all the integration love when it comes to things like continuous integration cruise control bamboo hudson etc...

but all these acronyms and different libraries geos gdal proj pcl shaply opengeo ogr ogc ows and what not each seemingly depending on any number of others is slightly overwhelming me

1295425
mouse	keyboard
i prefer the command line because i have a shell window open in the source anyway to run builds and tests and along with file name completion using the keyboard is faster than using the mouse for me

1295440

1295630
processors	hyperthreading
in the case of simultaneous multithreaded architectures like ibm power6 ibm cell sun niagara and intel hyperthreading you also tend to see new instructions to prioritize between threads like setting priorities and explicitly yielding the processors when there is nothing to do

1295693
min	max	width	height
the same can be applied for width height min and max with minor adjustments

1295716
accessor	properties
on the other hand will send a message to the properties s set accessor which will take care of retain count

1295719

1295728
width	height
height and width are in pixels

1295748
min	max
some records can be deleted too so the min to max id set will have holes

1295751
int	double
a b int 4 or double 4.5

1295751
division	modulo
given reasonable timespan division timespan modulo should be pretty straight-forward

1295753

1295977
lxml	celementtree
i have no recent experience as to how pyrxp today compares with lxml or celementtree

1296195
content-disposition	content-type
set the content-type property to the mime type and add a custom header content-disposition with a value like

1296201
serializable	deserialization
full cycle serializable deserialization could work reliably only if you are holding both activities in your own hand

1296201
serializable	deserialization
if one company implements serializable sends the rdf over to another company that implements the deserialization you cannot expect too much

1296201
serializable	deserialization
the only justified reason i can think of where guaranteed serializable deserialization could work correct me if i am wrong if you would use rowlex as data storage layer persisting retrieving your objects to from rdf

1296208
vb6	vba
vba vb6 392 chars w formatting

1296214
width	height
first of all the width and height properties of the canvas element do not reflect its actual size on the screen

secondly i can t get the onresize event to fire regardless of whether i put it on the canvas or on the surrounding box

1296259
post	get
the one will be accepting get commands initial load of the page the other will be serving post requests perform the necessary action and redirect back to the same view

1296263
subtraction	addition
as far as i know bitwise operations are the cheapest operations slightly faster than addition and subtraction

1296263
division	multiplication
multiplication and division operations are a little more expensive and comparation is the highest coast operation

1296288
integer	unsigned
the c# byte is an unsigned 8 bit integer with values that can range between 0 and 255

1296294
hide	show
and you just show or hide it

1296297
integer	unsigned
size unsigned 8-bit integer

1296377

but i still got this feeling that i should inherited the initial comment s properties only adding a simple comment-id joint

1296382
post	put
post variable put it in a form element

1296394
post	put	post	get	put	get
in addition to that i advise you to read your web service might not be restful ifâ as just properly handling get post put delete is not the all that is needed to be really rest

1296397
getdate	datepart
when i do for example datepart mm getdate i get the result of the month being 8 for august

1296399
addition	multiplication
if the multiplication unit is being used by another instruction perhaps we can find an addition instruction to execute instead for example

1296403
int	chars
edit if arr supposed to be used in int expressions then please don t mind the chars value of 0

1296411
move	drag
using the standard vcl drag and drop events ondragover and ondragdrop how can i distinguish between copy and move operations

1296434
min	max
as a simple example consider this access for n 10 random integers between min 100 and max 200 from random.org which supplies true random numbers based on atmospheric noise rather than a pseudo random number generator

1296456
stateless	stateful
don t try to wedge a fundamentally stateful interaction into a stateless model just because you read about it on wikipedia

1296471

in particular will the underlying array used by the python list implementation continue to grow indefinitely have millions of spots even though the list only has a thousand things or will python eventually do a realloc and free up some of that memory

1296516
int	chars
the moment you ask for 05 is no longer and int but a string chars varchar nchar nvarchar etc

1296552
postgresql	mysql
i have too little experience with postgresql or oracle to judge so i will just stick with not recommending mysql

1296601
profiling	instrumentation
however i suggest testing such optimizations using a profiling such as instrumentation just to make sure you re not over-complicating your code for not a lot of benefit

1296630
post	get
here s a blog post with some more information get vs2010 extensions easily with built-in extension manager and checking out a vs2010t4 editor

1296684
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
i ve tested all combinations of pre-allocating not pre-allocating counting up down and for while loops in ie 6 7 8 firefox 3.5 google-chrome and opera

1296684
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
the functions below was consistently the fastest or extremely close in firefox google-chrome and ie8 and not much slower than the fastest in opera and ie 6

1296707
width	height
not the width or height of the image but the size of the data

1296719
versioning	upgrade
by default when using a new versioning of a subversion client it will upgrade the repository to that versioning

1296728
children	parent
i really donâ t want to run the first query on the children and then query the parent by a list of ids as i figure there has got to be a better way of doing this

1296747
move	drag
for vanilla drag drops it applies rules based on original and destination drive volumes - dragging dropping files around on a volume is a move operation by default

1296770
folder	directory
either copy the python lib directory to the ironpython folder or set ironpythonpath

1296781
post	get
attempts to use response.redirect above to my .ashx file result in get not post and trace.axd of course shows nothing in the form collection so that seems wrong too

1296799
addclass	removeclass
to prevent your row styles from vanishing put them in a css class and use addclass and removeclass instead to apply them bearing in mind that if they re not in a class then they don t exist

1296802
put	get
if you put it in an external file this won t get evaluated and that script text will be in the javascript file on the client which is not going to work because it doesn t have the proper id

1296816
unix	sunos	unix	aix	sunos	aix
there s libstatgrab which doesn t seem to be very actively developed it already supports a decent variety of unix platforms though and the very active psi python system information which works on aix linux sunos and darwin

width	height
you can specify the x y width and height to draw the image and you can specify where in the image you want to draw using the clippingrect

1297045
hide	show
.lib files enable you to hide certain parts of your implementation - you could have private exports that do not show up in the .lib but are discoverable via getprocaddress

1297048
implements	modifiers
by the way one language that implements access modifiers per object and not per class is ruby

1297126
g++	gcc
the above code returns 4 on gcc and 1 on g++

1297144
implements	extends
zend_rest_client extends zend_service_abstract which in turn implements a gethttpclient method which returns a zend_http_client instance which exposes a getlastresponse method which returns a zend_http_response instance which once again exposes a getbody method

1297205
g++	gcc
edit to clarify things i m using gcc g++ 4.3

1297249
pull	push
it allow full round-tripping of revisions full clone pull and push however as of this writing xxx amend this if when it becomes incorrect it is still in development and there are not yet official releases

1297249
pull	push
up until recently this only let you clone and pull a subversion repository but as of hgsvn 0.1.7 it supports push

1297270
valgrind	callgrind
for this you need to be running in linux which i think you are and have the callgrind and valgrind programs available

1297275
post	put	post	get	put	get
when you say go and create a medication you put or post to the medications resource and you get a reference back to that medication

for example they re usually a side effect vs explicitly managed via get put delete

1297306
versioning	upgrade
i recently upgrade it to the latest versioning from 2.0 and i have a feeling that this has something to do with it

1297357
cpython	ironpython
the .msi installer for ironpython includes all parts of the cpython standard library that should work with ironpython

1297357
cpython	ironpython
you can simply copy the standard library from a cpython install if you prefer although you re better off getting just the modules that the ironpython developers have ensured with with ironpython - this is most of them

1297392
nszombies	nszombieenabled
one way to determine if my scenario is what is happening is to turn on nszombies which you can do by setting the environment variable nszombieenabled to yes

1297426

i have a very simple war project and i want to include a directory named meta-inf at the top of the classes output folder where all the compiled java classes are

1297473
folder	directory
any quick pointers on how to instruct maven to put this directory and file into the output folder

1297480
hash	hmac
in some other applications we don t want create a database just for this so we create a hmac secret hash of the email address and use that as confirmation secret

1297506
put	get
either of these procedures should get me the same date i put in

1297526
retaincount	dealloc
if you use a retain you will increment the retaincount by one so that when autorelease releases the object it will still have a retaincount until another release is sent - which should be done by you at some point - maybe in your dealloc

1297553
versioning	upgrade
which versioning it can be upgrade

1297559

you can try postsharp to create those attributes and have the class implement the getter setter interface

1297671
put	get
i put my calls to async services in the model and hook into events from my viewmodel that get fired when the data is returned to the model

1297684

nsoperation	nsnotification
i m currently sending a nsnotification at the end of my main method and any code that is waiting for the nsoperation to complete subscribes to the notification

1297734
firefox	safari
everything is working in firefox on both pc mac and on safari but doesn t work in ie

1297734
firefox	safari	post	get
using post instead of get causes it to fail in firefox and safari as well

1297741
width	height
there is also another graph that is basically a pie-chart where the width of the slices doesn t change their height does

1297778
getter	setter
turns out you can create a getter setter delegate from a propertyinfo and have near native get set performance

1297782
ethernet	wireless
i m doing the reverse of what it seems most people do when bridging an ethernet and wireless interface

1297782

1298005
freebsd	linux
linux or freebsd or windows

1298026
width	height
i need to get the body element height and width when i resize the browser windows

1298042
spaces	linefeed
my idea there is that we deal with cr linefeed and spaces at beginning or end of line replacing with a single spaces

1298076
gif	bmp
also in which format images has to be stored. bmp gif jpeg.....

1298105
filtering	grouping
the actual summarization query is something like the following counting up the number of sessions and transactions then grouping by campaign and optional filtering

1298130
rss	feed
convention seems to go with using your first example as the link for an rss atom feed

1298154
comparator	comparable
cons value must either be comparable or you need to provide comparator in the constructor

1298161
equals	compareto	equals	tostring	tostring	compareto
boolean boolean boolean string parseboolean string tostring boolean valueof boolean valueof string booleanvalue compareto boolean equals object hashcode tostring

1298163
treemap	treeset
treeset and its brother treemap oddly have nothing to do with representing trees

1298163
children	parent
internally they use a tree organisation to give you an alphabetically sorted set map but you have no control over links between parent and children

1298163
comparator	comparable
if you donâ t supply a comparator to define the ordering you want treeset requires a comparable implementation on the item class to define the natural order

1298166
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
along with a custom uiimageview that implements touchesbegan and touchesmoved to determine where to move the uiimageview

1298166
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
use of nslog shows the touchesbegan touchesmoved methods on the jm_uiimageview are no longer called

1298171
post	put
can you configure apache as a reverse proxy to allow outside gets to be proxied directly to couchdb whereas put post are sent to the application internal logic for sanitation authentication...

1298241
rss	feed
i have a fairly simple process running that periodically pulls rss feed and updates articles in a mysql database

1298258
folder	directory
copy that file into your project directory and add it to the project by right-clicking in xcode on your resources folder and choosing add existing files

1298285
width	height
i suspect this is due to the display block in the li elements but they need to have fixed width height is there a way around this

1298298
width	margin
the outer one also floated left and with 100 width the inner with a left margin of the same width as the left column

1298305
feedback	review
firstly do not be discouraged or disheartened when something doesn t work or when something breaks or if you receive negative feedback the proverbial it sucks review

1298408
qmainwindow	qdockwidget
window a would be a qmainwindow and window b would be a qdockwidget

1298416
equals	compareto
if a treeset contains object a then object b is considered part of the set if a.compareto b returns 0 even if a.equals b is false so if compareto and equals isn t implemented in a consistent way you are in for a bad ride

1298416
equals	compareto
the lesson to learn here is always avoid implementing compareto and equals inconsistently

1298434
gridview	detailsview
in order to bind a datasource to a server-side control gridview detailsview

1298434
gridview	objectdatasource
since in your case databinding situation is different as you mentioned earlier that you bind gridview with objectdatasource which executes a query in page load and in every select insert update delete operations datasource is bound automatically which means databind is also called automatically

1298434
gridview	objectdatasource
there is another case which you are looking for an answer in the first place is that if datasource is queried and bound in page events you query something and get a result with datatable and bind it into gridview -- this source is not in the page not a objectdatasource or something else stands on page as static source .since this query is coming from an event when you enable pageindex you must query it again that leads to you must also bind it with databind

1298464
swt	swing
is swt faster than swing

1298500
swt	swing
swing and swt are two completely different apis although the principles are the same

1298522
swt	swing
swing vs swt

1298522
swt	swing
swing vs swt 2nd

1298617
swt	swing
we also had this question in company and decided to go with swing because for normal desktop application you just cannot sense the speed difference which is supposedly on swt side and this speed you are buying with ruining wora principle you have to bring with your application needed .dlls or .so files to natively support your application running in desired os-es

1298652
keydown	keyup
the button control intercepts the arrow key presses and moves focus to the next or previous control in the tab order in a manner so that the keydown keyup and keypress events are not raised

this lets you format the sharepoint rss feed using templates so you can get just the output you want

1298706
ienumerable	iqueryable
the result in example 1 will also not be further queryable on the server as an ienumerable is returned while in example 2 the compiler can work out if the result should rather be a iqueryable instead of ienumerable

1298762
post	get
they all use http post get etc. don t they

1298764
organization	naming
project organization also includes topics like naming conventions lumper splitter preference on classes number of actual projects vs

1298771
folder	directory
when something changes i automatically want a mbox or a maildir directory to show up with the contents of my new folder

1298783
swt	swing
i think it s important to remember swt came in to being when swing was very immature and i guess the eclipse folks thought it necessary to reinvent-the-wheel suspect in retrospect that s something they regret however thin a layer swt is

1298817
nsbitmapimagerep	nsimage
using pure objective-c cocoa and pdf kit iterate on the pages of your pdf document and for each one create an nsimage whose size is that of the media box of the page lock focus on it tell the page to draw create an nsbitmapimagerep with the focused view the image unlock focus on the image then ask the bitmap image rep for the jpeg data and write that data to the file

you probably want a module with the extra hw uarts usb etc... as well as just the chip but you could implement this with something the size of a bluetooth usb or probably smaller

1298963
windows	wow64
windows itself provides an api to deal with most aspects of changing the mapping of your address space to get a different windows onto a wider pool be it via things like pae running wow64 disk or a mixture

textarea	textbox
buttons textbox textarea fieldsets and dropdowns are different across browsers and platforms

1299036
google-chrome	firefox
edit redsquare has pointed out that the above will not work in firefox and google-chrome as those browsers will append a tbody element to tables

1299125
google-chrome	firefox
i think firefox google-chrome etc will add the tbody in for you therefore the selector should be

1299147
stdout	stderr
you can even capture the stdout and stderr streams from the ffmpeg process and use that information to for example drive a progress bar or display errors
