metaclass	subclassing
note that the magic behaviour that initalised gains by having the metaclass init_attributes is not passed onto a subclassing of initalised

100037
metaclass	subclassing
here is an even more concrete example showing how you can subclassing type to make a metaclass that performs an action when the class is created

100300
try-catch	exception-handling
and try-catch where you actually catch an exception-handling you re able to handle is good or if you do this

100315
getter	setter
from experience the only times you d want to make a member variable public and leave out getter and setter methods is if you want to make it absolutely clear that changing it will have no side effects

100315
getter	setter
also if you re writing a data structure as a way of finding out about how they store data rather than as release code then there s a good argument that getter and setter will not help and will get in the way of the learning experience

100334
rss	feed
allows you to consume and apply xslt transform to any rss feed and output the result on any sharepoint page

100350

put	get
simply put if you buy something on a credit card your card provider is liable for ensure you get what you paid for broadly speaking in most countries does not constitute legal advice etc. and if you have a problem with your purchase they will refund you very quickly and then will go and chase the person that you paid

100802
opera	firefox
opera and ie these days treat getyear as getyear was originally specified for dates before 2000 but will treat it as getfullyear for dates after 2000 while webkit and firefox stick with the old behavior

100802
opera	firefox
this outputs 108 in firefox webkit and 2008 in opera ie

i managed to get a selection of rowkey objects but can t find out how to get the original objects i put in back

100838
vb.net	vb6	vbscript	vb6
i wrote basics for years ms-basic gw-basic quick-basic visual basic vbscript and it was very difficult to use vb.net because i always try to write things as i used to do with vb6 or vbscript

100928
httphandler	httpmodule
however creating your own http module to do something similar is of course trivial -- the onbeginrequest handler could look as follows in this case implementation for a httphandler shown but in a httpmodule the idea is exactly the same

100930
opera	firefox
code for mozilla firefox opera etc

100937
lisp	scheme
they are most probably much less mature than any common lisp or scheme implementation but there are lisp dialects for .net l# and dotlisp

that s one reason why going from hex to binary is much easier than from decimal to binary

101428
ubuntu	linux
kernal operating system virtual server instance linux windows server windows home ubuntu aix zseries os 390 et al

101507
ssl	https
i would first try to figure out why your application is crashing on https ssl connections

101561
mvp	presenter
in mvp the presenter contains the ui business logic for the view

101561
mvp	presenter
this differs from mvp where actions route through the view to the presenter

101561
mvp	presenter
this is contrary to mvp where it is absolutely necessary because if the view does not delegate to the presenter it will never get called

101656
n-gram	words
basically an n-gram is splitting a words into smaller chunks

101701
sniffing	wlan

101879
post	get
it makes the environment get post cookie and server variables global php manual

101905
minimum	max
the obvious upper bound is max heap size divided by the minimum amount of memory required to service a request but even that is hard to measure in an environment with a garbage collector.

101927
postgresql	mysql
for small-medium look at mysql or postgresql

101966
post	put
you can check out this post to find out how to put together a basic modelbinder

101988
opera	safari
if every developer had written code for fx safari and opera i think ie had to start following the rules sooner than with version 8

101991
apache	nginx
my preferred server is nginx but the common pattern is to start with apache + mod_proxy_http

102018
bibtex	latex
if you re doing any serious work with latex you ll find make very handy because of the need to re-interpret .tex files several times when using bibtex or tables of contents

102055
google-chrome	firefox
this works in both google-chrome and firefox but not in ie

102059
width	height
with previous versions of flash entering the full screen mode increased the height and width of the stage to the dimensions of the screen

102059
width	height
now that hardware scaling has arrived the height and width are set to the dimensions of the video plus borders if the aspect ratio is different

102094
macports	homebrew
there are different cases depending on whether you installed mysql with the official binary installer using macports or using homebrew

102261
firefox	safari
firebug works great in firefox which isn t having this problem nor is safari so i m hoping someone might spot something obviously wrong with the way my code will play with ie

102261
firefox	safari
single clicks collapse and expand tables in firefox safari but ie tables require multiple clicks a seemingly arbitrary number between 1 and 5 to expand

102464

as an example i have a simple login page with the standard username and password text boxes and the log in button and a remember me checkbox with a i can t remember my username and or password hyperlink

102599
cvs	svn
one of the essential differences between svn and cvs is that changes are committed atomically

102599
cvs	svn
in cvs each file has its own version but in svn the version is for the whole project and includes all the files checked in together

102643
rsa	aes
i would use aes for the bulk data encryption and rsa for encrypting the aes key

102657

edit - i added a scriptmanager control and wrapped the buttons in an updatepanel however now i m receiving the following error

102686
hide	show
ctrl + r â show hide results pane

102690
equals	gethashcode
then we can make two instances of some reference type which are actually equals because of the overloaded gethashcode and equals

102690
equals	gethashcode
for complicated dictionary keys you must override equals and gethashcode correctly

102716
put	get
you get a root page via a http get parse it to find urls and put them on a queue unless they ve been parsed already so you need a global record of pages you have already parsed

102717
extjs	gxt
i m working on a project right now that uses extjs gwt gxt not to be confused with gwt extjs

102717
extjs	gxt
anyways gxt is still somewhat immature and lacks a solid community that i feel gwt extjs has

102717
extjs	gxt
however the future is with gxt as it s native gwt and actually developed by the company that made extjs

102717
extjs	gxt
for more information on extjs gwt gxt

102747
ant	maven-jar-plugin
strong tool support exists for creating manifest files a core ant task for example or the maven-jar-plugin

102752
getter	setter
the sqldataadapter implements idbdataadapter which has getter setter for all the crud commands

102756
translation	localization
managing localization and translation using .rc files and visual studio is not a good idea

102788
crypt	md5
a hashing function md5 sha1 crypt etc is not suitable as i would like to be able to decrypt the information as well

102832
jsf	seam	post	get
how do i induce seam jsf to use get and include the query expression as a parameter rather than post the default

102836
equals	gethashcode
don t override gethashcode and equals on mutable classes only override it on immutable classes or structures else if you modify a object used as key the hash table won t function properly anymore you won t be able to retrieve the value associated to the key after the key object was modified

102862
vim	emacs
on the mac or nix you can use command line or gui versions of emacs or vim

102914
post	get
you can use a phaselistener to convert post requests to get requests or just to interpret get requests so that they can be bookmarkable

102924
actionscript	mxml
that is also how it is done behind the scenes when the mxml in your example is transformed to actionscript before being compiled

102924
actionscript	mxml
...except that the code generated by the mxml to actionscript conversion is longer as it has to be more general

102977
google-chrome	safari
because google-chrome uses the webkit to render html you can be assured if it works in safari it ll work under google-chrome however it s rendering engine isn t up to scratch quite yet

102995
google-chrome	firefox
i use firefox mostly and have google-chrome for the other websites at work

102997
ncover	fxcop
cruise control will be automatically pulling the source from visual source safe ok it isn t subversion but we can deal compiling it and then running it through fxcop nunit ncover and last but not lease simian

103010
google-chrome	firefox
i switched to google-chrome and haven t looked back except for the occasional site which doesn t work properly forcing me to load it in firefox

103053
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
but i definately now make sure sites i work on render well in google-chrome as well as firefox latest versions of ie safari konquerer and opera

103117
rsa	aes
assuming that you have a safe way of sharing a key whether rsa encryption of it retrieval over an ssh or https link or callling the other developer on a secured phone line any of the major modern encryptions like aes as mentioned by ed haber would be suitable

103130
cvs	svn
they have versions for svn and cvs

103143
post	get
just a guess the handler specified in iis7 s windir system32 inetsrv config applicationhost.config which is handling your request is not allowing the post verb to get through at all and it is evaluating that rule before determining whether the url doesn t exist

103174
ironruby	ironpython
if you re an ms developer have you found a niche in your world for other languages like f# ironruby ironpython or something similar and what niche do they fill

103184
hash	salt
i assume we are vulnerable in this case so we should probably store a salt along with the hash

103226
hash	salt
a salt hash should work just fine

103233
hash	salt
if indeed you choose good random salt you ll have to do the hash for every other card in your system

103233
hash	salt
you see in the password world a salt adds no cost because we just want to know if the clear text + salt hash to what we have stored for this particular user

103285
int	double
any other cast will not work trying to unbox an int to a double and will result in a compile time runtime error depending on the situation and what can be detected by static type checking

103309
hash	salt
hashing is nice for security but wouldn t you need to store recall the salt in order to replicate the hash for a duplicate check

103347
luabind	tolua++
do you use luabind tolua++ or some other library if so which one or none at all

103384
reentrantreadwritelock	futuretask
in any case as you probably know terracotta gives you the ability to express concurrency across the cluster the same way you do in a single jvm by using pojo synchronized wait notify or by using any of the java.util.concurrent primitives such as reentrantreadwritelock cyclicbarrier atomiclong futuretask and so on

103391
filesystems	ntfs
it helps a bit to deactivate the ntfs filesystems feature to keep track of the last file-access

103431
math.h	sqrt
including math.h will tell the compiler that the math functions like sqrt exist but they are defined in a separate library which the linker needs to pack with your executable

103474
wsdl.exe	svcutil.exe
i d like to use the ide to add the service not muck with wsdl.exe or svcutil.exe

103554
post	get
first you get or post your request

103554
post	get
to accomplish steps 1 and 2 below is a simple php class which uses curl to fetch webpages using either get or post

103579
hash	salt
even if they had the salt hash and the method you used

103598
opera	safari
others safari opera have adopted support for it but support on older browsers is unreliable

103648
ssl	https
i m unclear why transmitting the passwords over ssl -- via https -- is being considered insecure by your audit team

103653
hash	salt
use a salt highly secure computationally expensive hash like sha-256 with a per-record unique salt

103653
hash	salt
if the simple check hits use the salt get the hash value do the in depth check

103669
profiler	gprof
mastery of a profiler gprof ...

103711
integer	unsigned
given an unsigned int 0 is 0 or 360 degrees and the max 32 bit unsigned integer 0xffffffff is the biggest value just below 360 degrees

103737
post	get
on my own site i assign each entry a unique integer from a monotonically increasing series newer post get higher numbers

103813
post	get
if you want to maintain the value of the label between calls you need to use one of the state mechanisms session preferences or communication systems request get post

103869
bazaar	git	bazaar	svn
after getting comfortable with the way svn works then you can get into distributed version control systems like git bazaar or mercurial but i ve seen enough professional developers have problems wrapping their heads around the basics of version control branching merging etc that i d get comfortable with that first before moving to distributed systems

103871
int	double
both of these cast the int value to a double

104018
inherited	properties
if the js implementation you re using supports the hasownproperty method for objects you can use it to test whether a properties has explicitly been set for an object or the properties is inherited from its prototype

104087
rpm	yum
i don t think you can list the contents of a package using yum but if you have the .rpm file on your local system as will most likely be the case for all installed packages you can use the rpm command to list the contents of that package like so

104093
rpm	yum
so you can use yum to list the available rpms and then run the rpm -qlp command to see the contents of that package

104126
width	height
if you set the width or height of the decoratorpanel you need to set the height and width of the middlecenter cell to 100 so that the middlecenter cell takes up all of the available space

104126
width	height
if you do not set the width and height of the decoratorpanel it will wrap its contents tightly

104207
equals	gethashcode
if you implement iequatable t you should also override the base class implementations of equals object and gethashcode so that their behavior is consistent with that of the iequatable t equals method

104264
cassini	iis
all the previous responses are great answers - here s one gottcha with cassini that might require iis on the destkop

104264
cassini	iis
cassini runs in the context of the developer not as the iis user iusr_ iwam or in winxp x64 the w3wp process

104264
cassini	iis
when you move to the server iis something that you would have had access to in cassini doesn t work the same

104292
folder	directory
my project builds fine on my development machine as the source is only two folder deep but tf build seems to use a really deep directory that is causing it to break

104292
folder	directory
currently my working directory is temp builddefinitionpath but now i don t know what wildcards are available to specify a different folder

104313
post	get
i need to handle form data most likely using post but i want to handle the get case as well

104313
post	get
it provides code examples for post and get which return an apr_hash_t of the key+value pairs in the form

104313
post	get
is there an existing module or routines within apache apr or apr-util to extract the field names and associated data from a get or post form into a structure which c code can more easily access

104339
int	chars
looking at the switch statement i see that i can only handle int chars etc and not objects.

104360
folder	directory
once done flex will create a generated directory in your source folder and inside you ll find all teh temporary as files that were used during compilation

104381
versioning	upgrade
that said almost every computer online has some form of the flash player though it might not be the needed versioning 9 for flex apps it can easily be upgrade through a simple click in the browser

104394
inherited	subclassing
having to subclassing a winproc when you re more familiar with object inherited is head-splitting and less than optimal

104451
hash	salt
storing credit cards using a simple single pass of a hash algorithm even when salt is fool-hardy

104451
hash	salt
when hashing credit card number the hashing must be carefully designed to protect against brute forcing by using strongest available cryptographic hash functions large salt values and multiple iterations

104473
system.in	system.out
and sadly since console is final you can t extend it to create a a wrapper around system.in and system.out that does it either

104510
free	malloc
the c and jni code can allocate memory as well malloc free new etc which is outside of the vm s 256m

104530
allocator	stl
stl containers with default allocator don t do anything fancy they all end up allocator via standard new delete operators somehow

104531
cairngorm	puremvc
i found cairngorm and puremvc to have a pretty steep learning curve and they both feel a bit too bulky for me

104617
udp	tcp
i m using udp not tcp at this time

104618
put	get
i ve been trying to get into f# on and off for a while but i keep getting put off

104622
arp	snmp
if you haven t already try hp openview trial version and apart of using snmp it also uses arp tables to figure out your topology

104632
hash	salt
from there you can change passwords or whatever you need to do never send the password though - you should always store it as a salt hash anyway always change it

104693
int	chars
grab a chars if it s a number chars keep grabbing then reassemble to chars into a single number string and convert it into an int

104727
rsa	dsa
scp will do the job but there is one wrinkle the connection to the second remote destination will use the configuration on the first remote destination so if you use .ssh config on the local environment and you expect rsa and dsa keys to work you have to forward your agent to the first remote host

104763
cvs	svn
i don t know about cvs but if going to svn is an option there s always ankh

104770
mousemove	mouseup	mousemove	mousedown	mouseup	mousedown
you can make more than one movieclip dragging at once using events mousedown mousemove and mouseup

104770
move	drag
in mousemove if the flag is set calculate move offset and just change .x and .y of all movieclips you want to drag

104804
rss	feed
you could also have an rss feed tying into the application that would publish an update as soon as something occurred

104855
move	drag
here s an example that implements drag functionality for an object that will also move a bunch of sibling objects along with it

104877
postgresql	mysql
just for completeness since mysql and postgresql have already been mentioned with sqlite use pragma table_info

104890
csla	.net
i read an article by rocky lhotka .net legend inventor of csla etc where he mentioned almost in passing that last year he felt very terribly overwheled by the rate of change

104939
getter	setter
deletepersoncommand will have the execute and in the execute can check attribute that will be passed by getter setter previously the call of the execute

104960
postgresql	mysql
edit i d like to be free to choose from postgresql mysql and sqlite as far as the actual databases go

104966
apache	nginx
choose a server architecture nginx mongrel fastcgi cgi apache passenger there is a lot to choose from

104966
put	get
make sure all of your passwords are out of source control if you have database.yml mail.yml if you use yaml_mail_config or other sensitive files in source control get them out of there replace them with database.yml.example and put them in the shared folder on your server

104966
apache	nginx
if you want a be right back page to be present when you deploy make sure that you have a capistrano maintenance file specified and nginx or apache knows how and when to redirect to it

105013
int	chars
such as int string returns float chars

105024
spaces	delimiter
i ve tried comma delimiting semi-colon delimiting and even spaces delimiter

105035
children	parent
by default the container is the browser window but if a parent element either has position relative or position absolute set on it then it will act as the parent for positioning coordinates for its children

105047
spaces	delimiter
semi-colon delimiter with no spaces

105118
next	except
a block has some whitespace above and below it and tolerates no html elements next to it except when ordered otherwise by adding a float declaration to another element for instance

105246
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
it s important to note that inline elements cannot be assigned their own width height or vertical whitespace margin padding top bottom

105266
mouse	keyboard
javascript looking for mouse movement keyboard activity and scrolling

105287
nunit	mstest
although several ci tools such as teamcity have better support for nunit probably would change as mstest becomes more popular

105287
nunit	mstest
in my current project we use both and the only big diffrence we found is that mstest always runs as a 32bit while nunit runs as either 32bit or 64bit test which only matters if your code uses native code that is 32 64 dependant

105303
iprincipal	iidentity
another disadvantage i ve run into is on a forms authenticated website using custom iprincipal iidentity

105303
cassini	iis
check this blog post for more.the headache on this made me drop cassini and stick with iis

105327
client-side	server-side
this hash could perhaps be inserted into the html document server-side for use by the client-side javascript

105339
int	double
for floats and double it s more difficult as with plain int as these may or not may be in the host machines byte-order

105352
ant	maven
it s flexable like ant while leveraging maven s dependency system

105368
width	height
an inline element does not define a box that s why you cannot set its width and height it will be appended to other inline elements in the current block

105391
maven	pom.xml
you can declaratively define your project s dependencies in maven s config file called the project object model pom.xml and maven does the work of storing all the jars in a local directory structure that it maintains

105391
jar	war
that means that if your project depends on jar a and a depends on jar b jar b will automatically be bundled with your war even though you don t explicitly list it as a dependency in your build config

105391
ant	maven
also i ll say from a professional development standpoint it makes sense to learn maven since in my experience maven has overtaken ant as the de jure build tool of choice both in open source and proprietary java projects

105543
silverstripe	modx
well silverstripe is thought to be a good option for people who care about web standards as is modx

105545
expression-blend	silverlight
get them a copy of expression-blend the gui development tool for silverlight wpf

105570
maven	cargo
maven can also help you in integration tests on tomcat if you have some since you can start stop or deploy a war using the cargo plugin

105737
free	calloc
the concept you are missing here is that for every calloc there must be a free

105737
free	calloc
and that free must be applied to the pointer passed back from calloc

105817
terminate	timeout
if you have solid proof using the query plan that the query can t be executed any faster than that then you should increase the timeout there s no other way to keep the connection that s the purpose of the timeout to terminate the connection if the query doesn t complete in that time frame

106018
put	get
put your value into a byte array then getstring to get the c# native string for the character

106168
mbunit	nunit	testdriven.net	xunit.net
also if you lack a plugin such as testdriven.net you cannot debug your nunit or mbunit xunit.net etc. unit tests within the visual studio environment as you can with the microsoft vs testing framework which is built in

106252
stdout	stderr
if by logging you mean system.out.println or system.err.println and if you re sure that your test really doesn t need the logs then you can redirect stdout and stderr programmatically

106336
int	double
i have a arraylist made up of different elements imported from a db made up of strings numbers double and int

106365
ncover	testdriven.net
i also like testdriven.net because it integrates nunit for unit testing ncover for code coverage and reflector for disassembling the .net framework

106469
public	protected
in c++ you simply specify a modifier before the base class of private public or protected

106485
mouse	keyboard
increases the productivity a lot and i am keyboard freak who hates using mouse

106509
submit	submission
i have a button that i would like to disable when the form submit to prevent the user submission multiple times

106553
queue	fifo
when creating a mutex semaphore in vxwroks you have two options to deal with multiple tasks queue waiting for the semaphore fifo or highest priority task first

106553
queue	fifo
if you were to use a fifo queue for the semaphore the kernel would have to traverse the queue of tasks waiting for the mutex to find the one with the highest priority

106765
versioning	upgrade
is there a framework that can be used to enable a c# windows service to automatically check for a newer versioning and upgrade itself

106771
int	boolean
and not just in java but also in c#. there are times when you need to get or set a value that is guaranteed to be an atomic operation on your given platform an int or boolean for example but do not require the overhead of thread locking

106837
ant	maven
it also has good integration with project sprouts which is a build tool for flex and flash similar to ant however it uses ruby rake tasks and includes excellent dependency management along the lines of maven

106842
width	height
when i say adjust the image size i don t mean set the height and width in the html image tag

106843
width	height
simply create a class that has the appropriate width and height values set and make all tags use this class

106861
firefox	safari	width	height
it s worth noting that in firefox 3 and safari resizing an image by just changing the height and width doesn t look too bad

106915
width	height
pre-load them into javascript image objects then just reference the height and width

106925
width	height
you can get the height width of an image after the page loads via javascript info then you could resize the height of the div after loading

106942
munin	cacti
munin and cacti provide very nice interfaces and pre-built scripts for rrdtool

106969
public	protected
private protected internal public give classes variables properties and functions the least amount of visibility they need for everything to still work

106990
public	protected
as some other answers have said in general go for the highest level of encapsulation as possible ie private unless you actually need internal protected public

107053
haskell	ocaml	erlang	ocaml
in functional programming languages erlang haskell ml ocaml f# etc. it s very common to have any list processing use recursion

107066
post	get
i decided to post it here to get feedback on the idea

107096
put	get
when i put the ccommandbar.insertmenubar before i create child dialogs i do not get my ok or cancel soft keys when i put that line after the creation of child dialogs the softkeys show as expected and work great

107131
svg	vml
there are two very nice browser-based vector javascript-manipulable graphics packages which together are virtually universal svg and vml

107131
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
svg is supported by firefox opera safari and google-chrome - technically only part of the specification is supported but for practical purposes you should be able to do what you need

107131
svg	vml
vml is microsoft s answer to svg and surprise is natively supported by ie although svg is not

107131
svg	vml
by the way you say that you re asking for an algorithm and i m offering technologies if that s the right term for svg vml

107133
inherited	properties
i can t specifically answer the question except that the issynchronized and syncroot properties but not synchronise explicitly are inherited from the icollection interface

107149
width	margin
this will position the first letter on the right edge of the paragraph then shove it left it by more or less the width of the paragraph then move both the letter and all the padding into the float s large negative margin so the paragraph fits in the margin and doesn t try to wrap around

107209
int	boolean
you could represent these connections as an array of eight boolean values or much more compactly as an eight bit int

107209
int	boolean
its then easy to use the eight boolean values or the eight bit int to form the filename of the bitmap to load for that grid square

107209
int	boolean
for example your center tile using this scheme could be called bitmap01000011.png just using the boolean values or alternatively bitmap43.png using the hexidecimal value of the eight bit int representing that binary pattern for a shorter filename

107234
put	get
in my head it s as simple as replacing a select stuff where tag buffer-overflow with select stuff where tag not in php offtopic funny-hat-friday but i ve not put together any db backed sites that get absolutely pounded on by thousands people

107301
subtraction	addition
each addition or subtraction mean the subsequent prior element in the array

107349
quicksort	mergesort
if you look at the quicksort or mergesort algorithms you will see that they both take the approach of dividing the list to be sorted in half sorting each half using the same algorithm recursively and then recombining the two halves

107358
unix	sunos
i don t know if this advice applies to sunos or any unix

107364
width	height
pass in a size with the desired width and a maximum height and then you can look at the height returned to fit the text

107426
post	put
a put is used to update existing data at a given url or to create something new when you know what the uri is going to be and it doesn t already exist as opposed to a post which will create something and return a url to it if necessary

107431
calloc	malloc	memset	malloc	memset	calloc
instead of doing malloc followed by memset you should be using calloc which will clear the newly allocated memory for you

107450
post	put
difference between post and put

107450
post	put
post and put requests is reflected in

107466
mouseup	mousedown
you can always use the mousedown or mouseup event and check to see if it the selected node

107480
inherited	properties
it can support oop because supports inherited through prototyping also properties and methods

107490
jboss	glassfish
if you are developing an application that would be deployed to application server tomcat jboss glassfish etc you don t have to handle concurrency control yourself as it already addressed by the application server

107510
addition	multiplication
you can then take the quaternion product which uses only simple multiplication and addition of the current rotation quaternion and incremental rotation quaternion to get a new quaternion which represents performing both rotations

107510
addition	multiplication
converting the quaternion to a rotation matrix is very straightforward uses only multiplication and addition when you want to display the model in its rotated state using traditional graphics api s

107520
rpm	yum
on at least one rh system with rpm v4.8.0 yum v3.2.29 and repoquery v0.0.11 repoquery -l rpm prints nothing

107542
post	put
one other difference is that put should be idempotent - multiple puts of the same data to the same url should be fine wheras multiple post might create multiple objects or whatever it is your post action does

107552
vmware	virtualbox
we have played a bit with vmware virtualpc virtualbox etc creating a virtual build server but we came across a lot of issues when we tried to copy it for others to use having to reconfigure every new copy of the vm

107557
bazaar	git	bazaar	cvs	bazaar	svn	cvs	svn
one of its functions is to generate a changelog entry from your local diff currently supporting bazaar cvs svn git and darcs

107599
post	put
others have already posted excellent answers i just wanted to add that with most languages frameworks and use cases you ll be dealing with post much much more often than put

107619
ubuntu	debian
the following command is probably the only one for which i ve used awk in the last two years it purges half-removed packages from my debian ubuntu systems

107650
bmp	png	png	ico
i ve used it a lot in my projects since a winform needs an ico file for it s icon while i usually have png or bmp files

107657
multiplying	add
he investigated a number of string hashing functions on a variety of datasets and found that a simple multiplying by 101 and add loop worked surprisingly well

107668
udp	tcp
if you have a situation where a tcp connection is potentially too slow and a udp connection is potentially too unreliable what do you use

107668
udp	tcp
i m interested in the various options here of which tcp is at one end of the scale and udp is at the other

107668
udp	tcp
various reliable udp options are available and each brings some elements of tcp to udp

107679
jsf	seam
template-based frameworks are very good for this but we ve had some good experiences with jsf + facelets + seam too

107688
post	get
when you re not certain where the values are populated or when you use them both and want to loop over all values by both post and get methods

107727
post	get
is only a shortcut to prevent you from testing post get and cooking if the data can come from any of these

107727
post	get
data are taken from get post and finally cookie

107727
post	get
rest architectures require to separate the post and get semantics you can t rely on in that case

107783
sctp	tcp
update a comparison between tcp and sctp shows that the performances are comparable unless two interfaces can be used

107874
rss	feed
you can point an rss viewer web part at the laconi.ca public stream rss feed and use this xslt to ensure attractive output

107878
versioning	upgrade
i m re-writing it in .net so i don t want to pay 600+ for an upgrade to the latest versioning of coldfusion nor do i want to go through the very large site fixing versioning incompatibilities

107883
quicksort	heapsort
for example quicksort average cost t n.log n and heapsort average cost t n.log n are both sorting algorithms with the same average cost - yet quicksort is typically much faster than heapsort

107883
quicksort	heapsort
this is because heapsort does a few more comparisons per element than quicksort

108027
put	get
i have no idea what can cause this but i would try to find out by subclassing qdrag overwrite deletelater well reimplement it but as it s a slot it will get called anyway use this instead of a qdrag and put a breakpoint in deletelater

108030
udp	tcp
if you have a situation where a tcp connection is potentially too slow and a udp connection is potentially too unreliable what do you use

108030
udp	tcp
if you want to get reliability out of udp then you re basically going to be re-implementing some of tcp s features on top of udp which will probably make things slower than just using tcp in the first place

108047
toolbar	docking
we currently use a very old version of stingray objective toolkit to provide our mfc extensions like customizable toolbar and docking windows etc

108102
lisp	smalltalk
the thing that i like most about lisp and smalltalk systems is that they feel alive

108218
onfocus	onblur
you can add and remove a special css class and modify the input value onfocus onblur with javascript

108250
post	get
drag it on the stage - select a control panel - double click controls to edit with the flash drawing tools - post to the website.you might have to use a flashvar to get the url into the url but that s fairly trivial.

108292
reverse-dns	spf
configuring and using sender-id domain-keys spf reverse-dns etc to make sure your emails are properly identified

108451
udp	tcp
if you need the reliable in-order delivery of tcp and also the fast response of udp and don t need to worry about congestion from sending large streams of data you can disable nagle s algorithm

108467
hide	show
it depends on how much encapsulated you want your class to be and what you want to hide or show

108507
xslt	xquery
personally i found xslt easier to learn than xquery

108507
xslt	xquery
xquery is a fantastic tool for selecting pieces of xml from a large repository but we still use xslt to transform our documents

108511
spaces	delimiter
note that overwrites the default spaces and tab delimiter so that the output of the date command gets gobbled all at once

108511
linefeed	delimiter
to capture multi-line output it can still essentially be a one-liner using the variable linefeed as the delimiter in the resulting variable

108545
post	get
i use post when i don t want people to have easy access to what is being passed and i use get when i don t mind them seeing the value in the url

108577
feedback	review
constant communication with chances for review and feedback will give users a better understanding of what you are delivering

108579
free	malloc
operator new and operator delete are c++ s closest equivalent to malloc and free and as these in the absence of class overrides are called as appropriate by new and delete expressions they can with care

108585
asterisk	pbx
here s one i did for the asterisk pbx a long time ago as an example

108649
hash	md5
i think jeremy has hit the nail on the head - if you just want to detect if files are different a hash algorithm like md5 or sha1 is a good way to go

108650
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
edit in response to chris i have set the partialchars parameter to 1 and the control works in all the other browsers i ve tried which are the latest versions of firefox safari opera and google-chrome

108692
getter	setter
there is a well-known debate in java and other communities i m sure whether or not trivial getter setter methods should be tested

108692
getter	setter
an annotation that says this test t should auto-test all the getter setter on class c because i assert that they are standard

108711
getter	setter
i doubt that autotesting getter and setter benefit your code quality or your coverage either these methods are used from other code and tested there 100 covered or not used at all and could be removed

108711
getter	setter
in the end you ll leave getter and setter in because they are used from the test but nowhere else in the application

108758
getter	setter
so i would try to see if those getter and setter can be removed as suggested before

108758
getter	setter
getter and setter are breaking encapsulation

108768
free	malloc
malloc inside a function call appears to be getting free on return

108820
cvs	svn
it lets you build applications with a svn cvs git like user interface easily your-command -o --long-opt some-action-to-execute some parameters

108862
profiling	benchmarking
programming languages have profiling like pear benchmarking

108884
memcpy	memset
the compiler will replace small memcpy s and memset s with more suitable code so it is not as horrible is it looks

108910
outputstream	inputstream	system.in	system.out
your command line interface class should accept an inputstream as it s input and provide an outputstream it can t hardcode output to system.out and input to system.in that it s output will be written to

108910
outputstream	inputstream
when a connection is made the server would take the inputstream from the connection and give it to the command line class which would provide the outputstream that data written to will be passed to the client that made the connection

108925
jar	war
if the former then the war is just a normal jar file and you can execute classes in that just like any other other jar file

108949
ssl	https
and because it also detects ssl you wont have to worry about weather your resources will be sent over http or https if you ever add ssl support to your server

108959
multiplication	exponent
it is probably the best you can do as a general method that works for all exponent values but for a specific exponent value there might be a better sequence that needs fewer multiplication

108980
getter	setter
in the most cases setter and getter do more as only setting and getting an internal field

108980
getter	setter
if you have no logic on the setter and getter then it must be used anywhere in your application

108980
getter	setter
test your business logic and not the getter and setter

108980
getter	setter
the result should also a coverage of the getter and setter

108980
getter	setter
if the getter and setter have no code coverage then removed it

108984
postgresql	mysql
the underlying database oracle microsoft mysql postgresql others custom.

108995
realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
sometimes even in c++ you have to make profit of the malloc realloc free utils

108995
realloc	malloc
and in c you could override malloc and realloc etc. through templates to achieve type-safety

109038
cairngorm	puremvc
the question has already been asked however since you ask specifically for the benefits of cairngorm and puremvc specifically these are my thoughts

109038
cairngorm	puremvc
both puremvc and cairngorm make it hard to write testable code

109038
cairngorm	puremvc
this is more true of cairngorm than puremvc but both are pretty bad

109038
cairngorm	puremvc
puremvc is more invasive than cairngorm meaning that your code is heavily dependent on the framework you have to subclass implement the framework classes interfaces but that doesn t mean that cairngorm isn t

109038
cairngorm	puremvc
cairngorm is full of anti-patterns like heavy use of global variables puremvc hides the worst parts of itself

109038
cairngorm	puremvc	cairngorm	flex
puremvc is anti-flex cairngorm just doesn t use many of the good parts of flex

109038
cairngorm	flex
in short cairngorm is the visualbasic of flex it works but will teach you a lot of bad habits

109038
cairngorm	mate
if you for some reason don t like mate try swiz which is a great improvement over cairngorm but still has some weird preference for using global variables for central event dispatching which is completely bizarre considering that one of the points of the framework is to avoid the evil global variables of cairngorm

109061
anjuta	kdevelop
these would be lightweight ides as opposed to heavyweights like anjuta kdevelop eclipse or netbeans

109069
clang	icc
to make binaries optimized for the machine you build them on use with gcc clang or icc

109069
clang	icc
see asm from gcc clang icc and msvc on the godbolt compiler explorer

109069
clang	icc
this source isn t x86-specific or gnu-specific at all but only compiles well for x86 with gcc clang icc

109081
jsf	seam
we re working with ejb here and it works quite well with seam and jsf faclets and myfaces trinidad

109091
setinterval	clearinterval
setinterval returns an interval id which you can pass to clearinterval

109091
setinterval	clearinterval
see the docs for setinterval and clearinterval

109098
setinterval	clearinterval
if you set the return value of setinterval to a variable you can use clearinterval to stop it

109124
stdout	stderr
is it possible to run an external process from perl capture its stderr stdout and the process exit code

109124
stdout	stderr
how do you capture stderr stdout and the exit code all at once

109150
stdout	stderr
with system both stdout and stderr will go the same place as the script s stdout and stderr unless the system command redirects them

109150
stdout	stderr
you could also call something like the following with open to redirect both stdout and stderr

109234
svg	vml
raphael is a plugin that uses svg for firefox and other browsers that support svg and vml for the ie products

109259
memcpy	memset
probably because it s not needed very often - i memset and memcpy reasonably often but i don t know that i d ever have used memswap if it was available

109476
stdout	stderr	cout	cin
however i think that the mechanisms the standard requires for synching stdin cin stdout cout and stderr cerr don t have to be visible to you

109480
memcached	apc
i ve created a forum and we re implementing an apc and memcached caching solution to save the database some work

109534
getter	setter
so to answer your question do net unit-test things that are better implemented as an integration test and also don t test getter setter - it is a waste of time

109605
postgresql	mysql
sql is used for relational databases ms sql server oracle sybase mysql postgresql sqlite etc... and xquery is used for xml databases marklogic sedena qexo qizx db etc...

109672
stdout	stderr
it also means you only need to remember one single approach to capturing stdout and stderr or merging them instead of using ipc open3 for external programs and other modules for capturing perl output

109735
min	max
if you really need very quick estimation you can do work breakdown structure with every task for 1-2 days or smaller and after this estimate every task by providing min and max estimated values

109735
min	max
sum of min and max values specify interval for the whole task

109853
memcpy	memset
memcpy memset can get massive performance increases from per-platform optimisation

109861
postgresql	mysql
i ve seen questions for doing the reverse but i have an 800mb postgresql database that needs to be converted to mysql

109877
debian	linux
debian gnu linux testing lenny

109879
ienumerable	icollection
will only serialize ienumerable or icollection collections conforming to specific rules

109879
ienumerable	icollection
the xmlserializer gives special treatment to classes that implement ienumerable or icollection

109879
ienumerable	icollection
a class that implements icollection such as collectionbase in addition to ienumerable must have a public item indexed property indexer in c# that takes an integer and it must have a public count property of type integer

109926
opera	safari
i remember it being wait and pay and nowadays the mobile phones usually have a real browser like opera mini or safari

109979
vmware	esx
at work it s vmware workstation on windows vmware server on windows and vmware esx on bare metal

109989
cvs	svn
so if you want to contribute to a lot of open source projects apache svn cvs etc knowing c would be a requirement

110012
verilog	vhdl
an example way it can work well is this find a fairly simple but necessary component of your software and implement it in verilog vhdl

110030
vmware	bootcamp
i plan on doing some .net development on it using a bootcamp vmware combo since vmware grants access to the bootcamp partition

110030
vmware	bootcamp
what is a recommended size for a bootcamp partition and how much memory should i give vmware

110037
jxtable	jtable
jxtable is an extension of jtable that supports multi-column sorting as well as other functions that jtable doesn t provide

110060
post	get
the default is usually gpc which means get is loaded first then post is loaded overwriting get if there is a collision then cookies are loaded overwriting get post if there is a collision

110060
post	get
for example changing it to cpg makes cookies load first then post then get

110154
postgresql	mysql
sqlite is nice and they have really nice documentation however you should be aware that it is not a full featured sql database like mysql postgresql or the commercial variants

110158
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
when you re done it all compiles down into html and javascript and has very good modern browser support ie6+ firefox opera safari

110189
getter	setter
beans with just getter and setter

110274
vmware	esx
what do i gain and or lose going from vmware workstation to esx

110326
vmware	esx
from my experience moving up the vmware application stack has never been problematic server to workstation to esx

110326
vmware	esx
however i would verify this by exporting all of your vms from the workstation install to an esx install to make sure you re not seeing any weird issues related to running the high-end tool from vmware

110365
multiplying	multiplication
start with your largest prime divisor and multiplying it by itself until a further multiplication would exceed the number n

110418
mouse	keyboard
enable system preference â keyboard mouse â keyboard â use all f1 f2 etc

110491
vsts	tfs
vsts 2008 tfs power toys if you re using tfs

110526
multibyte	htmlspecialchars
even if you use htmlspecialchars string outside of html tags you are still vulnerable to multibyte charset attack vectors

110562
getter	setter
is there a similar way to define a property so that i could invoke it s getter and or setter in the function code

110591
sorting	filtering
i know how to do it in c# sql with a key value table but i don t know how to do it with nhibrenate including filtering and sorting by the user defined fields

110612
getter	setter
using your domain objects in jsps can make your domain harder to refactor and promotes the indiscriminate use of getter and setter hence breaking encapsulation

110617
x86	64bit
it is already installed when you installed 64bit version and all you need to do is run the 32-bit dtexec.exe - the one installed program files x86 microsoft sql server 90 dts binn replace 90 with 100 if you are using ssis 2008

110619
cvs	svn
once you ve set up a central repository you can use a cvs svn style workflow to check in and update

110629
umbraco	dotnetnuke
basically joomla drupal phpnuke dotnetnuke umbraco are all examples of what we don t want

110720
ant	maven
since i ve switched from ant to maven as my build system continuum is the obvious choice

110729
opera	firefox
code for mozilla firefox opera etc

110737
boost	stl
so my guess is to use it for external libraries you won t even touch like the stl c api headers boost whatever

110738
cobertura	checkstyle
the checkstyle and cobertura code coverage plugins are two that we use

110772
int	double
if you want double create getdouble method for int - getinteger

110804
accelerometer	gyroscope
combine gyroscope and accelerometer data

110819
int	double
shorts and int double and floats then the compiler is adding implicit type conversions for each mismatch

110843
lisp	scheme
if you usually program in one language and switch to the other only occasionally then unfortunately you are doomed to write common lisp in scheme or vice versa

110843
lisp	scheme
then at least you will always know whether you are in common lisp or scheme mode

110866
profiler	vtune
this utility is the direct descendant of vtune and provide the best available sampling profiler available

110871
children	parent
the best of these commandlines are then allowed to mate and breed new children which hopefully inherit the best genes from their parent

110887
config	ini
is there a way to read a module s config ini file

110902
valgrind	callgrind
valgrind has already been mentioned but it s especially useful with the callgrind tool

110911
lisp	scheme
i do most of my development in common lisp but there are some moments when i want to switch to scheme while reading lisp in small pieces when i want to play with continuations or when i want to do some scripting in gauche for example

110913
quicksort	radix-sort
know the limitations of the algorithm you choose a radix-sort quicksort for 10 elements to be sorted might not be the best choice

110954
post	get
so my alltime suggestion would be to use post instead of get

110956
post	get
get passes data in the url post passes the same data in the http content both are exactly the same from a security standpoint that is completely insecure unless you do something about it yourself like using https

110956
post	get
from an http standard viewpoint get requests should not change the site and browsers spiders are much more likely to make get requests on their own without the user actually clicking something then post requests

110961
nant	cruisecontrol
as are cruisecontrol and nant

111014
post	get
both get and post have their place

111014

enlightenment v16 is actually very lightweight compared to gnome kde these days and it is very configurable although nothing seems to be as configurable as fvwm florian s suggestions are all good but if you re used to gnome kde then you probably won t like ratpoison xmonad

116118
profiler	yourkit
i would recommend that you profile your application with a good profiler like the netbeans 6 profiler or yourkit to make sure you don t have any memory leaks

116142
post	get
basically i m wondering if there is anything similar to either a get set template or post get set hook with class scope

116154
getter	setter
i don t like ddx because it s old and it s not flexible and i cannot use getter and setter

116163
pascal	delphi
delphi v7 - object pascal standard tquery object name query1

116170
accessor	properties
no you cannot auto properties are a shortcut for an explicit accessor to a private field

116170
put	get
if you want to put custom logic you must write get and set explicitly

116210
gif	png
indexed png less than 256 colors is actually always smaller than gif so i use that most of the time

116235
hl7	x12
interface languages like x12 and hl7 existed for sure but with xml people could tailor it to their individual aix or as 400 systems

116261
put	get
preferably it should be able to run on windows without to much hassle ever tried to put up apache+python+svn+trac on the same windows 2003 server and get them all to run together

116290
postgresql	mysql
written in php works with mysql or postgresql

116306
min	max
you can also derive from this class numericupdowntoolstripitem which initialize the control property with the custom control and can populate next properties from the hosted control min max value - for example

116342
autoresetevent	manualresetevent
if you want one thread to wait till another thread reach a point in execution you might want to use waitevents autoresetevent or manualresetevent

116448
put	get
you need to put any proprietary code in your back-end where client machines can t get at it

116461
gif	png
png is a 100 replacement for gif files and is supported by all web browsers you are likely to encounter

116461
gif	png
virtually all browsers support single-bit transparency in png files the type of transparency offered by the gif format

116461
gif	png
if your png files are coming out larger than equivalent gif files it is almost certainly because your source image has more than 256 colors

116461
gif	png
gif files are indexed to a maximum palette of 256 colors while png files in most graphics programs are saved by default in a 24-bit lossless format

116461
gif	png
if file size is more important than accurate colors save the file as an 8-bit indexed png and it should be equivalent to gif or better

116461
gif	png
it is possible to hack a gif file to have more than 256 colors using a combination of animation frames with do-not-replace flags and multiple palettes but this approach has been virtually forgotten about since the advent of png

116469
punctuation	words
for each words in the file we are to clear any punctuation in the words ex can t would end up as can and that--to would end up as that obviously with out the quotes quotes were used just to specify what the example was

116528
client-side	server-side
if your dataset contains more than a few hundred kb you are likely to end-up with client-side or server-side http timeouts considering default settings

116578
scons	autotools
scons has a configuring mechanism that will do a lot of what autotools do without as much complexity and is pretty darn portable although not as portable as autotools

116627
notepad++	jedit
for others ides i have used jedit for little java notepad++ still for some scripting and short test code runs

116632
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
i used to use opera and firefox as my standards compliant browsers but i ve recently become much enamored with safari

116632
google-chrome	safari
edited to add google-chrome is coming close to taking safari s place but that print screen thing is still the deciding factor

116663
nemerle	boo
nemerle and boo are my personal favorites for such things

116664
scons	autotools
the autotools uses a multi-stage process that s relatively easy to break and scons just feels weird to me

116705
salt	md5
md5 or sha in combination with a randomly generated salt value for every entry

116707
hash	salt	hash	md5	salt	md5
use a strong crytographic hash function like md5 or sha1 but make sure you use a good salt otherwise you ll be susceptible to rainbow table attacks

116715
postgresql	mysql
that said i use temporary tables in postgresql for a number of purposes and most will translate to mysql

116730
opera	safari
don t get me wrong here - i m not trying to dismiss the users of opera safari or any other browser

116739
pbkdf2	salt	pbkdf2	hash	hash	salt
sha all variants is now trivially breakable and best practice is now as of jan 2013 to use a key-stretching hash like pbkdf2 or ideally a ram intensive one like bcrypt and to add a per-user salt too

116739
hash	md5
sha-256 uses 64 characters in the database but with an index on the column that isn t a problem and it is a proven hash and more reliable than md5 and sha-1

116739
hash	salt
you often use the hash of username password salt or similar rather than just the password but if you play with this then you make it even harder to run a dictionary attack

116753
hash	salt
add a unique salt to the hash password value store the salt value in the db

116753
salt	md5
when a unique salt is used the benefit of using a more secure algorithm than sha1 or md5 is not really necessary at that point it s an incremental improvement whereas using a salt is a monumental improvement

116767
hash	md5
the ready availability of cloud computing and powerful parallel-processor graphics cards means that passwords up to 8 or 9 characters hash as md5 or sha1 are now trivially breakable

116767
pbkdf2	hash
a key-stretching algorithm like pbkdf2 applies a quicker hash like sha512 thousands of times typically causing the hash generation to take 1 5 of a second or so

116860
pbkdf2	salt	pbkdf2	hash	hash	salt
pbkdf2 for example uses salt large number of iterations and a good hash function

116873
pop-up	dialog
by noninasive i mean don t pop-up an alert or modal dialog box thereby forcing the user to click something

117010
scons	automake
automake or scons are quite complex and are worth your time only if you intend to release your code to a wide audience

117097
haskell	ocaml
you can look at haskell ml ocaml etc

117146
int	chars
you can call int fstream get which will read a single chars from the stream

117159
post	get
if you want to post some cleansed ddl and data and an example of what you are trying to get out of the db we may be able to give you a less subjective answer

117176
daemon	cron	jobs	cron
i d recomment taking a look at ll-xist this library contains large amount of life-saving code like cron jobs helper daemon framework and what is not interesting to you but is really great object-oriented xsl ll-xist itself

117274
kde	gnome
customizing the root menu is also easy much easier than doing so in kde or gnome which i never did figure out adequately

117332
int	boolean
c++ is pass-by-value by default so the function gets copies of those int and boolean

117349
try-catch	exception-handling
either you expect exception-handling in certain situations in which case you write a try-catch block around that code and handle them or there is an unexpected error in which case you should prefer your application to abort or retry or fail

117407
serializable	deserialization
you can use xml serializable deserialization by yourself

117451
folder	directory
i believe that to do it the way you are hoping to you d have to have each version of the file in a separate directory in the repository and check it out into your source folder

117475
getter	setter
the properties to read write have public getter and setter

117477
restructuredtext	textile
a while ago i came across a python library that formats regular text to html similar to markdown restructuredtext and textile just that it had no syntax at all

117481
versioning	upgrade
so i d like to upgrade to a more recent versioning but the new one must not break any existing scripts

117547
draggable	droppable
called whenever a draggable is released over the droppable and the droppable is accepts it

117547
draggable	droppable
the callback gets three parameters the draggable element the droppable element and the event

117547
draggable	droppable
my question is does anyone have a good example on how to reference the draggable element and the droppable element in this callback javascript function

117556
folder	directory
that will make a copy of your repository on another directory without the .svn folder

117564
cpu	processors
it will tell you the number of cpu cycles executed since the processors was booted

117568
post	get
if possible it s best to attempt sql injection via http get and post requests

117674
vim	emacs
use the ide you like best emacs vim vc++ express code blocks bloodshed - again whatever

117678
ubuntu	linux
this is with ubuntu linux 1gb ram

117707
width	height
the key thing here is to turn the anchor tag into a block element so height and width work

117741
boost	stl
become familiar with the stl and boost and use their facilities whenever possible rolling your own

117774
entity-relationship	diagram
there was also some configuration to get used to since i don t work with java much but the end result was what i was looking for on open-source replacement for visio s entity-relationship diagram

117811
min	max
if the array is sorted as in your example i would define buckets containing a min and a max

117811
min	max
initialize create a bucket with a min and a max equal to the first value

117811
min	max
at the end you will have a set of buckets with a min and a max in each

117811
min	max
if the min is the same as the max print a single number ie in your example the first bucket would have a min and a max of 1

117834
opera	safari
safari 1.3+ opera 9.2+ konquerer and ie8 all support it at least to some degree

117849
dictionary	map
you would also be surprised how many people struggle to implement a map dictionary type data-structure

117900
post	get
i assume i will get one wrong incomplete answer here and than my post will sink into nothingness as usual but either way thanks in advance

117918
min	max
general how do you find min and max from an array n size with just 3 n 2 comparisons

117920
pop-up	dialog
after i dismiss the the dialog by canceling i get another pop-up like the one below

118016
min	max
in addition the second syntax is more flexible if there are further aggregates which may be added in the future in addition to count like min some_scalar max avg etc

118043
hide	show
i know you can just use css to hide the div or silverlight plugin but is there a way to instantiate a silverlight component app using javascript that doesn t show any ui element at all

118109
int	chars
a struct that starts with 4 chars and then has a 4 byte int would be useless if read on another system where gcc decided that it should re-arrange the struct members

118137
hide	show
then to show the whole multi-part query you can either show five circles with some combination of union and intersection or else combine each parenthesis and then hide the detail making the results into a new circle to combine with other elements

118235
wordpress	phpbb
anyway iâ m sure other people have tackled this and the solution is probably applicable to many apps similar to wordpress drupal phpbb phpmyadmin etc.

118251
width	height
in your javascript set the font size and attributes that you are trying to measure put your string in the div then read the current width and height of the div

118265
converter	multibinding
multibinding converter staticresource converter

118265
converter	multibinding
in xaml create instance of your converter and add it to your multibinding s converter property

118265
converter	multibinding
in general whenever you have to map multiple property values to one other property you ll have to use multibinding and converter

118325
google-chrome	firefox
i use firefox with ie tab and google-chrome

118325
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
firefox with ie tab because those are the two browsers with the most market share and google-chrome because it is one of the few windows browsers that use webkit meaning it should display similarly to safari

118340
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i find that if you stick to standards compliant markup and don t use anything too unusual it will render fine in firefox 2 3 and safari google-chrome and usually fine in ie7 8

118342
cvs	rcs
rcs file data cvs dps build.xml v

118373
radiobuttonlist	checkboxlist
depending on what other attributes you put on a checkboxlist or radiobuttonlist or whatever asp.net will render the output using different structures

118377
getter	setter
from my understanding you should use synchronized on both the getter and the setter methods and that is sufficient

118388
getter	setter
if you have 20 getter and setter and they re all synchronized you may be creating a synchronization bottleneck

118436
versioning	upgrade
it ended up that we had so many workarounds while using the development versioning of modules that it was a pain every time we upgrade modules or core itself

118487
rss	feed
1 rss feed and 2 manual entries

118503
des	aes
yes purely asymmetric encryption is much slower than symmetric cyphers like des or aes which is why real applications use hybrid cryptography the expensive public-key operations are performed only to encrypt and exchange an encryption key for the symmetric algorithm that is going to be used for encrypting the real message

118507
ubuntu	debian
if you install in debian ubuntu package name python-zsi the documentation is in usr share doc python-zsi in a pair of pdfs you can find in there

118610

118655
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i m far from being a css expert but this works for me in ie firefox safari and google-chrome

118680
cpython	ironpython
if beautifulsoup doesn t work on ironpython it s because ironpython doesn t implement the whole python language the same way cpython does

118680
cpython	ironpython
beautifulsoup is pure-python no c-extensions so the only problem is the compatibility of ironpython with cpython in terms of python source code.there shouldn t be one but if there is the error will be obvious no module named ... no method named ... etc.

118697
rss	feed
i found this blog post that describes how to add style to your rss feed

it shows virt res and shr by default on debian linux

118740
komodo	notepad++
edit as you ve noted in your reply the issue is with trailing whitespace - i don t know notepad++ too well but most modern editors designed for coding have a strip trailing whitespace on save option i know komodo does

118793
post	get
i would suggest you spend time reading jeremy millers build your own cab series of post to get a feel for what you might like need to implement as your application becomes more complex

118884
opera	firefox
i have noticed that some browsers in particular firefox and opera are very zealous in using cached copies of .css and .js files even between browser sessions

119031
kde	gnome
is there a standard format for kde gnome etc

119040
asp.net-mvc	html.actionlink
going by the asp.net-mvc preview 4 code i have in front of me the overload for html.actionlink you are using is this one

119062
kde	gnome
for gnome and kde you would probably want to include a desktop file with your app that defines how it will be launched

119128
x86	64bit
here s an example using typical settings for an x86 processor all used 32 and 64bit modes

119132
x86	64bit
also a library may be compiled under x86 with 32-bit ints and you may be comparing its components on a 64bit process would would give you a different result if you were doing this by hand

119190
ant	maven
i recommend using something like maven or ant as a standardized build system

119209
tunnel	vpn
the clincher for us was the speed the lack thereof of vss over vpn and low bandwidth hotel networks on the road and the problems of trying to tunnel through firewalls so that two teams at two different sites could quickly securely and reliably work from the same code repository

119283
firefox	safari
interesting feature it can emulate safari ie or firefox browsers when rendering

119295
single-sign-on	shibboleth
clarification we don t have a single-sign-on server shibboleth setup yet

119326

realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
however how would you unit-test for example a memory allocator think malloc realloc free

119461
cunit	cppunit
my unit tests usually don t use tools like cunit cppunit and similar software

119465
vsto	add-in
in my case i did this because my excel add-in used vsto and visual studio doesn t support xla files directly

119478
inherited	subclassing
we ve inherited a wcf web service that has a custom messageformatter that constructs a custom message subclassing in the serializereply method

119478
put	get
every way we tried we managed to get the ws-addressing headers into the actual response but could never get the ws-security header in actually we were just trying to put in a security header with timestampid and created expires elements

119508
mouse	keyboard
i want to create a keyboard and mouse hook which will be started as a windows service

119534
getter	setter
to me that excludes auto-generated getter and setter but includes hand-written ones that contain some logic

119538
int	double
the lua version posted above is faster but relies on the truncation of double to a 32-bit result therefore it requires the x87 unit to be set to double precision and cannot be adapted for double to 64-bit int conversion

119545
post	get
for example a get request to products edit 45 would display the product editor whereas a post to the same url would update the product

119595
cvs	svn
beware clearcase is file-centric not repository centric like svn or cvs

119680
ironruby	ironpython
look into ironpython and ironruby -- these will allow you to easily interoperate with c#

119721
ironruby	ironpython
i think this is possible with ironpython and ironruby as well

119728
cvs	svn
we used viewvc for browsing both cvs and svn repositories but since we switched to fisheye we finally have a really good solution for code browsing and examination

119733
postgresql	mysql
this does not happen with mysql or postgresql

119738
maven	pom.xml
if you use maven to build you can define your dependencies in the pom.xml file

119744
ironruby	ironpython
the function would check whether the user has associated any scripts with given points and if so runs the script by invoking ironpython ironruby with optionally given parameters

119873

but seriously sign up to relevant mailing lists and rss feed so that you can be updated as things happen

119918
rss	feed
2 get some rss feed news letters to c# sites such as c# corner or channel 9

119995
maven	pom.xml
i really don t see what is the big deal with getting maven + eclipse to work as long as you don t have to change the pom.xml too much

120046
websphere	ibm
i recommend a combination of the sap business connector which provides an easy interface for receiving sending rfc calls from to the sap side and the ibm websphere java library which allows easy interaction with websphere

120052
cvs	svn
that said it s possible that starting from a blank slate with git might actually be easier - my vcs experience is all with centralised version control cvs svn perforce... and part of my ongoing

int	double
where type is int double long long or whatever describes the alignment requirements

120091
post	get
i have then implemented a new project from scratch based on this blog post and get stuck with the same performance issues

120140
ant	maven
on one hand i think that everyone should be free to use the set of developemnt tools they are most productive with as long as all source artifacts are stored in version control and the build script say ant or maven ensures standards compliance by specifying exactly which jdk to use which versions of which third party libraries to depend upon running style checks checkstyle and running unit tests etc

120140
ant	maven
on the other hand i think so many people use the same tools eclipse and often it is much better to have some things standardised at design time instead of build time - for example checkstyle is far more useful as an eclipse plugin than as an ant or maven task - that it is better to standardise on the set of development tools and a common set of plugins

120156
width	height
i also ommitted most of error checking whether given width height is out of bounds

120158
post	get

lisp	scheme
let me list a few important details about how metaprogramming works in lisp or scheme or slate or pick your favorite dynamic language

120284
lisp	prolog
add prolog like backtracking to the language that very seamlessly integrates with normal lisp code see screamer

opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
window.onerror catches all errrors in ie and most errors in firefox but does nothing in safari and opera

120657
stdout	stderr
in case it matters i m grabbing a pipe to stderr for processing it but ignoring stdout and stdin

120666
getter	setter
as a result you will get a bunch of unit tests which are worth nothing there will be unit test for every single class available and they will test setter and getter

120716
put	get
i put it there and didn t get errors in opera 9.5 ff3 and ie7

equals	gethashcode
equals uses hash code of pair class but take a look at the definition of gethashcode it just a combination of pair members hash codes - it s has nothing to do with equality of items

120829
freebsd	linux
once upon a time i did this - installing a freebsd on x86- although i had some linux knowledge already at that time and it took me 3 hours mainly that much time because i was working on another machine in parallel

120832
jruby	mri
it probably should complain that this does not make sense but when n.times is called in mri it returns an enumerator whereas jruby complains that it needs a block

120838
postgresql	mysql
it supports oracle postgresql and mysql

120876
superclass	subclassing
what are the c++ rules for calling the superclass constructor from a subclassing one

it has support for logging to console file recordstore canvas form bluetooth a serial port bluetooth ir usb socket incl ssl udp syslog mms sms e-mail or to amazon s3

120916
superclass	subclassing
if you want to call a superclass constructor with an argument you must use the subclassing s constructor initialization list

120925
vsto	add-in
this was with a vsto workbook saved as an xla file which in some ways is more flexible than a pure vsto add-in

120925

121059
int	chars
what is the best way to divide a 32 bit int into four unsigned chars in c#

121100
hash	salt
you can store a password salt and hash although the value of doing so can be disputed but that doesn t work for phone numbers

121107
int	chars
converting the int to bytes reversing the byte-array for the correct order and then getting the ascii chars representation from it

121119
mouse	keyboard
on my current keyboard which is not a split this means the wide enter key the arrow keys and the number pad all jut out to the right before i have space for my mouse

121154
mouse	keyboard
i don t know of any keyboards like that but what might help is a keyboard with a built-in touchpad like for a laptop that you can use instead of your other mouse for some of your mousing small adjustments quick taps to click etc to avoid having to go out to the mouse

121177
min	max
we essentially created a full product product attribute definition system data types min max occurrences default values required flags usage scenarios etc. the system worked ultimately but came with a significant cost in overhead and performance materialized views to visualize products custom smart components to represent and validate data entry ui for product definition another smart component to represent the product instance s customizable attributes on the order line blahblahblah

you cant do this for a normal post get however you can get to this info if you use an xmlhttp call and use the getresponseheader

121246

i move my keyboard and mouse around i change my position and the position of those two

121246

121545
pecl	pear
my suggestion is to start with assuming pear pecl modules and get the rest of the code done

121547
pecl	pear
code it initially using pear pecl and if you get people asking for a non pear pecl version start coding your own alternatives then for such a version

once you understand the innards of whatever you re trying to replace you may want to switch to the pear pecl version so that you re not wasting time reimplementing what has already been implemented.

121619
folder	directory
unc shared folder and no replication has many downsides especially if iis is going to use unc paths as home directory for sites

121620
int	double	int	chars
primitive data byte chars int double and arrays of them byte ... are erasable by writing new random content into them

121620
hash	md5
if we talk about passwords it s better to use crypto-strong hash functions md5 sha1 ... and never ever work with passwords in clear text

121627
int	chars
edit to comment on some of the previous answers the jvm could relocate your objects in memory without erasing their previous locations so even chars bytes int and other erasable data types aren t an answer if you really want to make sure that no sensitive information is stored in the memory managed by the jvm or swapped on to the hard drive

121651
pyopengl	pyglet
i realise this doesn t exactly answer your question but there s a library called squirtle that will render svg files using either pyglet or pyopengl

google-chrome	safari
caveat this technique does not work for focus changes caused by tabbing through fields with the keyboard and does not work at all in google-chrome or safari

121708
google-chrome	firefox
this should work in most modern browsers tested in google-chrome ie and firefox with the caveat that google-chrome does not set focus on buttons that are clicked vs

gridview	rowdatabound
i am trying to do some dynamic stuff with my gridview so i have wired up some code to the rowdatabound event

121736
photoshop	paint.net

121873
put	get
i suspect that you can get rid of the outer query and put distinct on the inner but i m not sure

121882
cassini	iis
the first one works because cassini is handling all requests the second one doesn t work because iis is looking for that directory and it doesn t exist instead of the .net framework running the code you have

121886

i want to be able to quickly check whether i both have sudo access and my passwd is already authenticated

122276
sudo	passwd
when they run my script i want it to use sudo permissions without prompting for a passwd if that is possible and otherwise to fall back to asking for the root passwd because they might not have sudo access

122305
post	get
if you can t get answers from those users on that or there s nothing suspect it might be worth creating a special little test script to write a cookie and post the result back to you on the next page-load

122344
mouse	keyboard
another thing that helped me much more than replacing the keyboard is replacing the mouse

122357

setuptools distutils will work for installation and your program may be running in a virtualenv where your pythonpath is completely user-local so it shouldn t assume use of the system site-packages directly either

122390
rss	feed
the purpose of an rss feed is to allow the easy transmission of content to places outside your site

122390

122671
int	chars
this is java and int rather than chars but you can easily adapt it.

122674
int	chars
chars in c have numeric values that happen to be in order so you just treat your chars like int

122687
int	chars
my first idea was to set the httpresponse.status property but it requires the chars before the first space to be an int

122687
google-chrome	firefox
i have tested the browser response of both internet explorer firefox and google-chrome i use google-chrome as my primary browser and firefox as secondary

122723
httprequest	httpresponse
an httpresponse is something that is sent back to the client in response to an httprequest

122811

an alternative though more effort would be to use something like virtualbox or the free version of vmware and run a light-weight linux distro where you could use the loopback mounting feature and expose it via samba as a windows-share

122840
haskell	ocaml
makes certain things harder than it has to be but that s not something you re going to miss unless you re coming from nemerle ocaml haskell or something along those lines

123037
hide	show
i ve had to work with divs and iframes when creating a javascript menu that should show overtop dropdown boxes and listboxes -- other menu implementations just hide these items whose default behavior in ie6 is to show on top of any div no matter the z-index

123041
comparator	comparable
for example the integer class in java implements the comparable interface so if you only saw the method header public class string implements comparable you would know that it contains a comparator method

123043
width	height
however you can get away with just taking the max width and max height of your skewed rectangle

123053
subclass	abstract-class
using an abstract-class as an interface is possible because every base class by definition defines an interface that all of its subclasses should honor it should be possible to use a subclass instead of a base class

123076
metaphone	soundex
edit double metaphone was specifically designed to be better than soundex and work in languages other than english

pascal	delphi
delphi 7 onwards technically object pascal or delphi language i guess

123244
subclass	abstract-class	implements	extends
an abstract-class in java is that a subclass cannot extends multiple base classes but it can implements multiple interfaces

123268

123401
hide	show
show it if it has a class of hide and hide if it does not have a class of hide

123451

spaces	delimiter
here s a regex for a 7 or 10 digit number with extensions allowed delimiter are spaces dashes or periods

123670
getter	setter
first of all setter and getter are an indication of bad oo

123670
getter	setter
secondly each object you have should be a world in itself--generally if you are going to use setter and getter they should return fairly safe independent objects

123670
getter	setter
so saying should setter and getter return something immutable doesn t make too much sense

123724
strncpy	malloc
strndup requires _gnu_source so maybe you need to make your own strndup with malloc and strncpy

123773
inherited	properties
what bugs me about this is that implementation inherited means code reuse one of the most important properties of oo languages

123855
redmine	trac
i started with trac but i found the mercurial support and the administrative interface for everything to be much better in redmine

123909

however i want to get this working in a c# excel add-in using vsto 2005 se can any one help

124177
ssl	https
the only way to do this is to use ssl tls https

124187
ssl	https
for example if you want to protect the parameters sent by your java app to your server from an attacker who has access to the communication channel you should consider communicating with the server via tls ssl https in your case and the likes

124190
int	boolean
create a boolean that indicates whether or not your int is valid or create a new type that wraps the boolean and int together

124226

124237
disk	ram
another note i m not thrilled about the idea of simply throwing hardware at the problem adding ram cpu power disk speed

124248
rsa	aes
so for instance you d use a secure random number generator to generate a 128 bit random key for aes and encrypt those 16 bytes with rsa

124248
rsa	aes
algorithms like rsa are much less user-friendly than aes

124248
rsa	aes
that is actually not the case with rsa which is --- more so than aes --- just a math equation

124248
rsa	aes
block crypto algorithms like aes do suffer from this problem too but without a pki aes is no less safe than rsa

124262
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
fetching an arrays with mysql_fetch_array lets you loops through the result set via either a foreach loops or a for-loop

mvp	presenter
i used a home-grown mvp model-view-presenter pattern and the absolute most important thing to allow the presenter controller in your case to be used in a winforms app was to not reference anything to do with system.web

124585
post	get
the purpose of this post isn t necessarily to refactor the code this isn t even the code i am using but instead to get input on whether or not this is a good idea

124591
inherited	subclassing
the way to prevent implementation inherited is in the programming language since the beginning you should use the final keyword on the class declaration and this way you are prohibiting subclassing

124615
getter	setter
lets say i have a class that stores user information complete with getter and setter and it is populated with data from an xml file

124638
udp	tcp
i found an article on getting active tcp udp connections on a machine

124641

124835
cvs	svn
you can do this with most systems cvs svn git and so on

124844
integer	unsigned
usually i do c and c++ work so my gut reaction is to use an unsigned integer field as a set of bits which can be flipped.

124861
hex	binary
using this you can create an arbitrary number of bit fields that mysql is happy to treat as binary hex or decimal values however you need

124896
post	get	post	put	put	get
rest requires you to define resources named via uri s and transactions based on the canonical crud rules get post put and delete

124930
put	get
can t you just get the image data and put it on the clipboard directly

apache	lighttpd
if iis doesn t fit your requirements you should choose another web server such as apache with mod_mono or lighttpd

124951
webclient	webrequest
you can use webrequest or webclient class to load data via proxy and pass obtained response stream to xmldocument

124956

125130
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
the -moz ones are firefox specific the -webkit ones are for safari google-chrome and a few other browsers that use that rendering engine

125131
firefox	safari
those are for firefox the ones labeled -moz-border and for safari -webkit-border

125133
google-chrome	safari
the -webkit ones will only work in webkit-based browsers like safari google-chrome or webkit

firefox	safari
afaik this method works in all cases in firefox and safari

125379
int	boolean
adding an int to a boolean

125398
pop-up	dialog
don t pop-up a dialog box announcing an error - do whatever recovery you re going to do anyway or whatever is possible

125491
put	get
it doesn t get around the one-use typedef unless you put that in a header which is always an option but it makes the resulting code shorter by one iterator

the interrupt is a physical signal in the processors that tells the cpu to store its current state and jump to interrupt or exception handler code

125586
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
one of the most impressive is a javascript implementation using the canvas component implemented in firefox safari opera etc

125609
versioning	upgrade
we then use home-grown tools to generate the schema upgrade and reference data upgrade scripts that are required to go from versioning x of the database to versioning x + 1

125615
ubuntu	debian
both mandriva red hat based and ubuntu debian based have packages for the boost libriaries

125639
jobs	cron
the other nice thing is that your service infrastructure is static like your rc scripts cron jobs etc. since they point to the application directory and it doesn t change

125640
versioning	upgrade
however at times system upgrade often breaks other programs when there is a versioning mismatch between the shared dll files and the program that requires them

125655
versioning	upgrade
it is a good approach to save database scripts into versioning control with change scripts so that you can upgrade any one database you have

125708
rss	feed
since only my team is using the installation of laconica that we have i take the rss for the public feed and i integrated that into sharepoint

125763

now if this is a comparegenerator it really should either return a boolean true or false or a int 0 or 1 lets use the former

125804
haskell	scheme	lisp	scheme
every programmer should have some experience with a modern jit d oo language c# java a lower-level simpler language c fortran etc a very high level interpreted language python ruby etc and a functional language scheme lisp haskell etc

125806
joystick	keyboard	mouse	keyboard	mouse	joystick
i have actually a fairly similar problem in that i need to be able to capture input for mouse keyboard joystick and i d also like to avoid sdl if at all possible

125806
joystick	keyboard	mouse	keyboard	mouse	joystick
the point is to capture mouse motion keyboard press release mouse clicks and potentially joystick handling for a game

125984
vsto	add-in
unfortunately you can t define a udf in a managed vsto excel add-in

126027
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
in a real case i wouldnt use timer i would have an arrays or xml object to iterate through with a for-loop regardless it works great and basically once you hit the end of your loops if i length - 1 have it call the functionality that starts the actual pre-loading now that we have our total

126027
for-loop	arrays
now we iterate through the arrays or xml object again but this time we do it only once each asset has loaded not in a for-loop

126056
public	protected
some methods will be left private and tested implicitly as part of unit tests for the public protected methods

126062

126067
opera	google-chrome
if you want to update the page in the already opened browser or use a browser of your choice always ie6 instead of opera or google-chrome then you ll have to do some homework but it s still quite easy

126125
printf	strlen
use only printf printf and str functions strcat strlen and of course their wide char corespondents wcslen...

126138
outputstream	inputstream
it doesn t appear to be possible to get a channel from an inputstream or outputstream filestream has a getchannel method but that doesn t help here

puts	gets
so you send it autorelease instead which puts it in the autorelease pool which is emptied once control gets back to the program s event loop

126254
width	height
set the s width and height to those px values so they re no longer relative

126254

with your preferred cell width height

126311
width	height
assign the class to both your label and textbox and you should not get width height changes when switching control thanks to the display block property

width	height
in that case i would suggest ignoring height problems just set the width to be consistent and always show a 3-4 lines textbox for editing

126366
stdout	stderr
as you said the solution outlined in this answer is the traditional way of reading both stdout and stderr from a process

126378

one technique is to use a well-known hash algorithm say md5 or sha-1 and use only the first 32 bits of the result

126392
put	get
in addition this is the most general solution it scales best in the future as you add more keys it is easy to code the sql to get the data out and the database will be able to optimise the query better than you would imagine i wouldn t put effort into prematurely optimising this case unless it was proven to be a bottleneck in testing later on in which case you could consider the next two options below

126417
dictionary	map
using a dictionary you can map almost any input to some other value object function

126423
stdout	stderr
if your use case allows for combining both stdout and stderr of the process in question you need only one thread otherwise two are needed

and perhaps they can automatically inline some trivial functions like simple getter setter

132776
inline	inlining
however there is no guarantee that your all candidates for inlining will actually be inline by the compiler

132776
inline	inlining
some compilers vc2005 have an option for aggressive inlining and you wouldn t need to specify the inline keyword when using that option

tapestry and wicket are two more modern ones haven t used them though

132790
button	checkbox
use a publish checkbox button and when the user interacts with the page in a way that causes them to navigate away ask them if they want to publish if that box is not checked button not clicked

132841
solaris	bsd
personally i prefer solaris or a bsd for stability

132854
disk	ram
the library was developed with the express purpose of being able to limit the size of the data pushed to the server to avoid exactly the type of situation you describe - effectively a dos attack by filling up ram or disk

132854
post	put
with the rmiio library the server side gets to decide how much data it is willing to pull where with http put and post the client gets to make that decision including the rate at which it pushes

132935
disk	ram
one possible problem is that having one database for each user will use disk space and ram very inefficiently and as the user base grows the benefit of using a light and fast database engine will be lost completely

132963
erd	diagram
this really throws dbas off until you point out that you can derive an erd from a class diagram by sliding all the arrows the to the other end of the lines.

133002
post	get	post	put	put	get
all of this is using the blaze proxy since it involves get put delete and post calls

133147
ssl	https
https ssl

133155
for-loop	arrays
the second for-loop is pretty obscure it s basically splitting the arrays into a head the first element and a tail all other elements

133189
min	max
it s an apache module that lets you easily specify how many instances min and max of your app servers you want to have running

133213
hash	salt
using hash passwords the default will guarantee security depending on a known reversals of the hashing strategy of rngcryptoserviceprovider class and b access to the database to compromise the randomly generated salt

133252
listview	gridview	gridview	detailsview	gridview	formview	formview	detailsview
if the server-side control is within a databound control listview gridview formview detailsview then the syntax is

133271
inline	inlining
if a function is static thus not exported anyway and only called once within your code and you never use a pointer to the function chances are good that gcc will decide to inline it automatically as it will have no negative impact the binary won t get bigger by inlining it only once

133348
findwindow	showwindow
i m not a delphi expert but if you can invoke win32 apis you can use findwindow and showwindow to minimize a window even if it does not belong to your app

133364
cstring	bstr
cstring std basic_string std string bstr or ccombstr

133412
post	get
i will play some more with the designer support to ensure i fully understand it all then get a blog post up

133426
inline	inlining
as has been suggested in previous answers use of the inline keyword can make code faster by inlining function calls often at the expense of increased executables

133427
ssl	https
use ssl otherwise known as https

133446
filtering	grouping
ensure the user and workspace filtering are cleared and you ll get a list of all files grouping by changelist and client spec

133468
cstring	bstr
cstring bstr and ccombstr are not standard and not portable

133530
findwindow	showwindow
you can use findwindow to find the application handle and showwindow to minimize it

133613
hash	md5
if that s your case then you can just store a hash signature md5 instead and compare it with the signature of the entered password

133671
post	put
the problem is when i put 01 01 2009 into the textbox and the post does not validate due to other data being input incorrectly

133677
post	get
i don t think it s good to post complete codes for node balancing algorithms here since they get quite big

133691
width	height
i am looking for an elegent way to set the chart control s along with other control s width height based on the screen browser size

133720
ssl	https
are you sure you are connecting your https client to the server port that talks over https tls ssl rather than http

133801
client-side	server-side
sounds like you want to resize a server-side dynamic image based on a client-side value

133801
post	get
you can get the full cross browser technical list of which javascript elements to use at quirksmode.org but you ll still need to figure out how to write the script yourself. then post that size back to the server set the control with this new size then render it to the client as usual

133851
gmail	hotmail
i found a very nice one for yahoo gmail and hotmail

133872
trac	bugzilla
but you are going to need external tools for tracking progress and bugs bugzilla yoxel trac gantt diagram tools mylyn for eclipse a blog whatever

133890
ienumerable	icollection
the xmlserializer gives special treatment to classes that implement ienumerable or icollection

133890
ienumerable	icollection
a class that implements icollection such as collectionbase in addition to ienumerable must have a public item indexed property indexer in c# that takes an integer and it must have a public count property of type integer

133903
width	height
once the release the control i then reposition the table cell height or width according to where they moved the new control

133964
int	boolean
i have a database column wantsreply that logically holds a boolean bit but is unfortunately implemented as an int

133979
post	get
make the xmlhttprequest request yourself passing post into the open method instead of get

134125
width	height
the width of every div is fixed but the height isn t

134138
prepare	execute
if there are no other restrictions on the username a prepare statement would still make sure that the above embedded query doesn t execute at the time of insert and store the value correctly in the database

134305
post	get
just enable it as an extension for some reason it wouldn t work with ze_extension on my windows machine setup your php.ini with xdebug.profiler_enable_trigger on and call your normal urls with xdebug_profile 1 as either a get or a post variable to profile that very request

134318
getter	setter
when a getter or setter is called the interceptor would check to see if the property exists in either collection and then take appropriate action

134346
hash	md5
using a non-reversible hash such as md5 is much more secure and you can store the hash value as clear text

134359
pop-up	dialog
if the program loses focus for any reason call comes in user switches programs user hits the windows button then i want a pop-up dialog box to cover the puzzle and the timer to stop

134359
pop-up	dialog
when the user closes the pop-up dialog the timer can start up again

134424
submit	submission
perhaps i want to allow users to be able to submit as many line items as they want when submission an invoice form

134436
packets	multicast
if the interface can receive unicast traffic properly and a network analyzer wireshark for instance shows that the multicast joins are being sent and the inbound multicast packets are correctly formed i would suspect a driver issue

134477
perl	tcl
just be careful so you don t ultimately drive the move from a weird mixture of batch files excel matlab and tcl to a weird mixture of perl python and whatever other language catches your interest next

134551
rss	feed
i don t know about eclipse but for visual studio if someone really wanted this they could easily add the so rss feed for the start page news channel so the so question list appeared in the start page or even better narrow it down with a tag like for c#

134555
hide	show
you can then show or hide your puzzle in each timer tick

134582
rss	feed
you have the rss plugin for eclipse to read the stackoverflow feed

134597
versioning	upgrade
you may also tie the versioning numbers to an update policy...changes to a require the user to purchase an upgrade license whereas other changes do not

134653
ubuntu	linux
i was unable to reproduce the problem on linux ubuntu mono despite using the same code on the same conditions multiple same executable running simultaneously release mode etc.

134677
put	get
this tryparse method was introduced in .net 2.0 to get over the fact that xxx.parse will through an exception if conversion fails and you have to put in try catch around the statement

134726
avr	microcontroller
another very clean and even simpler architecture is avr which is an 8-bit architecture used in microcontroller from atmel

134744
ant	maven
if you move to an ant or maven for you maven fans then you can automate the jar building very nicely and also use it outside of eclipse in an automated build environment

134814
hide	show
this means you can hide content in the print version which is show in the screen version or hide content in the screen version which you want to show up when printing.all you do is apply display none to the appropriate sections in the appropriate stylesheet

134882
git-rebase	undo
does anybody know how to easily undo a git-rebase

134906
jobs	cron
is there a command or an existing script that will let me view all of a nix system s scheduled cron jobs at once

134972
versioning	upgrade
there was a huge explosion when we tried to label our next release a major versioning above the previous one because marketing sales thought our current customers would be upset that we have a new major versioning so soon and they need to upgrade

134999
bazaar	git
bazaar and other distributed tools such as git mercurial darcs and the like are ideal because you can have your repository stored in multiple places ie

135009
division	modulo
the divmod function is a convenient way to perform both division and modulo

135118
inherited	properties
try using firebug or chrome s inspect element feature right click on the select control click inspect element to see exactly what style properties are being inherited rendered for that specific object

135169
jobs	cron
gae s load balanced and scalable hosting sounds like a good fit for a system that could eventually be moving around a lot of data but it s lack of cron jobs is a nuisance

135226
getter	setter
opera supports a language that is equivalent to ecmascript 3 + getter and setter + misc

135226
getter	setter
safari supports a language that is equivalent to ecmascript 3 + getter and setter + misc

135231
httpwebresponse	system.net.httpwebrequest
what i do is build a custom class the wraps system.net.httpwebrequest httpwebresponse so retrieving pages is as simple as using system.net.webclient

135276
int	chars
you can determine the size of time_t at compiletime in terms of fundamental types so an int or a long or an ssize_t and then use the right format chars to py_buildvalue -- i for an int l for a long n for an ssize_t

135367
boost	stl
remaining within the boundaries of the c++ language and libraries i would suggest first getting used to programming using stl algorithm function templates as one the most common use you will have for boost lambda is to replace functor classes with inlined expressions inlined

135367
boost	stl
when you over- use the stl you find yourself gravitating towards boost bind and boost lambda

135367
boost	stl
so use stl algorithms write your own functors and then translate them into inline expressions using boost lambda

135441
migrate	upgrade
i have factored this code out into a third repository and then i periodically migrate that code into my dependent project repositories as internal release and upgrade steps

135441
versioning	upgrade
my individual projects then have a revision that looks like upgrade to v4.3.345 of shared.app.dll which includes all changes needed to work against that versioning

135458
free	malloc
will the detached thread free the memory allocated by malloc or is that something i now have to do

135460
post	get
of course this code will return an error since google uses get not post for search queries

135514
inherited	properties
ok it looks like i had the right answer unless if you don t want inherited properties

135514
inherited	properties
here are some other options to include inherited properties

135543
versioning	upgrade
the subversion versioning on the server is older than the versioning on my notebook so i guess my newer versioning somehow upgrade the working directories so they are incompatible with the old versioning on the development server

135589
put	get
make sure you use a masterpage so that all of your sub pages will have a common base and give all of your elements good ids because you will still need to get your hands dirty with css to put it all together

135599
erd	diagram
not sure if its a part of uml but i find entity relation diagram erd very useful when modeling your database.

135654
cvs	svn
the next one is probably useless for you but many people used to use cvs don t realize that svn has feature like that so i write it down

135656
postgresql	mysql	post	get
decide at runtime whether you want mysql postgresql memcached or http post get requests to a sketchy server in indonesia

135711
freebsd	netbsd	freebsd	opensolaris	opensolaris	netbsd
if you want to get your hands dirty with kernel programming go with freebsd netbsd or opensolaris for example

135711
opensolaris	netbsd
these os-es even have a list of projects on their respective web-sites and i personally have extremely good experience with people on opensolaris forums and netbsd mailing lists

135739
imperative	declarative
the for-loop is imperative the algorithms are declarative

135795
client-side	server-side
it is a good approach is to use javascript to do client-side validation and give the user quick feedback and catch 99 + of the cases then do a server-side validation of the submitted parameters to catch the minority that don t have js enabled or who manipulate the html to submit non-expected values

135795
client-side	server-side
just remember that the client-side validation is optional and is good for those common mistakes input validation but the server-side validation is mandatory for all input whether or not any client-side checks have been done on the given input

135815
getter	setter
or course this is a simple example but there is a lot of stuff the operator module provides including the items setter getter for list and dict

135832
put	get
i want to get your opinion on whether this is a good idea or should i put my application metadata in the soap header itself

135836
freebsd	solaris
freebsd has specific concepts of jails and solaris has containers

135852
inherited	properties
it can t be inherited and all members properties and methods are static shared

135876
int	boolean
i think you almost answered this yourself i think the end aim is to make the code more readable and in this case the enum did that imo its always best to look at the end aim rather than blanket rules maybe think of it more as a guideline enums are often more readable in code than generic boolean int etc but there will always be exceptions to the rule

135929
put	get
i d like to just put in a comment in the block of my if-statement but i get an error when i try

135946
boost	stl
either standard c++ stl or boost ok mfc or atl win32 api or a small single-purpose and free library that i can download from somewhere

135971
uniq	grep
with some clever sort uniq diff grep awk later on has potential but i was wondering if anyone knows of any existing solutions

136051
ienumerable	ienumerator
take the following class it doesn t implement ienumerable or ienumerator

136154
profiling	benchmarking
if you re doing database stuff the dbi profiling can benchmarking your queries which is work happening in another program

136177
ndepend	fxcop
â just because code passes fxcop stylecop looks good in ndepend and passes automated tests doesnâ t mean it provides the best business value

136232
pyopengl	pyglet
if you are going to go with ctypes definitely check out the pyglet and pyopengl projects that have massive examples of ctype bindings

136233
put	get
but when i put this in my .aliases file i get an alias loop

136397
maven	pom.xml
try running first mvn install in project bar in order to put bar in your maven repository and then add the dependency to foo s pom.xml

136401
rss	feed
also are there any .net libraries which i can use to work on rss feed

136401
rss	feed
i have not done any rss feed programming before

136403
maven	pom.xml
bar s pom.xml needs to include foo in order to use maven to compile it

136422
rss	feed
many rss feed only keep the latest 10 or so posts so there would be no way to provide the older data from the feed since the blog started

136424
rss	feed
as other said depending on the rss feed you may only get a finite amount of items

136476
arp	icmp
not receiving any responses to icmp pings or arp requests is not a 100 guarantee that there s no network connection

136489
folder	directory
it is perfectly feasible to deploy user controls directly to sharepoint sites either through the controltemplates folder in the 12 hive or to a location in the web app virtual directory which you can then reference from web pages using sharepoint designer

136502
jquery	scriptaculous
there are two possible solutions there was a conflict with an older version of scriptaculous and jquery scriptaculous was attempting to extend the native array prototype incorrectly - first try upgrading your copy of scriptaculous

136536
sqlcommandbuilder	sqldataadapter
i am trying to retrieve the value of an identity column into my dataset after performing an update using a sqldataadapter and sqlcommandbuilder

136563
rss	feed

136604
children	parent
i m having troubles and asking for your kind help in finding a way to keep track of parent id s and inserting the children without using cursors or nasty things like that.

136675
richtextbox	textblock
i m not sure if you can make a textblock selectable but another option would be to use a richtextbox - it is like a textbox as you suggested but supports the formatting you want

136714
disk	ram
depending on the size of the data and the amount of ram available one of the best performance gains will occur by setting sqlite to use an all-in-memory database rather than writing to disk

136733
codeigniter	cakephp
for php there is codeigniter kohanaphp and cakephp

136786
mouse	keyboard
for linux i unfortunately have not been able to find a good way to easily create keyboard mouse macros

136804
django	web.py
you might consider using something like web.py which would be easy to distribute since it s small and it would also be easy to adapt your other tools to it since it doesn t require you to submit to the framework so much like django does

136839
cvs	svn
version control a certain tagged version from svn cvs

136839
cvs	svn

balsamiq mockups looks pretty nice

136988
erd	diagram
design document including an erd diagram of the database

137029
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome so far if it clears safari 3.0 on win it seems to clear google-chrome too

137035
fadein	fadeout
so if you really really want this effect then you will need to do the image fadeout spinner fadein and once that is complete triggering the upload

137069
folder	directory
svn creates .svn directory in every single folder git only creates one .git directory

137074
g++	gcc
use the -s option to gcc or g++

137173
ubuntu	debian
so far i ve tested it on ubuntu debian and red hat as

137203
cifs	smb
smb cifs supports file block reading so you should be streaming the file at that point of course you didn t actually say how you were accessing the file - i m just assuming smb

137444
prng	random
you still have to estimate entropy if you want to know how random your seed value was - you can use the best prng in the world but its entropy is still limited by the entropy of the seed.

137519
hide	show
for example how do i show or hide the outlook envelope icon from an outlook rule

137525
children	parent
you might want to try an alternative approach where you have a parent maven project and two children project

137525
children	parent
parent pom.xml has references to both children projects modules

137552
int	boolean
well i can t remember enough from my php days to answer the part but for most c-style languages null should be used in the context of pointer values false as a boolean and zero as a numeric value such as an int

137577
int	boolean
0 is the int value of zero and false is the boolean value of well false

137586
post	get
also post any recommendations to books post that help you understand and get to running speed asap

137626
prng	random
my experience has been only with slow initialization of the prng not with generation of random data after that

137654
put	get
technically you can get around it anyways but you have to put in extra work to shoot yourself

137660
stdout	stderr
the iis process must have a stdin stdout and stderr

137694
prepare	execute
also it looks like the first trace does no prepare call and thinks p1 is an output paramer in the execute while the second trace does a prepare call with p1 as an output but does not show p1 as an output in the execute step - is this significant

137705
websphere	ibm
i m looking for people who have had experience scaling ibm s websphere to high traffic volumes

137715
int	boolean
false is a valid boolean value 0 is a valid int value and php has some fairly ugly conversion between 0 0 and false

137723
solaris	bsd	solaris	aix	bsd	aix
in order of number of platforms under each os linux solaris windows hpux aix zlinux bsd osx os 360 i don t care about this one

137723
x86	64bit
solaris x86 64bit

137729
winpcap	wireshark
wireshark is handy as a stand alone utility you can use manually but it s also possible to do packet sniffing programmatically using winpcap the library on which wireshark is based

137738
ubuntu	debian	redhat	fedora
redhat based systems fedora mandriva or debian based systems ubuntu

137743
children	parent
is there any way to tile all of the form children of an mdi parent easily

137773
versioning	upgrade
update the customer upgrade to the latest versioning of debian testing and the same error occurred

137788
getter	setter
properties are just getter setter methods with differant syntax

137815
ubuntu	debian
i ve generally been fine with plain old debian ubuntu has its caveats that sometimes hit you at wrong times

137850
free	malloc	free	calloc	calloc	malloc
if the argument to the free function does not match a pointer earlier returned by the calloc malloc or

137850
free	realloc

super	self
therefore while i do think tdd would be super helpful i don t think it can be something that s learned successfully by one s self

137876
firefox	safari	safariwatir	firewatir
be aware that each browser has their own version of watir watir ie firewatir firefox and safariwatir safari

137917
postgresql	mysql
it works with both postgresql and mysql to perform non-blocking queries

137949
versioning	upgrade
firebug is stable on firefox 3 but you have to upgrade to versioning 1.2.1 since previous versioning no longer work

137954
opensuse	centos	redhat	fedora
with those things considered you would be best off with redhat fedora centos and suse opensuse

137954
redhat	fedora
i ve used redhat fedora and opensuse to run banking production apps and they are pretty good

137962
getter	setter
if my memory serves correctly the private keyword is the only way to create a privately scoped property getter or setter when its opposite has greater than private accessibility

138146
websphere	ibm
websphere 6.1 ships with an ibm jdk 1.5 or is it 5

138154
firefox	safari
browser support currently is ie safari firefox 3.1 alpha

138157
system.in	system.out
i m just using basic system.out and system.in functionality but i m happy to rebuild my i o wrappers

138242
rss	feed
then you could search for pages that offer their full article text in rss feed

138259
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
if retrieval by index doesn t happen too often a sortedlist or sorteddictionary will have much better performance characteristics access by index can be achieved through the elementat extension method

138282
cvs	svn
there are even svn tools guides and git tools guides out there that will do this cvs conversion for you

138292
rdf	owl
if you ve worked on a project that stores data for use with the semantic web do you use rdf or even owl as the internal data format or do you have your own data model ontology that you map to rdf for interoperability

138292
rdf	owl
if you do your own thing how does it differ from rdf owl

138310
rss	feed
you can always get your own but be warned html pages often need heavy cleanup so restrict yourself to rss feed

138322
jena	rdflib
in the end i rely mostly on 3rd-party storage backends like jena rdflib et al

138347
jobs	cron
is there any way without using cron jobs

138350
int	chars
the first obvious one that comes to my mind is that your array of int is 2 to 4 times larger than an array of chars and hence if the array is big enough you ll get fewer data cache hits which will definitely slow down the performance

138362
sorting	filtering
you can also filtering the list before sorting by inserting a grep if you want to filtering on the same cached value

138379
x86	64bit
theoretically csidl_program_filesx86 should map to c program files x86 in a 64bit system but what does it map to in a 32 bit system where this path doesn t exist

138398
post	get
once you get this working you might want to post your findings to pinvoke.net for others to make use of

138412
gridview	sqldatasource
i can t get my gridview to enable a user to sort a column of data when i m using a custom sqldatasource

138414
udp	tcp
udp tcp messages

138463
hash	md5
if you use cryptographic hash md5 sha1 ripemd160 the hash will be unique modulo collisions which are very improbable -- sha1 is used for digital signatures and md5 is also collision-resistant on random inputs

138467
gridview	sqldatasource
when handling the sorting event do you recreate the sqldatasource and rebound it to the gridview

138472
put	get
you put in and get out data by specifying the key you are operating on

138472
put	get
this implies that put key value get key contains key and remove key are all really fast

138532
filenotfoundexception	eofexception
an example from the java-api is ioexception that has subclasses like filenotfoundexception or eofexception and much more

138547
daemons	launchd
i d installed full-text searching during installation the sql full-text filter daemons launchd is running thorough an admin user account

138592
post	get
you can see the files its loading including the paths to each and you can even sniff post and get variables

138659
post	get
an easy test to see if its your script or a quirk in firefox would be to change your get url to a form with a post method as the browser plug-in shouldn t re-call a post request

138746
hash	md5
you can install an alternative hash generation function if you want to customise the way the id is generated it s a 128bit number generated via md5 by default

138779
organization	naming
there s a reason classes are broken into namespaces -- primarily for organization and to reduce naming conflicts

138851
postgresql	mysql
the one that s in mysql postgresql and not the one that s in myapp models.py

138888
django	web.py
if you think django is too much you can try a lighter one like the very small but still handy web.py

138898
pull	push
you don t need a server for it as it s a distributed version control system - you can hold a whole repository copy on a flash drive and push pull changes from it

138898
cvs	svn
as opposed to svn and cvs it doesn t spread its metadata directories all over the repository

138948
opera	google-chrome
users mainly use firefox2 but also opera 9.x ff3 ie7 and google-chrome are used to access the site

139582
mvp	presenter
my main issue is that almost every single mvp implementation has the view holding onto the presenter and telling the presenter to do things

139582
children	parent
then the view holding onto the controller looks kinda silly the parent is the controller and the children are the views

139582
mvp	presenter
a traditional form holds presenter mvp implementation has other consequences

139582
mvp	presenter
the way to fix this is to pass in an interface again most mvp implementation i see have the form creating the presenter but hey

143501
width	height
if it s in an element that scales automatically like a grid cell and the grid resizes automatically like if it s the root element on the page and the page doesn t have a width or height specified then you re good but otherwise you ll need to handle the application.current.host.content.fullscreenchanged event and either resize or apply a scale transform to the image or its container to make it fill the screen and do the same when you go back to non full screen mode

143518
multiplying	add
you store the polynomial coefficients in a vector v at the beginning all coefficients are zero and for i n to 0 you multiplying it by ax+b and add c i

filesystems	ntfs
you can use an encrypted filesystems like the native one for ntfs on windows or one of the various options for linux

143824

145433
maven	buildr
and even though everybody says ruby is slow buildr was 2-6x faster than maven

145474
hash	salt
what you should do is store the hash of a pre-chosen and secret salt value + the password

145474
hash	salt
i.e. concatenate the salt and the password hash the result and store this hash

145474
hash	salt
when authenticating do the same - concatenate your salt value and the user-supplied password hash then check for equality

145474
hash	salt
of course if the user send passwords across the network for example if you re working on a web or client-server application then you should not send the password in clear text across so instead of storing hash salt + password you should store and check against hash salt + hash password and have your client pre-hash the user-supplied password and send that one across the network

145477
freemarker	velocity
your string example is a valid template in at least a few templating engines like velocity or freemarker

145533

146209
post	put
i put an example of this style in another post

146221
sin	sqrt
stuff like sin log sqrt take arrays instead of scalars

146250
pull	push
should i push keypresses to vehicles when they re pressed or should vehicles pull keys pressed from the engine

146250
pull	push
if the player controls the vehicle with the arrow keys should a keypress set the accelleration push and a key-release clear the velocity or should the vehicle ask the game-engine if the accellerate key is pressed pull

146250
pull	push
i think a push would mean that the keyboard control module would need to know about vehicles whereas pull would mean a vehicle needs to know specific keyboard controls

146264
mouse	keyboard
if keyboard events are a callback don t use the pull approach for your mouse events for instance

mouse	keyboard
for development i tend to switch between the keyboard for typing and shortcuts and the mouse for pointing at things

146753
mouse	keyboard
spodi i agree on the keyboard for shortcuts so the only buttons i use on either the mouse or the tablet are the first and second both of which are available on the pen

146767
mouse	keyboard
my left hand is always on the keyboard while my right is jumping to and from the mouse

146777
organization	naming
specifically when you create an interface implementor pair and there is no overriding organization concern such as the interface should go in a different assembly ie as recommended by the s# architecture do you have a default way of organizing them in your namespace naming scheme

146841
spweb	spsite
ensure that this object or its parent such as an spweb or spsite is being properly disposed

146871
lisp	scheme
i have decided that i prefer scheme over common lisp so that narrows it down a bit

146942
children	parent
it comes up with the correct query to add the parent and assigns a new guid for id however it doesn t associate that parent id to the children objects in the sql it tries to execute

146942
children	parent
doing it that way is the only way i can seem to get nhibernate to see that these children really belong to this parent

146943
config	ini
please do not recommend alternative libraries - i just want a simple method for parsing out some config strings from an ini file

147084
folder	directory
i want to ensure that any files or folder created inside the server directory have group write permissions and belong to the developers group

147112
opera	firefox
the input event also has various bugs in firefox and opera

147125
disk	ram
this seems to give the best of both worlds if another application needs that memory it can immediately claim the physical ram and start writing to it since another copy of it is on disk and can be swapped back in when the inactive application is woken up

147125
disk	ram
and when the original app wakes up any of its pages that are still in ram can be used as-is without having to pull them off the disk

147161
int	double
so generate a 52 bit or larger unsigned random int for example by reading bytes from dev urandom convert it into a double and divide it by 2 number of bits it was

147161

post	get	post	put	put	get
what is the practical benefit of using http get put delete post head

147187
post	get	post	put	put	get
why not focus on their behavioral benefits safety and idempotency forgetting their names and use get put or post depending on which behavior we want

147187
post	get	post	put	put	get
why shouldn t we only use get put and post and drop head delete

147195
post	get	post	put	put	get
the rest 1 approach uses post get put and delete to implement the crud rules for a web resource

147195
post	put
can you update a record with post instead of put

147195
post	put
further post uri s have no key where put must have a key

147195
post	put
i suppose you could insist on some ambiguity where post does either post or put

147195
post	get
if you re not building a restful interface then it s typical to only use get and post for retrieve and create update

147195
post	put
it s common to have uri differences or message content differences to distinguish between post and put when a person is clicking submit on a form

147208
hide	show
i ve got some javascript that show hide some table rows but when the rows are set to display none

147213
post	put
and it can know that post put and delete should not be cached

147283
int	chars
easiest way is with an array of chars where the enum s int value indexes to a string containing the descriptive name of that enum

147299
post	put
when all the pieces are in place then you can post put the transaction wrapper with all the component pieces

147305
sorting	grouping
if the data is both directly related to the additive fact and is not something you want to be grouping sorting search on then putting it in the fact table is okay

147326
post	get	post	put	put	get
you could use only get and post but then you are losing out on some of the precision and clarity that put and delete bring

147326
put	get
if you think of a resource management api then get put and delete probably cover 80 -90 of the required functionality

147326
post	get
if you limit yourself to get and post then 40 -60 of your api is accessed using the poorly specified post

147363
vim	emacs
i know vim and emacs and vim fits my brain and my habits better

147371
ienumerable	iqueryable
if your stored procs return result sets i think linq will translate that into anonymous variables that you should be able to access via ienumerable or iqueryable somebody pls verify this

147392
vim	emacs
emacs or vim is not significantly better than vim or emacs

147392
vim	emacs
i have no doubt that anything you can get done in emacs you can also get done in vim just not standard

the response about the require tbody element when dynamically building tables appears to be the entire problem - this appears to even set the image width and height to 0 in the dom

147712
ant	maven
or use ant or maven

147726
wan	lan
the idea was that instead of having our program beat against the wan when it s down they d send a configuration file containing the closely-guarded admin credentials run it in each lan and zip up the results and e-mail it back

147763
width	height
it s a bit of a hack but you could add an empty div with a width of 1px and height of 1000px inside your #content div

147768
folder	directory
set the base directory to the root folder also

147774

why not let the window resize itself based on the runtime height width

147875
idictionary	icollection
i tried wrap generic idictionary in class that implements nongenetic idictionary however i discovered that i have to also somehow convert generic icollection to nongeneric one so i go with mark gravell solution

147886
width	height
it s been a while since i ve done so but i think the closest html dom equivalent is setting a width on a div and requesting the height cut and paste reuse so apologies if this contains errors

147928
width	height
although it may appear like a double in xaml the actual value for a definition s height or width is a gridlength struct

147928
width	height
unlike every other property in wpf width and height don t default their databinding mode to twoway you have to manually set this

148161
getter	setter
but i haven t generate getter and setter option in source menu it s missed

148165
getter	setter
edited i guess it is not possible to generate getter and setter automatically in your version though you would be able to create templates for the same and use it as per your requirements

strtok	malloc
use getenv path to get the path string from the environment then use successive calls to strtok path then strtok path null to parse out the paths from the path string into an array of which you will need to allocate with malloc

148664
pop-up	dialog
i think you ll have to let the user choose an xml file validate and then pop-up the dialog again if its a _1 file

the idea is to have a folder on which the developers drop database upgrade scripts and the build process get s to the folder creates a build script and moves all the files on the folder to a new folder with the database build versioning that we just created

148880
swt	swing
in my experience as a general rule java programs that use swt as the gui toolkit are more accessible then programs that use swing which is why i stay away from netbeans

148880
vim	emacs
for c and c++ programming i use cygwin with gcc as my compiler and emacs or vim as my editor depending on what i need to do

149194
lisp	smalltalk
if you want to learn different sorts of object-oriented languages you might well want to learn smalltalk if it differs significantly from ruby something like java or c++ and perhaps also the common lisp object system

149212
cpu	hyperthreading
almost any new cpu has more than one core or if it has just one it might support hyperthreading and thus pretending it has more than one

149380
sorting	filtering
ps be glad i didn t show my example of a stored procedure that supports dynamic sorting dynamic filtering text-searching of columns pagination via rownumber over and try...catch with transaction rollbacking on errors.

149381

unixodbc	iodbc
freetds + unixodbc or iodbc

149418
unixodbc	iodbc

int	double
64 bit int will handle any money but again be careful when converting and multiplying by various rates in your app that might be floats double

149471
nstimer	nsrunloop
a nsrunloop internally is a linked list and by adding a nstimer object to the runloop a new linked list element is created and added to the list

149471
mouse	keyboard
if the fire date for every timer is still in the future and there is no other event to process like a keyboard mouse event from ui or a sent notification it would return null

149471
nstimer	nsrunloop
performselectoronmainthread creates a nstimer object like this one that fires only once and where the time to fire is already located in the past so it needs firing immediately then gets the nsrunloop of the main thread and adds the timer object there

149474
libxml2	libxslt
i was using python s libxml2 libxslt to process this

149506

mri	rubinius
mri 1.8 have supported them as far as my memory reaches ruby 1.9 yarv does it too so does rubinius

149709
children	parent
assuming that the order of children within a parent is irrelevant then a topoligical sort will get you what you want

149709
children	parent
if the order of the children within the node is relevant then you need to maintain the task order within the parent

149715
crc	reed-solomon
it might not be a crc it might be an error correcting code like reed-solomon

149720
atomic	interlocked
intel s open-source threadbuildingblocks has a template atomic that offers the same functionality as .net s interlocked class

149726
put	get
in the meantime you can put an extra comment character at the end of your comments to get it to look okay

149811
post	get
if you omit it it will default to get and the parameters will be sent as part of the query string not as post data

149829
min	max
if you also maintained the min and max between each return to zero you have the bounds of the superset

149865
ogre	irrlicht
ogre and irrlicht both are said to have a cleaner design than crystalspace so i wouldn t worry to much about problems with the latter

149908
accurev	svn
accurev is new therefore there has little resources available online as apposed to svn which you would find tons of integration work that was done by hundreds with jira for example

149913
int	double
the standard way of generating a double uniformly in 0 1 is to generate an int in the range 0 2 n and divide by 2 n

149928
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
i would say it s okay as long as you make them unchecked-exception subclass of runtimeexception in java

149947
atomic	interlocked
strictly speaking linux cannot offer atomic interlocked functions like ones in win32 simply because these functions require hardware support and linux runs on some platforms that don t offer that support

149978
superclass	subclassing
the crtp gets a lot less curious if you consider that the subclassing type that is passed to the superclass is only needed at time of method expansion

149978
superclass	subclassing
you just need the pattern to import the symbolic subclassing type into the superclass but it is just a forward declaration - as all formal template param types are by definition - as far as the superclass is concerned

149978
superclass	subclassing
we use in a somewhat modified form passing the subclassing in a traits type structure to the superclass to make it possible for the superclass to return objects of the derived type

149978
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
the application is a library for geometric calculus points vectors lines boxes where all the generic functionality is implemented in the superclass and the subclassing just defines a specific type cfltpoint inherited from tgenpoint

149995
unsigned	short
if i change the type of the field wwindow to unsigned int wwindow 16 which has the same number of bits as an unsigned short the program tells me the size of the struct is now 20 bytes the correct size

150010
pop-up	dialog
ideally the user is going to click on an icon next to a text box that will pop-up the form they will select the department they need and when they click ok the dialog will close and i will have the value selected for me to update the textbox with

150012
unsigned	short
interesting - i would think that word would evaluate to unsigned short so you d have that problem in more than one place

150023
folder	directory
remove all directory in build folder

150026
for-loop	loops
for example setting documenttext in a for-loop will only set properly on the first iteration of loops

for each row in the datatable add subtract the credit debits to the previous row s balance and assign it to the appropriate cell of your datatable

150064
subtract	add
for each item or altitem add subtract the credit debits to the global variable and assign it to the appropriate cell of your datagrid

150123
try-catch	exception-handling
using a try-catch block to save on performance because your invalid data rate is low is an abuse of exception-handling handling at the expense of maintainability and good coding practices

150141
lisp	scheme
in languages like lisp scheme they re often passed around quite liberally as function parameters but the idiom in c# typically finds lambdas used only for lazy evaluation of functions as in linq or for making event-handling code a bit terser

150203
inherited	properties
i would make a custom control that inherited from contextmenu that has a sharedmenuitems dependancy properties and a menuitems dependancy properties

150224
unsigned	short
this is followed by the unsigned short which is on an int boundary and then a word which is along aligned on an int boundary which means that there 2 bytes of padding between them

150224
unsigned	short
when you switch to unsigned int wwindow 16 instead of being a separate short the compiler uses the unused parts of the previous bitfield so no waste no short and no padding after the short hence you save four bytes

150278
cpu	processors
it was a bit hard on the processors we were running on a pentium-iii equivalent machine and it was pushing 50 -75 peak cpu

150283
lisp	scheme
so for learning scheme lisp javascript isn t a bad start

150302
terminate	timeout
a short timeout value will consume considerably more cpu than the infinite timeout but there are good reasons for using a short timeout for example if you want to terminate the process thread the runloop is running in

150359
put	get
but when i try to just put something in there i get an errorinvalidchangekey

150361
cpu	processors
doing it that way however should improve performance because it would come down to doing only about 20-30k vector transformations which doesn t take much processors power on most modern cpu s

150393
cpu	hyperthreading
in either case hardware_concurrency returns the number of threads that the hardware is capable of executing concurrently based on the number of cpu cores and hyperthreading units

150411
verilog	vhdl
if you re going to do a lot of bit manipulation and you care much more about readability rather than performance for your application then you may want to create an integer wrapper to enable slicing like in verilog or vhdl

150443
postgresql	mysql
let you access sqlplus and other command line sql environments for postgresql mysql

150480
implements	sealed
when coming to mock classes that are not test friendly sealed not implements any interface methods are not virtual you would probably want to use the adapter design pattern

151115
getter	setter
yes you can create getter and setter functions inside an as3 class

151115
getter	setter
more information about getter and setter can be found here

folder	directory
i have a folder var unity conf with some properties files in it and i d like the caucho s resin jvm to have that directory on the classpath

151244
suppressfinalize	finalizer
suppressfinalize should only be called by a class that has a finalizer

151244
suppressfinalize	finalizer
suppressfinalize tells the gc that the object was cleaned up properly and doesn t need to go onto the finalizer queue

151244
suppressfinalize	finalizer
the suppressfinalize optimization is not trivial as your objects can live a long time waiting on the finalizer queue

151278
int	boolean
using an int as boolean

note that you can also use attr_reader or attr_writer to define just getter or setter or you can define them manually as such

151385
cairngorm	flex
i was new to flex when i learned cairngorm but found it useful and easy to learn with the above

151399
ogre	irrlicht
irrlicht has a cleaner api lower system requirements and works better across platforms than ogre in my opinion

151726
jruby	mri
differences between jruby and ruby mri

151843
versioning	upgrade
i used to develop a warehouse management application using c++ and sql and we always had to support at least two versioning back from the current versioning of sql server because our customers were extremely reluctant to upgrade

151867

first autogrow does only work on firefox not on ie safari opera and google-chrome

152132
versioning	upgrade
you still have the job with adding dll s when deciding to upgrade to a other versioning of the dll though

152133
gendarme	fxcop
just stick to the mono make sure that you have gendarme code inspector fxcop for mono checking your code for portability issues and you should be fine

152141
equals	toarray
i d be much more concerned about the toarray call on the populated list which will result in a memory allocation equals to its internal size and a memory copy of the contents of the list into it

152157
allegro	sdl
since you mention gdi+ i suppose you want it for windows but there are good portable solutions like sdl allegro cairo etc

152234
versioning	upgrade
from this point on you ve given the customer a reason why not to upgrade to your new versioning and to stay with the old versioning

152365
mouse	keyboard
each structure represents an event to be inserted into the keyboard or mouse input stream

before we were running svn 1.5.0 installed with collabnet on svn and the credentials were cached after the first command

152398
directx	gdi
ui technologies opengl glut directx gdi qt etc

152401

as for libraries c++ programmers absolutely need to know stl and boost

152412
equinox	knopflerfish
pax runner run and switch between felix equinox knopflerfish and concierge easily

152443
profiling	instrumentation
it uses sampled profiling has some useful ui does not require instrumentation

152464
inherited	properties
javascript uses prototypes to define object properties including methods and inherited

152510
udp	tcp
you create a socket by either defining a local address in case of tcp ip an address is an ip address and usually in case it s a tcp or udp socket a port number both can be any and then binding the socket to it and just use it a server socket or you can create a socket by defining a remote address and then connecting the socket to it additionally you can bind it to a local address in advance if you want to keep control of the local address and port as well and use it as a client socket

152514
cvs	svn
bonus points for ignoring cvs and svn control files folders

152514
cvs	svn
the script would be needed to run a build on a linux system so i think changes to cvs or svn control files should be omitted

152516
mbunit	mstest
mstest is slow mbunit

152521
udp	tcp
a port denotes a communication endpoint in the tcp and udp transports for the ip network protocol

152575

post	get
what is the simplest way to identify and separate get and post parameters from a controller in ruby on rails which will be equivalent to _get and _post variables in php

152598
cvs	svn
the original question asked for ignoring svn and cvs directories which can be done by adding -prune to the find command

152607
awt	swing	swt	swing
i you are not using a gui for instance awt swing or swt you could try starting you application in headless mode

152614
imperative	declarative
i prefer to write in functional or declarative style over imperative whenever i can

152619
min	max
that would make the calculation of min and max fairly trivial

152625
min	max
all of these suggestions involve walking the list twice if you need to get both the max and min

152629
post	get
support of post and get methods

152630
hash	salt
i store my passwords hash in the usertable with a unique salt per user

152633
children	parent
if it does i start selectively adding it to elements starting with the element the element s parent children etc

152679
hash	salt
if you salt the password before storage you must compare the hash salt password to the db

152754
post	get
worse you could get publicly bashed on blogs like youthoughtwewouldntnotice.com making such blog post about you high-ranked google results for your name thus tarnishing your reputation irreversibly

152773
versioning	upgrade
my eclipse is a highly recommended versioning that i ve seen all over the net that is really very affordable last i heard 50 for the distro plus a year of free upgrade

152781
irrlicht	ogre3d
if you want to peek at code there are several open source game engine like ogre3d nebuladevice and irrlicht

152789
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
after testing with a serialized object written to a file using the objectoutputstream in a java 1.5 program then running a read with a objectinputstream in a java 1.6 program i can say this worked without any issue

152808
children	parent
the children send notifications to their parent

152823
.htaccess	httpd.conf
update renamed htacces.txt to .htaccess and ammended the appropriate directives in the httpd.conf file and all seems to work

152829
min	max
when signal is poor noisy data values spread max to min is low and there s proportionally higher noise in many more buckets

152873
put	get
if you edit the test run configuration by double clicking the .testrunconfig file that gets put into the solution items solution folder when you add a new unit test you get a test run configuration dialog

152881
addition	multiplication
the double name n m format is very fast when you are accessing data by rows both because has almost no overhead besides a multiplication and addition and because your rows are packed data that will be coherent in cache

152922
post	get	post	put	put	get
the mapping between get and post and put and delete and controller actions is set up in config routes.rb in most modern rails code

152929
post	get	post	put	put	get
rest only cares about 4 events in the life on an object create post retrieve get update put and delete

152994
boost	stl
boost especially will cause this but even the regular stl code can do this

153015
udp	tcp
sockets are protocol specific - so the implementation of uniqueness that both tcp ip and udp ip uses ipaddress port is different than eg. ipx network node and...ahem socket - but a different socket than is meant by the general socket term

153015
udp	tcp
since ip has become the dominant protocol a port in networking terms has become synonomous with either a udp or tcp port number - which is a portion of the socket address

153015
udp	tcp
the api functions make it clear that both are just different type of sockets - sock_dgram is udp just sending a message and sock_stream is tcp creating a virtual circuit

153015
udp	tcp
technically the ip header holds the ip address and the protocol on top of ip udp or tcp holds the port number

153066
boost	stl
one big advantage of boost is that many of its features will show up in the stl extensions for the upcoming c++0x standard see for example

153071
.htaccess	httpd.conf
my guess is that within xampp you need to enable allowoverride through an .htaccess in httpd.conf

153082
ubuntu	linux
the only software that i see providing torrent links are linux distros and not all of them for example the ubuntu website does not provide torrents to download ubuntu

153154
children	parent
copy data over starting with the lowest level grandchildren children parent

153158
versioning	upgrade
typically the rule of thumb with dnn is to upgrade to the most current versioning and keep an eye on the security items posted on the site also keeping an eye on cathal s blog is a good idea as he is the head security person

153200
put	get
rest has guarantees of safety a get message won t change state and idempotence a put request sent multiple times has same effect as just one time

153214
hide	show
active is somewhat like an onclick event so if you nest a hidden input in the li this css hide the span and show the input when the li is clicked on

153221
put	get
which seems to get called when i do python myservice stop from the command line i can put a debug line in there that produces output to a file but doesn t actually exit the whole service - subsequent calls to python myservice start gives me an error

153222
ienumerable	idictionary
i feel it very comfortable to work with when the view interface exposes only basic clr types such as string mapped to textboxes idictionary mapped to dropdownlists ienumerable mapped to some grids repeaters

153261
getter	setter
i interpret that as meaning that testing setter and getter that don t do anything except set or get is probably too much testing no need to take the time

155612
disk	ram
not to mention things like ssd or even ram disk for your templates will make it a non-issue

155615
client-side	server-side
i understand that server-side validation is an absolute must to prevent malicious users or simply users who choose to disable javascript from bypassing client-side validation

155662
cos	sin
you need to use a partial function to input the radians into cos and sin

155662
cos	sin
that said javascript s sin and cos aren t quite as picky so you must have halved your radian or something

155664
firefox	safari
when performing an xmlhttprequest and executing a function onreadystatechange the xmlhttprequest.responsetext property contains the data loaded at that point in firefox but not in ie and maybe safari

155669
hide	show
i might show or hide certain features or change certain text

155682
rdf	owl
semantic web for the working ontologist book contains a good number of practical examples and motivates the need for rdf rdfs and owl and is in my opinion very readable

as it happens sin and cos are also functions

155852
inherited	properties
i have a class which inherited from component it has one properties which is a collection of rules

the netbsd and openbsd versions support only -r

155963
getter	setter
the reason for using a di container are that you don t have to have a billion properties pre-configured in your code that are simply getter and setter

155963
getter	setter
these methods will allow you to ensure that any interface specified as a field in your class instance is configured correctly upon startup and then you no longer have to null-check your getter and setter assuming you do allow your singletons to remain thread-safe

156009
spaces	delimiter
these are obviously spaces delimiter but for the sake of generality it might as well be anything

156024
folder	directory
note 2 i recommend you create a temporary folder for the tests and run command line or powershell whose current working directory is set to this location

156088
rss	feed
this is done when a website does not offer an rss feed or a rest api for accessing the data in a programmatic way

156099

156116
firefox	safari
an answer that would work cross browser safari webkit firefox etc. would be preferred

156136
direct3d	directx
i looked around and found the directx direct3d stuff which has all the underlying pieces but there doesn t appear to be any high level api to work with unless you re willing to use .net and use wpf neither of which really interest me

156136
direct3d	directx
directx direct3d has these pieces but you have to jump through a lot of hoops or so it appears to use it

156172
x86	mips
the world would be better if we all ran mips i think or even arm or powerpc - or rather if intel amd took their semiconductor expertise and used it to make multi-core ultra-fast ultra-cheap mips processors instead of x86 processors with all of those redeeming qualities

156249
mouse	keyboard
by this i mean if you take something that relied on both the mouse and keyboard and changed it to rely only on the mouse or only on the keyboard then you have improved useability

156261
stdout	stderr
the tool calls out to the shell and i wanted to capture exactly what was displayed during test runs no matter what git was displaying and no matter if it was being spit out in stdout or stderr

156270
for-loop	if-statement
thus the more appropriate place for the lock would be inside portions of code such as inside a for-loop or if-statement so you can free up the individual elements right away even before other ones are processed

156280
put	get	pull	push
i know i can do an hg incoming -p to see the patch sets of changes coming in but it d be nice to just directly see the actual changes for a particular file that i d get if i do a pull of the latest stuff or what i might be about put push out

156328
keydown	keyup
for keypress you can also use sendmessage sending both keydown and keyup

156365
inherited	properties
linq-to-sql has some support for inherited via a discriminator here here but you can only query on classes that are defined in the linq model - data classes themselves and more perhaps importantly for this example the query itself must be phrased in terms of data classes although tentity is a data class it knows that the properties here is declared on the entity base

156369
lisp	scheme
and there are equivalents in lisp and scheme

156374
lisp	scheme
well apart from common lisp labels and scheme letrec which you ve already mentioned javascript also allows you to name an anonymous function

156523
int	chars
if i was going to do a rewrite i just used delphi ansistrings for each text buffer in the current version with newline chars embedded i d use int or int64s for each chars and encode block start stop cursor position and line markers in the high bits that way you don t have to adjust pointers when you insert or delete things

156604
memcached	apc
depending on what you really need you might be looking for apc memcached various template caching libs.

156640
gif	ico	gif	png	png	ico	exif	webp	exif	xmp
it fully supports exif as well as iptc xmp and many other types of metadata from file types including jpeg png gif png ico webp psd .

156772
dependencyobject	uielement
if the object is intended to sit in the xaml tree its best to use dependencyproperties and thus inherit dependencyobject - which all uielement do to allow all the benefits that dependencyproperties provide being animatable binding optional automatic child inheritance etc

156795
put	get
it s not the most elegant solution but you could use openrowset to put the stored proc results into a table then use sp_help to get a description of it

156800
width	height
ps since i have a 2.0 app i m using the object tag approach to silverlight and it s contained in a div with height and width set in style

156912

when a mouse down is detected on the button i want to send a specific keyboard code to the application currently on focus

156916
bash	zsh
i am using zsh but a bash solution is also welcome

156954
spaces	delimiter
important spaces are by far not the only delimiter

156963
terminate	timeout
since by default there is a timeout that kills the service after 30 seconds when it was not able to go beyond the start methods this was the reason why it simply terminate

156990
rss	feed
this is done when a website does not offer an rss feed or a rest api for accessing the data in a programmatic way

157025
inline	inlining
and when you are at a point of code you are sure about the type of the object being called you may make an inline call that will avoid the polymorphic system and enable inlining by the compiler

157028
hide	show
show the window programatically hide it immediately programatically and click cancel on it well you guessed programmatically

157037
spaces	delimiter
your word delimiter are going to be many spaces tab beginning of line parentheses periods commas exclamation question marks etc

157134
factors	mean
physical distance whilst a factors does not always mean that latency automatically goes up

157151
png	ico
furthermore setting the icon of the form from a png is an unessecary performance hit it should have been an ico in the first place

157180
folder	directory
first create a directory inside your eclipse installation folder for example opt eclipse called links

157186
bazaar	git
maybe you could look at something other than subversion if you dont want a server like a distributed vcs bazaar git and mercurial are popular these days or you should look at subversion hosting services

157200
ant	maven
there should be an ant or maven or similar build script that will allow a developer to build and deploy from their working copy onto the development web server so they can see how it is

157215
vim	emacs
so instead of using an ide which you ll probably do all your professional life get a taste of using old school editors like vim emacs

157238
lwjgl	jogl
consider using opengl use jogl of lwjgl

157238
lwjgl	jogl
jogl is more java-like whereas lwjgl provides more gaming functionality on top of opengl access

157244
folder	directory
one solution would be to use iis manager to configure the website created for your asp.net app by visual studio and add a virtual directory for each of the common folder so that by the virtual nature of the virtual directory they will appear to be in the same root folder as your asp.net app

157263
getter	setter
in c# there was a conscious decision to disallow changing the type when overloading properties even when they have only one of the getter setter pair because it would otherwise have very inconsistent behavior you mean i can change the type on the one with a getter but not one with both a getter and setter

157295
post	get
as a side note you ll find the request method in this case get and for submitted forms usually post in request.method

157401
division	multiplication
in about 99.8 of all cases it s just plus minus division and multiplication in some intelligent combinations - in most cases it s about algorithms not math

157446
x86	64bit
as for the size of the .net 3.5 deployable file is that it s .net 2.0 3.0 and 3.5 for x86 x64 and the other 64bit architecture in one big file

157451
mbunit	nunit	mbunit	mstest	nunit	mstest
it seems to combine all the best of nunit mbunit and mstest

157456
perforce	svn
i would pick it over either svn or perforce any day

157493
perforce	svn
i believe svn is very good system as svn is free i would think you d have to have a compelling reason to switch especially as perforce does take a while to learn

157519
min	max
you get a coercion mechanism with allows you to define rules for max min and present value of the property

157532
post	get
when it comes to support for other methods than get and post the problem mostly lies in that some browsers for example safari don t support these and flash player relies on the browser for all it s networking

157696
folder	directory
change directory to mysql installation folder

157718
stdout	stderr
in that case my advice would be to use stderr rather than stdout

157721
post	get
good luck and please post more details about your scenario if you want to get more accurate hints.

157771
put	get
assuming you use lazy matches you can get a set of matches on a string which you can put into your array

157781
capitalization	uppercase
however there seems to be a bug in this method it returns all node names in uppercase and all attribute names in lowercase regardless of the capitalization i used to create the node

157785
vbscript	vba
the on error goto label syntax is supported by visual basic and visual basic for applications vba but vbscript doesn t support this language feature so you have to use on error resume next as described above

157984
textwrangler	textedit
you can then open .bashrc in textedit or in textwrangler and add the previous commands

158057

158125
children	parent
are you only concerned with elements that are children of the same parent or all elements at the same level cousins if you like or elements anywhere in the document.

158144
put	get
i bet if you put your send code in a for 1 100000 loop you would eventually get a write that succeeds with a value smaller than requested

158151
photoshop	paint.net
do i really have to open an image program like paint.net or photoshop simply to paste an image then save it

158175
children	parent
forcing everything into layout managers the different wpf panels does not make much sense for certain scenarios where you don t care that elements are maintained by some parent container and you do not want the other children to be affected by a change in the layout appearance of each other

158200
put	get
sets recognized properties for an ftp server to put and get xml input and a jms queue server that keeps track of jobs

158200
post	put
the junit test i am working on simply needs to emulate this environment by starting a local ftp and mock queue server for the filter to connect to then waiting for the filter to connect to the queue and put the new xml input file on a local directory via a local ftp server wait for the queue message and then modify the xml input slightly put the modified xml in a new directory and post another message to the queue signifying the job has completed

158343
temp	tmp
followed the steps here and assigned permissions to the tmp temp environment variable directory to the user i am using to test also assigned permissions to aspnet and then to everyone as a blanket is this permissions related

google-chrome	firefox
break line tag is not working in firefox neither in google-chrome

158548
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
ok i tried this and it works in firefox 3 safari 3.1.1 and ie7 but not in opera 9.52

158550
submit	submission
that way your function will be called whether the link is clicked or the submit button is pushed or the enter key is pressed and you can cancel the submission by returning false

158550
submit	submission
edit i would recommend always hooking form submission this way rather than calling submit on the form object

158587
int	boolean
true boolean are coerced to unit int and false boolean to zero int

158603
cpu	processors
thus the bigger problem might be that you rely on a certain speed you assume the processors can perform that many operations a second however when the core frequency is lowered it will behave like a slower cpu less operations per second and the core frequency doesn t jump to max just because the cpu is not 100 idle

158651
mvp	presenter
you do you manage the same presenter working with different repositories using the mvp pattern

158652
nswindowcontroller	nsviewcontroller
don t forget that nswindowcontroller and nsviewcontroller will release the top-level objects of the nib files they govern

put	get	switching	screens
this works well enough for screens media but when you switching to print media is there any guarantee that the 90 dpi i appear to get on my system i put the margins to 0.5in either side and for a text resized so that it fits just within that i get about 675 for clientwidth will be the same anywhere else

158711
pcm	music
by the solution you propose setting the digital output as default my pc would output pcm in games music etc

158731
gif	bmp
when you press a hotkey it captures and saves a snapshot of your screen to a jpg gif or bmp file

158737
unix	solaris
platforms in use include windows linux unix and solaris

158755
implements	extends
in java an interface is not technically a class it is a type but not a class hence the keyword implements and interfaces do not extends object

158758
disk	ram
6 - ram disk

158761
updatepanel	onclientclick
style a button to look like a tab then set it s onclientclick event to switch the active view in an updatepanel

158806
width	height
i want the input-box to inherit the height width from the parent table-cell but when i look at the input-box in firebug it has an inline css height width already set causing the table-cell to scale when the td text is pressed

158824
pdfbox	itextsharp	pdfbox	itext
if you re looking for something a little more diy there s the itextsharp library - a port of java s itext - and pdfbox yes it says java - but they have a .net version by way of ikvm.net

158824
pdfbox	itextsharp
here s some codeproject articles on using itextsharp and pdfbox from c#

158854
cvs	svn
cvs2svn does a lot of magic between cvs and svn

158941
rss	feed
how can i to generate an rss feed of team foundation server commit messages

158941
rss	feed
i d like an rss feed that would supply the same or similar information -- or even a way to wring some text out of tfs that i can reconstitute into rss

158941
rss	feed
this is similar to the question sending svn commits to an rss feed but i do have control over the private tfs repository

158943
rss	feed
i know that services like my.yahoo.com allow you to add content from rss feed to your personal page but in general they are links which draw the user to the site which provided the feed

158943
rss	feed
what are the legalities and implications of using rss feed as a data source for a site which repackages the data so as to be unrecognizable that it came from said source

158959
freebsd	netbsd	openbsd	netbsd	openbsd	freebsd
i have to guess here since i could not find a public list of all ports available for openbsd but since there is a port for freebsd netbsd etc

158959
openbsd	freebsd
i guess that even though openbsd links to freebsd s porter s handbook freshports is not applicable for your system

158997
actionscript	mxml
that is rather than dealing with time and frames in flash one is dealing with describing where components should be placed with mxml and how those components work with actionscript

158997
actionscript	mxml
actionscript is used to program behaviors components and other things outside or what mxml does

159002
actionscript	mxml
so yes everything that can be done with mxml can be done with actionscript but not the other way around

159028

159034
min	max
and by extension is it safe to validate an input by checking that it is your max value and leave out your min value assuming you started at 0 and incremented by 1

159052
int	double
as long as you make sure not to do that and you are not building a laser that requires 30 significant digits of precision just pick your favorite flavor between int double or whatever float s your boat

159067
for-loop	loops
you might also check out this page on my site where i compare the speed of an incrementing for-loop a reverse do while loops and duff s device

159073
unsigned	short
in short you cannot rely on an enum being either signed or unsigned

159081
min	max
usually when i need this kind of information i include in the enum a max and min value something like this

159134
next	except
i was doing everything right except that when i replaced the radio button with the combo box there was still one element previous button which had the radio button group as its next element sort of like a tab stop

159194
temp	tmp
turns out that even with iis using impersonation and the tmp temp environment variables being set to c windows temp the asp.net process is still running under the aspnet account and each individual user needed permissions to the documents and settings aspnet local settings temp folder

159263
xfce	kde	xfce	gnome	kde	gnome
however if the distro is more than a few years old it may not exist and alternative mechanisms include browser older attempted standard gnome-open gnome kfmclient exec kde exo-open xfce or parsing mailcap yourself the text html handler will be likely be a browser

159312
children	parent
position each div as you like and then adjust the positioning of their children which most browsers will treat as position relative to my parent unless it s absolute iirc

159319
vbscript	jscript
vbscript and jscript msi customactions suck

159319
vbscript	jscript
vbscript and jscript msi custom actions don t have to suck

159368
int	chars
i ve seen this done with chars arrays to emphasize that one chars is reserved for a string terminator but never for an int array

159410
actionscript	mxml
in the end everything is compiled down to actionscript check the -keep compiler option but mxml just saves you so much time

159452
.htaccess	httpd.conf
you can set this in httpd.conf or in an .htaccess if you have access to one using the php_flag notation

159454
width	height
you need to listen for width changes on the content composite mparent compute the minimum height again given the new content width and call setminheight on the scrolled composite with new height

159454
width	height
this is because changes in the height of the content do not affect the minimum height of the content as long as the width is the same

159489
ssl	https
a clientssl virtual server is typically configured to accept https connections from a client decrypt the ssl session and send the unencrypted http request to the web server

159489
ssl	https
the redirect will be returned to the client in http mode rather than https causing the ssl session to fail

159501
spaces	delimiter
also assuming that the line you gave above is partial as it has only 13ish fields by default fields are white spaces delimiter

159507
awt	swing	swt	swing
to design guis in java you can use swt awt or swing widget toolkits

159511
put	get
but to be on the safe side your unhandled exception filter might get inadvertently overwritten you could put your code inside #95

159555
expression-blend	silverlight
wpf silverlight expression-blend

159574
implements	modifiers
it s not as simple as implements var in a method since you also have to take into acccount different modifiers and attributes like so

159579
charindex	substr
raw t-sql is limited to charindex patindex replace and substr for string manipulation

159601
sorting	grouping
these functions include sorting paging grouping etc

159666
daemons	launchd
launchd the daemons

159678
int	chars
they are often surrogate keys as int create faster joins than chars fileds and especially than multiple field chars joins

159679
folder	directory
if you are running under vista then the system just redirects writes to the program files folder this is done so old program that keep their configuration in the program directory will continue to work when the user is not an admin or uac is enabled

159704
serializable	deserialization
so serializable works but when you try to pass these objects the other way as a parameter for a web service call the deserialization breaks because they can t be the input is treated as a list of string object dictionaries which can t be converted to a list of whatever custom class the collection contains

159749
children	parent
a better solution might be - assuming you need to expose all of the parent properties up the tree at the child level - to go ahead and implement direct properties on the children

159760
put	get
with this example if you have a name with more than three parts then all the extra stuff will get put in the last_name field

159795
client-side	server-side
jquery is for client-side stuff whilst server-side javascript exists its not a common use-case

159804
django	web2py
what does web2py do that you can t do with django in a few lines of code with a better performance code that s easier to read and on an established platform where tons of developers will jump in and fix problems in no time if they appear

159808
organization	naming
our strategy is to have systematic code reviews and to reject code that s not properly documented through comments proper function naming and organization etc...

159819
nginx	lighttpd
at least lighttpd has horrible fastcgi bugs i wouldn t wonder if nginx has some too

159926
cvs	svn
i know there s tools to migrate history and changes from cvs to svn and there s no equivalent to do the reverse

159944
cvs	svn
seriously why would you prefer cvs to svn

159960
curry	first-class
having a functional language is not only about what you can do such as higher-order functions first-class functions and curry

159971
cvs	svn
svn is better than cvs

159971
bazaar	git
if you want to change checkout mercurial git bazaar

159982
cvs	svn
if you really must do it it shouldn t be very hard to write a script that walks through the history of the svn repo getting each revision and committing it to cvs

159984
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
works on firefox ie safari opera google-chrome

159999
cvs	svn
and since one of the main goals of svn was to be a better cvs those developers will probably not have expected anyone to move backwards either

160021
cvs	svn
so what is with svn that your company dislikes so much and cvs does better

160021
cvs	svn
the designers of svn went out of their way to make the svn experience fairly similar to cvs

160021
cvs	svn	perforce	cvs	perforce	svn
svn gives you atomic commits which while not quite up to the standard of perforce is miles in front of cvs

160021
cvs	svn
i upgraded our development team it team from cvs to svn

160021
versioning	upgrade
i got all the right python scripts to upgrade all the versioning history and we have been using svn happily for nearly 4 years

160037
cvs	svn
svn is better than cvs because it was designed to be - it s roughly the same thing with some simplications and new features

160067
cvs	svn
it s not rocket science to write a script that takes the list of commits from your svn repository and iterates through them one at a time merging them into a newly-created cvs repository

160162
collabnet	svn
i have installed svn 1.5.2 with binaries downloaded from collabnet here

160169
getter	setter
getter and setter are evil

160169
getter	setter
i have never been able to write anything remotely complicated without getter and setter but it is a nice guideline

160169
getter	setter
if you have a lot of getter and setter it probably means you are doing it wrong

160260
solaris	bsd
my two reasons are i already know how to do this and i need my scripts to be portable across linux bsd solaris

160267
folder	directory
i ve tried all the tricks i can find on google and the obvious of removing the directory and folder manually

160284
sysv	systemd
python can t help you with that and though i ve seen occasional mention of third-party libraries that try to do this they usually only work on a few systemd like strictly sysv style strictly bsd style or just systemd with proc.

160306
realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc	free	realloc	free	malloc	free	calloc	calloc	malloc
you can only call free 3 on pointers allocated on the heap with malloc 3 calloc 3 or realloc 3

160315
pop-up	dialog
i m trying to write a resolution selection dialog that pop-up when a program first starts up

160330
actionscript	mxml
putting actionscript in mxml is the same as putting css or javascript in html really bad

160353
windows	wow64
windows has wow64 windows on windows 64 bit and linux can have the 32 bit libraries available alongside the 64 bit

160404
daemons	systemd
our embedded systemd doesn t have syslog so the daemons i write do debugging to a file using the a open mode similar to how you ve described it

160404
disk	ram
it s pretty rough and maybe should be called log frontal truncations but it stops our small ram disk based filesystem from filling up with log file

160441
ssdp	upnp
i ve looked at both ssdp and upnp for this type of functionality but i d recommend going with a custom udp multicast solution

160441
ssdp	upnp
imho ssdp and upnp and bloated and overly complicated for resource discovery.

160449
hash	salt
btw i don t know enough cryptography to say whether it s safe enough to add secret salt + hash although seems fine

160520
post	get
it s all based on hits to pages and or get post parameters

160616
many-to-many	one-to-many
if so this identifies your relation as many-to-many rather one-to-many

160659
vim	emacs
most of the file-based tools that we have vim emacs eclipse vs.net unix tools will have to be abandoned in favor of smalltalk s own tools

160679
width	height
if you have a wide picture you want to set width to 100 and leave height

160679
width	height
if you have a long picture you want to set height to 100 and leave width

160690
mvp	presenter
i use mvp so it is split into handler and presenter

160717
width	height
here s a quick function that will adjust the height or width to 100 depending on which is bigger

160729
width	height
what you want to do is on page load walk through the dom and for every image or alterantively pass a function an image id if it s just a single image check if which attribute of the image is greater it s height or width

160729
width	height
once you got that then set the corresponding height width on the tag to 100 and the other to auto

160770
width	height
you need to calculate the ratio between the window width and height and the image width and height

160782
integer	unsigned
depends what language you re using but an ip address is usually stored as a 32-bit unsigned integer at least at the network layer making comparisons quite fast

160792
rss	feed
that has classes related to rss and atom feed

160793
freebsd	linux	freebsd	solaris
is there a place where i can upload my code and have it tested across a bunch of different systems like other linux flavors and things like solaris freebsd and other operating systems

160852
profiling	instrumentation
you can instrumentation profiling and explore the behavior or code in both user space and kernel space

160876
ubuntu	linux
i have a from what i can tell perfectly working linux setup ubuntu 8.04 where all tools nslookup curl wget firefox etc are able to resolve addresses

160899
rss	feed
you could use the fetch page module trim it to just the items inside the news feed loop though each list item and use an item builder module to mangle the relevant bits as a proper rss feed

160913
width	height
it seems i can only adjust the height of the header cell but not the width

160942
division	modulo
this is faster than using division or modulo

161024
boost	stl
using good libraries like boost stl

161038
opensuse	linux
take a look at the opensuse build service it includes a fairly wide variety of linux distros not just suse opensuse

161077
disk	ram
in a rare situation and you could construct such an example enough space just happens to be available in part of the heap which is already in ram but allocating a new page for the stack has to wait for some other page to get written out to disk

161105
min	max
if you want the first with after the first without change the subquery to use min instead of max

161115
ubuntu	debian
quick start guide - slightly ubuntu debian specific

161120
jobs	cron
hudson monitors executions of repeated jobs such as building a software project or jobs run by cron

161121
put	get
once you get the 3 line segments converted into series of points you can put all points into a bucket and group all points by y

161127
mouse	keyboard
we can fudge it by deliberately swallowing mouse and keyboard events but am i missing some fundamental property like setting isenabled to false without affecting its visual style that gives us what we want

161132
cpu	processors
processors do 1b things a second one if a frame is irrelevant pretty much the only relevant cpu operations are n 2 where n 100 and blowing your l2 cache and of course busy waiting for disk access

161136
multiplying	add
what you have to do is choose two vectors sides of your triangle multiplying each with a random number in 0 1 and add them up

161149
onclick	onfocus
i can see that it would be good to have expansion contraction onclick in which case textmate - again mac - though css suport isn t as good as cssedit but onfocus

161159
solaris	aix
be aware that most of the options discussed in other answers are not standard on platforms that do not use the gnu utilities solaris aix hp-ux for instance

161182
firefox	safari
tested the font-size with absolute measurements in firefox safari and ie6 so it should be pretty portable

161182
width	font-size	letter-spacing	font-size
edit note that you may also need to play around with settings such as the letter-spacing property as well and experiment with what font you use since the font-size setting isn t really the width of the letters which will be different based on letter-spacing and font proportional to length

161193
mouse	keyboard
for example do you use keyboard more than mouse

161202
cvs	svn
the first one can be solved by using svn +ssh which is the more comparable format as cvs uses its own protocol as well

161216
cvs	svn
svn was supposed to be better than cvs but in some areas that didn t work well

161216
cvs	svn
the other distributed tools are a lot faster svn is slow as hell even cvs can be faster sometimes have much more useful features than svn are developing rapidly while seeing any new feature in svn takes years

161222
ant	maven
i m considering switching back to a pure eclipse project with no ant and no maven involved

161279
verilog	vhdl
and if we look at the experience of people like the fpga designers we see that programming exclusively graphically just doesn t work - hence languages like verilog and vhdl

161292
cvs	svn
one aspect of git has not been discussed when it has been brought to your attention in all these other answers git provides a cvs server emulation so that you might migrate to git svn to git is easy and well supported and later use a cvs server interface for accessing the repository in a centralized manner

161358
persistent	transient
the important thing here is the difference between transient detached and persistent entities

161381
versioning	upgrade
keep in mind that you don t need to upgrade the .net versioning

161399
put	get
this works fine locally and on some developmentservers however when i put it live it stopped working because i don t get asp.foo_bar_aspx but _asp.foo_bar_aspx

161430
ant	maven
so i am wondering if maven 2 does the same thing if you are running ant task

161433
google-chrome	safari
i just tested with ff3 ff2 safari ie7 and google-chrome

161443
codeigniter	kohana
in kohana codeigniter i can have a url in this form

161445
equals	gethashcode
in addition to jon skeet s comment make your account struct a class and override the equals and gethashcode method to get nice equality checking

161455
persistent	transient	instances	transient
save persistent both work on transient instances ie instances which have no identifier assigned yet and as such are not saved in the db

161459
ant	maven
maven has the ability to run all your tests for you during the testing cycle of compilation this should stop the need for any ant tasks to run the tests

161459
jar	war
however if you still need to have scripts for other tasks generation of code etc then be weary of maven s ability to generate code and not include it in the compiled binaries jar war though this may well be fixed for newer versions of maven

161464
maven	pom.xml
this has two benefits a you keep track of how the build procedure changes between versions and b other developers don t need to manually find and install all the jar files that your project depends on they simple fetch the pom.xml file and maven takes care of the rest

161528
puts	gets
it gets x out of the condition clause scope of the while and puts it in a reference y which is available in the higher scope

161559
cvs	svn
nowadays i prefer git over svn but it takes a while to get over the threshold if you come from cvs svn land

161561
wtl	atl
for a real-world library use of crtp look at atl and wtl wtl.sf.net

161568
bazaar	git	bazaar	svn
although i tested not thouroughly on windows as i no longer use this system i m quite confident that all the major vcs svn git mercurial bazaar have proper windows-implementation now

161572
bazaar	svn
if you re looking on getting out of svn you might want to evaluate bazaar for a bit

161591
button	checkbox
for example in the wizard you may have multiple controls button checkbox multiple line controls and they all have a different behavior on actions from the enter key

161675
subtract	add
rather than lots of tests i simply add the squares of all three then subtract the square of the smallest one

161717
width	height
if i create a function with jquery that adds an empty div performs some animation inside the blank space created by the div then removes the div the browser never makes room for the empty div height and width are set

161731
google-chrome	firefox
i ve tried with google-chrome and firefox 3 and although the navigation is not as smooth as i like the problem seems fixed

161733
mouse	keyboard
they are as plug and play as a mouse keyboard or flash drive

161746
sorting	filtering
here is a table supporting sorting and filtering

161746
sorting	filtering
look at this example in the incubator which supports multi-column sorting and fixed header but unfortunately no filtering

161778
ingres	mysql	ingres	oracle	interbase	ingres
sql mysql mssql 2000 mssql 7 ingres interbase 6 oracle sybase

161821
cvs	svn
if your team is already familiar with version and source control softwares like cvs or svn then for a simple and small project such as you claim it is i would recommend you stick to svn

161821
pull	push
i am really comfortable with svn but for the current e-commerce project i am doing on django i decided to work on git i am using git in svn-mode that is with a centralised repo that i push to and pull from in order to collaborate with at least one other developer

161860
gif	png
another way around this is to use 2 separate images e.g a gif and a transparent png and target your css accordingly

161947
margin	height
this will recursively add up the rendered height not just the styled height for each child element and any associated margin and padding and return an accurate figure for element height

161953
bazaar	git
i d recommend trying or reading the documentation of at least mercurial git and bazaar

161983
struts	stripes
i think you ll find that gwt complements something like stripes much more than it does struts

161983
struts	stripes
i don t want to start some kind of flame development platform war but in my opinion stripes is a far superior and easier to use framework than struts we migrated from struts a year ago and have never looked back

162011
nant	cruisecontrol
i am executing the nant build file with a task in cruisecontrol

162011
nant	cruisecontrol
so nant is running the tests not cruisecontrol

162047
int	chars
what i think you need is a strlen-ish function go ahead and write it int stringlength const chars s

162047
int	chars
then you need a function called int scanback const chars s const chars matches int start which starts at start goes down to z as long as the chars being scanned at s id contained in matches return the last index where a match is found

162047
int	chars
then you need a function called int scanfront const chars s const chars matches which starts at 0 and scans forward as long as the chars being scanned at s is contained in matches returning the last index where a match is found

162047
int	chars
then you need a function called int charinstring chars c const chars s which returns non-zero if c is contained in s 0 otherwise

162154
textarea	textbox
example if i am here typing in this textarea i would like to be able to get the text same way if i were in the subject textbox in my outlook

162159
range	max
for example i use the the keypress event to prevent letters in a text box set a max number of characters and that a number is with in a range

162182
pull	push
maybe it would be a good idea to look at pull media instead of push media for your application

162182
rss	feed
you could put the content of the mass mailings up on a website and notify interested readers with an rss feed for example

162182
rss	feed
you might as well provide an rss feed to those pages as an alternative for the users who do want to use it

162184
client-side	server-side
in short - always always validate server-side and then consider client-side validation as an added extra to enhance the end user experience

162290
jsf	wicket	jsf	stripes	struts	wicket	struts	stripes	wicket	stripes
investigate jsf wicket struts 2 stripes - whichever one you use depends on your specific needs as they all have different strengths

162309
pop-up	dialog
to pop-up the uac dialog in vista when writing to the hklm registry hive we opt to not use the win32 registry api as when vista permissions are lacking we d need to relaunch our entire application with administrator rights

162319
tapestry	wicket	tapestry	struts	struts	wicket
for some of the java-only technologies investigate jsp servlets struts struts2 which is the updated version of webwork spring mvc tapestry web4j wicket

162358
mouse	keyboard
i use a single mouse and keyboard through synergy

162366
uninstall	upgrade
i have a situation in which it is undesirable to perform a complete uninstall reinstall of a web site but in which periodic bug fixes and minor upgrade are made

162412
mp3	wav
i d go with converting the audio to wav or mp3 on the server

162534
iprincipal	iidentity
so can you advice me how to deal with iprincipal and iidentity

162579
client-side	server-side
there are some validations that can t even be properly done in server-side application code and are utterly impossible in client-side code because they depend on the current state of the database

162606
sequence	permutation
this routine parameterized by an index into the set of all permutation would return the next number in the sequence

162664
struts	stripes
struts 2 and stripes are more modern and very similar to each other

162664
jsf	wicket
on java the popular component frameworks are jsf a standard and wicket

162667
iprincipal	iidentity
just substitute the correct types iprincipal iidentity if needed

162718
webkit	gecko
i m wondering how does one integrate a gecko or webkit one

162718
webkit	gecko
where s the best place to find the core for gecko and or webkit in an embeddable format

162785
post	put
you could put the text into an invisible span and read that spans width but basicly this looks like someone trying to sabotage your site and therefore i would recommend banning post with words longer than a certain lenth for example 30 characters without spaces allowing links to be longer

162797
firefox	safari
it must work in ie6 ie7 firefox for windows macosx linux and safari

162799
opml	xml
it s xml so if you needed to store more data then the opml specification supplies you can always add your own namespace

162799
opml	rss
additionally importing and exporting from other rss readers is all done via opml

162864
rss	feed
the other caveat is that i m sure you re going to want the end user to be able to categorize their rss feed and be able to potentially search sort them and having that kind of datatable style will help with this

162874
jar	war
the problem is that my custom jar is being excluded from the war file

162900
width	height
you can t have one property like that but you could create two properties which both manipulated the same underlying field - just like height width size in windows forms

162904
public	protected
it processes an entire project or a specific file and shows various unused dead code methods as well as suggesting visibility changes a public method that could be protected or private

162907
mouse	keyboard
enter the keyboard mouse preference pane

162945
cvs	svn
you could very easy implement a local version of svn cvs and interface in it through your applications add new files remove old ones

162960
cvs	svn
from what i saw cvs svn can t handle something like this or am i wrong

162991
swt	swing
once created those widgets will be integrated with swt swing or qtjambi framework

162991
swt	swing
i will probably choose swt swing or qtjambi for the ui controls but i am wondering what to do with the graphical part of the simulation

163029
pdfbox	itext
check out pdfbox or itext

163034
nexus	artifactory
i would suggest using a maven proxy like archiva artifactory or nexus and defining your repo list on the server side

163072
swt	swing
you can use an swt canvas or swing canvas or opengl canvas via jogl ... and set it up as an observer of your simulation and whenever the simulation state changes you can redraw the new state

163084
intersect	contains
relationships such as contains within or intersect are using the mbr not the exact geometry shape an ellipse is treated like a rectangle

163188
integer	fractions
the key here is in the third line of code the division operator performs an integer division so that result are missing the fractions part of the result

163188
division	multiplication	division	subtract
first do the division and the multiplication then subtract the result from the original number

163188
subtraction	multiplication	division	multiplication	division	subtraction
we could leave them out since the priority is higher for division and multiplication than of subtraction but this gives us more readable code

163228
post	put
but the flex code has to use post but sets the http header x-method-override to delete you can do the same for put i presume

163232
short	base
especial since these comments relevancy is very short lived and they tend to build up littering the code base

163235
int	chars
it s so tightly coupled to a standard von neumann cpu architecture that no standard library or runtime is required to implement most of its features pointers chars strings automatic variables on the stack int arithmetic etc

163248
ienumerable	iqueryable
to understand this a bit better you really need to understand the difference between iqueryable and ienumerable and at which point a linq to sql query stops being iqueryable and becomes ienumerable

163302
folder	directory
how do i get modrewrite to entirely ignore the vip directory so that all requests pass directly to the folder

163302
folder	directory
the folder are within a wordpress directory

163321
coalesce	isnull
coalesce function same isnull function

163327
cvs	svn
also situations arise when there is a good reason to move code from one class to another or to rename files which would make it even harder to find the root of the reason behind a certain section of code renaming not so much of an issue with svn but a pain with cvs

163341
profiler	vtune
you can find out which one you are using a profiler that will measure both cpu and l2 misses like intel s vtune

163359
rss	feed
most rss feed are only written to deliver a relatively short period of time - all items in a feed generally need you to have created your own archive over time

163365
post	get
note i am submitting my own answer as part of the accepted way of sharing a tip but if anyone has a better solution feel free to post it here it may get more votes than my method

163382
post	get
can someone enlighten me as to specifically why i get the error message i will post at the end please

163395
google-chrome	firefox
i no longer have a windows pc available to me so i can only test on google-chrome firefox on ubuntu

163395
google-chrome	firefox
my results work 100 consistently on google-chrome and let s say somewhere around 70 - 80 on firefox but i don t imagine it would be incredibly difficult to find the inconsistencies

163395
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
it s not perfect and it s most definitely a hack but i got it to work pretty well on winxp ie firefox safari google-chrome and opera

163395
opera	safari
when you don t set a font mozilla uses monospace by default ie uses courier new opera courier new with quotes safari lucida grand with single quotes

163395
opera	safari
when you do set the font to monospace mozilla and ie take what you give them safari comes out as -webkit-monospace and opera stays with courier new

163395
punctuation	words
punctuation counts as a part of the words

163417
inline-functions	inlining
any compiler worth its salt should be capable of inlining a small function as if it were a macro and an inline-functions will respect namespaces and other scopes as well as evaluating all the arguments once

163492
children	parent
think of it like a tree where the nodes with no children are final outcomes and every branch between a node and it s parent or children is a state each one keyed differently

163544
int	chars
- if we talk about simple data types such as int and chars there is little difference between an array and a pointer

163544
int	chars
what if you accidentally try and print a variable of the type int instead of a chars pointer with the s formatter

163544
calloc	malloc
using malloc calloc or similar

163551
put	get
now when i try to refer to an image from the list directly before i get the name of the image put inside imagelocation

163620
strcpy	strncpy
so i changed strcpy to strncpy and it got rid of the garbage

163707
cvs	svn
in cvs i would just go to the attic to find it how do i find a file in svn without having to go back to a revision where it existed especially annoying since i have no idea really when i deleted -- one week ago two weeks ago...

163722
yourkit	jprofiler
as of writing this question 2008-10-02 jprofiler was at 5.1.4 and yourkit was 7.5

163727
jar	war
i use the maven-buildnumber-plugin to generate my version number for jar war ear packages

163730
hash	md5
you could write a script that checks the crc or md5 hash of each file from the source and target folders and only perform the overwrite if the file has changed

163754
ubuntu	debian
it is included in the standard emacs distribution and in emacs21-common or emacs22-common on ubuntu and debian at least

163850
width	height
you may also want to debug the x y width height values of each of your components to make sure they re what you expect - something i find helpful with doing layout is to draw the layout on paper and start writing sizes and coordinates so that i can see that my calculations are right

164002
fseek	fread
i use fseek to determine the length of the file and then use fread to read in the file

164004
perforce	svn
i would say svn on price free perforce on ease of integration

164023
accessor	properties
obtaining a properties value using the get accessor would have an observable side effect

164073
innodb	myisam
i know with myisam tables you can get the table def update time but thats not so true with innodb and i ve found its not even reliable to look at the .frm file for an idea of when the definition might have been modified..

164093
serializable	deserialization
theres a good way to make the serializable and deserialization

164124
rss	feed
i m working on an rss feed for a custom tasking system we use and i m still wrapping my head around how things should work

164126
for-loop	loops
syntax to cover assignment operation if then else for-loop while loops select input output

164182
integer	unsigned
i use unsigned long int for my timer counters 32-bit since that is the native sized integer on my hardware platform and that gives me elapsed times from 1 ms to about 49.7 days

164224
put	get
and i put 7 rows with score 23 to get a large number of decimal places and then changed one row with score 43 to generate a second number with a large number of decimal places

164242
int	chars
to serialise to a chars array invest a byte at the beginning to indicate the size of int and the byte order - you will need this later

164297
versioning	upgrade
i would like to upgrade the code to the recent versioning of powerbuilder but there are some intermediate versioning of powerbuilder that have binary dependencies to an old microsoft java dll that microsoft no longer can distribute due to some court case

164329
aggregate-functions	sum	min	max
group by lets you use aggregate-functions like avg max min sum and count

164368
profiler	yourkit
i ve used yourkit and it is a very nice profiler the best i ve ever used in java i ve used a variety of others over the years

164378
getter	setter
basically i need to take a .class file or a collection of them parse the bytecode to determine all of the data members and perhaps getter setter and then write something that can output code in a different language to create a class with the same structure

164393
nant	cruisecontrol
after some one checks something in have a box setup to check this stat i ll probably use nant and cruisecontrol or something to handle the management of the cvs well starteam in my case but do you know of any scriptable or command line utility to accurately cycle through source code looking for string literals

164407
yourkit	jprofiler
intellij seems to switch their recommendation back and forth between yourkit and jprofiler so i would guess their feature sets are similar

164416
public	protected
you can add public members are run time with no additional code and can affect protected private members using the magical overloading methods __get __set

164417
csc	vbc
you can actually go into the microsoft.csharp.targets or microsoft.visualbasic.targets file located in the framework directory usually c windows microsoft.net framework v3.5 and modify the csc or vbc task parameters to include additional reference dependencies

164437
yourkit	jprofiler
i ve used both jprofiler 4 and yourkit 7.5 and yourkit wins hands down

164437
yourkit	jprofiler
it s so much less invasive than jprofile in that i ll happy run production servers with the yourkit agent installed which i would never do with jprofiler

164500
int	double
use const when you have a variable of a type you can know at runtime string literal int double enums ... that you want all instances or consumers of a class to have access to where the value should not change

164503
move	drag
if you want to move past the error to see what would have happened had the error not occurred you can drag the yellow-highlighted line the line that will execute next down to the next line of code after the offending one

164542
opera	safari
if you are using firebug and need to support ie safari or opera as well firebug lite adds console.log support to these browsers

164548
avr	microcontroller
today avr and pic are probably the most common microcontroller among hobbyists

164553
accessor	properties
obtaining a properties value using the get accessor would have an observable side effect

164566
bash	zsh
i could see these being potential enhancements to the extension but for now i can work around them with a bash zsh shell function in my starup file

164595
rss	feed
of course if you re writing both the producer and consumer of the rss and your goal is that the feed always contains the full set of assigned tasks just updating the pubdate will work just fine

164597
chown	sudo
i recursively set permissions on the server directory to richard developers using sudo chown -r richard developers server

164672
int	double
they have strictly defined lengths for byte short int long and single double precision floats equal on every system

164691
getter	setter
the endless getter and setter that java requires aren t as often used in python

164691
getattr	setattr
python introspection is more flexible you have access to an object s internal dictionary of attribute values and you have first class functions like getattr and setattr

164691
getter	setter
further you have the property function which is often used to bind getter and setter to a single name that behaves like a simple attribute but is actually well-defined method function calls

164748
post	get
if i get a request or two i ll post it and then come back and edit this response to point others to the source as well

164752
hide	show
the two functional states of show and hide along with the meta data of publish draft and archive are intermixed in the same column of status

164798
centos	linux	centos	solaris
sun studio includes a full ide plus a very high performance compiler and is available for red hat or centos and suse linux platforms as well as solaris

164819
hide	show
at the point that you decide your business logic needs additional data to make the decision whether to show or hide an article perhaps an isapproved flag then you can store that data

164830
min	max	minimum	max
average minimum and maximum can be calculated with the avg min and max functions

164854
put	get
in my experience you need to put your link inside a onrelease handler or mouseevent.click in as3 for it to not get blocked

164990
folder	directory
should i simply reference the dll in the build artifacts directory or should i implement another nant task that copies these to a thirdparty libs folder

165019
int	chars
i would work hard to not use chars or varchar as a pk but use an int with an auto_increment instead

165022
versioning	upgrade
the reason is your core framework assemblies in .net 2 are upgrade and have new versioning numbers which the app wasn t compiled against

165093
simulink	labview
labview and simulink are two graphical programming environments

165110
client-side	server-side
client-side javascript or server-side insert language of choice is the way to go

165121
int	chars
i would work hard to not use chars or varchar as a pk but use an int with an auto_increment instead.

165167
ubuntu	linux
if you can t get away from windows use vmware and run some form of linux ubuntu is popular

165172
int	double	int	boolean
normal value types boolean int longs float double enum and structs are not nullable

165174
kate	kde
i really enjoy kate part of kde

165209
swt	swing
i get the impression swing swt seem to more like winforms

165238
octal	decimal	octal	hex
o u x x are for unsigned integral types as octal decimal hex and hex

165291
hide	show
and hide show it using the steps above

165310
firefox	safari
that actually sounds like a bug in the browser -- you could file at if it s in safari or for firefox

165575
getter	setter
another example which may be more meaningful is that i need to call some method when a setter or getter is used

165581
getter	setter
if you add your own getter setter logic the compiler will use your code instead of its auto-generated code but as far as the users of that property are concerned nothing has changed

165588
getter	setter
when using automatic properties you don t get direct access to the underlying backing variable and you don t get access to the actual logic that gets implemented in the property getter and setter

165588
getter	setter
you would then implement the appropriate logic in the getter setter

165592
getter	setter
and later on if you want to implement getter and setter for the property only then you create a explicit private member for it and add the logic

165641
cpu	affinity
if you could call a function that returns a number indicating what cpu the thread is running on without using affinity the answer would often be wrong as soon as the function returned

165700
apache	nginx
until the release of phusion passenger aka mod_rails the standard for deployment was not fastcgi but using a cluster of mongrel servers fronted by apache and mod_proxy or nginx etc

165720
post	put
unfortunately that same browser won t allow me to test http put delete and to a certain degree even http post

165748
hide	show
which will show mybox hide the specified children and then blink the box

165779
post	put
unfortunately that same browser won t allow me to test http put delete and to a certain degree even http post

165779
post	get
i ve also heard that browsers support only get and post from some other sources like

165817
vim	emacs
question and i m not interested in text editors no matter how awesome they may be and i don t consider either vim or emacs to be an ide so.

165846
nexus	artifactory
some of the other questions and answers here on so extol the virtues of using an enterprise repository tool like archiva artifactory or nexus

165853
folder	directory
the source code directory is unfortunately hard coded into the pdb s however if you know the folder required you can use windows concept of symbolic links junctions

165886
rss	feed
all of the tags based on keywords have rss feed attached to them so i d start by subscribing to relevant keywords and searching the data

165896
accessor	properties
python does not need to define accessor right from the beginning since converting attributes into properties is quick and painless

165911
getter	setter
if you do find yourself needing to be able to write getter and setter then what you want to look for is python class properties and ryan tomayko s article on

165911
getter	setter
getter setter fuxors is a great place to start albeit a little long

165925
getter	setter
there is no real point of doing getter setter in python you can t protect stuff anyway and if you need to execute some extra code when getting setting the property look at the property builtin python -c help property

165943
put	get
also if you put a date t and time t in the beginning and in the end of that batch file you will get the times it was at that point and you can map your script running time and order

165951
stdout	stderr
i was kind of sure that there was an easy way to do this - a generic service wrapper that can be configured with a log file for stdout and stderr

165958
haskell	ocaml	erlang	ocaml
it combines a software stack with a code generation engine to build services that work efficiently and seamlessly between c++ java python php ruby erlang perl haskell c# cocoa smalltalk and ocaml

165958
serializable	deserialization
it can work over tcp sockets and the serializable deserialization is already built-in

165972
stdout	stderr
when you got that running you can use the process class to start the application and configure it so that you can handle stdout stderr yourself processstartinfo is your friend

166048
int	double	int	chars	int	boolean
however java knows only a few primitive types among them int double boolean and chars along with enums which behave in this manner

166127
pop-up	dialog
i tried the example above with ctrl+s but firefox s save dialog still pop-up

166130
return-value-optimization	nrvo
this is a trivial case for nrvo â names return-value-optimization a misnomer in this case since there s no name

166138
vb.net	vb6
the app is currently written in vb6 and while its going to go to vb.net c# in the future i need to find a way to pick up vb6 now

166140
filesystems	fat
i ve learned a lot by looking at a specific subject like the fat driver implementation and filesystems abstraction

166158
opera	safari
according to wikipedia xmlhttprequest first appeared in internet explorer 5 as an activex object but has since been made into a standard and has been included for use in javascript in the mozilla family since 1.0 apple safari 1.2 opera 8.0 and ie 7.0

166158
post	get	post	put	put	get
the open method on the object takes the http method as an argument - and is specified as taking any valid http method see the item number 5 of the link - including get post head put and delete as specified by rfc 2616

166158
post	get	post	put	put	get
as a side note ie 7â 8 only permit the following http methods get post head put delete move propfind proppatch mkcol copy lock unlock and options

166190
put	get
using datatable.clear will fail if there are any constraints applied that would be violated but using datatable.reset will get rid of anything and everything that has been put in place since the datatable was created

166194
min	max
folk should be aware that the set function max min count etc can be omitted so that they can understand the coder s intent when it is

166196
des	aes
i know you said you don t care about how secure it is but if you chose des you might as well take aes it is the more up-to-date encryption method

166218
public	protected
in progamming there s something to be said for case sensitivity for instance having a public property foo and a corresponding private protected field foo

166245
disk	ram
if this is something you re going to be fetching on a regular basis it might be worthwhile to prefetch the data from disk or the database doesn t matter and have your script pull it from a ram cache like memcached

166267
post	get
or the excellent jquery form plugin that post your files through an iframe to get the effect

166299
google-chrome	firefox
occurs on ie7 8 firefox google-chrome

166307
solaris	sunos
look at the three different numbering schemes for sunos solaris or the two numbering schemes for java

166309
vsto	add-in
i am currently building an excel 2007 add-in using vsto latest version + sp1 and .net 3.5

166336
lisp	scheme
apart from the multiple- single-namespace issue and guaranteed tail-call elimination which some cl implementations support as well depending on the compiler settings there isn t much that makes scheme as a language more suited to functional programming than common lisp and still most lispers wouldn t call cl a functional language

166336
haskell	scheme
likewise scheme is very much an imperative language as compared to haskell

166337
public	protected
public surface visible from an external assembly public protected and internal protected

166360
int	double
and here i noticed that just int matrix is not good if i occasionally want to use it with decimal or double

166360
multiplying	add
continue with assumption we could have a bunch of objects we are able to add and multiplying - why don t use them in my matrix

166360
multiplying	add
so just after considering it would be a matrix class now i faced that generic t could not be used i need it to support some interface which could add and multiplying

166485
instances	transient
alternatively another approach is to have a decorator for your service registered in the container with a singleton lifestyle but your actual underlying service registered in the container with a transient lifestyle - then when you need to refresh the component just dispose of the transient underlying component held by the decorator and replace it with a freshly resolved instances resolve it using the components key rather then the service to avoid getting the decorator - this avoids issues with other singleton services which aren t being refreshed from holding onto stale services which have been disposed of making them unusable but does require a bit of casting etc

166501
post	get
html forms up to html version 4 and xhtml 1 only support get and post as http request methods

166501
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	post	get	post	put	put	get
however get post put and delete are supported by the implementations of xmlhttprequest ajax calls in all the major web browsers ie firefox safari google-chrome opera

166512
ubuntu	linux
actually there is also a linux version of wtk from sun and i am using it every day on ubuntu

166534
ceil	floor
you may wish to use ceil or round instead of floor

166536
for-loop	arrays
clarification if you are doing a readall followed by a string.split r to get an arrays of all the lines in the file and the using a for-loop to process each line that s code which will generally result in worse performance than reading the file line by line and performing your process on each line

166572
glulookat	glrotate
going this way you ll find that glrotate gltranslate glulookat and friends are quite useless

166572
children	parent
scene nodes might need to be organized in a hierarchy this one can be easy - just add parent children pointers to the node

166608
entity-relationship	diagram
personally i always liked dia it s ubiquitous portable easy to use and supports a whole bunch of other diagram other than just entity-relationship uml so i can use it to make diagram for non-techies

166673
inline	inlining
the size method from std vector should be inline by the compiler meaning that every call to size is replaced by its actual body see the question why should i ever use inline code for more information about inlining

166693
dia	visio
then you can translate it into visio or dia or a uml tool that generates both the sql schema and your object model.

166754
ubuntu	linux
if you are a linux beginner i would start with ubuntu linux server

166754
gentoo	linux
i installed mono on a gentoo server a couple of weeks ago just to find out that it can t run precompiled asp.net sites you be warned linux ain t made for .net

166760
ubuntu	linux
but also works great on ubuntu and ubuntu seems to appeal more to linux newcomers

166805
dedicated	server-communication
with no control over the distance between both servers they might be in two different datacenters and no dedicated inter-server-communication line i d rather run them via round-robin dns or a loadbalancer that redirects clients to either www1.yourdomain.xxx or www2.yourdomain.xxx and handle server-communication carefully

166842
post	put
for put and post we ll usually have files containing the representations to send alongside the curl script

166843
vb.net	vb6
this is a vb6 access app that i inherited and am currently re-writing in vb.net and sql server

166860
int	chars
a comparing two 4-byte chars fields will take exactly as long as comparing two 4-byte int fields

166895
maven	pom.xml
is it possible to have a different set of dependencies in a maven pom.xml file for different profiles

166918
profiling	debugging
it can also interface with the zend platform if you have that for online profiling and debugging

166985
inline	inlining
inlining is about as hidden as these things get and 3rd party containers may have virtual function tables - which means you may not get inline

167002
perforce	svn
i used to work with subversion and a system tray tool svn notifier to monitor the repository so i would immediately see when my local copy was not up-to-date anymore and i am wondering if some equivalent was available for perforce on windows

167004
mockups	balsamiq
i am attempting to set up an nmake makefile to export our balsamiq mockups files to png files automatically but i m afraid i can t make heads nor tails of how to make a generic rule for doing so without explicitly listing all the files i want exported

167018
cpu	processors
i like that it tends to use my cpu to its fullest 2 cores and would theoretically scale to any number of processors available

167042
nunit	mstest
i tend to use it with team coverage which lets me see the coverage directly in the editor even though the tests are nunit not mstest based

167043
firefox	safari
this will allow entry to be right-justified and at least in firefox 3 ie 7 and safari will even appear to flow from the right

167050
children	parent
instead of insert 1000 rows into a parent table then inserting 5000 rows into a child table you now have to insert the parent rows one at a time in a cursor or some other loop just to get the generated ids so that you can assign them to the related children

167189
printf	strcpy
so thing like strcpy printf etc

167205
post	get
be sure to sanitize your get post input in this case so as to not allow attackers to run arbitrary commands on your machine

167222
many-to-one	one-to-many
if you have a one-to-many or a many-to-one relationship you will not

167247
superclass	subclassing
how do i stop a function procedure in a superclass from been overridden in a subclassing in delphi 2007

167278
bash	tcsh
slightly longer answer the usual shells sh ksh csh tcsh bash do not have any hooks for you to hang actions on ok so bash2 has context sensitive tab-completion

167284
profiling	debugging
just put the dependency for the release profiling inside the profiling declaration itself and do the same for debugging

167341
valgrind	memcheck
valgrind --tool memcheck --leak-check full . a.out

167413
cvs	svn
we are migrationg from cvs to svn and embracing some kind of revision management in order to enforce order to development testing release cycle

167423
pull	push
databases are typically pull sources and not push so you ll still need to programmatically probe for changes no matter what

167426
post	get
when i post from chrome or ie the data i get in python is empty

167434
boost	stl
but even then it s most likely you would be using plain stl containers and not boost

167435
cpu	processors
as kaboing mentioned maxdop n actually controls the number of cpu cores that are being used in the query processors

167475
filesystems	fat
you still have the rename call on windows though i imagine the guarantees you want cannot be made without knowing the filesystems you re using - no guarantees if you re using fat for instance

167490
boost	allocator
even if you can get a current version of boost to work according to your requirements with custom allocator it may break with a new version of boost

167539
subtract	add
value is the integere value you want to add or subtract if you provide a negative number

167539
getdate	dateadd
select dateadd dd 1 getdate will return a current date + 1 day

167628
trac	bugzilla
for both the wiki and bugzilla we would need to either migrate the existing data into trac or a way to integrate with trac

167681
trac	bugzilla
for bugzilla trac has a script bugzilla2trac.py that will automate the process of importing bugzilla bugs to trac tickets for you

167697
post	get
i ll continue to research this and post here if i find something but i m hoping to get some other good ideas

167730
toolbar	docking
i have no good reason other then imoho are difficult to get to do what you want - if what you want if something other than a docking toolbar

167791
mouse	keyboard
as a programmer i found it very hard to use my laptop and workstation with two different input devices can anyone suggest a good solution to use single mouse and keyboard to control my two machines

167793
mouse	keyboard
synergy lets you easily share a single mouse and keyboard between

167793
mouse	keyboard
redirecting the mouse and keyboard is

167811
mouse	keyboard
synergy is great but also give something like vnc a try it consolidates not only the keyboard and mouse but also the screen

167813
mouse	keyboard
what you want is a small gadget called a kvm switch keyboard video and mouse switch

167841
post	get
you could try using the post redirect get pattern

167841
post	get
that way if a user refreshes s he is refreshing the get command rather than the post

167878
rss	feed
all you have to do is type the url of the rss feed with the georss data within into the box on google maps

167878
rss	feed
search for merge feed or merge rss on there and you can find many examples that you can copy and modify

167909
kinematics	particle
i m interested in command-line applications even those that i can just execute and have spit out an answer without needing inputs for things like kinematics planar motion newton s laws gravitation work energy momentum and impulse systems of particle rotational kinematics and dynamics angular momentum static equilibrium oscillatory motion wave motion sound physical optics electrostatics gauss law electric field and potential capacitance resistance dc circuits magnetic field ampere s law and inductance

167922
put	get
usb interfaces will also get put to sleep randomly

167922
mouse	keyboard
the net effect of this was that it was very difficult to get two machines to boot up and work on the kvm switch and the switch would lose keyboard or mouse input on one or both machines every few days

167922
mouse	keyboard
these have two dvi inputs and i used one of my older belkin ps 2 switches to switch the keyboard and mouse

167922
mouse	keyboard
the keyboard and mouse are switched off the kvm switch

168023
hide	show
quick experiment with visual studio 2005 show that you can enclose those headers in your own named namespace and then use what you need from this namespace but don t use the whole namespace as it will introduces the namespace you want to hide

168056
bcel	cglib
many libraries use cglib bcel javasist or janino to generate bytecode for new classes at runtime and then load them from controlled classloader

168056
profiler	yourkit
you can catch these with a decent profiler i use yourkit - search for multiple classloader instances with the same retained size

168060
range	max	range	min	min	max
7.2 6 for an enumeration where e min is the smallest enumerator and e max is the largest the values of the enumeration are the values of the underlying type in the range b min to b max where b min and b max are respectively the smallest and largest values of the smallest bitfield that can store e min and e max

168060
min	max
defines an enumerated type where e min is 1 and e max is 4

168129
scheme	racket
update plt scheme is now called racket

168221
accessor	properties
if you expose it as a properties from the very beginning you can make whatever changes to the properties accessor functions that you need and the class s interface remains unchanged

168283
vim	emacs
i know that some people swear against using a language-specific ide ever vim emacs or die

168366
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i have a form that submits just fine in firefox safari google-chrome - but does absolutely nothing in ie or opera

168366
onclick	onsubmit
if i attach an onclick handler to the submit button i can see that the button is being clicked - but if i attach an onsubmit handler to the form i get nothing

168366
submit	submission
if i make the button onclick handler submit the form through javascript it works fine - it s just the direct submission that s not working

168366
opera	firefox
so ie and opera were ignoring the nested form correctly i assume but firefox et al were being more forgiving and allowing the form to submit

168371
vim	notepad++
i use notepad++ or vim for anything in the lamp stack - i ve never found anything particularly useful in the ides for those technologies unless you could the mysql client tools as an ide which i use when i am able to

168413
gtk	motif
you still have to use a windowing framework specific to the os you run on mfc win32 motif gtk qt etc.

168431
mouse	keyboard
but if you keep in mind that you probably had a reason for wanting to go to the definition the ctrl -click workflow saves you an instance of moving between the keyboard and mouse

168441
switching	screens
it takes 20 seconds to start up you have to wait a second or so for it to switching between screens

168463
boost	stl
what about the stl or boost data structures specifically pointer containter doesn t work for you

168477
range	max	range	min	min	max
max and min inclusive exclusive limit the range of the numbers

168485
notepad++	scite
php perl javascript bash or most other languages notepad++ on windows scite on linux

168524
int	double
you cannot add a new interface for int or double

168524
multiplying	add
but you can declare an interface for an object that can multiplying and add values of some generic type

168525
accessor	properties
to retain a high degree of extensibility without the pain of re-compiling all your assemblies you want to use public properties as accessor

168525
getter	setter
this contract is enforced with an interface and fulfilled by the getter and setter of your class that inherits this interface

168525
getter	setter
later on should you create additional classes from that interface you have flexibility of adhering to the contract with the use of the properties but since you are providing the data via the getter and setter the implementation or process of assembling data can anything you want as along as it returns the type that the contract expects

168531
backtracking	greedy
now + is greedy which forces backtracking but the negated char class require a char-by-char comparison

168539
vb6	vba
vba which is really a dialect of vb6 is slow for these kind of applications

168539
vb.net	vb6	vb6	vba
this has an example of how to do what you want zipping using windows built-in zip capabilities from vb.net it shouldn t be much different from vba or vb6

168542
equals	gethashcode	equals	tostring	tostring	gethashcode
one thing i would like to see is the ability to create named types with simple declarations which would generate the properties and constructor in the same way as for anonymous types as well as overriding equals gethashcode tostring in the same useful way

168649
kde	gnome
on linux you have several choices gtk-based gnome company qt-based kde company if you re a sucker for punishment you can go for pure x and then you are more-or-less in for an interesting time both gnome and kde have ide s you can use

168676
swt	swing
update arguabley it shouldn t matter much but i m using swt not swing

168720
mbunit	mstest
our team is looking to switch from using mbunit to mstest but there appears to be some disconnect between the two

168720
mbunit	mstest
does anyone know how to simulate the combinatorialtest and factory attributes from mbunit when using mstest

168783
rss	feed
it contains source code for aspx file that generates an rss feed of tfs checkins which returns information about the most recent n checkins

168845
getter	setter
btw change all getter and setter methods into properties...no need to have the c# library function just the same as the java library unless you are going for perfect interface compatibility

168860
post	get
do a cross page post - from your first page post back to the second page and get the details from httpcontext.current.request.form collection

168878
put	get
if you get a string from the client you should look it up in the business layer using the service layer and put the id of the found object in the vo

168886
post	put
update never fails you try to put all the information in the post and you forget something important

168896
des	aes
if you have an encryption key you could also consider running the text through des or aes or similar

168914
arraylist	treeset	treemap	treeset
that s why java has treemap in addition to treeset treelist arraylist and linkedlist implementations of a list.

168914
arraylist	treeset
however for some reason the java implementation of treeset is quite a bit slower than using an arraylist and a sort

169007
width	height
the select shows a 2px border 0 padding and a width of 996px and height of 18px

169007
width	height
the input shows a 2px border 1px 0 padding and a width of 1000px and height of 16px

169044
jdk1.6	jdk1.5
my development environment is running in jdk1.6 and i need to compile some classes so they are compatible with a client running jdk1.5

169054
margin	height
if you need to create line height you can add a bottom margin

169059
min	max
i first created a simple solution one that tracks the min max for the previous n entries using a circular buffer and a test harness to measure the speed

169059
min	max
in the simple solution each data value is compared against the set of min max values so that s about window_size count tests where window size in the original question is 1000 and count is 3600000

169059
queue	fifo
first off i created a solution that used a fifo queue to store window_size values and a linked list to store the values in ascending order where each node in the linked list was also a node in the queue

169059
queue	fifo
to process a data value the item at the end of the fifo was removed from the linked list and the queue

169059
min	max
the min and max values could then be read from the start and end of the linked list

169083
width	height
instead of testing the width see if the height of the element is more than one line measured in ems since you ll be changing the font size around

169113
free	malloc
to obtain this sort of information we override new delete and malloc free providing our own heap implementations that store stacktraces on allocation and produce a report when the heap is destroyed as well as adding sentinels to detect buffer overruns

169131
min	max
making daily scrums too large of a process -- not sticking to a certain time limit we prefer 15 min max

169170
udp	tcp
the scenario is for both udp and tcp

169208
agile	sprint
being able to track the work that s done every day and make decisions on how to modify by cutting or rebalancing work the rest of the sprint is quite useful on it s own and sound agile to me

169208
agile	sprint
of course if you don t have the other components of the agile process you will have harder time to measure the success of your work so you might think you are on track with the sprint but in fact be nowhere near the point you should be at to deliver quality product on schedule

169216
getter	setter
but what about if you are using getter and setter

169234
unix	bsd	unix	solaris	solaris	bsd
mono can be run on linux bsd unix mac os x solaris and windows operating systems

169258
google-chrome	safari
does anyone know of a technique script library or demo that accomplishes http streaming comet in webkit browsers safari and google-chrome

169278
folder	directory
how do i get modrewrite to entirely ignore the vip directory so that all requests pass directly to the folder

169288
getter	setter
for example value objects that have getter setter constructors and supporting fields

169329
jar	war
all modules need to be separate unit of deployments ideally a war or jar file

169351
maven	pom.xml
you specify your dependencies in the maven pom.xml project object model - its basically an xml description of your project and maven automatically downloads compiles against them and packages them with your app

169353
hide	show
probably somewhere in your render method you show or hide dropdown control based on the property value

169366
imperative	declarative
rather than directly placing graphic elements using imperative semantics you define a grammar that declarative defines the relationship of graphic elements

169397
ant	maven
i converted from ant to maven 2 and have not looked back since

169397
ant	maven
ant and maven 2 different ways of building.with ant you are giving instructions on how to build things

169397
maven	pom.xml	ant	pom.xml	ant	maven
if you have an existing ant build xml you can take a first step in refactoring you build by wrapping that in an maven 2 pom.xml

169401
nhibernate	llblgenpro
you are writing sql instead of using a mapping technology nhibernate linq to sql ef subsonic llblgenpro etc.

169405
ant	maven
ant and maven are definitely the two standards

169405
ant	maven
if you re already familiar with ant and want the dependency management that comes with maven you might take a look at ivy

169405
ant	maven
one thing both ant and maven lack is true control structures in your build scripts

169420
getter	setter
or by putting matching code in the setter getter and use a custom list implementation

169472
getter	setter
plus when using eclipse you can have it automatically generate your getter setter this way

169495
postgresql	mysql
long answer to my knowledge unlike postgresql mysql ms-sql there is no native driver to connect php to sql server compact edition

169536
temp	tmp
ways to keep the space build up from happening too fast is change the location of your my documents folder change environment variables for items such as temp and tmp

169556
hide	show
so add all your items the first time around and then later on you just hide the ones no longer needed and show the ones that are

169582
ant	maven
you don t have to move from ant to maven just for the dependency goodies

169590
mousedown	mouseenter
the mousedown and mouseenter event handlers do not work together very well

169590
mousedown	mouseenter
for instance once a mouse button is clicked and held down c# will fire the mousedown event handler but when the cursor moves over the picturebox the mouseenter event does not fire until the mouse button is realeased

169604
mouseleave	mousedown
use the mousedown event to just detect a down press of a mouse button and set this.capture to true so that you then get other mouse events even when the mouseleave the control you won t get a mouseleave event because you captured the mouse

169605
firefox	safari
wasn t there a qa test website service which would let you specify a web page that you wanted to be rendered in a certain browser ie firefox safari version x y z and they would mail the snapshot back to you

169646
memset	calloc
be sure to initialize pathdeppcopy using memset of calloc

169661
jboss	weblogic
the big gun java ee web servers jboss websphere weblogic etc and windows server iis asp.net are truly in a different league in scalability and performance than your typical lamp stack

169690
jobs	cron
for an excellent description including how to handle non-dotfile configuration like cron jobs via the svnfix script on multiple machines

169716
width	height
top left height and width can differ between

169755
boost	allocator
there are parts of boost that have no allocator and you might find them useful

169758
getter	setter
there are some decent implementations for binding at the field level stuff like getter and setter see jgoodies binding and jsr 295 for examples

169783
clang	llvm
use the llvm clang static analyzer

169825
wxpython	pyglet
it should play well with wxpython or at least i seem to recall posts to the mailing list about wxpython and pyglet being used together

169902
width	height
given two image buffers assume it s an array of ints of size width height with each element a color value how can i map an area defined by a quadrilateral from one image buffer into the other always square image buffer

169919
serializable	deserialization
i bet more mature libraries such as whatever google uses include that kind of serializable and deserialization baked in

169920
antivirus	mcafee
after examining the version information in the file i figured out it was part of the mcafee antivirus suite installed on the computer

169925
int	double
is there a way to round a double to the nearest int too

169994
ienumerable	icollection
on the api level usage both of them are pretty much the same since both implement same set of interfaces such as icollection ienumerable etc

170008
put	get
here s an example of how you can get that information using python and here s an example of it being put to use as a django form field which allows you to easily validate an image s existence filesize dimensions and format given its url

170019
memcached	apc
as an easy first version of the code i am simply using php session s to store the state information instead of something more advanced apc memcached db

170033
plural	inflection
i m looking for a good inflection or well a library that can turn plural into singular and vice verse - which a kind of inflection library for php it could be a part of some current framework or a stand alone library the only requirement i have is that it s compatible with the mit license

170036
profiler	shark
preferably something akin to shark on macos although i am willing to accept that i am going to have to pay for such a profiler on windows

170054
sorting	filtering
just look at the sorting filtering functionality in the new swing jtable

170060
ant	maven
after getting sick of looking at completely useless and unhelpful errors when attempting to do the simplest things like ftp a war file to a server maven was thrown away and ant dusted off

170121
profiling	instrumentation
it uses sampled profiling has some useful ui does not require instrumentation

170134
awt	swing
swing awt components generally have to have a layout before you add things to them - otherwise the ui won t know where to place the subcomponents

170134
width	height
a bit like those html tables we used to see with bizarre combinations of rowspan colspan width and height attributes - which never seemed to look quite how you wanted them

170158
gmail	hotmail
some sites take this a step further and don t allow addresses from domains such as yahoo gmail hotmail etc .

170177
profiling	instrumentation
it was an instrumenting profiling then and it took so long to instrumentation the dll that i was attempting to profiling that i eventually lost patience after an hour

170192
put	get
what do i need to put in a build.xml file to get ant to build it and make a war file

170327
vcproj	csproj
not all of the information is contained in the build file itself as some sub-projects are referenced by their vcproj or csproj files

170354
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and firefox are working perfectly well

170355
mouse	keyboard
including mouse clicks selecting copying navigating with the keyboard changing worksheets .

170355
keyup	mouseup
i had kind of hoped there would be keyup and mouseup events these two would probably have been enough

170415
firefox	safari
i am interested in browsers ie 7 firefox 3 safari 3

170419
put	get
so you get a requirement change request bugfix etc you put it in there

170419
put	get
you get used to this very quickly and it isn t that onerous - you ll need to say i changed this config value and you need to put this file in this directory or add this config file to the system

170478
opera	safari
i tested this in opera 9.5 ie7 ff3 and safari and it works in all of them

170521
urllib	httplib
the idea behind python 3 is to clean up the language syntax itself - remove ambigious stuff like except exception1 exception2 cleanup the standard modules no urllib urllib2 httplib etc

170624
width	height
i have tried to modify the dom adding attributes height width on the fly but seems did not work on ie6

170632
width	height
instead of modifying the height and width attributes of the image try modifying the css height and width

170632
width	height
one common gotcha is that the height and width styles are strings that include a unit like px in the example above

170632
width	height
edit - i think that setting the height and width directly instead of using style.height and style.width should work

170636
width	height
to modify an image proportionally simply only alter one of the width height css properties leave the other set to auto

170651
mouse	keyboard
to be more robust you could then add timing data from keyboard and mouse usage hard disk response times motherboard sensor data eg temperature etc

170688
postgresql	informix
perhaps the biggest reason that oodb have not taken hold dramatically is because of the success of the hybrid object-relational systems that take most of the potential marketshare from oodb postgresql and informix

170709
tinyxml	xerces
tinyxml can be best for simple xml work but if you need more features then try xerces from the apache project

170720
innodb	myisam
tested both myisam and innodb

170734
merb	ruby-on-rails
with merb 1.0 rapidly approaching i would like to know what merb ruby-on-rails users recommend

170734
merb	ruby-on-rails
what was downside for you when you switched to merb from ruby-on-rails

170757
cvs	svn
i ran my own svn server for 2+ years and cvs 2+ years before that

170764
memcached	apc
apc memcached db etc

170816
merb	ruby-on-rails
the biggest downside was figuring out what s different between merb and ruby-on-rails

170816
merb	ruby-on-rails
the biggest upside is that when i ask for help on the merb irc or mailing lists i get help not insulted -- unlike ruby-on-rails

170948
lisp	scheme
here is a solution in scheme because i know that better than common lisp and have an interpreter for checking my work

170950
rss	feed
let s say i have a database and an rss feed

170950
rss	feed
i have to find out what is the new data from an rss feed that isn t already in the database

170954
rss	feed
pull from a unique field of a particular item in the rss feed

170957
rss	feed
most rss feed will have a date with each story - so make a query to pull the latest story s date from the database pull all of the latest stories from the rss feed and compare dates

170974
rss	feed
this approach will handle most cases though as with everything related to rss it breaks down if the feed provider isn t behaving properly

171013
edifact	x12
even huge standards like ansi x12 and edifact were problematic because even when two partners exchanged documents using an agreed standard there were usually enough differences in the way the documents were utilized that it required custom coding to process them

171028
int	chars
int main int argc chars argv

171033
gtk	motif
wxwidgets lets developers create applications for win32 mac os x gtk x11 motif wince and more using one codebase

171099
post	get
as these are post requests they should complete quickly - there s no data to be retrieved and returned as with a get request

171115
pecl	pear
i know there are many pear pecl and other php libraries classes out there that can fit my description - but which ones are maintained used and have proven to be bug-free and efficient

171121
jquery	scriptaculous
i ve been writing php web applications for some time and have come across very nice javascript frameworks such as jquery extjs scriptaculous etc

171157
prepare	execute
but we have also copied features such as prepare execute from pear db

171185
post	get	post	put	put	get
by this i mean you would have to rewrite all urls not only in http headers but in your html content as well do a regex search replace on the html and decode rewrite and resend all get post put data too

171198
maven	pom.xml
i personaly use maven 2 and here is a pom.xml i would use that do just that

171230
rss	feed
i need to get access to the itunes tags in an rss feed using php

171309
division	subtract
i don t know if it s faster but if you want to use a bitwise operator to perform binary division you can use the shift and subtract method described at this page

171321
client-side	server-side
sajax is one of a number of libraries that provide an easy way to link callbacks from client-side js to server-side php

171336
hash	salt	hash	hmac
you should have a keyed hash hmac together with salt or a keyed salt hash

171416
serializable	deserialization
if matching the exact serializable format of firefox is not your aim you could use one of the javascript json serializable deserialization libraries listed at

171435
g++	gcc
i know that the #warning directive is not standard c c++ but several compilers support it including gcc g++

171453
g++	gcc
are you aware of can you name a compiler other than gcc g++ that provides #warning

171478
disk	ram
i had 2gb of ram had been trying to allocate more ram for disk cache but still haven t achieve anything

171495
prepare	execute
all of the above implement prepare and execute

171512
int	boolean
provide an api to access the bits in this 2d map as boolean or even int values

171518
width	height
i think you can do this by calculating the height and width you want with javascript via document.body.clientwidth etc. and then injecting the iframe into your html like this

171518
width	height
element.innerhtml + iframe src height 200 width + document.body.clientwidth 0.8 +

width	height
i m trying to set the width and height of an element with javascript to cover the entire browser viewport and i m successful using document.body.clientheight but in ie6 it seems that i always get horizontal and vertical scrollbars because the element must be slightly too big

171548
client-side	server-side
logic data presentation - you name it - are split and mixed between server-side and client-side code

171631
min	max
now this is working great however the min max and close buttons still are xp default theme

171642
firefox	safari
however the vast majority will be using vanilla ie firefox safari

171664
subtraction	addition
i am building a simple expression parser that then needs to evaluate the simple binary operations such as addition subtraction etc

171665
post	get
to do a real post or pre increment the counter would need to be locked from before the get to after the set

171688
versioning	upgrade
when you reopen a net 1.1 form in .net 2.0 the resx file gets upgrade to a new versioning

171706
floating-point	fixed-point
use fixed-point when the hardware doesn t support floating-point or the hardware implementation sucks

171752
bash	zsh
rush is a replacement for the unix shell bash zsh etc which uses pure ruby syntax

171764
ubuntu	linux
if you can bypass that iirc i booted from the cd and downloaded the normal server kernel and it all worked fine then you end up with an absolutely minimal linux system but backed by the full ubuntu repositories so it s an excellent base for a server

171795
children	parent
perhaps only parent own children and not the other way around

171827
pascal	delphi
i need a complete object pascal syntax preferably delphi 2009

171828
jar	war
i the case of releasing java jar ear jar rar war files i would like to be able to look in at the jar and switch to the same branch version or tag that was the source of the released jar

171865
jar	war
seems a load easier than looking in the war ear jar etc easy time

171876
ready	each
it is my understanding that in the last part of the phase the transaction coordinator asks each node whether it is ready to commit

171899
filtering	grouping
strategy filtering and pipes grouping

171934
memset	memcmp	memcpy	memcmp	memcpy	memset
memset memcpy and memcmp

171942
jdom	xerces
though not related to programming exactly the use of xml parsers that come from multiple sources like xerces jdom

171953
pop-up	dialog
and if i misunderstood and you re talking about a dialog box made via css rather than a pop-up browser window then all the ways of closing that window are elements you could register click handers for.

171958
merb	ruby-on-rails
ruby-on-rails plugins merb uses gems and not all have been ported the most used ones have

171958
merb	ruby-on-rails
doing a straight port of a ruby-on-rails app will not utilize some of the cool features in merb plus syntax differs in places

171958
merb	ruby-on-rails
overall if you re comfortable with ruby-on-rails switching to merb isn t hard at all

171958
merb	ruby-on-rails
i personally prefer merb over ruby-on-rails as it adopts more ruby conventions

171966
memcpy	memset
if you have a very specific case you can often vastly outperform the system libc and or compiler inlining of memset and memcpy

171966
memcpy	memset
for example for the program i work on i wrote a 16-byte-aligned memcpy and memset designed for small data sizes

171966
memcpy	memset
the memcpy was made for multiple-of-16 sizes greater than or equal to 64 only with data aligned to 16 and memset was made for multiple-of-128 sizes only

171966
memcpy	memset
drop down to around line 600 for the memcpy and memset

171994
post	get
html forms support get and post

172016
memcpy	memset
memset memcpy are mostly written with a basic instruction set in mind and so can be outperformed by specialized sse routines which on the other hand enforce certain alignment constraints

172016
memcpy	memset
for data-sets several hundred kilobytes memcpy memset perform faster than anything you could mock up

172016
memcpy	memset
for data-sets megabytes use a combination of memcpy memset to get the alignment and then use your own sse optimized routines fallback to optimized routines from intel etc

172075
pull	push
default pull push repository origin

172075
pull	push
default pull push options

172078
cvs	svn
in our shop we re in the process of moving from cvs to svn and have been quite pleased with the result

172164
apache	lighttpd
the linux.com article talks about using lighttpd with apache

172177
apache	lighttpd
the benefit of both apache is more powerful and extensible useless if you don t need that power but anyway... and lighttpd is faster at static content

172218
post	get
to get a small string say up to 2000 characters from the database is very quick and probably faster than having the user post it all the time especially if there is more than 1 on a page

172243
clang	llvm
use the llvm clang static analyzer

172258
ready	each
after i m finished with it each week i d like to click one link to uncheck reset all of the items on it so it s ready for the next use

172269
pull	push
as a distributed version control system through its push pull system it helps developers to create a source code eco-system which helps to manage a large pool of developers working on a single project

172270
accessor	properties
declare accessor using properties

172270
accessor	properties
when declaring accessor you should always use the objective-c 2 properties feature

172270
accessor	properties
the properties declarations make the memory management semantics of the accessor explicit

172272
rss	feed
all web clients that i know of are read only meaning that you can only browse the files make diffs set up rss feed but you can not modify the repository in any way

172374
mouseover	mouseout
insert a mouseover and mouseout event

172376
hide	show
in this css file just hide the elements you don t want to show while printing display none

172392
pycrypto	keyczar
i couldn t figure out how to do it with ezpycrypto pycrypto seems to be hung on a moderator swap and googles keyczar does not explain how to set this up - i fear if i don t just get it then i run a risk of introducing insecurity

172449
restrict	shared
then you don t have to bother coding up your own security solution and you re not restrict to a static shared key which if compromised will allow all captured traffic to be decrypted after the fact

172453
filesystems	fat
there is a number of embedded filesystems not fat compatible that designed exactly for this purpose

172472
subtract	add
incday - add a or subtract a number of days

172472
subtract	add
incmonth - add a or subtract a number of months

172472
subtract	add
incweek - add a or subtract a number of weeks

172472
subtract	add
incyear - add a or subtract a number of years

172538
folder	directory
i have a master directory of client folder each of which has projects and each project has sales and delivery

172552
temp	tmp
in my first pass i just created the temp dir at tmp . script but then i tested the script on a computer where i didn t have write access to tmp and i d like to take that case into account

172585
subtraction	addition
no multiplies or divides only addition subtraction and shifts

172587
g++	gcc
what is the difference between g++ and gcc

172592
g++	gcc
gcc and g++ are compiler-drivers of the gnu compiler collection which was once upon a time just the gnu c compiler

172592
g++	gcc
according to 1 and 2 g++ is equivalent to gcc -xc++ -lstdc++ -shared-libgcc the 1st is a compiler option the 2nd two are linker options

172597
g++	gcc
gcc or g++ just choose a different front-end with different default options

172613
g++	gcc
the only notable difference is that i you pass a .c to gcc it will compile as c whereas g++ will always treat it as c++

172639
int	double
that said as per my comment on collin s post the ability to perform things like basic arithmetic increment int32 division etc on for example a matrix t for t in decimal float int double etc is often highly valuable

172663
rss	feed
i need to create a news ticker that is updated via an rss feed

172718
postgresql	mysql
i still use mysql for web sites but for in-house projects i rather choose firebird or postgresql

172728
postgresql	mysql
people using linux are used to install mysql sqlite or postgresql in a second and maybe that s beacuse they don t need windows to run a dbms

172756
width	height
use screen.availwidth and screen.availheight to calculate a suitable size for the height and width parameters in window.open

172787
postgresql	mysql
postgresql and mysql go toe to toe all the time and the choice is not as clear as you made it seem

172793
ironruby	ironpython
1- the homepage points to another page at codeplex the homepage should be clean and just point the advantages of ironpython take the ironruby page as an example its that hides language-developent stuff from the user even though the user has to access ironruby s svn prior using it

172798
lisp	scheme
i have experimented with lisp actually scheme and found it to be a very beautiful language that i am interested in learning more about

172833
sorting	filtering
this has scaling problems selecting from really large datasets but so do all the less-normalized schemas sorting and filtering by a text field will probably always be slower than using an integer for example

172843
calloc	malloc
use calloc instead of malloc

172843
memcpy	malloc
while this will involve the overhead for zeroing memory most compilers are likely to have this routine highly-optimized -- more optimized that malloc new with a call to memcpy

172863
clang	llvm
does anyone have experience with llvm llvm-gcc or clang

172871
folder	directory
i ve tried various folder organizations a top level project directory then broken down by department or person or application but no matter what i try it s still too time consuming to find what i m looking for

172918
width	height
both should take 100 width and 100 height within the container

172928
allegro	sdl
i m toying with sdl or allegro but i have no experience in either so i m open to the best and ideally easiest toolkit out there

172929
g++	gcc
although the gcc and g++ commands do very similar things g++ is designed to be the command you d invoke to compile a c++ program

172943
strcpy	memmove
go ahead and figure out how to write the assembly to replace a few simple stdlib routines like strcpy memmove etc

172959
hash	salt
as jplemme has pointed out you are actually working with a completely separate parrallel system into which live data has been copied and anonymized and the secure login process that uses hash and salt

172968
many-to-many	many-to-one
you won t have the tag entity but the many-to-many lookup table will have to be created as a many-to-one relationship which makes it an entity itself

172992
disk	ram
but it basically matches ram blocks to disk blocks

173007
g++	gcc
also if you use g++ to link the object files it automatically links in the std c++ libraries gcc does not do this

173007
g++	gcc
gcc compiling .cpp and g++ compiling .c .cpp files has a few extra macros

173070
google-chrome	firefox
after some fiddling i found out that the highest possible value of two which when right-shifted by .5 would yield 2 is 2.9999999999999997779553950749686919152736663818359374999999â with the 9 repeating in google-chrome and firefox

173133
int	double
how can i reinterpret cast a float to an int or a double to a long

173162
button	checkbox
when i did this for a project i found that setting the value of select fields radio button and checkbox necessitated more complex code something along the lines of

173162
button	checkbox
as noted in the comment the jquery .val val method handles setting radio button checkbox and selects

173163
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
also if you aren t using firefox you can use firebug lite in ie safari or opera

173168
codeigniter	cakephp
with mature frameworks like zend framework codeigniter and cakephp creating just about anything in php is possible

173214
joomla	phpbb
in a few of the open source applications i ve poked around in including joomla and phpbb they declare a constant in the main includes file and then verify that constant exists in each of the includes

173229
daemons	launchd
you might also want to take a look at any startup scripts that might launchd the fastcgi daemons

173241
bitblt	gdi
other gdi functions such as bitblt link as expected and the compilers compiles with out error or warning

173246
apache	nginx
we use apache 2.2 but will be switching over to nginx once it goes live

173352
gcov	gprof
3. cygwin shell installable complete with perl gcc gprof gcov gdb and related tools bash vim development debugging tools

173365
postgresql	mysql
doesnt mysql postgresql oracle and so on and so on allow you to do that

173490
profiler	gprof
either use a profiler man gprof as another poster suggested or - quick dirty - put a loop around the offending section of code to execute it many times and use clock

173523
django	turbogears
it s python web framework similar to django or turbogears but it doesn t have the overhead of those frameworks

173548
accurev	svn
we evaluated it alongside with plastic scm svn and clearcase-ucm that we already owned and used and decided to dump clearcase and svn both were used in two different groups and to purchase accurev

173586
int	double
that works note the addition of case double in the switch but there may be a better way to do the int float check as they would only work with standard uk us numbers

173602
mouse	keyboard
maybe you just need an keyboard mouse hook

173634
decoder	encoder
if it supports parameters change inside the stream then if you can tell the encoder to put the corresponding header when changing resolution your decoder should automatically switch

173638
rss	feed
properly on different rss feed and

173654
keydown	keyup
intercepting the ctrl+v in keydown or keyup of your form

173701
cvs	svn	cvs	rcs
the other thing you need is some kind of revision control - cvs rcs svn git clearcase.

173703
portrait	landscape
the device allows users to switch from the standard widescreen landscape display format to a portrait one

173715
virtualenv	setuptools
my site-packages directory contains setuptools and virtualenv only

173718
profiling	instrumentation
however even with rdtsc you will be including the time your code was switched out of execution while a better solution than using time clock if you need an exact measurement you will have to turn to a profiling that will instrumentation your code and take into account when your code is not actually executing due to context switches or whatever

173770
lwjgl	jogl
i know how to draw basic objects using jogl or lwjgl to connect to opengl

173796
implements	extends
i also tried an oo approach defining objects for trunk branches leaves all extends an abstract class and implements a genotype interface to vary the kind of trees

173799
width	height
you might have to set a width and height on your as well

173807
disk	ram
now point 2 is the easier to tackle and explain lots of things go faster if you have more ram or a faster machine or faster disk or move over to gig ethernet or such

173829
width	height
in css file set the width of .ui-datepicker-cover to 220px height to 200px

173886
inherited	subclassing
also i would like this behaviour to be inherited by subclassing and not code a custom serializer for every one

174069
kde	gnome
how can i in java or using some other programming language add a new program group in the applications menu in both kde and gnome

174107
for-loop	loops
as a preparation create a serial for-loop template and change your code to use functors to implement loops bodies

174107
atomic	interlocked
what worked great for me was a combination of manual reset event + atomic interlocked counter as a much faster alternative

174119
automake	autotools
i see this often in the build scripts of projects that use autotools autoconf automake

174153
operands	decrement
compiler error the operands of an increment or decrement operator must be a variable property or indexer.

174175
operands	decrement
you are running one of the operands on the result of the other the result of a increment decrement is a value - and you can not use increment decrement on a value it has to be a variable that can be set

174208
width	height
i don t think ie supports the use of auto for setting height width so you could try giving this a numeric value like jarett suggests

174240
vbscript	jscript
has anyone had any experience targetting wsh in the way that vbscript jscript perlscript xbscript and forthscript among other do such that the language can be used from the command line and embedded in server-side web pages

174267
post	get
next question is what method do you use post or get

174267
post	get
as a general rule of thumb you can take the following use post when the request will cause action that changes state on the server and use get when you only retreive data from the server

174365
vsts	tfs
my visual studio team system vsts integration with team foundation server tfs doesn t seem to pick it up

174365
vsts	tfs
is this a feature that isn t part of vsts tfs

174396
rdf	owl
in addition there are some general-purpose rdf rdfs owl search engines you may find helpful

174430
put	get
and put everything dealing with log4net in that file but i still get the same messages

174454
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
aptana studio is the best in my opinion it s based on eclipse and subsequently java so it will run on pretty much anything and has design views supporting firefox opera and safari on os x and windows i assume it does other browsers as well if they are installed

174465
allocator	stl
usually i find that the best bet is to use the stl with custom allocator instead of replacing stl containers with hand rolled ones

174467
boost	stl
however i think that in this case i would almost always buy and use stl - or a better solution something from boost perhaps before rolling my own

174510
google-chrome	firefox
source google-chrome ie firefox

174521
allocator	stl
even if you do not share stl objects across threads many implementations use non-thread safe constructs like ++ for reference counting instead of an interlocked increment style or having non-thread-safe allocator

174535
gif	png
ideally this server side script would take the kml the map s lat lon center and the map zoom level and appropriately merge all of the visible place markers into a single gif or png overlay

174546
folder	directory
either way since deploy seems to be the last step previous steps probably clear the directory and deploy is failing to run leaving your folder empty at the end of the steps

174552
fseek	ftell	fseek	fread	ftell	fread
you may also want to check the error-codes for fseek ftell and fread

174559
vmware	virtualbox
if you are completely new to kernel development i would suggest not starting with hardware development and going to some software-only kernel modules like proc file sysfs or for more complex examples filesystem network development developing on a uml vmware virtualbox .

174653
wiimote	infrared
i d like to use the wiimote accelerometers gyroscopes infrared camera etc etc etc on various applications

174727
temporary	tablespace
temporary tablespace are used to

174728
allocator	stl
as evan mentioned writing proper allocator can help with this but if you re counting every byte used or concerned with memory fragmentation it may be wiser to hand-roll a solution that s tailored for your specific problem as the stl has been optimized for the most general usage

174728
boost	stl
you may also choose not to use stl for a particular case because more applicable containers exist that are not in the current standard such as boost array or boost unordered_map

174761
gif	png
not sure why you want to go to a gif png overlay you can do this directly in kml

174828
libjpeg	libpng
my common library has grown to include code by others mostly things like libjpeg libpng ffmpeg mysql and a few others and i would rather keep the amount of external code in it to a minimum

174839
ubuntu	debian
is there an easy way of cloning entire installed debian ubuntu system

174841
put	get
even when i put a break point in the converter code the debugger just doesn t get there when an update is done to the underlying data -

174882
daemons	systemd
also depending on how often changes are made to either systemd from bookmarks to downloaded isos you may need to run rsync in daemons mode and have it update nearly constantly

174922
implements	extends
i find that it varies a lot depending on the code you are working with - when writing something from scratch test driven it probably takes about the same amount of time to implements the feature as without tests but you save longer term on the quantity of bugs that will be found and how easily you can maintain and extends that code base

174937
maven	m2e
it tells maven a bit more explicitly what you are doing and i ve found that m2e and q4e both like it better

174958
jar	war
however only the application components within that war or ear will use the new jar which may be a problem or an advantage depending on how you ve set up your deployments

174959
eruby	erb
you do need a ruby enabled server such as apache running eruby erb

175008
codeigniter	cakephp
i don t know too much about rails or perl frameworks but php frameworks such as zend symfony codeigniter cakephp etc are used widely

175025
outputstream	inputstream
if you want to use inputstream and outputstream concurrently with socketchannel from looking at the source it appears that you need to call socketchannel.socket and use the streams from that which behave slightly differently

175115
hide	show
i got the tips to show when you stop and hide if you move

175129
put	get
i want to put that sql command dump text into this email when i get a sqlexception which will save me the time of digging through trace logs when a page blows up because of a query

175205
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
in ie and firefox this will make anchors unclickable but in webkit based browsers google-chrome and safari this does nothing

175206
getter	setter
if i have 7-10 parameters in one routine i look at bundling them into a new class but not if that class would be nothing but a bunch of fields with getter and setter - the new class has to do something other than shuffle values in and out

175228
getter	setter
is it ever appropriate to abandon the getmyvalue and setmyvalue pattern of getter and setter if alternative function names make the api more obvious

175228
hide	show
in brief is it better to have a single setvisible bool method or a pair of show and hide methods

175233
hide	show
in the example you gave show and hide make a lot of sense at least to me

175239
hide	show
implicitly the show and hide functions you list are both setters

175266
getter	setter
in general i think setter getter should only set the values of properties

175266
getter	setter
in this case i would argue that using functions to perform the action and update the state is better than having a setter getter that performs an action as a side-effect of updating the property

175267
hide	show
i prefer the show and hide methods because they explicitly tell what you are going

175267
hide	show
plus show and hide are better-named method for an interface imho

175280
hide	show
if switching misvisible really turns visibility of the object on and off immediately than use the show hide scenario

175301
bazaar	svn
you could consider using bazaar as a local repository then committing back to the central svn server

175307
cvs	svn
svn cvs git mecruial anything that doesn t lock files and doesn t leave your source in a proprietary file sytem

175325
minix	aix	unix	aix	unix	solaris	solaris	irix	solaris	minix	solaris	aix	vxworks	qnx	vxworks	minix	qnx	minix
probably the one that will get you farthest is posix after all every unix like system tries to support at least some posix the more the better very little can call themselves really being 100 posix-compliant platforms a ux aix hp-ux irix mac os x 10.5 minix qnx solaris unixware vxworks .

175325
freebsd	netbsd	freebsd	linux	openbsd	netbsd	openbsd	freebsd	openbsd	linux
however there are quite a couple of platforms that offer at least some posix support some more some less and some are almost posix-compliant freebsd linux netbsd beos openbsd .

175337
hide	show
i would go with the isvisible show hide set

175337
hide	show
show and hide make the side effects clear

175372
kate	kde
i use kate kde advanced text editor for most of my development including django

175393
hide	show
otoh operations like show and hide can be easily overridden with different implementations without revealing anything about the internal state

175394
google-chrome	firefox
css seems to be easier to standardize across browsers than javascript though that may be changing with the advent of google-chrome s v8 and firefox s upcoming new rendering tool

175449
children	parent
this way you can reference your tasks by its parent or by its children

175449
children	parent
even though it may have a parent or children

175449
children	parent
just make sure that you don t have a task that has its parent the same as its child or else you ll go into an infinite loop when you do your recursion to find all the children

175511
put	get
that said sometimes it s difficult to get around--i have had to go back and edit in the null when it made sense as a default but i never put it in on the first pass any more

175528
gif	png
the site will support several file formarts from plain text to office documents doc xls ppt ... videos mpeg avi ... images jpg gif png ... pdf s open office etc

175612
put	get
or is it run in a more batch manner - you put in requests then get told later if you can have your slot

175878
opera	google-chrome
google-chrome looks like a major contender but it s still less than 5 as is opera

175887
versioning	upgrade
in one of database tables i store the versioning number of the database structure so i can upgrade any database easily

175892
width	height
make its width height 50 the width of the browser window or something

175893
google-chrome	safari
well since google-chrome is based off of webkit if you test for safari chances are google-chrome will work as well

175905
opera	safari
finally there should be a very specific customer request to invest the time and money making support for the other browsers like opera safari e.t.c

175924
google-chrome	safari
testing google-chrome and the windows version of safari will give you a very good handle on your site s user experience on the mac platform at least if you don t have a mac available for testing

175955
postgresql	mysql
i am currently trying to import a semi-colon delimited text file into a database in c# using oledb where i don t know the type sql server access oracle mysql postgresql etc. currently i m reading in the file as a database using the jet text reader then creating a prepared insert statement populating the fields then commiting at the end

176043
unsigned	short
the arrays module is more like a thin wrapper over c arrays which give you kind of strongly typed containers see docs with access to more c-like types such as signed unsigned short or double which are not part of the built-in types

176053
ready	each
are very easy because you have a ready to use package for each version you deployed

176064
google-chrome	firefox
i know with my website targeting technology people i see about a 30 firefox 55 ie 12 google-chrome and the rest are others for my visitors

176071
opera	safari
highly recommended to fully support opera and safari no missing functionality slightly degraded interfaces are acceptable but only if absolutely necessary

opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
interface degradation is acceptable with ie6 and firefox 2 as long as it is still usable i consider these as end of life browsers and frankly rarely worth the effort also here are older versions of opera and safari but i rarely see significant problems with these

176110
min	max
for a more complicated answer there is such a thing as sample counting clipping detectors that require x consecutive samples to be at the max min value for them to be considered clipping where x may be as high as 7

176115
richfaces	icefaces
i ll second richfaces but also point out icefaces which isn t free but is also very nice

176116
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
others firefox opera safari google-chrome if you strive to write standards-compliant html css and javascript what works in either of these browsers will most probably work with the rest

176137
wgs84	utm
does anyone know of a way in java to convert an earth surface position from lat lon to utm say in wgs84

176143
short	base
long story short is that it is not a completely managed code base but simply a .net wrapper around their com version

176144
opera	safari
second safari has the greatest standards support combined with a marketshare which isn t negligible opera is just hard to justify for cost benefit reasons

176144
firefox	safari
third in my experience going from safari to firefox is usually less problematic than the other way around

176144
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome comes last because it s so likely to just work if safari is good to go

176155
xfce	kde	xfce	gnome	kde	gnome
freedesktop.org standards are followed by gnome kde and xfce so it should work on any distribution

176192
getter	setter
my thought was that i could use setter and getter for each common variable

176220
put	get
these users most likely will not be trying to put in text that would get sanitized but by protecting against it you are protecting their users

176258
hide	show
if all you want to do is conditionally show or hide a div then you could declare it as an asp panel renders to html as a div tag and set it s .visible property

176271
client-side	server-side
you can use client-side validation to save some load on your server or make your app seem more responsive by showing the error sooner when validation fails but you should always validate using server-side code

176271
client-side	server-side
personally i like the asp.net validation controls because it gives you the benefit of client-side validation with security of server-side without having to write your logic twice

176301
mouse	keyboard
i think it s funny when you hear people typing away on the keyboard in crime dramas doing photoshop-type stuff that really requires a mouse

176308
maven	cargo
have a look at cargo and its maven plugin

176342
folder	directory
the registry change would cause the search order to start with the current working directory which you could set to the desired folder in a shortcut

176345
maven	cargo
the cargo maven plugin is a good way to go if you re doing servlet development and want to deploy the resulting war for integration testing

176376
put	get
i want to put 3 into a function and get the first value greater than or equal to 3 in this case i would want to get 6

176459
int	double
the int and double work fine and get stored in the table...but i can t figure out how to get the strings to store.

176467
installation	upgrade
i was able to upgrade the tfs installation at my company by using these resources

176479
gif	png
i have a image upload form that should take image types png jpeg gif resize it and then save it to a path

176479
gif	png
for some reason i can t get the png file types to work it works fine with jpeg gif and the file is copied so it looks like it s something to do with how i m creating the png

176481
vertica	greenplum	vertica	teradata	teradata	greenplum
you may want to look at what companies like teradata netezza greenplum vertica asterdata etc are doing

176516
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	webkit	gecko
do the standards-compliant engines first webkit safari google-chrome and gecko firefox

176542
datamapper	activerecord
these basic patterns will give you an idea of how to structure your objects and the more advanced patterns like activerecord datamapper you ll see how those relate to problem domains beyond where your needs are at the moment

176548
imperative	declarative
in general mixing workflows imperative programming with rest declarative programming is very problematic

176555
bazaar	git
examples darcs git mercurial bazaar

176555
cvs	svn
examples cvs svn visual sourcesafe

176566
post	get
the link points to the corresponding blog which lists post screencasts in descending order so you ll need to go back to this page to get started

176644
google-chrome	firefox
i ve only tested it in google-chrome and firefox as those are the browsers in which i have a javascript console so i can t guarantee it works in internet explorer as i ve never personally used it

176644
google-chrome	firefox
my understanding is that this was an ie-only property that the other browsers picked up and isn t currently in any standards so i d be surprised if firefox and google-chrome support it but ie stopped

176669
post	get	post	put	put	get
resource-orientation is about explicitly modeling state data limiting function to predefined verbs with universal semantics in the case of http get put post delete and leaving the rest of the processing to the client

176682
dateadd	datepart
well you could use a lot of dateadd datepart etc but it will be slow if you have a lot of data as it can t really use an index here

176697
gif	ico	gif	png	gif	bmp	bmp	png	png	ico
icons in other image formats ico bmp png gif photoshop psd jpg and more

176700
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
the contenteditable property is what you want -- it s supported by ie safari and by google-chrome as a byproduct and i think firefox 3 alas not ffx2

176700
firefox	safari
edit olliej so yes the contenteditable attribute in the linked demo works fine in ie firefox and safari

176703
perforce	accurev
i ve been a long time accurev user and have recently moved to a job where i m using perforce

176824
button	checkbox
solution select the project.vbp and from the tool sourcesafe menu choose check out you get a dialog which lets you choose all files you get a checkbox for each and a button for select all

176895
implements	extends
hethmon from manning is a very good book to learn http protocol and will be very useful to someone implements it extends it

176916
webkit	gecko
there may be more my google strategy was to try webkit command-line pdf and gecko command-line pdf basically looking for commandline programs that embed the two popular open-source rendering engines in command-line renderers

176954
int	chars
bitsets have the advantage that they do exactly what they say on the tin - none of this declare an array of chars int but the only legal values are 0 and 1 nonsense

177013
int	boolean
additionally i don t rely on the automatic conversion of int to boolean values but explicitly compare them

177126
min	max
if you want an example that has the proper min and max values too try this one of length 8

177191
inherited	properties
want to avoid inherited properties

177216
udp	tcp
difference between udp and tcp

177234
free	malloc
the routines were used as wrappers around malloc and free

177234
free	malloc
when a buffer of a specific type was allocated we d malloc the memory in blocks if a list of free buffers was empty

177234
free	malloc
we also maintained a list of the blocks of buffers so that we could do a simple cleanup by calling free on each of the actual malloc d buffers

177234
put	get	free	malloc
we had replacement routines for malloc and free that did pointer arithmetic to get the buffer size and then to put the buffer into the free list

177236
stdout	stderr
linux variant when writing a daemon what are the basic building blocks forking a child and killing the parent closing stdin stdout stderr etc.

177264
bitarray	bitset
after that they swept through the bitarray once spitting out the phone numbers for entries that had the bitset high

177337
realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
i don t know what your whole environment is but you might consider wrapping the calls to malloc realloc free on just the vm so that you can pass it off to a handler designed for small pools

177346
hide	show
however slapping labels on methods is faster than building logic to show hide buttons or do security validation in code

177348
google-chrome	safari
works with google-chrome safari like a charm

177363
hash	md5
i ve chosen to go with an md5 hash and it fits fine for my purpose

177369
hash	md5
you could use an elf hash - c code included or some other simple hash function like that instead of md5 or sha-x

177376
hash	md5
personally i d use md5 if you need to store in text or a 256b 32b hash such as sha256 if you can store in binary in this situation

177386
hash	md5
now whether you d be better off truncating the sha-1 hash or using a shorter hash such as md5 i don t know

177386
hash	md5
i think i d be more generally confident when keeping the whole of a hash but md5 has known vulnerabilities which may or may not be a problem for your particular application

177393
versioning	upgrade
this used to work great and then we upgrade versioning of gcc and suddenly started seeing stack overflows

177401
memcpy	memset
if you don t want to use memset you could always declare a static copy of your struct and use memcpy which will give similar performance

177450
queue	fifo
it is easiest to implement a queue fifo rather than a deque or linked list

177468
qpushbutton	qobject
i have other classes that subclass qpushbutton and qobject respectively but they compile ok

177485
listview	gridview
i want to display some information in a listview using the gridview

177532
verilog	vhdl
do you prefer vhdl or verilog and why

177534
unbind	hoverintent
hoverintent only binds mousemove when the cursor enters the active element and unbind it afterwards

177565
altera	xilinx
buy a cheap starter kit from xilinx or altera the two big fpga players

177565
verilog	vhdl
vhdl is more popular in europe and verilog is dominating in the us

177624
ant	maven
ant and maven are both build tools which will run on any platform which has java available for it

177646
int	chars
int chmod const chars path mode_t mode

177649
mouse	keyboard
take regular breaks from using the mouse and learn keyboard shortcuts

177689
gridview	rowdatabound
if this is a pure coding exercise then bind to the rowdatabound event of the gridview

177702
notepad++	scite
for starters give her a text editor with regex search and replace like notepad++ or scite

177737
button	checkbox	optgroup	checkbox
they can handle going one level deep if the top level is not selectable see the optgroup element 1 but beyond that i suggest taking a regular list ordered or unordered with as much nesting as you need remember sublists go inside list items in their parent list and including a checkbox or radio button with each selectable list item

177758
linefeed	delimiter
the official end-of-line delimiter in whois as with most ietf protocols is crlf not just linefeed

177798
keydown	mousedown
otherwise you could also add event listeners for appropriate ui events keydown mousedown and prevent their default behavior return false or event.returnvalue false

177804
antivirus	mcafee
i am specifically interested in software like mcafee entercept or certain antivirus scanners that patch the kernel

177815
post	get
i am changing a get to a post

177844
verilog	vhdl
also check out opencores.org - there are some articles and a lot of open source code in both verilog and vhdl you can learn from

177844
verilog	vhdl
as far as i can tell vhdl vs verilog gets just as religious as ruby vs python or java vs c#

177863
google-chrome	firefox
that it is to say file with spaces.pdf gets downloaded in firefox as file while in google-chrome ie7 ie6 is downloaded as file with spaces.pdf

177874
websphere	ibm
i have an ibm websphere mq queue running on windows containing many items of varying priority

177875
int	chars
use a blank in those columns any int will have a chars or even a null chars

177887
public	protected
it s unlikely to do so however and making the inheritance protected or public would avoid this possible trap

177922
ironruby	ironpython
i don t know why anyone would want to call it wisc as these people are essentially saying we will never ever use vb.net ironpython ironruby f# or any other .net language

177927
put	get
i am currently thinking of doing some base methods with generics and reflection to get some generic query methods to reduce the duplication issue 2 i will put a prototype up for review later

177932
jsf	seam
you don t have to use jsf for seam to be useful

177956
int	boolean
what is the best way to convert an int or null to boolean value in an sql query such that

177968
datalist	repeater
the repeater and datalist controls don t offer paging and the datagrid with paging is restricted to one item per row

178003
ssl	https
use ssl https

178023
sproutcore	cappuccino
you could also try sproutcore or cappuccino js frameworks

178038
folder	directory
then just have the www working-copy auto-updated or exported if you don t want the .svn directory in the www folder for the www-user by some script perhaps as a post-commit hook which then setups permissions accordingly

178197
int	boolean
it uses boolean values to represent the bits in terms of the api but under the hood i believe it uses an int

178235
cvs	svn
svn was born out of limitations that the creators saw with cvs

178241
int	double
in situations where you are dealing with very large amounts of data fixed point can be twice as memory efficient a four byte long int as opposed to an eight byte double

178322
post	get
however input must always be validated on the server side since the user can just change the input data manually in the get url or send crafted post data

178341
bazaar	git	bazaar	svn
and the base functionality between svn git mercurial bazaar all use essentially identical commands to commit view diffs and so on

178341
bazaar	git	bazaar	svn
the small difference in the way git requires changes to be explicitly added before they re committed as opposed to svn s commit everything policy is conceptually simple and unless i m mistaken not even an issue when using mercurial or bazaar

178395
pull	push
edit note mercurials biggest difference i ve noted vs git that makes mercurial harder to use for newbies is mercurials default behavior for push pull is like doing git push --all git pull --all which can propagate private branches and add lots of confusion especially as when a new branch turns up mercurial freezes in fear and asks you how to handle it instead of just keeping on trucking as well as the default merge conflict resolution tool on mac just clobbering one set of changes blindly

178414
put	get
and those will get put into ppt s for presentation internally and externally

178415
rapidsvn	tortoisesvn
i think the toolset for svn is much broader so you could sit down and teach people tortoisesvn rapidsvn etc even if they did not have much conceptual idea of how the repository worked

178424
vmware	bootcamp	parallels	bootcamp
if cross-platform testing is central to your company s business a full size intel-based mac running both os x and windows with parallels bootcamp or vmware for testing may be a better option

178432
folder	directory
make sure your virtual directory or sub folder are set up correctly in iis and didn t change in the deployment

178434
dlsym	dlopen
in c you can work around these by not linking directly to the library instead you load the library at runtime using dlopen then find the symbol you are looking for using dlsym and assign it to a global symbol that you can name any way you like and then access it through this global symbol

178442
cvs	svn
stuff like this is hard to do properly with cvs or svn

178490
pop-up	dialog
our program has this and for debug builds we pop-up a dialog detailing the problem if it is a warning or fatal message

178503
autoresetevent	manualresetevent
other than that start your worker thread and make it wait on some manualresetevent or autoresetevent

178508
hash	md5
for a more robust check you could calculate md5 or sha-1 hash with hashbytes on the row contents to give you a difference with a very low probability of collision see this wikipedia article on birthday attacks for a discussion of this problem

178532
typedef	struct
for legacy code reasons the msdn suggestion of replacing typedef with struct is not practical

178534
folder	directory
i usually put separate folder at the root level so i end up with a directory structure like this

178535
versioning	upgrade
to build business objects there is a lot of leg work that needs to be done and this should be tackled by a code generator. i m not using one though as i still want to get a grip of the framework the latest versioning of csla 3.5 cuts down the amount of code in properties and we have upgrade because of this

178551
ceil	floor
what about ceil and floor

178551
ceil	floor
ceil floor and a number of other mathematical and trigonometric

178555
verilog	vhdl	verilog	hdl
once you re ready to choose an hdl i heartily recommend verilog having learned vhdl first

178555
verilog	vhdl
yes vhdl was once much more feature-rich than verilog but later revisions of the language verilog 2001 verilog 2005 systemverilog etc.. have cherry-picked most of the interesting features and there is far more robust toolchain support for verilog and its variant these days in addition to it being the dominant language in use in the us in my experience vhdl is only used here when dealing with extreme legacy blocks and in academic contexts partially due to the tools support mentioned previously

178576
ceil	floor
implements ceil floor and a number of other mathematical

178580
debian	linux
we are trying to bind a linux machine debian 4.0 to w2k3 ad

178581
postgresql	mysql
however i only have that experience with mysql and postgresql - not with sql server

178620
integer	unsigned
if the creation of orders customers will always be centralized an unsigned integer would be fine

178655
inherited	properties
i would bind the background of the textbox instead so that whatever background brush the user set on the user control would flow properties value inherited to the button

178665
pop-up	dialog
if you are running as a service without a logged in user some print drivers like to pop-up dialog from time to time

178665
pop-up	dialog
the driver may pop-up a dialog that will never be seen and hold up the printer queue because nobody is logged in

178778
vb.net	vb6
indeed chr 0 is used to terminate a string if you want a newline character you can use environment.newline in vb.net or vbnewline in vb6

178835
accessor	properties
i did not test your code but you should never need to force the initialization of proxies the properties accessor do that for you

178860
codeigniter	cakephp
i m trying to use a microsoft access database for a demo project that i m thinking of doing in either codeigniter or cakephp

178913
put	get
note the stickeyness - the set 6 12 13 doesn t have a shared element with 1 2 3 but they get put in the same group because of 5 2 6

178921
google-chrome	firefox
this works fine in firefox and google-chrome but whenever i do the search in ie i get redirected back to index.php

178981
opera	firefox
this test script ran fine for me in ie firefox and opera

178998
decoder	encoder
for what you are doing you need an encoder decoder for the format

179021
onchange	onkeydown
you can do this in onkeydown and onchange

179037
post	get
in other words have a cycle of remove code get it to build run it and see if the console still pops up. eventually you should end up either spotting the issue or being able to post a short but complete program so that we can reproduce it and help fix it

179084
nant	cruisecontrol
cruisecontrol calls a series of nant scripts

179107
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
it s the absolute worst of the mainstream browsers i try to use firefox with firebug or google-chrome safari to handle most issues

179116
ready	each
advance each tag to later versions when ready

179174
bazaar	git
since you can still push to another machine also running git mercurial bazaar etc you still have the multi-computer backup safety which you d hopefully have either way

179186
gtk	cairo
-i c gtk include cairo

179294
post	get
further i recommend to use post wherever possible avoid using get for form submits - if some users want to simulate a form submit via get make sure your application supports the desired parameters either via post or via get but when you submit the page yourself via a button or js prefer post over get

179298
listview	gridview
i just learned this today the bind method as used with gridview and listview doesn t exist

179299
vim	emacs
i m fairly new at programming but i ve wondered how shell text editors such as vim emacs nano etc are able to control the command-line window

179338
boost	log4cpp
external dependencies boost log4cpp etc are not stored in svn

179390
vbscript	vb6
we still prototype things in vb6 and vbscript because they re good at it

179401
hide	show
put .parent before hide or .show to show or hide the parent div

179403
client-side	server-side
the other way to do this is server-side instead of client-side

179415
awt	swing
i haven t seen it cause any problems yet and to my understanding the graphics class is legacy code but the java designers didn t want to change the interfaces for swing and awt classes in order to preserver backwards compatibility

179435
integer	fractions
you get 16-bits of signed integer plus 16 bits of fractions precision

179485
inotifypropertychanged	ieditableobject
i am also not comfortable with my domain objects implementing ieditableobject and idataerrorinfo inotifypropertychanged etc

179512
google-chrome	safari
given that google-chrome and safari use webkit has anyone yet found anything that renders differently on google-chrome than safari

179515
put	get
for example i remember reading that apple put a lot of work in safari to get apple-style font rendering there and i doubt google duplicated that effort

179520
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome also uses an earlier version of webkit than the current safari so pages should be checked in both browsers

179524
children	parent
you should be able to just update your collection to make it accurate and then save the parent but as you ve found out hibernate tries to detach the children from the parent before deleting them and if the foreign key is not-null it will fail

179527
google-chrome	safari
this is probably a good place to note that google-chrome has been added to browsershots so you don t even need to have it installed to test on it and safari

179590
google-chrome	safari
en-us applewebkit 525.13 khtml like gecko google-chrome 0.2.149.30 safari 525.1

179614
boost	stl
if an idiomatic answer is important they can always specify c c++ c++ with stl c++ with boost etc

179626
vb.net	vb6
visualstudio offers or at least offered a wizard to do a conversion from vb6 to vb.net which could then be converted to c# with a bit of work possibly helped by #develop s vb.net - c# converter but when last i used it for anything non-trivial there was a lot of manual work needing to be done so i suspect you re probably better rewriting or porting by hand if this is a large and or important application

179644
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome is currently using a slightly older version of webkit than safari

179653
int	chars
i want to take the value stored in a 32 bit unsigned int put it into four chars and then store the int value of each of these chars in a string

179662
octree	quadtree
then you create a quadtree or octree to hierarchically divide the mesh data

179676
put	get
what is the best way to get a file in this case a .pdf but any file will do from a webresponse and put it into a memorystream

179687
rss	feed
i ve wondered the same thing for a while and am very hesitant to republish rss feed feedforall says there is no inherent right to reproduce content

179691
integer	unsigned
consider that an unsigned 32-bit integer stores over 4 billion values

179699
google-chrome	safari
this would be a similar question to does google-chrome render the same as konqueror and altho the webkit html renderer versions may be different the java script engines are very different between google-chrome safari and konqueror

179738
min	max
just find the max and min datetimes take the difference and divide by the number of datetimes you looked at

179749
ironruby	ironpython
i admit i haven t learned ironruby ironpython f# or any other .net language yet but i m seriously considering it just to increase my programming arsenal

179776
client-side	server-side
i don t see how you expect server-side code to call a client-side function

179776
client-side	server-side
ajax calls are from the client-side to the server-side

179782
awt	swing
if it s a gui app switch from swing to awt or maybe eclipse s toolkit it s supposed to be pretty quick

179804
client-side	server-side
any time you transition between server-side and client-side it s like the user clicked the refresh button on their browser in terms of performance

179813
altera	xilinx
altera and xilinx have simulators build into their free tool sets

179813
ada	vhdl	verilog	vhdl	verilog	hdl
for hdl choice verilog is to c as vhdl is to ada

179838
filesystems	xfs
extended attributes are supported some filesystems particularly xfs and i think jfs

179849
unix	solaris
the tools need to be accessed from windows linux various unix s vms and solaris

179946
vb.net	vb6
however if i m not mistake the wizard only migrates vb6 to vb.net

180097
int	double
those calls will include methods that have arguments that are primitive types int double etc.

180218
folder	directory
you can t checkout a single directory of a repository because the entire repository is handled by the single .git folder in the root of the project instead of subversion s myriad of .svn directory

180330
pop-up	dialog
i ve got a save dialog box which pop-up when i press a button

180363
picturebox	linklabel
in this control there are several child controls like a label a picturebox and a linklabel

180363
mouseleave	mouseenter
this is because there is no mouseenter and mouseleave events on the child control

180384
google-chrome	firefox
ps you can enable firefox to auto log on via ntlm and it is one of the most requested features for google-chrome too so don t let browser issues put you off

180399
min	max
any aggregation function used during a join to retrieve the max or min or avg value from a joined table will cause the error

180440
put	get
while you can put any sql you like in the conditions of a named scope if you then call find_by_sql then the scopes get thrown away

180441
accessor	properties
for example if you have an object that just has properties and accessor you re probably fine

180543
profiler	visualvm	visualvm	jprofiler
use a profiler jprofiler netbeans profiler visualvm eclipse profiler etc

180601
super	implements
the fact is that super is implements in java as well as in c# where it is called base unless i m wrong

180630
unix	bsd
it isn t quite irrelevant - some version 6 unix stuff escaped into bsd but these days you d be extremely hard pressed to find anything that ancient in current use

180634
inherited	subclassing
probably due to a delphi background and i always make it private to avoid the problem when the inherited is erroneously omitted from a class but a subclassing tries to use it

180636
junit	testng
there are 2 main unit test frameworks -- junit and testng

181395
ftp	telnet
what about mail 25 110 143 telnet 23 ftp 21 dns 53 or even whois 43

181450

181818
rss	feed
according to the feedparser documentation i can turn an rss feed into a parsed object like this

181898
apache	lighttpd
in order to lighten apache s load people often suggest using lighttpd to serve up static content

181898
apache	lighttpd
in this setup apache passes requests for static content back to lighttpd via mod_proxy while serving dynamic requests itself

181898
apache	lighttpd
from what i can see the size of the apache process proxying its request through lighttpd is as large as it would be if it were serving the file itself

181919
apache	lighttpd
you don t have an apache process spawned for each request - static files images and the like are fetched directly by lighttpd

181931
rss	feed
if you re looking to read in an xml feed modify it and then output it again there s a page on the main python wiki indicating that the rss.py library might support what you re after it reads most rss and is able to output rss 1.0

181939
getter	setter
getter and setter

181955
apache	lighttpd
maybe it does reduce the load of apache because it doesn t have to do io to the disk but it will increase the load of lighttpd on the same machine and thus reducing the available load to apache .

181955
apache	lighttpd
maybe lighttpd io access is lighter than that of apache 1.3 but why not just switch to apache 2 or lighttpd completely

181966
freemarker	velocity
i want to use a template engine in a struts application and would like to know if using tiles can be recommended instead of freemarker or velocity

181983
freemarker	velocity
it was good for templating however it can t really be compared to velocity or freemarker with tiles you use normal jsps and are limited to the jsp tags youv e got

181983
freemarker	velocity
velocity and probably freemarker although i haven t used it before provide their own tags or expression language so you can do thinks like

181983
freemarker	velocity
however i think velocity or freemarker are more powerful in terms of what you can do with it.

181983
freemarker	velocity
but if you need something more advanced than plain jsps velocity or freemarker might be the way to go

182002

webclient	webrequest
one other option might be to get the data yourself webclient webrequest etc and simply push that html into the webbrowser - but this will mess up external links etc

182185
nginx	lighttpd
personally while lighttpd is ok i would go with nginx + fastcgi if you end up going with a lightweight webserver + fastcgi solution

182185
apache	lighttpd	apache	nginx	nginx	lighttpd
fastcgi the issue here and it doesn t matter if your webserver is apache lighttpd or nginx is figuring out how many fcgi child processes you let each user leave running because each process eats memory equal to the size of the php interpreter in linux not all of it is wired of course but i digress

182185
apache	lighttpd
i do sympathize with the desire to do something interesting like lighttpd + fcgi instead of the standard apache + cgi + suexec but i deep down i really can t recommend it

why does my rss feed duplicate some entries

182525

ant	maven
i ve looked at ant and maven and they don t seem to be well geared towards remote administration the way capistrano is - they seem much more focused on simply building and packaging applications

183126
inherited	properties
now in .net for desktop controls you can use inherited which is much more powerful than the old tag properties anyway

183156
folder	directory
another way to do it is to remove all the .svn directory in all the folder

183185
int	chars
in table a it is represented as an int and in table b it is represented as a chars

183197

hide	show
warning double-click here to show hide compiler links

but when the loop variable equals the limit rather than multiplying by the fraction i subtract the subtotal variable from the total cost and put that in the last department

183290
ant	maven
as you ve already said ant is more a replacement for gnu make while maven is primary a buildout dependency-management application

183290
put	get
but if you require additional steps fabric has worked very well for me so far and i assume that capistrano also offers generic shell-command put and get operations

184381
webkit	gecko
my understanding is webkit is pretty good smaller than gecko

184403
hash	md5
examples would be base 64 encoding being a hash algorithm where md5 being an encryption algorithm

webkit	gecko
when apple was considering which engine to use in making safari they looked at gecko but decided to go with khtml fork it and called it webkit

184413
google-chrome	firefox
it apparently wasn t enough for google when they made google-chrome and they have a significant stake in firefox

184424
pascal	delphi
delphi 7 s grammar is in the back of the object pascal book

184438

bluetooth	usb
there are a lot of weird serial ports these days usb serial cables bluetooth cell phone modems with gps .

184537
free	malloc
i see in c++ there are multiple ways to allocate and free data and i understand that when you call malloc you should call free and when you use the new operator you should pair with delete and it is a mistake to mix the two calling free on something that was created with the new operator but i m not clear on when i should use malloc free and when i should use new delete in my real world programs

184540
free	malloc
it is worth mentioning that you cannot mix new free and malloc delete

184548
free	malloc
use malloc and free only for allocating memory that is going to be managed by c-centric libraries and apis

then subsequent upgrade installers will use the same product code and upgrade code but change the versioning

184771
mp3	ogg
if the program in question actually decodes mp3 ogg upon loading and encodes in back when saving this could be detected by noticeable time it takes to save a file then yes - you could experience degradation in quality

184797
mp3	ogg
if you re using a lossy codec ogg mp3 and jpeg among others are all lossy and you re recoding the data when saving then yes there will over time or rather with repeated recoding be a loss in quality

184798

185180
post	get
the problem is when a validation error occurs at which point the navigation rules get skipped and i end up at foo after the post

185180
post	get
my question is there a way to redirect on validation errors so i end up with a get request for instead of the post to foo

185365
ssl	https
to determine whether it s an https request or an ssh request you need to try to read some data with a small timeout this is because tls ssl handshakes start with the client sending some data whereas the ssh handshake starts with the server sending some data

185377
accessor	properties
next thing is to move all your mapping logic inside the class ideally inside the properties accessor

185415

185463
portrait	landscape
i have a view that supports landscape and portrait viewing with the controls all moving around when you switch from one to the other

185573
getter	setter
i couldn t really find this in rails documentation but it seems like mattr_accessor is the module corollary for attr_accessor getter setter in a normal ruby class

185624
inline	inlining
i fixed that by making the function inline but i m afraid that this is a fragile solution because as far as i know the compiler doesn t guarantee inlining even when you specify the inline keyword

185631
apache	lighttpd
running lighttpd behind apache to serve static files certainly seems braindead to me

185631
apache	lighttpd
apache still has to unpack the http packets and parse the request through its parse tree send proxy requests and then lighttpd has to re-unpack hit the filesystem and send the files back through apache

185631
apache	nginx
what you will see is people using a lightweight webserver like nginx as a frontend server to serve static files and proxy dynamic urls to apache

185631
apache	lighttpd
i probably could come up with a nightmare configuration for apache that would make it actually slower serving static files than proxying those requests to a backend lighttpd but it would involve enabling expensive features like .htaccess in apache that are disabled in lighttpd so it wouldn t really be fair

185632
getter	setter
as ruby s attr_accessor generates getter setter methods for instances cattr mattr_accessor provide getter setter methods at the class or module level

185640
inline	inlining
inlining means that executable code instructions is inline into the calling function s code

185642
public	protected
thus you can call any public protected instance method on templatecontrol

185652
width	height
i have a uiimageview and the objective is to scale it down proportionally by giving it either a height or width

185662
haskell	scheme
i ve also read that scheme or haskell could be better languages to achieve this task

185672
listview	gridview
is it possible for you to override an existing control such as a listview or gridview

185673
put	get
i could use webdav or http to get put data to a server but it makes the application more complicated

185693
smartsvn	tortoisesvn	rapidsvn	tortoisesvn	rapidsvn	smartsvn
i just verified that both smartsvn and rapidsvn mentioned previously require administrator access to insatll on windows just like tortoisesvn

185702
swt	swing
this is true for windows swing swt gtk and probably others

185740
put	get
i can see how one could argue that the robot is in the abstract just a data repository -- put left turn put travel 100 meters get outside temperature

185770
spaces	linefeed	getter	setter
using indexof to support getelementsbyclassname in ie can really make a difference because there are no faster alternatives and the classname property s underlying getter setter conveniently replace tabs and linefeed with spaces

185825
public	protected
in flex and many other languages a function method of a class can be declared private or protected or public

185829
public	protected
thus visibility increases as you go from private to protected to public

185829
public	protected
in c++ you can control how the visibility of members should be inherited to the descendants by prepending the base class name with the private protected or public keywords meaning you want the visibility of the base class members to be at most at that level

185829
public	protected
in each of the cases above the descendant classes are of course able to introduce their own private protected and public members

185848
int	chars
note matt curtis points out that c++ allows the simplification of the above if the static member variable is of const int type int bool chars

185862
mp3	wav
read and play wav s and or mp3 s

185864
put	get
you have to have a line int foo i some where in your code to tell the compiler where to put it otherwise you get a link error

185926
oql	jhat
jhat can execute oql these days as well bottom link execute oql

185954
nsoperation	nsautoreleasepool
yes you need to create an nsautoreleasepool in your method unless you are creating a concurrent slightly unfortunate nomenclature nsoperation subclass and your overridden method creates the nsautoreleasepool before calling nsoperation main

185993
mvp	presenter
is there good example code or a test project for explaining the modelâ viewâ presenter mvp pattern

186008
serializable	deserialization
serializable deserialization

186035
slideup	slidedown
when a h3 is clicked the div directly below after is revealed with jquery s slidedown function while all other divs are hidden with the slideup function

186037
width	height
is there any way to validate the width and height of image when uploaded

186098
filesystems	hfs+
on macos the default filesystems is hfs+ which does not support sparse files

186107
vb.net	vb6	vb6	powerbuilder
easily add email support to your visual basic 6 vb6 asp asp.net vb.net c++ c# foxpro access powerbuilder or delphi application

186109
vim	emacs
many decent text editors have the option as well vim emacs editplus and so on

186265
vmware	virtualbox
first both virtualbox and vmware server are great products and since both are free each is worth evaluating

186279
inherited	properties
adding a properties to the prototype of a function object will make it available to the constructed object as well as to all of the objects which inherited from it

186294
mantis	bugzilla	testlink	mantis	testlink	bugzilla
you could use combination of a bug tracker jira mantis bugzilla and test case management tool like testlink

186297
vmware	virtualbox
just like vmware gives support for vmware server sun gives support for virtualbox

186313
draggable	droppable
once it is put in there it gets replaced with a new div which is both draggable because you can junk it by moving it back to the palette and droppable because you can add ingredients to it

186376
for-loop	arrays
in some cases though the compiler will replace foreach with a for-loop i believe when iterating over arrays

186378
postgresql	mysql
is your application meant to be portable are you planning to migrate it to mysql postgresql whatever

186387
jobs	cron
what is the best procedure for deploying web apps that rely on cron jobs for cache maintenance db updates ...

186455
terminate	timeout
when the timeout event occurs you can terminate the thread that does the actual processing clean up and end the process

186473
put	get
assuming the request goes through jquery put a debug statement in the jquery source get function that kicks in if the url is

186478
post	get
below post was because i was an idiot who didn t read the question properly but will get the dates in a week starting from monday given the date not the week number

186521
public	protected
also keep in mind that what you need to test is the public api of an object not it s protected private methods

186521
public	protected
so as long as the public methods fulfill tests the protected methods will be covered too

186569
versioning	upgrade
will users who do not have admin rights on their computers be able to upgrade to new flash player versioning by themselves

186574
isapi	httpmodule
ii6 uses what iis7 calls the classic pipeline where a httpmodule can only get involved once the earlier isapi based pipeline determines that the script mapping requires the request to handed over to asp.net

186595
rpm	yum
the same goes for linux if you use the yum rpm installers

186599
post	get
also it usually helps get an idea of what is expected by visualising even if in block form or via post it notes what you want to see as to what it is you are indeed coding

186619
prng	random
i have a pseudo random number generator prng class that i want to unit test

186633
pop-up	dialog
i actually want the pageload to be triggered everytime the modal dialog pop-up

186641
vb6	vba
there s something about vb6 vba that makes them feel unnatural to me

186645
perforce	svn
obviously given the source you have to realise that it stresses the advantages of perforce over svn but it is still a useful read

186645
perforce	svn
i would certainly recommend perforce for a number of reasons already covered in other answers but i m not in a position to offer a comparison with svn having never really used it

186668
firefox	safari
no matter if you use safari or firefox or possibly another browser it is standard or mac that browsers search their plugins in that folder

186687
emacs	textmate
i ve found it extremely easy to use and there are tips for integrating it with vi m emacs and even textmate if you use that

186690
googletest	cppunit
then assuming you are using an xunit-style test library cppunit googletest unittest++ or whatever you can add various testxxx functions to a single class to test out associated groups of functionality

186788
put	get
if all you want to do is put a bullet point on your resume to get past the agents just add it that will get you past the agents and give you a chance to get your foot in the door

186819
versioning	upgrade
when you add references using visual studio you will get a assembly reference with both versioning number and public key and this can give you some trouble when you upgrade a vendor assembly to a newer version. br

186842
udp	tcp
tcp and udp are still addressed as they are under ipv4

186845
icmp	dhcp
the only thing that changed between the two versions is the addressing scheme dhcp dhcpv6 and icmp icmpv6

186845
udp	tcp
so basically anything tcp udp related including the port range 0-65535 remains unchanged

186846
udp	tcp
i m pretty certain that ports only have a part in tcp and udp

186850
udp	tcp
the tcp and udp layer is the same structure

186850
udp	tcp
ipv6 as the name implies is about the ip layer being enhanced not the tcp or udp layers

186868
awt	swing
as you already require java 1.4 you should consider some small changes to take into use swing gui instead it solved our applet refresh issues with awt

186871
content-disposition	content-type
use a content-disposition attachment header but stick with the correct content-type

186973
profiler	aqtime
also if you have access to a profiler such as aqtime or similar then running your code through it might give you some hints

186990
configobj	configparser
i ve heard that configobj is easier to work with than configparser

186990
config	ini
configobj is a simple but powerful config file reader and writer an ini file round tripper

187021
profiler	visualvm	visualvm	jrockit
i don t have experience with visualvm -- but jrockit s profiler does provide this information

187032
ssl	https
the only impact on your php would be in the self-facing links you re publishing which you d want to switch from to there s a _server https variable you could use to trigger this change if you ll be accepting both ssl and non-ssl connections

187052
range	max	range	min	min	max
the date data type is based on the double data type with range checking min max date values plus a considered epoch

187052
int	double
the precision for double precision floating point where one day 1 int is effectively nine decimal places

187061
super	extends
all the compiler knows about t is its bounds which it probably doesn t have other than explicitly extends object and a super of the null type

187169
installation	upgrade
usually in regards to installation customization upgrade paths etc

187178
rss	feed
i ll just add that if you re worried about any performance impact associated with fetching the rss feed you can enter a non-existent url such as that will fail quickly and reduce the amount of content needing to be rendered

187185
put	get
then you can just put and get whichever files you like betwen the current directory on the linux box and your windows server

187206
octal	binary
perhaps using octal or binary to store your format types as a bitmask

187228
children	parent
whenever you try to set a children to different parent sl fails with an argument exception same when you reuse a resource that is not a style

187279
google-chrome	firefox
this renders fine in firefox and google-chrome

187305
sqldatasource	formview
the rows from the sqldatasource display fine in the formview and i can edit them

187391
mbunit	cruisecontrol.net
i have logged on to the build server with remote desktop using the same user account that cruisecontrol.net runs under and run mbunit manually and the tests pass

187594
wordpress	joomla
by the way the code i ve been looking at is from the joomla 1.5 core and several wordpress plugins so i assume they are people who know what they re doing

187620
x86	64bit
can a winforms app compiled for any cpu be configured to run as x86 on a 64bit server without recompiling the app

187628
config	ini
the standard python config files look like ini files with and key value or pairs

187655
post	get
including get post request urls cookies etc

187713
integer	fractions	fixed-point	fractions
edit for clarification fixed-point values have two parts to them an integer part and a fractions part

187713
integer	unsigned
the integer part can be represented by a signed or unsigned integer data type

187713
integer	unsigned	integer	fractions
the fractions part is represented by an unsigned data integer data type

187713
integer	unsigned	integer	fractions	fixed-point	fractions
if a 8-bit unsigned integer were to be used for fixed-point math then the fractions part would be split into 256 evenly divisible parts

187717
ssl	https
https http over ssl sends all http content over a ssl tunel so http content and headers are encrypted as well

187795
hide	show
my page actually looks like this where query advancedsearchfields is basically including a flex form into the page and i want it to show hide the custom view below after the search is complete

187823
integer	fractions
a cast from float to integer will throw away the fractions portion so if you want to keep that fractions around as fixed point then you just multiply the float before casting it

187917
put	get
if you have permission to read but not write a file the buffer you get when you visit the file c-x c-f or find-file will be put in read-only mode automatically

187946
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
you can see it in action at works in ie firefox safari opera

188046
min	max
getprefferedsize used to return the same object that you gave with setpreferredsize everything also goes for min max size so what we would do is call setprefferedsize on every scaling component with a particular subclass of java.awt.dimension then we would walk the component hierarchy and update each scaling component whenever the resolution changed

188086
width	height
if so i got this awhile ago just type resize and use the arrow keys to adjust width and height

188108
hmac	md5
hmac makes use of some sort of one-way hashing function like md5 or sha-1 to encrypt the secret along with a message

188108
hash	hmac
when the digest is sent along with the message the receiver our server can re-generate the hash with the same hmac calculation and compare the locally generated digest with the digest that came along with the message

188116
profiler	visualvm
you can also use heapwalker from the netbeans profiler or the visualvm stand-alone tool

188116
visualvm	jhat
visualvm is a good alternative to jhat as it is stand alone but is much easier to use than jhat

188208
stdout	stderr
there seem to be two bash idioms for redirecting stdout and stderr to a file

188227
vbscript	vb6
it was nice for vb6 vbscript which were loosely typed but .net is strongly typed making the warts well wart-ugly

188230
stdout	stderr
might be useful for cases where you aren t redirecting stdout to somewhere else but rather you just want stderr to be sent to the same place such as the console as stdout perhaps if the command you are running is already sending stderr somewhere else other than the console

188236
button	checkbox
click those 2 checkbox hit the get button on that dialog

188242
postgresql	mysql
i can understand why not all data types would be supported from mysql oracle postgresql and so forth

188278
stdout	stderr
where sends both stdout and stderr to wherever 2 1 sends stderr to where stdout is currently going at that point in the command line

188278
stdout	stderr
where the former is redirecting both stdout and stderr to file the latter redirects stderr to where stdout is going before it is redirected to the file in this case probably the terminal. this is useful if you wanted to do something like

188278
stdout	stderr
where you want to use less to page through the output of stderr and store the output of stdout to a file

188320
stdout	stderr
so with you can write something like and get stdout and stderr output appended to the log file

188358
ready	each
actually loading up an interpreter for merely executing code and copying memory out to a user is exhaustively wasteful why don t we just pre-compute all the possible pages and store each page in memory ready to go so its just a mem-copy

188405
wordpress	joomla
i think joomla and wordpress are not the greatest examples of good php code with no offense

188405
wordpress	joomla
so it s by no means good code but wordpress and joomla both excel on the frontend - pretty easy to use people get a website and can do stuff

188473
fflush	gets
i have a c# object with a critical resource that needs to be fflush very specific points in time making it a bad candidate to leave around for the garbage collector to take care of whenever it gets around to it how should i handle this

188526
cpu	hyperthreading
be cautious that hyperthreading cpus appear identical to multicore d cpu s yet the performance characteristics are very different

188541
hash	salt
alternate step 3 is app submits info from step 2 and server sends back a hash signature of the info + salt

188553
processors	hyperthreading
environment.processorcount will also include any hyperthreading processors

188553
processors	hyperthreading
there is no way at least up through windows 2003 to distinguish a hyperthreading processors from one with two cores

188563
jlist	jtable
i believe you need to replace the jlist with a single column jtable

188588
profiler	visualvm
if you update to java 1.6u7 or better you ll get access to the visualvm tool that is essentially the same as the netbeans profiler

188595
int	chars	unsigned	short
assume you only want functions of the signature unsigned short id_for_allowed_functions int x chars y

188658
folder	directory
is it a folder which exists outside of website directory

188708
jquery	simplemodal	jquery	jqmodal	jqmodal	simplemodal
a couple i found for jquery are jqmodal and simplemodal

188712
implements	sealed
you are implements idisposable in a class which isn t sealed

188720
subtract	add
is there any way to in one query subtract 2 cars from bob and add 2 to john

188734
jquery	jqmodal
i ve had good results using jqmodal a plugin for the jquery framework that lets you define modal dialogs but it s by no means the only option

188770
translation	localization
rick strahl has a good explanation and example code for a database-driven localization provider here - there s a nice built in localization editor too with interface to google translation and babelfish

188831
direct3d	directx
this is because system.drawing.bitmap is a gdi+ bitmap while classes like bitmapimage in system.windows.media.imaging are direct3d directx

188843
put	get
so much can get done quickly when you put the right people in a room and hammer out things on a whiteboard

188845
awt	swing	ant	maven
this ability or the lack of it is built into the various testrunners console awt swing ant maven or the one built into eclipse etc

188882
boost	stl
thus you ll have to write this this way using stl or even boost

188896
put	get
this happened with the previous version of perl 5.8 and windows 2003 and iis 5. anyway basically i put in a carp or a warn and i get an error message and then some garbage text

188917
firefox	safari
now it s also supported in firefox 3 and safari i m not sure which version but at least 3.1 and highter but not the iphone

189003
websphere	ibm
we are using ibm websphere transformation extender which has lots of other problems too and the mapping tool of biztalk is a joke in comparison to wtx

189004
haskell	ocaml
as a trivial example compare quicksort implementations in java and ocaml or better still haskell on this page

189071
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
each comparer has a case-sensitive as well as a case-insensitive version

189154
getter	setter
he also advocates not using the else keyword nor any getter or setter but i think that s a bit overboard

189162
inline	inlining
declaring it inline makes it a candidate for inlining it does not mean a lot nowadays in c++ as the compiler will inline or not sometimes ignoring the fact the keyword inline is present or absent

189228
put	get
however it starts to get messy when you have two put methods because although the method returns void you seemingly have to cast it to a strongly typed delegate to end the invocation

189236
extjs	sproutcore
consider technologies like sproutcore gwt or extjs which put the layouting code fully on the client making the server responsible only for data marshalling and processing and easily replaced

189252
disk	ram
i ve got a dell xps m1330 with a 2.2ghz processor 4gig ram geforce 8400m and a 64gb ssd disk

189261
teamcity	ncover
i think the best we can hope for is to break open the nunit jar file that comes with teamcity and writing a custom task that integrates nunit2 and ncover

189294
disk	ram
skipped vista x64 and moved straight to win2k8 with 8gb ram and a handful of disk

189399
prepare	execute
prepare execute it for each value and union the results client-side

189399
prepare	execute
prepare and execute it

189410
width	height
imagecreatefromstring to read an image in from a stream but i m not sure whether you can get the size of the resulting object as required by s3- inputresource above - getimagesize returns the height width etc but not the size of the image resource

189457
google-chrome	safari
in google-chrome and safari if the browser is not able to connect to a local area network lan or a router it is offline

189486
hide	show
you may want to set up a global ajax event to show hide the loading icon

189509
filesystems	fat
on windows the .emacs file may be called _emacs for backward compatibility with dos and fat filesystems where filenames could not start with a dot

189578
firefox	safari
safari nightlies and is already supported in firefox 3

189584
gentoo	linux
well back in 2005 i used gentoo linux and i used a lot a small program called genlop to show me the history of what i ve emerged installed on my gentoo box

189634
inherited	properties
otherwise if the properties is inherited use the value of the parent

189661
opera	safari
gizmo s comment states that safari and opera support

189668
ubuntu	debian
i also suggest you reading the section emacs startup strategy in usr share doc emacsen-common debian-emacs-policy.gz for more ubuntu debian specific information

189679
trac	bugzilla
it has excellent support for both bugzilla and trac

189712
versioning	upgrade
my home basic laptop came with a cd that had all the necessary stuff for upgrading to a different versioning of windows i upgrade to linux

189713
getter	setter
upon being forced to write unit tests for anemic domain objects that are nothing but bags of getter and setter which i was forced to write as well

189778
inherited	properties
another properties that comes with a sense of ownership in a mutex is the ability to support priority inherited

189778
vxworks	rtos
if you refer to classic vxworks rtos kernel they define three mechanisms

189817
persistent	transient
specifically i m looking for a framework that support dynamic distribution across the grid cloud but replaces the transient agent with a more persistent service

189835
pull	push
in your example you could simply pull merge your change into the integration upstream repository and push it directly up to the remote server

189853
min	max
assume i need to do all sorts of funky queries min max group etc. with the datasets as describe from above would it be slow or not to the point that it makes better sense to have multiple database strategy eg

189854
hide	show
then you could use that code to show or hide a textbox to display a message

189888
apache	lighttpd	apache	nginx	nginx	lighttpd
setup up server combination of your choice apache lighttpd nginx thin etc.

189918
inherited	properties
also keep in mind that most components buttons labels etc will inherited many properties fonts colors etc from their parent

189993
ssl	https
when i use apachebench to test https the error is returned ssl handshake failed

190059
allocator	stl
my idea is to maybe use a different new operator say mynew and custom allocator for all my stl types

190059
allocator	stl
then when linking in from a parent project require them to thunk mynew to new and my stl allocator to the standard one or one of their choosing

190108
post	get
and when you process the form the action is the same w the table and id being passed thru the url so it get s the id and table that way and for lname fname and email it should grab it via post

190112
int	boolean
for primitive types arguments int boolean float ... or string every combinations of limit values for a string xxx null

190135
versioning	upgrade
but now with new upgrade versioning we need to support the import facility from the last versioning s db

190149
prng	random
on a computer your options are pretty limited to pseudo random number generators prngs and given your constraint that they never repeat then a prng is your best option - real random data will occasionally duplicate a number

190172
integer	fractions
define the complexity as the total number of symbols a unit to the power of 1 has complexity 1 any other integer power is 2 a fractions power is 3

190198
hash	md5
i am trying to generate equivalent md5 hash in both javascript and .net

190198
hash	salt
i will add in salt later but at the moment i can t get the .net version to match up with the web site s hash

190198
hash	md5
i m guessing it is an encoding problem but i ve tried about 8 different variations of methods for calculating an md5 hash in .net and none of them match what i have obtained in javascript or from the web site

190205
google-chrome	firefox
checked this in google-chrome ie7 and firefox 3.0.3

190245
inline	inlining
but mainly it is controlled by the inline keyword and compiler switches for example you can have it auto inline small functions even without the keyword. its important to note that debug compilations should never be inlining as the callstack will not be preserved to mirror the calls you created in code

190282
x86	64bit
websphere mq 7 for windows supports x86 and x64 but not itanium 64bit

190316
yacc	bison
you can apply compiler theory here and generate your scanner and parser using flex bison lex yacc or whatever tools

190376
salt	md5
we came across some code that is using hashcode as a salt source for md5 encryption but this raises the question will hashcode return the same value for the same object on different vms different jdk versions and operating systems

190434
subtract	add
incday - add a or subtract a number of days

190434
subtract	add
incweek - add or subtract a number of weeks

190434
subtract	add
incday - add a or subtract a number of days

190434
subtract	add
incweek - add or subtract a number of weeks

190434
subtract	add
incmonth - add a or subtract a number of months

190434
subtract	add
incyear - add a or subtract a number of years

190443
vb.net	vb6
btw have you tried migrating control arrays from vb6 to vb.net

190447
fast-forward	merge
git svn rebase this makes the next step a fast-forward merge see aaron s comments below

190470
hash	md5
jeffrey richter documents an almost identical case in clr via c#. when a hash does need to be stored i d prefer it to be calculated in a way which is always guaranteed to be stable - md5 or a custom interface implemented by your types with a guarantee of stability

190485
serializable	deserialization
so for instance deserialization of hash structures need to recalculate hash codes and these values should not be stored in the serializable form

190493
hide	show
also with my old 1.x firmware way it required me to capture touch events and hide show the control myself

hash	salt
server then performs the same check your db should store hash passwords but this method prevents you from effectively using a salt for that hash since you d have to broadcast this

190504
post	get
i was able to get this working but came across the following issues and i m going to post the solutions to hopefully help others in the future

190506
inherited	properties
to revert a properties on a descendant form to the ancestor form s value right click on the properties in the object inspector and choose revert to inherited

190506
inherited	properties
to revert all properties values of a component to the ancestor s values right click the component and choose revert to inherited

190514
realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
for growing arrays malloc realloc free is the way to go in c and std vector or any other generic stl container is the way to go in c++

190561
jobs	cron
php running scheduled jobs cron jobs

190592
int	chars
your code won t handle letters occuring 255 times or 127 if chars happens to be signed. making charcounts an array of int probably won t impact performance much at all

190593
put	get
i ve put the findcontrol instruction in the page load method after the code which creates them but get an error

190622
apache	nginx
actually there is a possible approach- if you just want to run asp.net programs with ssl you can use cassini + apache proxy nginx for windows

190686
bazaar	git
perhaps you d benefit from switching to a distributed version control system like git or bazaar

190694
bazaar	svn
commands in bazaar are very similar as in svn plus additional excellent functionalities eg

190694
bazaar	svn
bazaar has basic support for importing svn repo with full history supports pluggable modules and tortoisebzr is in the works

190701
put	get
update 2 i put the formula for two mutually exclusive events above instead of 2 independent ones as getting an a the first time doesn t mean you can t get an a the second time

190744
memcpy	strcpy
it somehow feels to me you should strcpy instead of memcpy

190750
strcpy	strncpy
the obvious fix is to use strcpy or strncpy

190831
post	get
so better use post and not get transfer mechanics

190835
post	get
you also get them into the viewstate object graph in their correct position which is invaluable for dealing with post backs and especially server-side validation

190843
post	get
it would take work to unpack this and turn the request in to a http get request using query strings rather than a post with the data in form parameters

190877
folder	directory
iis 5.1 does not run php properly under root directory but fine in all other folder

190912
gentoo	linux
i ve run into a problem where i m getting two printouts of my etc motd file on gentoo linux

190913
subclass	abstract-class
making abstract-class before i had more than one subclass in mind for them

190966
put	get
if you have the resources as the question implies you do you get the users to supply copy and designs in what they do know powerpoint word fireworks etc and get the people who can do a correct implementation but who might not be able to write decent prose etc to put it into the html cms magicthing

191017
firefox	safari
i tested firefox 3.0.3 and safari 3.1.2.

191062
turbogears	cherrypy	pylons	cherrypy	pylons	turbogears
the three i ve heard of are cherrypy turbogears and pylons

191062
turbogears	cherrypy
however i m confused because turbogears seems to use cherrypy as the controller although isn t cherrypy a framework in in it s own right

191069
postgresql	mysql
engine works with mysql postgresql

191100
put	get
you could start your onchange method with you may have to modify this for your language of choice you ll probably get a flicker but it should put it back quickly enough

191109
ant	cruisecontrol
i m currently using cruisecontrol integrated with ant to control project builds

191209
copying	overwrite
by default copying from the command prompt will prompt you to overwrite files that already exist in the target location

191228
public	protected
although for some reason the setlineedit function is protected on qabstractspinbox but public on qlineedit

191242
ssms	sqlcmd
i ask because sometimes ssms is a little heavy weight when i just want to look through the database and find one record and sqlcmd doesn t really seem like a good choice when browsing through a lot of different records or a lot of large records

191376
implements	extends
it seems like maybe there should be an abstract base profile class that the other profiles should extends but i m not sure how to implements that eg a join table between profile types and account types

191425
nant	cruisecontrol
as for tool recommendations i ve used finalbuilder visual build pro msbuild team build nant cruisecontrol and cifactory plus and good old fashioned batch files

191465
cpu	processors
on my dev machine i use a quad core cpu and although our project has more than 1200 files it is still easily processors limited during compile time although a faster hard drive would still help speed things up

191498
min	max
also try your method to get a random id between min id and max id and then

191536
rss	feed
this public weather.com rss feed is a good example of what we d be parsing our actual weather.com feed contains additional information because of a partnership w them

191601
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
in opera the event target for window.onload and body onload and even window.addeventlistener load func false will be the window instead of the document like in safari and firefox

191616
cvs	svn
in fact svn does stores binaries a lot more efficient than cvs for more info see the svn-faq

191656
isnull	nvl
you can do the isnull or nvl stuff but it s just going to make the engine do more work

191763
post	get
nobody could ever prove so far that multiple inheritance has any advantage over other techniques you mentioned in your post using interfaces and delegates i can get exactly the same result without much code or overhead while it has a couple of well known disadvantages diamond problem being the most annoying ones

191777
client-side	server-side
html_quickform can be configured to have client-side or server-side validation or both

191824
versioning	upgrade
a lot of companies are ignoring windows vista and are planning to upgrade to the next windows versioning when it comes out in the hopes that it will suck less than windows vista

191838
rss	feed
some kind of small sensor maybe a temperature sensor for his dorm room that served up the results as an rss feed

191909
implements	extends
one thing that results from that is that i cannot ever add to an interface once i have released it because it would break compilation for anyone implements it -- the only option is to extends the interface

191929
public	protected
public private protected virtual abstract override new static internal sealed and any others i m forgetting

191935
accessor	properties
if you follow what is now considered to be best practice you should release outlet properties because you should have retained them in the set accessor

191942
modifiers	sealed
i usually start off with the access modifiers first then virtual abstract sealed then override new etc

192006
msisdn	sms
of course if you want to implement a protocol-specific extension for your required protocols you would have to develop the whole stack - request object response object a mechanism of identifying sessions for example using the msisdn in an sms instead of cookies a templating and rendering framework equivalent of jsp - and then build an mvc framework on top of it

192122
spweb	spsite
i am opening up a spsite and then trying to open up a spweb under that spsite

192156
coalesce	isnull
other rdbms would prefer coalesce instead of isnull

192170
keydown	keyup
if you need shortcuts that won t be available on the menus then you ll have to handle that your self via the keyup or keydown events either on the form or the control

192179
public	protected
the main difference between traits and default interface implementations which java now has is that traits can contain private or protected methods unlike traditional interface methods that must be public

192187
mp3	wav
this lets me pipe the output of the mp3 decoder directly into the video decoder instead of having to first decode the entire mp3 into a wav file on disk

192188
profiling	debugging
i ask only because using the zend debugger with zendstudio has proven to be much easier fewer steps to start stop debugging from the browser but i really like some of the profiling tools available that only work with xdebug

192220
children	parent
assume further you only have basic data structures arrays and hashmaps no fancy objects with parent children references no orm no framework just your two hands

192230
postgresql	mysql
most fortune 500 companies now use mysql or postgresql or another open source rdbms somewhere in their organization even if they also use one of the commercial closed-source rdbms brands

192230
postgresql	mysql
i realize that both mysql and postgresql were available as early as 1995 but i would argue that they weren t mainstream for several years after that

192396
public	protected
if you look at c++ for each class you specify after the colon in the class declaration the kind of inheritance you get is determined by the access modifier private protected or public

192416
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
firefox also supports ntlm as does opera and google-chrome

192462
children	parent
re comment from e-satis about immediate children or immediate parent

192486
inotifypropertychanged	ieditableobject
by implementing certain interfaces idataerrorinfo inotifypropertychanged ieditableobject etc. your presenter can make the ui that much simpler with less code

192489
mbunit	nunit	mbunit	cruisecontrol.net
nunit is supported by default in cruisecontrol.net and you have to do a little extra work to get mbunit to work in cruisecontrol.net

192489
mbunit	nunit
testdriven.net allows you to right click and run tests in the ide and it supports mbunit and nunit and others

192584
post	put
i am working within winforms and thanks to some helpful blog post put together a pretty nice solution which i wanted to share

192608
sorting	filtering
i m looking to utilize jquery to handle a few very common requests we get for data tables of varying sizes scrolling sorting and dynamic filtering

192621
jar	manifest.mf	jar	war	war	manifest.mf
finally in each of your projects there should be a meta-inf manifest.mf file that just has the name of the jars that jar war depends on

192633
rss	feed
but for parsing rss feed i d recommend universal feed parser which can also parse atom

192656
cpu	processors
it turns out that in most versions of the 386 and later there actually was a cpu id but it was only visible at one specific time right after the processors was reset in the edx register

192672
solaris	bsd
anecdotes i have heard say that the solaris and bsd virtual memory systems may show better performance improvements than the vm system of linux--but i have no empirical data to back this up

192677
inherited	properties
applicationsettingsbase inherited from settingsbase neither of which expose a default properties

192697
client-side	server-side
how do you fix a names mismatch problem if the client-side names are keywords or reserved words in the server-side language you are using

192806
keydown	keyup
this will allow all keypress events to get filtered by the keypress keydown and keyup events at the form level which will allow a single keyboard shortcut to be handled in one location instead of duplicating the functionality in all user controls

192852
getter	setter
in this case there is the possibility that your setter getter may inadvertently make direct or indirect assumptions about the state of the object

192870
lisp	scheme
some other language interpreters do that too i m thinking of lisp and scheme implementations mostly

192870
serializable	deserialization
i think this would be very hard to do for a random program but if you wrote a framework where all objects supported serializable deserialization you can then serializable all objects used by your program and then ship that elsewhere and deserialise them at the other end

192872
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
also you may want to consider modifying an existing class that s already inside media print or building up the new css using something other than innerhtml which i ll admit smells awful to me but seems to work in opera 9.6 safari for windows 3.1.2 ie 6 and firefox 2.0.0.17 i didn t test any other browsers

192885
width	height
if i set the anchor property to opposing ends say left and right when the designer file gets compiled it sets the width height of the control to the width height of the container

192888
hide	show
i have some nested tables that i want to hide show upon a click on one of the top-level rows

192950
min	max
if you want distinct values from only two fields plus return other fields with them then the other fields must have some kind of aggregation on them sum min max etc. and the two columns you want distinct must appear in the group by clause

192993
hex	binary
is there a way to see via hex editor or otherwise if data in a binary file is aligned or packed specifically for an hpux system

193015
filesystems	hfs+
there seems to be some confusion as to whether the default mac os x filesystems hfs+ supports holes in files

193025
nfa	dfa
the regular expressions are converted into a single non deterministic automata nfa and possibily transformed in a deterministic automata dfa

193063
for-loop	loops
there is the switch nested inside loops for-loop unwinding known as the duff device

193090
ienumerable	iqueryable
for the linq functionality that ships with the 3.5 framework those methods are implemented as extension methods on either ienumerable or iqueryable there s also a bunch of methods that work on data sets too

193101
ubuntu	debian
you ll effectively have to do rpm for fedora debs for ubuntu and debian etc

193124
rss	feed
i have an aspx page that creates an xmldocument object from sql data and then transforms it into another xml document rss feed using an xslt file with xpathnavigator and xslcompiledtransform

193173
next	except
this is all great except now i ve just discovered that if i hand a paragraph of text to abcpdf at the bottom of the column such that it needs to chain to the top of the next abcpdf thinks the top of the new column is the start of a new paragraph and applies the indent there as well

193194
put	get
seriously though you get back what you put in

193198
ostringstream	std
the std ostringstream is a good method but sometimes this additional trick might get handy transforming the formatting to a one-liner

193248
mvp	presenter
i m in agreement with chills42--the goal of mvp is not to make the presenter so generic that it could be used with any ui technology

193249
subtract	add	multiplying	add	multiplying	subtract
it could add subtract multiplying and divide

193271
cvs	svn
diff has the --ignore-space-change or -b option and i would like to have essentially the same feature available in cvs or svn

193282
put	get
note that this is all hidden away in a private framework so don t try to put this in code you submit to the app store and be prepared for some hackery to get it to work

193292
haskell	ocaml	erlang	lisp	erlang	ocaml
as i ve already got ruby lisp haskell and erlang under my belt i m interested specifically in what kiss-violating features i should look out for in ocaml

193293
exif	xmp
given a filename i need to be able to access certain metadata in an image for a closed source project i m currently developing without regard to how the metadata is stored that is exif iptc or xmp

193299
config	ini
another option is apache commons config also has a class for loading from ini files

193382
erlang	scheme
try it in scheme or ruby or erlang as well

193398
integer	unsigned
the language i am working with is limited to 64-bit unsigned integer length maximum integer size of 18446744073709551615

193416
multiplying	add
i ve edited my binary multiplying example to show a pattern for each 1-bit in the bottom number add the top number bit-shifted left the position of the 1-bit times to a variable

193420
bash	zsh
i ve been combining putty cygwin screen and zsh not bash lately

193432
decoder	encoder
for png you can use pypng module - lightweight pure-python png decoder encoder

193570
folder	directory
and you can ignore the argument about deleting a single directory to uninstall your program - windows vista won t let you modify files in the program files directory so your config will need to go in a different folder anyway

193626
octal	hex
once upon a long time ago 1987 or so i wrote a program odx octal dump in hex - weird that i continue to use - it gives me a hex dump 16 bytes per line plus an image of the printable characters

193633
maya	3dsmax
maya 3dsmax lightwave so you can export and import your models very easily

193713
getter	setter
idioms aren t just naming for example python has a good deal of magic you can use with getter and setter to make object properties act magical

193730
firefox	safari
it was behaving properly in firefox but not safari

193770
mouse	keyboard
...you could jump through these errors using usual keyboard shortcuts mouse clicks you use for compilation error analysis...

193806
nhibernate	llblgenpro
there are several other linq to x implementations around including linq to nhibernate and linq to llblgenpro that offer or mapping and supporting frameworks in a broadly similar fashion to the entity framework

193835
nemerle	boo
i m looking to move some of my lighter weight metaprogramming from nemerle to boo and i m trying to figure out how to define custom operators

193873
inject	interceptor
cache is inject to my interceptor via constructor injection

193880
accessor	properties
the same principles apply whether you use declared properties or write accessor yourself

193922
srp	principles
moreover each object is srp single responsibility principles

193937
lxml	elementtree
see lxml elementtree import example

193941
nemerle	boo
the primary two languages i ve been working with are boo and nemerle but i ve also played around with f#

194001
folder	directory
for asp.net apps i ve often seen them placed on a separate disk from the application under a folder structure that mimics the virtual directory structure

194068
lisp	smalltalk
and when were at the lisp land try to replace lisp with smalltalk

194083
jobs	cron
if you want to avoid setting up cron jobs and whatnot though i d suggest it s a better method the solution you ve provided is pretty good

194112
button	checkbox
for checkbox and radio button see whether and for html elements you ll need to loop over the select.options array and check for each option whether

194120
arp	dhcp
as for the dhcp problem if the other computer is on the same subnet you can look it up by mac address using net arp

194130
ant	maven
it is much better than ant because for most common tasks you don t have to write a complicated build.xml maven has very good defaults and it s all convention over configuration

194130
m2e	pom.xml
it is also well integrated both with netbeans and eclipse m2e plugin so the ide honors whatever settings including dependencies you declare in the pom.xml file

194180
collabnet	svn
you can use the stock collabnet svn installer and configure apache to your liking that way

194184
boost	stl
using precompiled headers this is quite useful for stl and boost

194191
x86	64bit
note however that the programfiles x86 environment variable is only available if your application is running 64bit

194197
lxml	elementtree
i actually prefer lxml as it has api like elementtree but has also nice additional features and performs well

194206
hash	md5
one thing about distributing the filenames into different directories if you consider splitting your md5 filenames into different subdirectories which is generally a good idea i would suggest keeping the complete hash as filename and duplicate the first few chars as directory names

194262
hide	show
then capture each subclasses type and show or hide a different loader graphic

194305
int	chars
this version allows any non-digit chars to delimit int if you only want dots to be allowed you can modify the inner loop to skip only dots and then check for a digit

194347
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
supports ie 6+ firefox 2+ safari 3+ and presumably opera but i did not test

194351
daemons	launchd
you launchd a daemons monitoring on the remote machine see the security parapraph

194363
post	get
if thanks.jsp is requested via a post request - redirect so it you present the page as the response to a get request

194402
ant	maven
given that maven s advantages are not too much compared to ant

194402
ant	maven
then again if you want some of maven s features ant folks have ivy for the dependencies feature

194432
free	malloc
assuming that you allocated the memory dynamically using malloc or another memory allocator you free it using free

194444
free	malloc
when it s about runtime memory allocation you can use your trusty malloc and free

194465
int	chars
what s the c++ way of parsing a string given as chars into an int

194489
xstream	xom
if you decide to roll your own xml configuration i d recommend using xstream with customized serialization options or if you just need to parse some xml take a look at xom

194490
innodb	myisam
the second argument against eav i have heard is that it requires table joins that get into low double digits but it was commented that using innodb over myisam improved the performance some or it could be vice-versa but i can t remember totally

194526
subnet	packets
i thought this might be a implementation detail for udp the packets are hopping over my computer in the subnet but wikipedia ing udp didn t enlighten me any more and i don t see why my computer should be forwarding these packets in the first place

194575
packets	multicast
the packets addressed to ips starting with 239 and 224 are multicast packets

194633
vmware	virtualbox
install something like virtualbox virtualpc or vmware to run linux in a virtual environment

194633
ubuntu	linux
virtualization or a live cd version of linux such as the ubuntu live cd is a fantastic way to get used to linux without having to throw out the safety blanket of windows right away

194636
opensuse	centos	ubuntu	opensuse	ubuntu	centos
if you re not happy with say ubuntu you can just nuke it and install something else say opensuse centos or fedora

194636
ubuntu	linux
it s so popular that you often get better results in google by replacing linux with ubuntu

194646
hide	show
doing this makes it so your custom overlay will show and hide with the normal overlays as they are now one in the same

194656
getter	setter
i generally go with constructor destructor first then important methods followed by getter and setter and eventually misc

194681
opera	google-chrome
tested and working in ff3 opera 9 ie6 and google-chrome

194759
post	get
but there doesn t seem to be a way to get the raw form post ed data without using binaryread and if i do that then i screw myself out of using the request.form collection later on

194777
httphandler	httpmodule
i would recommend implementing and httphandler or an httpmodule for this type of scenario

194777
post	get
you can get to the post data from the page_load event but implementing this logging facility here is not as maintainable

194820
opera	safari
you can embed svg files with and in cutting-edge browsers opera safari also and css background-image

194844
gif	png
create a png pnm pseudo gif svg

194872
webkit	gecko
there is no cross-browser way to do this as you said especially with the red text outline but the webkit and gecko teams are implementing some cool css things like gradients embossing with experimental css properties

194880
opera	safari
you could also use svg + css background-image in opera 9.5 and safari

194884
chown	sudo
why not use sudo for the deployment routine and then chown -r on the rails_root

194889
int	double
for example adding two int is different than adding two double or even one int and one double

194889
equals	tostring
the truth is that like the tostring clone equals methods are for java quasi-standard-like c++ operator overloading is so much part of c++ that it becomes as natural as the original c operators or the before mentioned java methods

194889
subtract	add
do not subtract in a + operator as in do not subtract in a add function or return crap in a clone method

194889
fortran	ada	ada	algol	eiffel	smalltalk	eiffel	ada	eiffel	algol	algol	smalltalk
despite all the fud against used defined operator overloading the following languages support it scala dart python f# c# d algol 68 smalltalk groovy perl 6 c++ ruby haskell matlab eiffel lua clojure fortran 90 swift ada delphi 2005 .

194907
put	get
one caveat with this and i m sure there s an option somewhere to control it but it s been my experience that once you put an xml comment anywhere in a project you ll get a compile warning for every public item that isn t commented if you don t use them everywhere in the project

195002
accessor	properties
as a further it s only functions properties etc that actually throw exceptions so these things aren t covered in the general documentation only in the documentation for the functions or accessor that actually throw them as in the example given

195032
3des	aes
if the algorithms you re working on are standard encryption algorithms like 3des and aes there is definitely hardware available

195070
int	boolean
i would like the fastest and most accurate function boolean isreachable string host int port that passes the following junit tests under the conditions below

195073
onmousedown	onmouseup
then you can intercept the selectionchanged event in the onmousedown and do the selection in the onmouseup instead

195073
mouseup	mousedown
you will also have to maintain a list of the selected rows in the mousedown event and if it turns into a drag drop event you drag all these selected rows and select them on the mouseup

195127
nant	xmlpoke
we re using nant so it s the .build file that has xmlpoke to set debug false alter connection strings and whatever else needs to change in the canary copy and the packaging copy of the web.config

195128
mousehover	mouseenter
btw instead of setting enabled in mousehover you should do it in mouseenter

195128
mouseleave	mouseenter
mouseenter and mouseleave is a pair which indicate whether is the mouse is within the button or not and it s fired once per entry exit

195131
sorting	grouping
for many queries it is much faster than mysql especially for grouping and sorting and can query remote systems in parallel and aggregate the results - which make it very useful in use with sharding

195195
gtk	motif
wxwindows a framework which supports windows 3.1 95 98 nt and unix with gtk motif lesstif and macos

195211
explode	implode
you can usually get by using implode explode or replace

195212
post	get
several of my ajax applications in the past have used get request but now i m starting to use post request instead

195215
post	get
this might help you to decide where to use get and where to use post

195215
post	get
uris addressability and the use of http get and post

195219
post	get
if it does it should be a post request if it doesn t it should be a get request

195220
post	get
the main difference is that post is used to modify the state of the server application while get only requests data from it

195250
hid	keyboard
that should work not just for keyboard but for all hid devices â mice game pads etc

195256
http.sys	httplistener
while you can write your own http server using normal tcp ip it s relatively simple it is easier to use httplistener which takes advantage of the http.sys functionality added in windows xp sp2

195305
trac	bugzilla
how does it compare to trac bugzilla

195324
rss	feed
you should try dotnetkicks.com which delivers nice rss feed of the most relevant .net blogs imho

195338
redmine	trac
the advantage of own project management software like trac or redmine is that you have the power of everything

195378
post	get
each data-entry form should point to a small php without any html that simply get s the post data enters into the db and forwards to the calling page

195382
textarea	pre
this causes incorrect display of whitespace in elements that ought to preserve formatting such as pre and textarea

195398
postgresql	mysql
the most mentioned difference between mysql and postgresql is about your reading writing ratios

195398
postgresql	mysql
but if you do a lot of heavy updates to a table as often as other threads have to read then the default locking in mysql is not the best and postgresql can be a better choice performance-wise

195398
postgresql	mysql
that s why it s usually said that mysql is best for webapps while postgresql is more enterprisey

195398
postgresql	mysql
at the load levels where postgresql s better locks overtake mysql s other parts of your platform could be the bottlenecks

195415
postgresql	mysql
you could then compare these with mysql and postgresql

195417
calloc	malloc
a nice malloc calloc and reallloc replacement is rmdebug it s pretty simple to use

195451
int	boolean
i use public boolean mousedown event ev int x int y to detect a click of the mouse

195477
subtract	add
when you equip or unequip an item add or subtract from the effective stats where appropriate

195485
vim	emacs
using either vim or emacs you come to understand that the interface exposes the code s representation of the state of the file you are editing in the buffer the file is the on-disk storage you can fill a buffer from or write a buffer to

195485
vim	emacs
vim and emacs are our two oldest editors in common use today and they share this behavior

195528
children	parent
i have classes bidiparent and bidichildlist which link parent and children in a bidirectional parent-child relationship

195528
children	parent
if a child s parent is updated by the service layer the old and new parent children lists are automatically updated to reflect the change

195528
children	parent
likewise if a parent s children list is updated by adding a new child the child s parent is automatically changed as is the old parent s children list

195528
children	parent
second question is is it possible to tell nhibernate to access and modify the field _children or _parent but to consider the property children or parent to be entirely synonymous with the field

195534
apache	nginx
what to use for a medium to large python wsgi application apache + mod_wsgi or nginx + mod_wsgi

195535
internationalization	localization
you ve been pointed to gnu gettext which allows you to replace literal strings with localized versions at run time - one aspect of localization which is what happens after you ve done the internationalization when someone actually uses your internationalized code in a specific locale

195537
rss	feed
i am working on an implementation for rss feed for a collaboration platform

195537
rss	feed
say there are several thousands of different collaboration rooms where users can share information and each needs to publish an rss feed with news changes etc.

195537
rss	feed
using a plain servlet is costly every time an rss client is calling the servlet and this will happen say every 10 minutes for each user registered to an rss feed on one of the thousand of rooms this will trigger the entire servlet lifecycle which is costly

195537
rss	feed
so how would you implement rss feed in a java envoronment

195549
width	height
caveat the canvas height and width is set by the component that instantiates it this is all wrapped up in a custom component so i can t explicitly set the width or height of the text control.

195567
vim	emacs
hence emacs s basic unit of work is a buffer and not a file and the same logic holds for vim

195567
vim	emacs
more capable applications like emacs and vim are a lot more flexible in that respect

195590
folder	dir
does anybody know how to determine the location of a file that s in one of the folder specified by the path environmental variable other than doing a dir filename.exe s from the root folder

195618
profiler	shark
if you haven t yet and you care about performance you must run your code through a good profiler personally i like kcachegrind valgrind on linux or shark on mac os x

195668
vim	emacs
in other words much of the vim emacs model except tweaked to be more in-line with discoveries that browsers are making

195683
nhibernate	llblgenpro
nhibernate activerecord subsonic npersist linqtoef linqtosql llblgenpro db4o csla etc

195688
int	double	int	chars
i have a string chars and i need to find its underlying datatype such as int float double short long or just a chars array containing alphabets with or with out digits like varchar in sql

195696
free	malloc
to prevent confusion in the future i d like to point out that the answer suggesting that the problem lies with the use of malloc free to manage the buffers being played is simply wrong

195745
gridview	repeater
why not use an xmldatasource with a gridview or repeater which ever is more appropriate and use a template to generate custom buttons bound to the appropriate properties from the xml element

195764
button	checkbox
the index.php page that shows the list of activities with checkbox a button to delete the checked activities and a field to add new activities

195795
unsigned	short
for example is 0xbac0 an unsigned short expressed in hex

195795
int	double
now you can convert it to the largest possible type long long for int double for floating pointers and then use the values in limits.h to see if the value would fit in a smaller type

195795
unsigned	short
you might also have to take arbitrary decisions for example 54321 can only be an unsigned short but 12345 could be a signed short or an unsigned short

195814
inherited	subclassing
with inherited you can implement common code at the base class with some override at the subclassing form and implement flexible interplay

195837
int	double
my comparing dvalue double long dvalue i guess you should know if is an int again not taking into account the usual precision problems coming witb binary real numbers used by computers

195843
invalidoperationexception	argumentnullexception
argumentnullexception invalidoperationexception

195859
post	get
caveat i ve never done linq-to-xml before but looking through other post on the topic this snippet has some f# code that compiles and does something and thus it may help you get started

195916
next	except
this also means that if you hit one of the features that are simply unsupported in rails that you really need youâ ll have no next step except to write the feature yourself if youâ re lucky

195919
folder	directory
it seems like the uninstaller removes only the directory and files that were originally installed from the msi file and it leaves everything else that was added later in the application folder

195939
cpu	hyperthreading
nowadays you are frequently hard-pressed to find a machine without multiple cores or hyperthreading or equivalent but in the circumstances that you have just a single cpu you should use semaphores

195952
cvs	svn
initially i thought that svn followed in the wake of cvs and didn t store binary diffs which it turns out i was wrong about

195957
client-side	server-side
but it is possible to make a md5 or other type of encryption client-side that gives you a reasonably secure way of validation you could test server-side

195996
vb.net	vb6
he s also written what is i believe is considered one of best books on the .net visual basic and is probably the foremost expert on migrating from vb6 to vb.net and the pitfalls therein

195998
vmware	virtualbox
if you can t get pre-packaged binaries for solaris you ll need to get your own solaris machine using virtual pc vmware virtualbox etc use it to compile the gems then pull the binary files out

196014
swt	swing
which library better for faster java application swt or swing

196027
hide	show
although this isn t a huge amount of time when using it to hide show ui elements the time can be visibly noticeable

196091
setinterval	settimeout
dan from my experience that includes implementation of smil2.1 language in javascript where time management is in subject i can assure you that you actually never need high precision of settimeout or setinterval

196091
setinterval	settimeout
what does however matter is the order in which settimeout setinterval gets executed when queued - and that always works perfectly

196109
wav	ogg
i d like to be able to create apps that can play not only those formats that the flex framework provides support for but other formats as well like wav wma ogg and other...

196136
free	malloc
so i suppose my real question is other than malloc free which handles getting and freeing pages for itself etc does a program need the os to provide anything else

196146
free	malloc
then it s up to malloc to dole out memory in a way that doesn t fragment the free memory too much

196154
free	malloc
most often c programs have their own malloc free functionality

196164
primes	modulus
where m the modulus would be the nearest primes bigger than 1000

196176
cl.exe	prefast
for static analysis consider compiling with prefast cl.exe analyze

196179
yacc	bison
please limit your solution to yacc bison parsers

196191
free	malloc
the job of malloc and free is to manage those pages of memory which are fixed in size typically 4 kb but sometimes bigger and to slice and dice them into pieces that applications can use

196233
gridview	detailsview
i only use it for bringing up smarttag on things like gridview detailsview and datasource rather than generating all the tedious boundfield and template controls by hand

196244
versioning	upgrade
for users it means they can have but one versioning installed and upgrade etc require parallel running

196252
swt	swing
several years ago swing was slow so swt was developed to make native api calls on systems

196252
swt	swing
swt is non-standard while swing is officially part of the java spec

196309
min	max
i ve been doing more reading including a micorosft research paper on functional programming with catamorphisms bananas and it seems that catamorphism just refers to any function that takes a list and typically breaks it down to a single value like max min and in the general case aggregate would all be a catamorphisms for lists

196349
hide	show
when the user presses the button hide the button and show the progress bar

196349
hide	show
then hide the progress bar and show the button again

196361
free	malloc
rather you d run into the difficulty that any good memalign implementation will be an integral part of the heap-manager codebase not simply layered on top of malloc free

196468
maven	cobertura
i am using the maven 2 cobertura plug-in to create reports on code coverage and i have the following stub i am using in a method

196468
maven	cobertura
any idea how i can convince cobertura s maven plugin that since the system.err.println statement is covered that ending brace has to have been covered

196499
range	max	range	min	min	max
the datediff on max min date values you suggested should work another option is to just count records for each submitted within each date range

196548
hash	md5
basically the idea is to take everything that you can find out about the computer person and then generate a md5 hash of this information

196551
implements	extends
the only thing i can think of you could do is write a proxy class where one of your private fields is the class you d want to extends and you implements all it s methods and proxy their calls

196592
modifiers	sealed
i believe you can use reflection to get around the access modifiers on a class so perhaps you can use reflection.emit to generate a type that inherits from an internal type but not the sealed modifiers though i can t find an example of this online

196616
nunit	mstest
run the test with a testrunner nunit mstest etc

196647
implements	extends
layne you described the problem as happening when your controller class implements an interface but in the code sample you provided the problem occurs when your controller class extends another class of yours validatingcontroller

196705
postgresql	mysql
in fact web2py is the only framework that allows you to write code once and the same code will run on gae sqlite mysql postgresql oracle mssql and firebird with the limitations imposed by gae

196705
django	web2py
the django orm does not do migrations natively see south web2py does

196705
django	web2py
the django orm does not allow partial sums count field and group by web2py does

196705
django	web2py	pylons	web2py
web2py can connect to multiple databases at once django and pylons need to be hacked to do that and

196705
django	web2py	pylons	web2py
anyway the most important issue is that web2py is easier than django pylons php and rails

196707
gif	png	gif	bmp	bmp	png	bmp	pcx	bmp	tga	png	tga
just by calling snapurl and saveimage you can take a snapshot of a webpage into various images such as bmp jpg jpeg gif png tif tga and pcx

196707
vbscript	jscript
more than 30 samples written in vc c- delphi vb c++ builder java jscript perl vbscript asp asp.net and php are provided

196721
maven	pom.xml
here s the relevant snippet of my project s maven 2 pom.xml

196721
maven	pom.xml	maven	cobertura
does anyone have this working and if so what does your pom.xml look like and which version of cobertura and maven are you using

196721
maven	cobertura
i m using maven 2.0.9 and cobertura 2.2

196737
public	protected
i ve been working with the joomla framework and i have noticed that they use a convention to designate private or protected methods they put an underscore _ in front of the method name but they do not explicitly declare any methods public private or protected

196737
public	protected
are the public private or protected keywords not available in older versions of php

196739
public	protected
public private and protected are php5 keywords

196798
django	web2py
web2py is 265kbytes of source code and 1.2mb all inclusive compare with 4.6mb of django

196798
postgresql	mysql
yet web2py will do everything you need manage session cookies request response cache internationalization errors tickets database abstraction for gae sqlite mssql mysql postgresql oracle firebird etc. it does not need installation - just unzip and click on it - and you can do development in your browser

196838
mouseleave	mouseenter
it sounds like what you really want is mouseenter mouseleave ie proprietary events but easy to emulate

196838
mouseleave	mouseenter
alternatively patch prototype.js and use mouseenter and mouseleave with confidence

196933
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
i ve successfully tested it in firefox 3 msie 7 opera 9 and google-chrome

197035
stdout	stderr
also try to redirect the output but stdout and stderr to a file so that you can see the error messages that are generated

197067
factors	mean
edit clarified what quality factors are supposed to mean

197086
post	get
you can also use bayesian filtering to remove or otherwise deal with the spam post that do get through

197160
opera	safari
like internet explorer opera safari on windows

197188
getter	setter
again check the getter setter checkboxes

197210
mouse	keyboard
this will not remove the key binding from vmware but you could set the option to grab keyboard and mouse intput on key press in the vmware preferences

197247
dictionary	map
purpose of the class a dictionary where a key can map to multiple values

197267
apache	lighttpd	apache	nginx	nginx	lighttpd
if you want to avoid apache it is possible to deploy a mongrel cluster with an alternative web server such as nginx or lighttpd and a load balancer of some variety such as pound or a hardware-based solution

197270
disk	ram
at any given moment it would be best if all bytes are both on disk and in ram

197270
disk	ram
this holds true whether the bytes are logically file bytes ie the ram is cache or process bytes ie the disk bytes are paged

197270
disk	ram
obviously for engineering reasons you can t have all bytes both on disk and in ram

197270
disk	ram
but you certainly shouldn t be throwing bytes out of ram just because they are also on disk

197270
disk	ram
and if you have both a spinning disk and ram pages that haven t changed in a minute it makes sense to pre-emptively write out the bytes

197276
stdout	stderr
the redirects stderr to stdout so any error messages will be captured in

197282
calloc	malloc
the malloc calloc valloc

197316
width	height
at first i was going to propose to get rid of the divs and move the formatting width and height directly on the td but i tried that and doesn t seem to solve the problem

197317
width	height
other bits css width height values require units presumably px

197346
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
as eric said a lot of big websites don t validate however if you start with a validating website that works perfectly in for example firefox safari google-chrome or opera chances are it will be right or mostly right in the other 3 and will only require minor adjustments for them to be right

197346
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari	webkit	gecko
ie6 and 7 have html hacks that don t require any extra work to load specific stylesheets for them but there isn t anything available for the gecko webkit or presto browsers firefox safari google-chrome or opera so an alternate method is needed for anything specific to these browsers

197372
testcase	fixture
i d like to parametrize the entire testcase including the fixture

197382
g++	gcc
if you want to be able to compile this code in gcc or g++ you will need to create an iterator and use a standard for-loop

197437
hash	salt
so what you could do is take all the pertinent information about what is in the coupon then hash it together with a secret salt to prevent tampering

197437
hash	salt	hash	md5	salt	md5
thus suppose you wanted a coupon for user 23 worth 200 you might build up a string like 23_200 and calculate an md5 hash with a secret salt of billthelizard to get 2671519131e974ee6fc746151e98f4a8 thus the complete code you give the customer is 200_23_2671519131e974ee6fc746151e98f4a8

197468
wtl	atl
i m just starting up a new atl wtl project and i was wondering if the global _module variable is still required

197468
wtl	atl
back a few years when i started working with wtl it was required at least for atl 3.0 that you define a global variable such as

197486
post	get
forgive me for the self-advertising but i have posted a few on my blog because i m rubbish at sql and it s a good place to store things i know i ll need in the future - if anyone has anything more substantial then please post i m as keen as anyone to get hold of something like this

197502
invalidoperationexception	argumentnullexception	invalidoperationexception	argumentexception	argumentnullexception	argumentexception
the framework offers already a lot of valid exception classes like argumentexception argumentnullexception invalidoperationexception formatexception overflowexception etc.

197567
superclass	subclassing
you could subclassing or superclass one of these controls to implement infinite functionality

197567
mouse	keyboard
create a single child window draw it yourself handle all the mouse and keyboard input yourself and implement the scroll bar messages yourself

197622
equals	gethashcode	equals	tostring	tostring	gethashcode
is there a visual studio plugin tool snippet for .net that is similar to commonclipse for the java eclipse platform that automatically generates the tostring equals gethashcode methods for you

197649
svg	vml
while working on svg implementation for internet explorer to be based on its own vml format i came to a problem of translation of an svg elliptical arc to an vml elliptical arc

197706
free	malloc
in microsoft s runtime the new operator uses malloc and the delete operator uses free

197732
post	get
the post outlines the process to get a valid certificate installed

197745
post	get
it is also a bad idea to use get methods to change state - take a look at the guidelines on when to use get and when to use post

197799
width	height
you might also try wrapping the content of your row s cells in an href and using css to push the href height width to the internal bounds of each cell

197845
hide	show
i m trying to show hide a movieclip or graphic symbol that is on a layer of a button symbol using actionscript 2

197863
profiling	debugging
ie8 beta 2 has some nice debugging profiling features i would tend to look for the possible resource culprits e.g google maps ajax calls dom manipulation table appending etc and use the debugger to set breakpoints and monitor things this way

197900
cpu	processors
it may be possible to let c++ keep track of all the allocated arrays and their sizes if you are writing a word processors for a windows box running on the latest intel cpu but it may be completely infeasible when you are writing an embedded system running on a dsp

197940
put	get
i can t seem to find an easy to use .net native way to get comboboxes on .net winforms to display one value and return another based on the selection without creating my own helper class with the knowledge that winforms is going to display the tostring method on the object that you put in it

197958
onmousedown	onmouseup
onmouseup onmousedown

198058
width	height
i d like to show a div that has a background-color with the height and width set to 100 but no content

198058
width	height
edit thanks to mark biek for pointing out that empty div with width and height styles shows how i d expect

198083
firefox	safari
this seems to work in firefox safari ie6 ie7

198084
webkit	gecko
i think it depends on the browser ie gecko engine webkit engine and on the mode standards mode quirks mode

198090
onmousedown	onmouseup
onmousedown and onmouseup are general events that anything can listen to via mouse.addlistener

198096
mouseup	mousedown
it looks like the mouseup mousedown events will trigger even when the mouse is outside the movie clip while onpress release will automatically check to see if the mouse is within the clip before being handled

198131
queue	fifo
queue and stacks are slightly specialised in that they are optimised for fifo and filo behaviour fifo and fifo respectively

198136
queue	fifo
queue fifo collection

198136
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
sorteddictionary tkey tvalue like sortedlist but stored as a tree of key value pairs which gives better performance in many situations

198137
cos	sin
y2 - y1 2 b cos t1 + t2 2 sin t1 - t2 2

198137
cos	sin
r2 cos a1 sin a2

198252
gridview	objectdatasource
i have a form that contains a gridview control which is databound to an objectdatasource control

198290
titlebar	window
the drawback to this approach is that you lose the borders of your window as well as the titlebar

198290
mousemove	mousedown
you would need to deal with this by implementing your own form move resize logic in the form s mousedown and mousemove event handlers

198306
french	polish
multilanguage support currently croatian danish english french german italian japanese polish portuguese

198348
int	double
web2py has js to blocks the user from entering a non-integer in a int field or a non-double in a double field

198422
tiff	png
convert the smaller logo pdf to a tiff png whatever using for example imagemagick s convert or the gimp

198441
actionscript	mxml
the flex mxml is mainly another syntax which eventually gets compiled to something you could have also written in actionscript

198462
post	get
when comparing an http get to an http post what are the differences from a security perspective

198462
post	get
when using jsp or a similar framework would it be fair to say the best practice is to avoid placing sensitive data in the post or get altogether and using server side code to handle sensitive information instead

198470
range	max
but if you don t use random.new then the class method rand only takes a max value not a range as banister energetically points out in the comment and as documented in the docs for random

198473
post	get
while it is true that post doesn t expose information via the url it exposes just as much information as a get in the actual network communication between the client and server

198473
post	get
get or query string post are really good for information required for either bookmarking a particular item or for assisting in search engine optimization and indexing items

198487
post	get
even if post gives no real security benefit versus get for login forms or any other form with relatively sensitive information make sure you are using post as

198487
ssl	https
for real sensitive info make sure to use ssl https

198488
move	drag
i guess there should be a drag initiated but when the mouse move outside the app window it needs to switch to the other functionality and should the mouse move back to the app window again back to the standard drag drop

198489
ssl	https	post	get
get is visible to anyone even the one on your shoulder now and is saved on cache so is less secure of using post btw post without some cryptographics routine is not sure for a bit of security you ve to use ssl https

198492
post	get
many people adopt a convention alluded to by ross that get requests only retrieve data and do not modify any data on the server and post requests are used for all data modification

198565
post	get
neither one of get and post is inherently more secure than the other just like neither one of fax and phone is more secure than the other

198565
post	get
get is more appropiate for idempotent queries while post is more appropiate for action queries but you can shoot yourself in the foot just as easily with any of them if you don t understand the security architecture for the application you re maintaining

198565
post	get
it s probably best if you read chapter 9 method definitions of the http 1.1 rfc to get an overall idea of what get and post were originally envisioned ot mean

198571
int	boolean
as others have pointed out any int value other than zero is considered true for the purposes of boolean expressions in c.

198592
perl	tcl
the .net framework regular expression engine is a backtracking regular expression matcher that incorporates a traditional nondeterministic finite automaton nfa engine such as that used by perl python emacs and tcl

198592
nfa	dfa
matching behavior first paragraph â â this article also offers a rationale for the employment of an nfa rather than the more efficient dfa

198606
cassini	iis
this works fine in cassini the built-in ad hoc web server for visual studio but gives me internet explorer cannot display the webpage when i try it on a live server running iis

198607
xna	slimdx
while that is most likely not an option for you since xna is not as slim as slimdx it certainly means that system.math is either actually missing something or the performance hit is not that big

198624
nfa	dfa
because representation of a given problem with a nfa is far easier than the equivalent dfa

198651
versioning	upgrade
the client vm compiler serves as an upgrade for both the classic vm and the just-in-time jit compilers used by previous versioning of the jdk

198679
mp3	ogg	mp3	wav	wav	ogg
given an inputstream called in which contains audio data in a compressed format such as mp3 or ogg i wish to create a byte array containing a wav conversion of the input data

198844
post	get
the difference between get and post should not be viewed in terms of security but rather in their intentions towards the server

198844
post	get
get should never change data on the server - at least other than in logs - but post can create new resources

198844
post	get
nice proxies won t cache post data but they may cache get data from the url so you could say that post is supposed to be more secure

198854
vb.net	vb6
i used to use it religiously back in the vb6 days but stopped when vb.net came out because that s what the new vb guidelines said

198866
post	get
both get and post send data in plaintext over the wire when used over http

198892
width	height
this works fine in firefox 3 but fails in ie7 because the image object being passed to the sizeimage function has a width and height of 0 for some reason -- maybe ie calls the function before it finishes loading

198928
width	height
how do i change the above imagemagick command so it takes the width and height from an existing image

198995
udp	tcp
in the example on cpan use sock_raw rather than sock_dgram udp or sock_stream tcp

199016
ati	nvidia
i ve tried it on vista 64-bit with ati graphic card and on windows xp 32-bit with nvidia with the same result in both cases

199038
gmail	hotmail
apparently email providers such as hotmail gmail yahoo drop all incoming email from widely used server providers such as amazon ec2

199045
post	get
basically it should allow me to submit http get and post requests with a simple syntax and then parse the resulting page and return in a simple format all forms and their fields along with all links on the page

199052
typedef	struct
it complained about a struct typedef in one of the openssl headers

199070
multi-query	mysql
this is called multi-query. the mysql extension in php does not have any means to enable multi-query

199127

199154
rss	feed
i get the following error when trying to load an rss feed

199159
post	get
edited to post the following example refactored code apologies for any errors as i typed it in notepad in a couple seconds rather than opening visual studio and i wouldn t get intellisense for your project anyway

199222
awt	swing
it does look like mixing lightweight usually swing and heavyweight awt components together

199222
awt	swing
moving to swing you need to replace every last awt component swing equivalents hint avoid import java.awt

199236
cpython	ironpython
for me ironpython has been the more robust choice and much of what i ve written in cpython ports without changes

199246
des	aes	3des	aes
when i add a new ipsec filter rule the only options for esp i get are des and 3des so the faq is correct - there is no support for aes prior to windows vista

199255
cpython	ironpython
once you have cpython understanding ironpython will be a lot easier to understand

199262
awt	swing
this happens all the time if you are not programming carefully in awt swing

199262
put	get
third and this is an extension of first if you get a callback that is not already on the awt worker thread be sure to put it on the awt thread before doing anything with the gui

199275
cpython	ironpython
i write code for cpython and ironpython but tip should work for jython as well

199289
public	protected
if you re using an oo language then i d suggest it s essential to validate the arguments to public methods but less important with private and protected methods

199290
nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception
decoding nullpointerexception is going to take a bit longer than illegalargumentexception filepath must be supplied or whatever

199292
argumentnullexception	argumentexception
yes it s good practice to validate all arguments at the beginning of a method and throw appropriate exceptions like argumentexception argumentnullexception or argumentoutofrangeexception

199307
inherited	properties
the component i was implementing a custom collection inherited from collectionbase i changed this to a list and added the designerserializationvisibility designerserializationvisibility.content attribute to the list properties this list is also read-only

199344
stdout	fflush
you need the fflush stdout because normally stdout is buffered until you output a newline

199362
kate	kdevelop
if you look at kate the text editor and kdevelop the ide the main difference is that kdevelop supports project management cvs subversion and build scripts whereas kate does not

199368
awk	ksh
all i use bash ksh for is as a shell - the scripting side is not useful - simple stuff is done with awk and pipes and complex stuff requires c

199371
pdcurses	ncurses
curses# uses pdcurses on windows and ncurses on linux

199373
jobs	cron
but your sysadmin friends will look at you funny when you write perl wrappers for cron jobs

199387
post	get
i created a nice class that can get and post an array of data including files

199387
post	get
to a url by just calling curlhandler get url data || curlhandler post url data

199391
debian	linux	versioning	upgrade
since they all run debian linux i ve set up a debian package repository on my server and the all the customer has to do is type apt-get upgrade and they get the latest versioning

199403
imagemagick	magick++
i am aware of imagemagick and it s c++ binding magick++ but i think it s an overkill for this project since i am currently not interested in other file formats or platforms

199405
getter	setter
the generate getter setter and constructor from fields functions are all really nice but it would be useful to have that tied into a new class pojo dialog

199427
packets	pcap
if you re writing an unusual packets processor such as an active hostile attack tool a man-in-the-middle process or a traffic shaping device then would be more likely to be building packets and using pcap

199450
put	get
this is because you may need to control the ids which get put in this table because your application is going to have to look for specific ids

199472
int	double
given that not every value is an int though you should typically not expect the memory footprint of your application to double

199521
groupbox	panel
to make matters worse in order to recursively clear controls inside sub-containers a group box within the panel i have to repeat the whole monster with an overloaded groupbox version

199526
bitblt	gdi
using gdi calls rather than gdi+ for the bitblt this is often a good idea - graphics drawimage can be very slow

199526
bitblt	gdi
i ve even found the normal gdi bitblt call to be faster on some systems

199540
groupbox	panel
the only change i might suggest would be instead of overloading the method just make the passed in type a control and you can use the same version for groupbox panel or any other container control that provides a .controls property

199554
argumentnullexception	argumentexception
for example an exception filter that catches argumentexception will also catch exceptions derived from argumentexception such as argumentnullexception invalidenumargumentexception duplicatewaitobjectexception and argumentoutofrangeexception

199576
ubuntu	linux
i am planning to move my vmware s virtual machines from a windows host to a linux host ubuntu

199590
packets	pcap
i also liked the suggestions from denton andrew of replaying pcap format packets

199593
put	get
you ll only get an improvement in programming efficiency after you ve put in the effort to re-implement the web app -- which due to the time required for the reimplementation may or may not result in an improvement overall

199602
awt	swing
canvas is an awt component so you ll need to wrap it in a swing component to which you can set the border

199634
pygtk	gtk#
gtk+ you can use almost in all programming languages in c++ using gtkmm in c gtk+ in c# with gtk# in python pygtk

199637
goto	break
java does not implement goto though it does have jump statements like break and continue

199661
bash	tcsh
i ve used bash csh and tcsh

199668
subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition	addition	multiplication
note this catches integer addition subtraction overflows and i realized that your question involves multiplication

199672
rhel	slackware	rhel	suse	slackware	suse
i usually stick to bash because it s more friendly than straight-up sh and it s the default on every distro i ve used semi-regularly suse rhel ubuntu slackware

199680
next	except
on the next pull you want to do the same thing except now if the edge has already been selected discard and reselect

199687
mouse	keyboard
is there a way of sending mouse and keyboard input so that llmhf_injected is not set

199692
inherited	properties
i have only a basic knowledge of css is it possible to inherited a properties from one style into another style

199695
ienumerable	ilist
apparently the winforms combo box wants an ilist not an ienumerable

199699

199735
onclick	onmousedown
add an onclick or onmousedown handler to the anchor tag

199835
vim	emacs
rather like editors do you prefer vim or emacs choice of shell is partly a question of familiarity and partly a question of preference

199835
subtract	add
if you decide that you want to use something other than c shell then you are basically in the bourne shell camp for which the posix standard more or less specifies the expected behaviour and then the different shells -- that is the bourne korn or born again shells -- add or in the case of the classic bourne shell subtract a few features

199835
unix	aix	unix	solaris	solaris	aix
if your code might ever need to move off linux to hp-ux solaris or aix the surviving trio of the classic at t-derived unix variants then you should consider ensuring you write your shell scripts in classic bourne shell though korn shell is also pretty safe

199867
bash	zsh
for a while i was the maintainer of the freebsd port of the bash tab-completion scripts but abandoned it as soon as i tried zsh for the first time

199867
bash	zsh
bash and zsh and other shells have nice extensions that you ll miss but those tie you to a specific setup

199870
ffmpeg	libavformat
i use ffmpeg also known as libavformat which is a cross-platform api

199879
mouseover	mouseout
my problem is that the mouseover and mouseout javascript events don t always trigger especially if the user moves the mouse over the flash element too quickly

199979
hide	show
one thing i ve done frequently is to create frames in the mc called show and hide followed by short animations and a stop command and then done something like this
