although it may not look quite the same visually i would suggest looking at wxtoolbook which puts tabs in a toolbar and would solve your problem you could use the gettoolbar method to insert your own toolbar items

10102458
toolbar	tabs
if that wasn t close enough visually to what you are looking to achieve i would suggest deriving a new control from wxbookctrlbase and then creating a tab control with custom drawn tabs which you could add to the toolbar using wxtoolbar addcontrol

memcached	apc
should a simple apc memcached entry be enough or would it require a more stable and persistant storage method also implying an extra sql query or file write on every login

10102480
memcached	apc
i originally thought that a cache storage apc memcached would be enough to store the counter but i m fearing that the cache could fail for what reason making this defense layer ineffective

10102521

10103084
int	double
you can easy convert float variable to int variable or double to long using such code in c#

10103086

10103310
dbcontext	objectcontext
when using dbcontext in a database-first scenario i found out that adding and deleting entities is very slow compared to objectcontext

10103310
dbcontext	objectcontext
if adding 2000 entities and saving the changes at the end dbcontext is 3 to 5 times slower than objectcontext btw. i know that adding a large amount of entities would be better using sqlbulkcopy but that s not the point

10103310
dbcontext	objectcontext
when it comes to deletion it even gets worse when saving at the end of all entity removals dbcontext is around 18 times slower than objectcontext

10115322
centos	linux
i m having hard time trying to setup an ssl certificate it s a comodo positivessl purshased from namecheap on my ec2 micro instance i m using amazon linux ami 2012.3 which is based on centos if i m not mistaken

10115387
put	get
put this all together and we get a statement similar to this

10115393
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
please view the below code as html in both firefox and other browsers such as google-chrome or safari

10115409
navigationcontroller	pushviewcontroller
rather convoluted calling sequence but the first issue i see is that it looks like you re calling pushviewcontroller on an onbviewcontroller not on its navigationcontroller

10115461
width	height
you can use to generate thumbnail of fixed size all you need to do it set your desired height and width

10115470
google-chrome	firefox
well i have tried something like this with firefox and google-chrome

10115495
stdout	stderr
if you want to get absolutely everything both stdout and stderr you need to redirect stdout from system.out and stderr from system.err

10115495
stdout	stderr
note that java buffers system.out so if you log both stdout and stderr to the same file you could end up with nonsensical output that has the two printstreams interwoven or something in stdout could be printed much later than a related message that was printed to stderr

10115538
serializable	deserialization
the preparemetadataforserialization method on base configures the runtimemodel for protobuf.net but i mentioned earlier the serializable and deserialization works fine outside of the wcf so i think the dtos are ok

10115557
cpu	processors
on my machine this gives me all sorts of devices sound card pci and usb processors so i m not sure if there is a better way to just get the cpu but i did get the info what cpu i have

10115588
getter	setter
when referring to internal private variables of java pojos that have getter setter i ve used the following terms

10115617
factors	matrix
lastly try to cheat the conditioning on your matrix by multiplying the diagonal by a factors like 1.0001

10115625
getter	setter
it does not mean there is a getter and a setter

10115625
getter	setter
property is the getter and setter combination

10115631
margin	height
surround the entire thing with a container div of the fixed height which you desire with no padding and inside that place another inner div with no margin and no fixed height then as the user changes the content create a javascript function to check if the inner div is the container div

10115656
for-loop	arrays
i m trying to query my database using a an arrays that increments in a for-loop

10115677
for-loop	arrays
i have an arrays that i want to rename so that the values are stored depending on what number the for-loop is on

10115700
jruby	mri
i have had success using mri for my development tdd cycles and switching to jruby using rvm to make sure everything still runs

10115714
ubuntu	linux
i ve compiled an ada program for linux on ubuntu 5.4 gnat 3.4 using the following command

10115768
for-loop	arrays
i have this code that executes a for-loop in javascript with a php arrays inside of it

10115802
width	height
they are only visible within the stage i ve set with specific height and width

10115869
user-controls	tabcontrol
the tabcontrol sets its size according to the user-controls size

10115891
rsa	dsa
i created both an rsa key and dsa key

10115891
rsa	dsa
i guess rsa is older and dsa is newer

10115901
post	get
but in my groups case i need to specify parameters such as all in people all to get all people or group id in people groups id to specify where to post a new person

10115913
put	get
i have worked out how to do the foreach and get every result but i put in the following code and just get a blank page

10116027
for-loop	arrays
i m thinking of writing a method that contains a for-loop that goes through each value in the arrays that the table view is pulled from and adds only those with the correct accessory type to a new arrays

10116029
public	protected
should their visibility be public or protected

10116029
public	protected
even though a child class implementing the abstract method will be public is it still advisable to maintain the abstract method protected

10116033
free	malloc
when we call malloc it allocates memory in the heap and it does so by picking a data block of suitable size from the free list right

10116038
getter	setter
and adjust your getter setter accordingly

10116068
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
i ve noticed that i can place this in viewwillappear and viewdidappear with slightly different results

10116105
post	get
use union to combine all the post from different tables then use the in clause to get all the userid s you want to follow based on the current userid

10116109
public	protected
if the abstract method only implements some piece of a greater functionality that is available from a public method in your abstract class then it should probably be protected

10116110
set	bag
the resource should remain alive as long as either there s at least one wrapper object in the bag whose valid flag is set or the resource itself holds a reference to a valid wrapper

10116134
post	get
this will work the same using post instead of get

10116144
google-chrome	firefox
but i m having issues on google-chrome and firefox - they both trigger the error callback with the slight difference that on google-chrome my controller action doesn t even get hit at all it does on firefox though

10116187
google-chrome	firefox
when the page generates it shows the code properly in the view source option of google-chrome and firefox but when i do inspect element it shows this

10116196
public	protected
here is the difference for public protected and private

10116196
public	protected
for method if you set public it can be accessed to all classes within all packages in your project if you set protected it just can be accessed to all classes within same package or sub class that extend the abstract class

10116200
google-chrome	safari
jquery offers cross-browser compatibility compare to keyframe which is only supported in safari and google-chrome

10116200
google-chrome	safari
if you don t want your users to be limited only to google-chrome and safari you should definitely consider jquery

10116205
getter	setter
create getter and setter for all properties in the config

10116220
submit	submission
the additional values that appear to be injected on submission are simply the x and y coordinates where the you clicked on the image to submit the form

10116220
submit	submission
when you use javascript to submit the form you do not click on the image which is why the x and y values are not included on form submission

10116242
free	malloc
the apparent corruption would happen because type or foo points at already free memory which malloc gives back to you for a different use

10116242
strdup	malloc
you should check the allocations from strdup and malloc to ensure that you got memory allocated

10116280
textview	imageview
each listview have 1 imageview and 2 textview

10116292
google-chrome	safari
so i was wondering is there a way to logout the user when he she closes the whole browser not just the one window in like say safari ie or google-chrome

10116315
google-chrome	firefox
it works in all other browsers firefox google-chrome etc except ie7

10116322
disk	ram
it allocates virtual addresses and the kernel is responsible for keeping track of where the pages are actually stored in physical ram or on disk

10116322
free	malloc
so the pages remain allocated to your program from the kernel standpoint even though they re free space from the malloc standpoint

10116338
getter	setter
i created a property for the nsarray which creates a getter setter

10116363
put	get
the primary problem with sending byte s over web services is that they get put in the soap body which is gets encoded as a base 64 string

10116368
free	malloc
this means that each subarray needs to be malloc d and free d individually

10116389
retaincount	dealloc
if your array s retaincount is greater than 1 at the start of dealloc some other object is retaining it at least temporarily

10116435
getter	setter
perl libraries for example often use a getter and setter

10116466
post	put
i ll be sure to post it later as it is getting kinda late and i m gonna put this down for the night

10116549
put	get
i m trying to put together a quick web service test just to see if i can get it to work for now

10116607
x86	64bit
i believe common x86 architectures will allow allocations of continuous physical memory in powers of two from 16 bytes to 4 mb though i m on a 64bit machine

10116625
put	get
a quick way to get it down by a factor of 10 or so is to create a column for string length put an index on it and use it in the where clause

10116703
feof	getchar
feof stream is probably wrong because feof does not predict a future eof it tells you only why a previous read-attempt failed why getchar returned eof

10116719
hide	show
then in cellforrowatindexpath create the cell then depending on the actual requirement show hide the subviews that makes up a book or a movie

10116719
hide	show
so if your layout varies you can still put them in one place and use frame or show hide to control cell behavior

10116735
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i ve got an app with a uitabbarcontroller that controls several uiviewcontroller

10116736
thinking-sphinx	ransack
our project is using ransack at the moment we are thinking to introduce thinking-sphinx

10116736
thinking-sphinx	ransack
is any way to use thinking-sphinx and ransack in a same project

10116746
scikit-learn	libsvm
in addition you will want to use scikit-learn which is a python wrapper for libsvm a very standard svm implementation

10116753
libstdc++	libc++
though if you use it means you re linking to clang s c++ library libc++ rather than gcc s libstdc++

10116763
folder	directory
in sts with roo the web-inf source is not where i expected it under src main resources which is where the meta-inf directory is but instead under src main webapp which is not a java source directory and thus shown completely separately just above the target directory so i mistook it for an output folder

10116763
post	put
in the applicationcontext.xml roo had inserted the filter to prevent the application context from constructing controllers as explained in axtavt s post but it also put in another filter to eliminate scanning roo generated classes

10116765
post	get
i found this post but i can t seem to get the syntax right for the before_filter

10116780
rtp	sdp	rtp	rtsp	rtsp	sdp
sdp rtp rtsp streaming are pretty involved protocols that usually do not work when you try to hook them up directly to players expecting to just open a local media file

10116790
min	max
recall that local max min is defined mathematically as

10116794
put	get
the extracted contents then get put into an nsdata object

10116827
glut	sdl
if you use another library like glut or sdl it becomes much easier let the library worry about setting up a window and then you can focus on learning opengl

10116874
ant	cruisecontrol
ant error message opt cruisecontrol workdir framework.xml 19 the following error occurred while executing this line opt cruisecontrol workdir checkout framework source framework.xml 103 the following error occurred while executing this line opt cruisecontrol workdir checkout framework source framework.xml 1101 compile failed

10116887
width	height
basically my question would really be would there be a problem if i set the content size width or height of a scroll view to zero 0

10116943
springsource	grails
as a result i switched to springsource toolsuite which has groovy grails integration support and is based on the eclipse project

10116965
jax-ws	jax-rs
implemented across diff standards jax-ws jax-rs due to diff application servers and containers

10117063
int	chars
unsigned chars tells how long next string will be then a string is written and then an int id is written

10117091
put	get
i can t seem to put it all together to get what i want without the poorman brute method of nested if loops

10117106
post	get
i wrote this on the train but didn t get to post it and it looks like a couple of other people posted good answers since but it might still be helpful so i ll post it anyways

10117221
put	get
if i look at the delay.h in my hitech samples there is a delayus unsigned char defined and an extern void delayms unsigned char which i haven t tried however when i try to put the extern directly into my c code i get an undefined symbol error upon linking

10117254
outputstream	inputstream
the connection is established when you call openconnection and the inputstream outputstream or both are called when you instantiate them

10117256
post	get
and for my get methods what are the pre and post conditions

10117277
goto	break
i wanted to just be able to break out of a block - sort of like a forward goto not really related to a loop

10117299
hash	md5
store the password in the database in a hash form preferably sha1 first choice or md5 second choice

10117376
post	get
code reads better get post

10117376
post	get
code is not as readable at a glance barely request.method get post

10117404
getter	setter
create setter getter constructors from fields

10117404
pull	push
git integration with commit dicard push pull and ssh support

10117433
ubuntu	linux
also keep in mind that moving a program compiled on one linux machine ubuntu 5.4 to another the webserver may have different file dependencies

10117467
google-chrome	firefox
solution should be cross-browser ie firefox google-chrome

10117495
hide	show
i m not doing any show hide on them

10117556
stdout	stderr
all its standard io stdin stdout stderr operations will be redirected from the original process to the parent process through three streams process.getoutputstream process.getinputstream process.geterrorstream

10117558
int	chars
so i need to print out the value in the struct tk either an int or a chars

10117609
width	height
i have tried above options but there are few problems with them like adjusting the height and width of the pop-up window changing some other properties also

10117609
pop-up	dialog
i tried jquery dialog box and then i got an idea to create a div element and place your html content in div and you just need to set its z-index to very high level and append it to body section and see it will work as a pop-up and now you can easily set up the properties for your div or pop-up

10117609
hide	show
i used show and hide method whenever i wanted my pop up to be displayed

10117641
width	height
you need is to compare the ratios of the width and height scales of the content and the target

10117730
ant	maven
however you can use the maven antrun plugin to use the standard ant tasks to do the unpacking for you

10117755
width	height
it seems that when the width height are smaller the area used for content is bigger and vice versa

10117815
pop-up	dialog
please try later appears on the pop-up dialog

10117852
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	safari
its actually working fine in mozilla google-chrome opera and safari but very messy in ie

10117942
next	except
dbscan visits each point once so there is next to no benefit from using a distance matrix except the symmetry gain

10118026
width	height
i noticed that i cannot choose any width and height combo i want for the spotify play button

10118026
width	height
if i use the generator tool and increase the width it automatically increases the height field to match some arbitrary aspect ratio

10118026
min	max	width	height
so i can never truly get the exact width and height i need even within the min and max values specified on the developer page

10118026
width	height
what i need is a width of 440px and height of 720px

10118026
width	height
when i set the width and height in the iframe to 440 x 720 it actually renders at 440 x 520

10118110
mouseup	mousedown
however almost all gui elements only get executed or changed if both mousedown and mouseup are fired and successfully run

10118166
for-loop	loops
this mostly happens if you access a for-loop variable inside a delegate lambda and execute it outside loops

10118181
int	double	int	chars
suppose the binary file consisted of a chars an int and a double what size would the chars buffer need to be

10118181
int	double
and how would i convert back into int s and double

10118190
google-chrome	firefox
the properties you re using may not work in firefox google-chrome and other non-ie browsers

10118212
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
i have two different analyzer implementations casesensitivengramanalyzer and caseinsensitivengramanalyzer that i want to use with this fieldbridge to make a case-sensitive and a case-insensitive index of the field

10118223

im not sure how to get a json object and output it in jersey using rest get from a ajax json post im using grizzly server server has been set heres the code that supposed to get the json correct me please thanks

10118233
width	height
or you can set the height and width using the code below

10118237
nswindowcontroller	nsviewcontroller
is it possible to access a nswindowcontroller s element from a child nsviewcontroller

10118237
nswindow	nsprogressindicator
essentially i have a nsprogressindicator that spins on the bottom corner of the nswindow

10118237
nswindowcontroller	nsviewcontroller
this works because my webview is in my nswindowcontroller instead of my nsviewcontroller

10118244
rss	feed
i am dynamically generating rss ouput from a php file and the url to output the feed is

10118287
backbone.js	zepto
i am building a mobile app using backbone.js and zepto but am missing a framework for handling the main user interface components

10118295
hide	show
on each tab there is a edit button which hide the standard text and show a input box

10118327
subtract	add
how can we add or subtract date in java

10118366
equals	compareto
equals and compareto have to do the same thing

10118366
equals	compareto
that is if equals returns true compareto should return 0 and vica versa

10118370
java.util.calendar	java.util.date
first of all you have to convert your string date to java.util.date than you have to use java.util.calendar to manipulate dates

10118419
equals	compareto
i suggest that you either change the equals â compareto and hashcode method to take name and age into account

10118420
subtract	add
then use the calendar arithmetic functions to add subtract

10118422
move	drag
drag drop you would propably need to do as two fingers on tablet click with left and leave the left finger on tablet and then raise right finger and move left finger so it could be interpreted as drag drop

10118435
fseek	fread
i am wondering if the processing time of fseek is the same as fread

10118466
sorting	filtering
the various filtering and sorting options chosen in the view should return different lists from the store

10118483
fseek	fread
fseek just repositions the internal file pointer whereas fread actually reads data

10118483
fseek	fread
so i guess fseek should be much faster than fread

10118485
fseek	fread
i am wondering if the processing time of fseek is the same as fread

10118485
fseek	fread
an fseek to file position 149m followed by a 1m fread will probably be faster than 150 different 1m fread calls throwing away all but the last

10118497
int	chars
this function takes an int that describes one line of the 3x5 matrix and converts it into a line of random chars

10118547
ftp	telnet
such as telnet ftp passwd fsck rlogin tip etc

10118562
post	get
also you can use get post this wp function has an offset param for your second loop

10118627
int	boolean	int	double
the nsuserdefaults class provides convenience methods for accessing common types such as floats double int boolean and urls

10118627
nsstring	nsdata
a default object must be a property list that is an instance of or for collections a combination of instances of nsdata nsstring nsnumber nsdate nsarray or nsdictionary

10118627
nscolor	nsfont
this limitation would seem to exclude many kinds of objects such as nscolor and nsfont objects from the user default system

10118668
int	chars
i also think of to use 5 bytes instead but than i need to take care of the different type of number one int + one chars is there any library in c++ can easily do the coding compressing for me

10118678
spaces	linefeed
mind the blocks that break a single textnode with linefeed and spaces before an html tag into three nodes spaces only textnode commentnode and textnode with html tag

10118683
width	height
and the div will have a height and width not a blank div any more

10118700
equals	compareto
so your compareto method should check if two person are equals by name first and if they are not check their age

10118710
stdout	stderr
unfortunately the streams get mixed on some lines the characters from stdout and stderr are mixed together in single line

10118711
accessor	properties
by using properties memory management is taken by accessor

10118728
min	max
use my roundto50 function to round of the min and max limits to the nearest 50

10118746
int	chars
the following example program fread s the first datasize sets of a chars an int and a float from a file specified on the command line

10118754
pull	push
which is similar to the manual process described in propagate a remote location via clone push pull

10118755
put	get
if two instances are trying to do this simultaneously then one will get an exception and will need to retry get the data again increment put all in transaction

10118760
uipagecontrol	uipageviewcontroller
then you can present separate pages as you want in a uiscrollview with a uipagecontrol much better a uipageviewcontroller

10118802
freebsd	linux
if jot is on your system then i guess you re running freebsd or osx rather than linux so you probably don t have tools like rl or sort -r available

10118832
rss	feed
i m using dotnetnuke dnn website version 5.6.2 and using news feed rss module in that

10118894
ant	maven
the same book-keeping information might not necessarily be needed to build the project - whether this is done by ant or maven - but have to be present nevertheless

10118894
maven	pom.xml	ant	maven	ant	pom.xml
both ant and maven have their own ways to represent the same information build.xml and pom.xml and to some extend the synchronization between the different forms can be automated.

10118914
firepath	firebug
i should also add that firebug firepath evaluates all the above successfully

10118975
fseek	fread
i probably feel fseek might be bit faster than fread as fseek changes the pointer position to the new address space that you have mentioned and there is no date read is happening

10119005
postgresql	mysql
the solution you gave me seems clear for the question but the problem is a little bigger the two tables presents different kinds of variables and it should be that they are one in mysql with the user data drupal default for users then i have 2 in postgresql both with the same primary key id_user

10119007
n-gram	words
i need to have the n-gram by rankings for example how many times a certain words shows up in a series of emails by a person

10119026
width	height
devices have a specific set of properties resolution orientation width height etc. which you can use media queries to pick them out

10119032
exponent	modulo
the same inputbytes array the same exponent and modulo but different result

10119035
for-loop	arrays
i have collected all data from sql file in an arrays and using for-loop i am appending and writing data to .csv file

10119073
spaces	linefeed
the string s includes spaces tab cr and linefeed

10119145
ssl	https
we do a post to a certain url using https ssl

10119176
profiling	debugging
i ve tried extensive profiling and debugging and i just can t come up with any reason why setting the visibility on some tick marks should ever cause the app to freeze

10119233
super	self
is there any way to change a.keywords to sort of like super but pre- __init__ self

10119241
post	get
this takes both get and post variables and validates them

10119241
post	get
in my javascript dojo code i then used an url with get vars and then made a post as well

10119241
post	get
so when i changed my ajax code as below it worked since cgi- param saveuser both fetches get and post of saveuser no change to the perl was needed

10119314
versioning	upgrade
i had the same problems see my comment but after a upgrade to the latest versioning of servicesstack.text and the problem has gone

10119384
children	parent
each of these data classes only contain references to instances for their children not their parent for their parent they only contain the id

10119407
hide	show
you could just give the elements you wish to hide a class and have them hidden by default using css then just show them once the link is clicked

10119477
keydown	mousedown
the events you should use are previewmousedown or mousedown not keydown

10119498
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
the problem is if i put the arrays inside a for-loop between do and done and when i try to print the arrays length outised loops i.e after done the values are not getting updated

10119499
switching	screens
effects like switching screens or slide screens in an activity with animations using viewflipper in android

10119510
int	boolean
what i can tell you int string boolean are not the only allowed return types

10119532
background-image	background-color
i think that tween effects not work with background-image but work with background-color

10119614
folder	directory
i have a folder src main webapp web-inf scripts which once after maven is run is copied to the target directory target project web-inf scripts

10119645
memset	memcmp	memcpy	memcmp	memcpy	memmove	memcpy	memset	memmove	memcmp	memmove	memset
the compiler may generate calls to memcmp memset memcpy and memmove

10119654
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it works great in google-chrome safari firefox but not so great in ie surprise

10119687
disk	ram
systems starts swapping out ram onto disk for ram-intensive processes

10119704
nsobject	nsmanagedobject
basically i just want to be able to make a core date query from a simple nsobject class or a nsmanagedobject extension from a class which is not a uiviewcontroller of some sort

10119707
graphviz	gephi
so readers may wish to know what toolsets each have - i am encouraged that gephi uses grahml and obviously dotml has the graphviz and other toolsets

10119710
mouse	keyboard
apparently this caused the inner div and thus the form to not receive any keyboard or mouse events at all

10119734

versioning	upgrade
if someone from your development team still use a versioning older than r14 better to ask them upgrade to latest android sdk versioning on their workstation as the android sdk has been changed rapidly since r14 regarding to project property file library project external jar dependency structure and etc

10122017

10122203
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
if you have subclassed uinavigationcontroller and not having a uiviewcontroller inside a uinavigationcontroller which is most common then you should do this instead

10122203

getter	setter
i am from java background and what i infer from objective c documentation is that a property is similar to java bean class one having getter and setter of instance varibles

10122507
getter	setter
a property can accessed from other classes through its getter and setter methods while an instance variable is private and cannot be accessed from other classes

10122532
pull	push
so it s a push-approach you don t pull the rfid you push it into the gui taking special care that such code is executed on the event-dispatching thread edt

10122576
getter	setter
the other difference is that in objective c you can synthesize properties while in java you need to write your getter and setter manually

10122576
getter	setter
property is a syntactic sugar over a getter method or a pair of a getter and a setter methods

10122595
getter	setter
a property in objective c is in fact the setter and getter methods that make it possible to access an attribute in a class from outside of it

10122701
getter	setter
it s introduced mainly because the complicated getter setter syntax

10122701
getter	setter
it s sort of similar to java s concept of protecting a private variable through getter setter

10122884
google-chrome	firefox

i need to get the data from the get to the post after the form submission but it s coming back null

10123188
submit	submission
aside from the fact that the return statement is executed before either of your callback functions success and error are called and it doesn t seem that anything is done with the return value of the click handler function for what may be happening is though you are making an ajax call on the click event the browser is also submission a form post because #submit_login is a submit type button - whether or not an ajax call is being performed the page does a reload on the form submit so it looks as if the click handler is returning false instead of hitting your success handler

nsurlconnection	nsoperationqueue
i chose nsoperationqueue because i wanted to cancel any or all on-going nsurlconnection at any point of time

10132948
nsurlconnection	nsoperationqueue	nsurlconnection	nsoperation
nsoperationqueue executes each enqueued operation on a secondary thread in background and hence i didn t need to do anything explicitly to spawn secondary threads except starting my nsurlconnection in overridden start method of nsoperation subclass and running the runloop for the spawned secondary thread until either connectiondidfinishloading or connectiondidfailwitherror is called

10135002
hide	show
my issue arises whenever a user has an faq answer open activated by the first function and then tries to do a show hide all

10135002
hide	show
the show hide function uses a toggling system so this causes all the questions to toggle including the one that is already showing

10135005
min	max	min	median	median	max
to find the median and left right you probably want to call it to find the median and then just do the max of the components of the array to the left and the min of the components to the right because you know once the median selection phase is done that all elements to the left of the median will be less than it and to the right will be greater or equal

10135016

so if it doesn t terminate before the timeout you specified then you could stop waiting and return a timeout error dont forget to signal the other thread to abort the transaction

i create a socket then all the related socket operations occur - all this works like magic then after all the processing i .send response here and for some reason it only shows on firefox and google-chrome

10135192
folder	directory
if you did it on directory which wasn t previously set up as git repository you can just remove .git folder assuming you re using linux

10135202
put	get
i see you did put -lm on the link command line for the main program but my guess is that the main program did not actually use any symbols from libm.so and thus it did not get added to the dt_needed table for the main program and therefore is not already loaded

10135204
onfocus	onblur
our testing showed that this behaviour would also occur whenever the keyboard was displaying and would prevent transactions in an onblur or onfocus event although not onkey down|up|press

10135212
portrait	landscape
if i m in portrait mode and i present a new modalviewcontroller and then rotate to landscape autoresizing works perfectly and everything looks great

10135212

this works fine in google-chrome but when i install this userscript in firefox greasemonkey the web console in firefox is not displaying anything

10135289
gridview	sqldatasource
so in theory i could build the select command in such a way that i could filter the data based on the gridview that is binding to the sqldatasource

10135289
gridview	sqldatasource
the problem is that if i use the same sqldatasource for all the gridview i cannot find a way to have each gridview tell the sqldatasource which one is calling it

10135324
portrait	landscape
keeping this in mind when a view is loaded in portrait as all uiviewcontrollers are but the actual orientation is landscape it s possible that the view will get confused and maintain a sort of messy hybrid orientation type view

client-side geocoding via the javascript api doesn t have these server-limits so if users do any sort of action to trigger a geocode or two using the js api is the best route

10135815
ember.js	sproutcore
see ember.js or sproutcore for real world examples of libraries that use this construct

10135834

opera 9.5+ safari 5.1+ firefox 4+ google-chrome 10+

10143394
put	get
this would have to be done most likely in common.js so that with the exception of the one in a billion user that has never been to the site and manages to navigate directly to the page with the dynamically sized image i hope you re not going to put something like that on your main page that information will already be there when they get to the page

10143408

you also have more limited control over the threads in a threadpool meaning optimizations like assigning processors affinity to load-balance and priority to give a thread more or less time of individual threads are not available

10143559
cpu	hyperthreading	cpu	processors	processors	hyperthreading
the rule of thumb is that if a cpu is given more than double the count of actively running threads as it has execution units these are the physical cores on a cpu chip and logical processors like hyperthreading technology that splits one core into two then the os will spend more time scheduling threads and switching between them cache-thrashing than it will spend actually running the threads

10143575
typedef	struct
however i would suggest changing your typedef so it s an alias for the struct not for a pointer to it

apache	nginx
this is an old question so i assume that you did already find a workaround but the new passenger + apache or nginx behaves correctly for camping as far as i could replicate

10143940
width	height
try grabbing the top left corner as a point original not bounding box then the transform-origin the width and the height as well as the transform style property

10144105
typedef	struct
most likely you want to place the typedef outside of the foo struct in this case -- you can already access a from within

10144105
typedef	struct
if you wanted to create a typedef inside foo for a nested type of another struct you could do this

10144139
int	chars
cannot use chars type int as type rune in function argument

10144148
put	get
as i understand it this consists of an initial options and a subsequent propfind exchange - after that get and put should be straightforward so i don t need a generic example there

10144153
mouseup	mousedown
at the heart of it a click event is supposed to be fired when a single element records a mousedown followed by a mouseup see jquery doc

10144153
mouseup	mousedown
so in agreement with the comments to your question the simplest solution is to register to mousedown or mouseup which one depends on the behaviour you are looking for the closest behaviour to click would be mouseup

10144155
jlabel	jtextpane
and jtextpane is a text editor and its document does not contain any separate jlabel that is why you get inconvertible types exception while trying to cast view to jlabel

edit i realize that you need the http verb get as well as the path post 321 to uniquely map to the controller and action but the question still stands...

10144956
qgraphicsitem	qgraphicspixmapitem	qgraphicstextitem	qgraphicsitem	qgraphicspixmapitem	qgraphicstextitem
if what you need is an object that consistently displays an image next to some text you are better off creating your own object that inherits qgraphicsitem that has a qgraphicspixmapitem and has a qgraphicstextitem

you could also use hide show or a number of other effects instead of fadein and fadeout depending on your effect

10145614
accelerometer	gyroscope
it s definitely possible to calculate the pitch and roll from accelerometer data but yaw requires more information gyroscope for sure but possibly compass could be made to work

10145614
accelerometer	gyroscope
based on how their tilt calibration ui works i m pretty sure they re using the accelerometer instead of the gyroscope

10145619
inherited	properties
then in all of your controllers that inherited from your base controller can just reference these properties

quick and dirty way is to use lines and bind their coordinates to the width and height of some parent container

10145628
children	parent
using a grid as the parent means any other children added to the grid after the lines will appear on top of the lines

10145671
httpresponse	request	httprequest	httpresponse
for example the mvc3 request and response controller properties were designed specifically to be isolateable injectable versions of httprequest and httpresponse

10145671
nsubstitute	moq
if the differences in test-writing with and without testhelper are sufficiently marginal then i d prefer to forego testhelper...which means i am then free to choose whatever isolation framework i like moq or nsubstitute

10145671
httprequest	httpresponse
ultimately i would be surprised to learn the mvc3 release had taken specific improved testability steps for httprequest and httpresponse but not for the other above listed dependency issues

10145712
httprequest	httpresponse
isolateable injectable versions of httprequest and httpresponse

profiling	debugging
when we want to take another application which is compiled with debugging information and get stuff out of it at runtime what we are dealing with is the problem of how to write my own custom debugger profiling automated-test kernel

10146042
profiling	debugging
testcomplete and other automatedqa programs contain a debugger and profiling kernel which can start up run and remotely control apps and parse their debugging information in several formats including the turbodebugger td32 information attached to these executables

10146042
profiling	debugging
their profiling kernel also can see each object as it is created and can iterate the rtti-like debugging information to determine that an object that was created is of a particular class type and then see what properties exist in that object

10146882
pascal	delphi
since delphi xe2 is using the free pascal compiler when targeting ios you can use any programming technique of fpc

10146882
pascal	delphi
from my pov the object pascal paradigm used with fpc object pascal dialect which can coexist with the default object pascal code is more advanced lightweight and integrated than the interface-based plumbing of delphi xe2 compiler with on-the-fly marshalling using rtti

sqldatareader	sqlconnection
if i want to run multiple select queries on different tables can i use the same sqldatareader and sqlconnection for all of them

10147053
width	height
what is happening is that other browsers are incorrectly applying a height of 305px and width of 940px to your #featured division

10147053
width	height
i suppose one way you could work around this is to manually specify the width and height on your #featured element so that all the browsers including chrome act the same

10147054
google-chrome	firefox	width	height
if you inspect the #featured element you ll notice that this element has a height and width set via css inline styles in firefox but not in google-chrome

10147109
multiplying	add
since you know kernel size the fastest way to do this would be to read chunks of the input image signal into shared memory and perform an unrolled multiplying and add operation

10147110
width	height
this is causing the plugin to set a specific height and width to the div where as in chrome no height is set meaning it is still 0

10147125
salt	md5
md5 password + generic salt

10147125
salt	md5

superclass	subclassing
where the subclassing is used in the definition of the superclass

it s interesting to note that although it s technically allowed it doesn t make sense to have a superclass create a subclassing instance in its constructor

10147496
public	protected
in order to test protected methods you often need to create a proxy class that makes the methods public

10147496

10147642
pull	push
that way any new commit push to your repository will be added to the pull request

10147649
free	malloc
to be technically correct wt is a so-called vla or variable length array which is notably only present in c99 which is a c standard which most compilers still don t fully support so you might be wanting to avoid these and use malloc and free

it is built on top of the lower-level qsqlquery and can be used to provide data to view classes such as qtableview

10147739
firefox	safari
i know how to customize it for ie but in firefox and safari its still default

10147773
stdout	stderr
of course it will be safer to scan the program s stdout and stderr for expected and unexpected patterns in order to proceed or abort

10147773
stdout	stderr
this would be possible by also setting the stdout and stderr args of popen to subprocess.pipe and calling communicate like this

10147790
for-loop	loops
if he means he needs it in loops then i m guessing that it s an if statement and an else statement inside the for-loop

10147822
ready	each
after each rk step evaluate the acceleration to be ready for the next step

10147930
nsstring	nsdata
the answer that i found out for android was that it was the old server but the new serve still had issues with the ios app but i figured out that if you alloc the nsstring with the nsdata then the information will not have any possiblities of gaining extra data or information

10147978
pop-up	dialog
in my case this reduced the time to pop-up the print dialog from 8 seconds to 0.7 seconds

10147990
umask	mkdir
so i only needed to call mkdir with full permissions and that gets chopped according to current umask

10147991
post	get
maybe it will be the way to go if the app is used enough but it seems like use would drop off and then you couldn t get at the older post easily

10147994
hide	show
the way you re handling it now it just hide and then show with no break in between

10148009
hide	show
i am using jquery to hide a textbox and show it when the user clicks a button

10148009
hide	show
if the user type a text then hide it and show it again the textbox is empty

it suggests that you set add a south_migration_modules dictionary in settings.py and map that app to a nonexistent module

10151344
hash	md5
good hash function md5 sha1 etc. makes this collision nearly impossible to happen so it only depends whether it is fast enough for your purpose

10151357

10151817
nscoding	nscopying
i followed the example code to conform this class to nscoding and nscopying

10151850
hash	salt
the hash is incorrect generated differently or with different salt

10151850
hash	salt
anyway for each new password hash saved generate a new random salt value like say 128 bits or more

10151850
hash	salt
this one-of-a-kind nonce is then used to salt the password before it is hash

10151850
hash	salt
the hash and the salt are then saved together they are often combined into a value but it s okay if they are in separate columns

10151850
hash	salt
find the row representing the user first and extract the hash and salt

10151850
hash	salt
generate the hash from the password using the salt

10151850
hash	salt
if hash salt was saved as a combined value separate it first as needed

10151850
hash	salt
that is the query should likely not search for where password should really be called hash or similar because the salt needs to be available to generate the correct hash again

10151850
hash	salt
this is not the correct way to do it and requires that each one of the potential salt is used in the hash generation so the right hash can be found

10151850
hash	md5
in addition do not use md5 for password hash

10151885
google-chrome	firefox
the following code makes google-chrome firefox ie all go into quirks mode

10151925

10151949
for-loop	loops
you can compress the two for loops into a single generator expression with a new for-loop to extract the file names from it

10151970

but what about casting arrays of double to arrays of int

10151994
put	get
the problem i have is if i put my code in the oncreate it doesn t work in the onshow works but i get the error

10152061
oncreate	findviewbyid	oncreate	recreate
so now if this locationlistener is not recreate after the oncreate call it will reference the old activity and a call to findviewbyid will return objects hold by that old activity

10152137
typedef	struct
or the typedef struct node_s to

10152255
stdout	stderr
the output you re seeing is both from stderr the gcc error message and stdout the rest of it

10152495
processors	hyperthreading
to determine if hyperthreading is enabled for the processors compare numberoflogicalprocessors and numberofcores

10152495
processors	hyperthreading
if hyperthreading is enabled in the bios for the processors then numberofcores is less than numberoflogicalprocessors

10152495
processors	hyperthreading
for example a dual-processor system that contains two processors enabled for hyperthreading can run four threads or programs or simultaneously

10152710
minimum	diagonal
one solution i d accept would be to create a euclidean distance matrix and shuffle the rows to get the minimum of a function the summed squares of the distances on the diagonal or other heuristic

10152710
minimum	diagonal
swapping rows 3 and 4 gives the minimum sum of the diagonal

10152712
vim	emacs
it does this adaptively and works even in full-screen programs like emacs and vim

10152719
maven	pom.xml
so whenever a pom.xml declares an external dependency maven tries to the get the jar files from the proxy

10152719
peer	p2p
as a workaround we were thinking that if it were possible to install a p2p plugin in maven then whenever a jar file is required maven could first check peer for example local maven repo of the developer sitting next to me before hitting the internal maven proxy

nsurl	nsstring	nsurl	nsdata	nsstring	nsdata
my path is in an nsstring that i have tried converting to nsurl and removing the file suffix to get it to work with the nsdata videodata.........line but it doesn t compile i get an no known class method for selector datawithcontentsoffile oftype. error

10153800
nsurl	nsstring
my code which included tips from elsewhere on converting from a nsstring to nsurl follows

10153808
put	get
and if you need to get know what you new id was while insert -ing data use output clause of insert statement - so the copy of new rows is put to table-type param

10153831
children	parent
master1 parent 1 children 2

10153831

master2 parent 2 children 2

10153831
children	parent
master1 parent 1 children 1

10153831
children	parent
master2 parent 2 children 2 -- difference

10153831
children	parent
it looks like the childs are referring to the same array also i did slice the initial children array which did work with the parent array as expected

10153839
nsurl	nsstring
both of which take the file location as an nsstring so there s not need to convert to an nsurl

10153859
hash	hmac
i don t see any mention of hmac in the documentation though so it is much more likely that the key is included as last part in the hash calculation but is not in the package of course

10153859
hash	md5
the plain md5 hash is then used as some poor man s authentication scheme

10153895
put	get
to get ipython to recognize site packages put something like this in a file named .ipython profile_default startup 00-virtualenv.py or something similar

10153923
django	web.py	flask	django	flask	web.py
something lightweight minimal like web.py or flask is imo a much better place to start than django if your focus is on learning and avoiding magic i have used all three

10153923
flask	web.py
if this is too difficult you might want to come back to it later after playing with a more automatic framework like web.py or flask

10153968
getter	setter
you just have to have appropriate getter and setter for the bean variable

10153992
portrait	landscape
how can it so that when a tablet is running the application it is forced to run it in landscape and when a phone is running the application it is forced to run it in portrait

10154021
uinavigationbar	uinavigationitem
please add uinavigationbar instead of uinavigationitem

10154088
textview	imageview
each childview could then be me made up of a framelayout containing an imageview and a number of textview on top of the imageview

10154122
multiplying	subtraction
a descending sort is achieved by changing the order of subtraction or multiplying the result by -1

10154131
portrait	landscape
but the problem is that the very second screen rotates from portrait to landscape or from landscape to portrait the whole form resets and all the fields that were visible become invisible

10154144
istream	getline
then when reading the file you can use istream getline to extract text strings and to extract numbers

10154167
post	get
i ve heard that there might be a possibility to post get query and pass it some handler in a way that doesn t make you wait for the answer when answer comes it just calls the given handler that handles the result

10154187
google-chrome	firefox
i m using font awesome for my project and it works fine for google-chrome firefox and ie9 but it fails show icons for ie8

i am not sure of whether some of the soccer websites like espn have provisions for such rss feed

10154336
daemons	systemd
in the systemd log daemons devicemgr always repeated

10154365
for-loop	loops
i have my mako templates running through for loops to create some tables for me and i was wondering if i could update the data in the for-loop and have mako render that specific part of the html to easily update the webpage

10154381
nsexpression	nspredicate
it s simpler you don t need to create a nspredicate just the nsexpression

10154421
ppl	tbb
if possible the best thing is to use libraries which abstract threads away and instead focus on tasks like intel tbb microsoft ppl

10154421
ppl	tbb
instead one should try - tbb and ppl do it - to split work on the different threads by applying a task-stealing pattern see the tbb wiki page

10154487
post	get
if not considering the prossible limits that the server blocks the post speed what else can i do to get the faster speed

10154495
sorting	filtering
you can use a javax.swing.table.tablerowsorter for sorting and filtering see tablerowsorter

10154507
hide	show
probably because you hide then toggle every time which results in a show

10154521
median	minimum
what determines the number of crossings is the order of arrangement of the edges in every layer.but again finding the minimum number of crossings or finding a maximum crossing-free set of edges is np-complete so again it is typical to resort to heuristics such as placing each vertex at a position determined by finding the average or median of the positions of its neighbors on the previous level and then swapping adjacent pairs as long as that improves the number of crossings.

10154537
xsl-fo	xslt
it takes xsl-fo compliant xslt code and xml and generates pdf files according to the xsl-fo spec

10154540
post	get
however with the get method the response comes in 13 ms but i need to use post

10154574
post	get
large latencies are one reason to use multiple threads in the first place - multiple lookups ad site get post can then happen in parallel

10154596
disk	ram
which buffers file data in ram delay-writing it to the disk

10154596
disk	ram
ram not disk

10154625
int	chars
i have an int n on firs line and then two n n matrixes of chars

10154640
disk	ram
i think the most reliable option for output would be to disk file or database instead or ram running python object then you read the info from file afterwards

10154642
children	parent
anyway the main point here is that a component should not concern itself with adding itself to its parent just with creating its own content children

10154709
calloc	malloc	memset	calloc	memset	malloc
i have no idea what getinitialaddress is supposing to return but if it is calling calloc or allocating some memory with malloc and then zeroing it with memset it is probable that the memory zone pointed by p starts with zero

10154729
implements	extends
i still need to know if both classes class1 and class2 extends the same class mainclass and implements runnable would a conflict happen

10154789
width	height

in order to turn a string into a java.util.date object you need a dateformat simpledateformat

10154837
post	get
i have the the server set up but im not sure what methods i need to use to connect to the php server using post method and also how the iphone will get the response from the server

10154873
sorting	filtering
this may also feel more familiar to you coming from javascript as you can add new functionality to the class as well like custom sorting or maybe filtering

10154883
super	self
so combines call super s -init method assign the result to self and check if we got non-nil from super s -init that is that super didn t fail to initialize

10154905
implements	extends
when i implements my interceptor that extends emptyinterceptor i added the method onflushdirty and so on

10154921
client-side	server-side
i just started looking into tower.js the last couple of hours and it looks like that the framework provides a nice structure for placing both server-side and client-side code similar to the assets folder in rails

10154923
for-loop	loops
you are capturing your loops variable so when the for-loop is finished the variable c has the value 4 which is the value the function sees when it executes

10154947
post	get
this will work regardless you are using post or get method in your form

10154984
cos	sin
i m interested in information about the speed of sin and cos in open gl shader language

10154984
cos	sin
as has been pointed out counting clock cycles of individual operations like sin and cos doesn t really tell the whole performance story

10154984
cos	sin
so to clarify my question what i m really interested in is whether it s worthwhile to optimize away sin and cos calls for common cases

10154984
cos	sin
or will the glsl compiler or the sin and cos implementations take care of optimizations like that for me

10155014
hash	md5
i m trying to find the md5 hash so i can start a google maps tutorial

10155017
put	get
in short i do the get request i put the result of the request in #mydiv i format it and i fadein the div

10155035
superclass	subclassing
in general instances of subclassing may be larger than those of their superclass so you should not expect the subclassing to fit into your vector s slot

10155060
put	get
the problem is that i don t know how to tell objectify that user parent is root and when i do multiple put user i get

10155091
matlab	simulink	matlab	s-function	s-function	simulink
note this is my first time using a matlab s-function and i ve only used simulink a handful of times

10155091
s-function	simulink
i m simulating the actuator a dc motor and the plant the segway itself as separate s-function blocks in simulink

10155102

put	get
i need to know how to get it in a form that i can put on a cd as a soft copy for a demonstration at school since this is a project

10155129
tinyint	boolean
if you have boolean tinyint fields in your acl table such as allowupdates andd allowdeletes then you should default these to false 0 so that when a new user is created they will get the least privileges until you specifically set them

10155231
xeround	cleardb
cleardb and xeround are a few

10155248
cos	sin
it s certainly slower to use texture lookups for sin cos as it is to execute the instructions

10155272
int	chars
either use the string itself as the queue id or if you need an int use string.hashcode hashcode returns the same value for the same chars

10155284
equals	gethashcode
however this also means that if gethashcode is not overridden so that it corresponds to the types equals method you will not be able to find such an object in one of the collections

10155284
equals	gethashcode
you should almost always implement both gethashcode and equals or none of them

10155285
equals	gethashcode
you have to override gethashcode as well - this goes hand in hand with overriding equals

10155293
equals	gethashcode
note that it s dangerous to use mutable fields for calculating equals or gethashcode

10155297
portrait	landscape
768 is for ipad-style tablets in landscape portrait mode

but then i realized that there were tools like dex2jar that would reveal all my code even with some obfuscation from proguard in particular this hardcoded key

10155321
listadapter	listactivity
when my class extends activity rather than listactivity the application works but then i am unable to use a listadapter which i need

10155332
rss	feed
if you have access to those rss feed you can parse them using the documentbuilderfactory

10155335
client-side	server-side
the choice is about doing it client-side or server-side typically by using the sql replace see below

10155372
didreceivememorywarning	dealloc
minimally you should free the retained subviews pre-arc in didreceivememorywarning and in dealloc

10155376
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
the most common cases are the uinavigationcontroller and the uitabbarcontroller with the ipad you can see also uisplitviewcontroller and pageviewcontrollers

10155379
super	extends
super refers to the base class that the current class extends

10155379
super	extends
so if parent extends child and you create a new child super refers to the parent class and doing something like super in the constructor would call the parent s constructor and this refers to the actual child instance you created with new

10155380
super	extends
super refers to the superclass that a class extends

10155393
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
you should use uinavigationcontroller for switching between uiviewcontroller

this happens only in firefox 11 google-chrome and ie8 work as expected

10155412
portrait	landscape
however this prompt displays in portrait while my game runs in landscape is there a setting i m unable to find which would allow me to landscape my dialog box

10155474
onchange	onkeyup
to be safe bind to onkeyup oninput and onchange

10155479
super	extends
super is the derived class parent when your class extends it through the extends keyword and you can invoke the overridden method through the use of the keyword super

10155503
post	get
i make a post request to a url and try to get the value based on the returned value i manipulate the value and try returning it back to the function

configure the client to use that client-side certificate to identify itself and only accept the one server-side certificate you installed on your server for that part of it

10155727
rss	feed
i m making a small rss reader and i want it to parse a website and make a list of the feed

10155759
stdout	stderr
it means that the standard error descriptor stderr 2 is to be redirected to the standard output descriptor stdout 1

10155796
awt	swing
on the other hand the standard edition of java offers the swing widget set the awt widget set

10155807
super	extends
further ambiguity can arise when you extends classes inherit functionality for a parent or super class because the option of overriding the parent method arrises

10155821
xpages	lotus
xpinc ibm lotus notes xpages in the notes client

10155821
xpages	lotus
xpages is ibm s java server faces jsf implementation for lotus notes and domino

10155898
stdout	stderr
you must redirect stdout and stderr

10155904
portrait	landscape
is there a way to make softkeyboard behave in landscape the same way as it does in portrait mode meaning that it will resize my layout

10155908
for-loop	loops
the downside is that this optimization adds code complexity the additional for-loop at the end to finish loops for the len 4 items left if the length is not evenly divisible by 4 and of course it s an architecture-dependent optimization whose magnitude of improvement will vary by hardware compiler etc.

10155947
getter	setter
you use setter and getter to isolate the class variables from the outside world so you don t need to allow other code to access them directly

10155949
getter	setter
a setter typically changes the state of an object in some way and a getter typically just returns some aspect of the state of an object

10155955
unix	solaris
i have an application that i deploy on both linux red hat and unix solaris

10155961
google-chrome	safari
i can get it to work in google-chrome and safari and the code goes like

10155963

regarding the second answer getter ans setter are not meant to be classes

10155963
getter	setter
consider this example which uses getter and setter to get ans set value for the printer class

10155992
innodb	myisam
since you started a transaction data will not be inserted into any table if any error occures provided you use innodb engine for your mysql tables myisam doesn t support transactions

10156053
postgresql	mysql
works with mysql and postgresql and possibly others and will prevent any other connection to the database from reading the rows returned to you how granular that lock is depends on the engine used indexes etc - check your database s documentation

10156053
datamapper	activerecord
activerecord supports both so you can look there for inspiration if datamapper doesn t

10156073
int	double
it isn t that clear with variables of type float or double of course easier with int and strings and especially useful with pointers

10156093
ssl	https
what i now need to do is include this in my original ssl redirect logic to ensure that any change password requests are redirected to the same url but over https instead

10156100
oncreate	recreate
you can even have fun rotating your android to see the app recreate showing that both the constructor and the oncreate are re-run every time the screen is rotated but that the static assignments are not redone when the activity is recreate

10156104
spaces	delimiter
the backslash escapes the first spaces which becomes the delimiter for cut and the second spaces separates the -d option from the -f option

10156119
keydown	keyup
difference between keyup keydown and keypress explained on quirksmode

10156155
stdout	stderr
this is occasionally useful for programs that want to take piped input but also read input from the user from stdout or more commonly stderr although using dev tty is more reliable in that case

10156171
sorting	filtering
see sorting and filtering for how to create a rowfilter instances of which can be added to a jcombobox and applied in the combo s action listener

10156199
accessor	properties	getter	setter
when you declare a properties in objective-c the properties are atomic by default so that synthesized accessor provide robust access to properties in a multithreaded environmentâ that is the value returned from the getter or set via the setter is always fully retrieved or set regardless of what other threads are executing concurrently

10156199
accessor	properties
then it means a synthesized accessor for an object properties simply returns the value directly

10156221
profiling	debugging
turn on template debugging and the output profiling in

10156223
inline	inlining
i m no c++ internals expert but i d assume that the inlining of function calls and instantiating templates is about manipulating the syntax tree before while and after it s been annotated with semantic information necessary to compile it properly as both of those seem to assume knowing a lot of stuff like type info and if something is good to be inline that is not yet known during scanning and parsing

10156244
stdout	stderr
and then invoke it with identifiable stdin stdout and stderr

10156244
stdout	stderr
there aren t any common uses of this but you might use it as a dirty hack to get a way to print to the terminal if whomever calls your script redirects stdout and stderr and for whatever reason you re not able to change that

10156262
folder	directory
in controllers pages.php the pages.php controller looks at the url segments and load static files from folder and sub-folders inside the views pages directory

10156486
avr	microcontroller
i am creating a hardware midi device based around an avr microcontroller

10156528
comparator	comparable
in the contract of treeset the requirement is laid out that all entries have to be comparable or you have to provide a comparator

10156528
comparator	comparable
this is also why you didn t see a compile-time error entries are only cast to comparable in the absence of an explicit comparator .

10156551

10156569
bluetooth	usb
you should be able to do with the usb for your device though you should focus on the usb anytime you want to transmit data from outside the phone into it though you could probably also do it with an ir broadcaster bluetooth broadcaster set up instead of a wired switch

10156604
put	get
you can find more information on the usage of the grid system over at the bootstrap scaffolding documentation they also have a stacked grid which you can view the source off to get an idea of how the rows are stacked up and how the content within are put together

10156605
stdout	stderr
only difference is that console executables automatically opens console window and c c++ crt runtime associates standart stdout stdin stderr handles to go to this window

10156817
cos	sin
you d have to test this out yourself but i m pretty sure that branching in a shader is far more expensive than a sin or cos calculation

10156822
layoutparams	viewgroup
your textview s are children of a tablerow so you should set an instance of tablerow.layoutparams for the layoutparams instead of the simple one probably from the viewgroup super class that you currently use

10156844
post	get
some thing like a prg post redirect get how to use it

10156868

width	height
how to specify width and height of a drawable item

10156898
min	max
i played around with the min and max height properties to achieve this but it isn t an ideal solution and doesn t always work

10156898
min	max
edit min and max height seemed to be ignored almost

10156898
min	max
adding min and max height made no difference to this

10156906
pull	push
can user b revert his files as locally added - nontracked then do hg pull -u which gets a.txt then handle the add commit push for b.txt and c.txt later

10156908
equals	compareto
also right now your compareto function is non-functional it always returns 0 -- this is like saying that all items are equals

10156909
post	get
then how do i use this to get number of post for a particular day

10156949
button	checkbox
i would like to replace the checkbox with button

10156997
getter	setter
in objective-c we can add property and synthesize to create a property -- like an instance variable with getter and setter which are public to the users of this class

10156997
getter	setter
then there won t be the overhead of calling the getter and setter as methods

10157064
versioning	upgrade
it s really nice for versioning and upgrade support of plugins with mef having a v2 contract that can also load plugins that only implement v1 of the contract

10157072
onclick	onkeyup
in your validate statement include the validclass option as well as onkeyup and onclick if you want the messages to appear as changes are made to the form

10157100
getter	setter
synthesize creates a default getter setter and instance variable unless you ve defined any of those things yourself

10157100
getter	setter
so why not expose instance variables instead of providing getter and setter

10157119

i have a parent object that contains a property that is a list of children objects

10157351
width	height
while the width can be determined by the element s content the height is always determined by the element s content

10157351
width	height
by its very nature it scales width-wise and the content flows to an appropriate height based on the available width

10157355
width	height
just bind to the window object on the resize and orientationchange events and use the jw player resize method after getting the new width and height

10157837
portrait	landscape
you could likely adapt it to modify the meta tag when the device changes between portrait and landscape

10157863

i would use auto for both width and height

10157889
fadein	fadeout
have you tried using animate instead of fadein fadeout

10157897

10157902
pull	push
try doing a git pull to sync up with the remote repository then you should be able to push to it

10157970
min	max
the best solution is to use a componentlistener implement componentresized and enforce the min max size that way

10157997
min	max
i have controller say home_controller providing max 10 min 4

10157997
min	max
but it doesn t seem to be working because when i look at the resultant javascript file from firebug wherever i have max or min they just show up as blank

10157999
int	double
when the type of a numeric expression is ambiguous haskell tries to resolve it first to int and then to double a floating-point number if that doesn t work

10157999
int	double
this specific example happened because 5.3 can t be an int since int is not fractions so it resolved to double in that case

10158066
width	height
you can edit the image element s width and height attributes.

10158066
width	height
you can set the width and height to either pixels or percent

10158066
width	height
but that will take 100 of the width and height of the parent element

10158099
width	height
you can set only width or only height to 100

10158099
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
this might not work in all browsers but it does in the latest versions of firefox google-chrome and opera

10158124

they only communicate via get and post commands

10158149
width	height
can you just use matrix transpose routines with the matrix being width height of int3 elements

10158156
udp	tcp
i have a very large network trace file which contains both tcp and udp packets.i want to find out the flows in the trace file.for that i have a hash function which takes in source ip address destination ip address source port destination port and protocol.in case of tcp i can understand that the flow means all the packets which have the same 5 parameters same.but what does it mean in case of udp.how does the concept of flow apply in case of udp

10158156
udp	tcp
i am a novice in packet processing.and once i have idendified a flow tcp and udp how do i work out the direction of the flow

10158166
udp	tcp
netflow applies to any protocol including tcp and udp

10158166
udp	tcp
so to answer your question yes udp packets should be treated the same as tcp

10158190

i m using firefox 3.6 and i don t need it to work in ie or google-chrome

10158238
for-loop	arrays
i fill an arrays in for-loop and when i try to get an item from it i always get the first element

10158303
getter	setter
now obviously this is still a problem with setter and getter however you are less likely to forget to use weakself since you have to explicity call self.property whereas ivars are referenced by self implicitly

10158312
16-bit	64bit
i think the size of the struct is correct short should provide 16-bit for the segment address and long long 64bit for the offset

10158344
ubuntu	linux	cout	cin
when i tell something to cin cout cerr or printf scanf or take arguments from the command line this all happens from the linux terminal in ubuntu

10158351
int	chars
here is an implementation of a symbol table where the symbols are single chars and the values are just int as with your code

10158354
stdout	stderr	cout	cin
cin cout cerr and printf scanf fprintf stderr ... use the standard c preopened files stdin stdout and stderr which are defined both in linux and windows

10158356
hide	show
however when i click on the #inputadd button it show the row but then the modalpopup hide i think the reason maybe because there is an updatepanel that include the modalpopup i am right

10158371
cout	cin
cin and cout and printf and scanf work much the same in windows as they do in linux

10158401
bash	zsh
i can reproduce this behaviour in bash and zsh

10158418
children	parent
in other words as i populate the widget with children the children shrink as necessary to maintain the parent geometry

10158418
children	parent
however if the parent is expanded the children expand to fill the new space

10158420
setinterval	settimeout
use settimeout rather than setinterval interval is for repeating a timer task timeout is a single timer task

10158479

i am creating a input form and i know how to do onfocus onblur placeholder stuff etc etc

10158520
spaces	delimiter
note that both these solutions assume that words are always delimiter by spaces which isn t true in general

10158557
onfocus	onblur
edit 2 part of the problem you might be seeing is the fact that you have onfocus and onblur on your input and the onfocus is clearing out the existing value

10158605
post	get
turns out i needed to loop through the post and call the tumblr api to get the embed code for the audio post

10158648
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and firefox

10158653
put	get
don t put the word get in the uri as you ve suggested

10158700
int	chars
if you have a primitive type the first chars will be all you get for int it will be i for chars c for unsigned long long q etc.

10158726
stdout	stderr
however both running processes has the default streams like stderr stdout and stdin

10158740
width	height
i know the width and height of the image and i know that pixels are 3-byte rgb values

10158756
min	max
i m trying to use std min_element and std max_element to return the min and max elements in a vector of doubles

10158756
min	max
i could of course write my own procedure to find the min max but i d like to understand how to use the functions

10158763
min	max
min max_element return the iterator to the min max element not the value of the min max element

10158764
put	get
if you update in the wrong order it will put lats first and then you get the error

10158769
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this seems to work fine in ie google-chrome and safari crashes if you rapidly click the black square however it s giving me problems in firefox

10158796
margin	height
to reposition any one of these all that is needed is to adjust the element in the appropriate direction top bottom margin padding height

10158855
int	chars
i don t think it is casting a chars or any other int type to a or other pointer type is well-defined if ill-advised

10158870
opera	google-chrome
i tried pixastic but it s broken in my browsers google-chrome opera and ie7

10158893
google-chrome	firefox
as can be seen ie and firefox works properly but not with google-chrome

10158916
uiview	subviews
also consider tagging the views with the uiview tag property so you can add the subviews once and then won t have to recreate them with reuse

10158933
put	get
you can then put in pointers to the subclasses and use dynamic_cast to get pointers back to the subclasses when you need them

10158951

accessor	properties
instead of leveraging synthesize for properties nsmanagedobject sublcasses leverage the dynamic keyword which indicates the accessor will be created at runtime - in this case by the nsmanagedobjectcontext

10159029
tapply	read.table
but the error message says the problem is caused by the call to tapply rather than anything about incorrect file names and i have literally no idea how that could happen since i thought a data frame which read.table creates always has the same number of rows for each column

10159044
translation	localization
take for example the case of localization of a web application - changes in translation and views and so on

10159049
comparator	comparable
but the way it is designed right now allows you to create a treeset with no comparator thus use the natural ordering with an element type that is not comparable to itself

10159067
width	height
right now it s an anchor tag with a set width height and a background placement

10159069
groupbox	panel
the model consist of a groupbox that contains a panel

10159070
hash	salt	hash	md5	salt	md5
the use case you re after isn t totally clear - but i m going to assume you are acting as an identity provider idp with pingfederate and you have accounts stored in some system database that have their passwords md5 hash with a salt

10159092
button	checkbox
i deselected the checkbox where the value is 3 which is on the related_products_ids and after hitting the save button the value 3 on the related_products_ids will be deleted so that current rows now is 2 and 4

10159107
bionic	libc
to be more specific that device is an android google tv box logitech revue and it seems that it s a bit different from regular android my guess it doesn t use retarded bionic and uses normal libc regular pthread and it s seems to be closer to regular linux

10159113
post	get
what s wrong with the above code how can i get it to send data from the forum via post

10159122

10159389
couchbase	couchdb
couchbase and couchdb share a lot in common but they are not fully compatible with one another

10159508
pull	push
the solution for me was to do a pull instead of a push as charlesbailey suggested

10159540
post	get

10159559
width	height
answer 1 try defining the modal css class and set the width and height

10159617
x86	64bit
if you re compiling for anything but 32-bit x86 integers and pointers will not be 4 bytes but 8 for 64bit which would cause problems

10159617
int	chars
besides the issue with defining stack versus heap why do you define your stack as a chars array rather than int if you re putting int in there

10159633

10159688
getter	setter
both rely on underlying getter and setter methods to manipulate the value that is stored private or protected inside the class

10159688
getter	setter
you could achieve the same thing through manual getter and setter methods this is what most old hat c-programmers do when they start picking up objective-c as far as i can tell but you would lose something called kvo key-value observation

10159690
width	height
as to the size you can again supply your own class with your custom width and height to the container and it should take up on it the way you re adding it inline now works fine as well just make sure to add it to the main container

10159753
integer	unsigned

10159805
post	get
basically the difference is with get the data is sent in the url like while with post the data is sent in a separate header

10159805
post	get
semantically if you re fetching data from the server and not changing anything you should generally use get while if you re changing something you should use post

10159808
mouseup	mousedown
i wan t to use events such as mouseup and mousedown when they are available

10159808

cpu	hyperthreading
also it frees up cpu time to be used for other things in some cases hyperthreading

10159848
post	get

10160134
hash	md5
this isn t actually something which is an md5 hash or anything

ok the first bounding box is 1261x512 making width height 2.462890

10166504
width	height
i m calling the different number range a box with width w2 and height h1

10166504
width	height
if w2 h2 is not equal to 2.462890 this whole exercise is pointless because you need to rescale the width or height

10166504

with the ratio measured for y we just multiplying 512 423 w2 then add to 25240264

10166594

i don t know the scheme syntax but in haskell syntax if you wanted x to be a lazy parameter to a strict function f you might write something like and modify f appropriately to expect such lambdas and call them at the moment you want to un-lazy them

10166913
super	extends
here this refers to the current object - so this.x refers to a field in the current object and super refers to the object this object extends so you can get to a field up higher

10166929

10167087
min	max
i dont mind using std less std more std max std min or any of the inbuilt functor objects

10167087
min	max
however i would prefer not to use enums in the constructor and then depending on the enum value call min or max routines

10167118
iboutlet	ibaction
you can t specify any random methods nor should youâ the whole point of the iboutlet iboutletcollection and ibaction keywords is to declare in code that these properties methods are used by a nib

10167539
qgraphicsview	qgraphicsitem
you also could handle the clicks in the items themselves by redefining their qgraphicsitem mousereleaseevent method it would remove the need for the evil cast but you have to remove the function layerview mousereleaseevent or at least recall the base class implementation qgraphicsview mousereleaseevent to allow the item s to receive the event

10167998
nasm	fasm
if you were to compile your assembly with an assembler such as nasm fasm or even gas it would not make calls to _getmainargs and others so you as a programmer would have to implement your own way to get command line arguments which can be tricky for beginners

realloc	strdup	realloc	malloc	free	strdup	free	malloc	free	realloc	strdup	malloc
if there are a great many relative to your virtual address space ram - you want to explicitly let the memory library know not all the originally requested memory is actually needed using realloc or you could even use strdup to allocate a new block more tightly based on actual needs then free the original - depending on your malloc free library implementation that might work out better or worse but very few applications would be significantly affected by any difference

in example it needs to pull an rss feed every 1 hour and call an certain rest api every 30 min

10177476
packets	multicast
femi is correct you need to call joingroup to inform your network that you re interested in receiving packets for that multicast group

10177496
pop-up	dialog
see this question for how to do all that android image dialog pop-up

10177509

ie 6.0.2800 does not identify as an iframe and will pass any expected width height values along

10177514
codeigniter	cakephp
there are also pre-built frameworks like larvel cakephp and codeigniter

10177515
unsigned	short
unsigned is short for unsigned int

10177523
superclass	subclassing
why use a superclass to instantiate a subclassing object like above

10177550
superclass	subclassing
since subclassing is a superclass you can use an instance of subclassing and treat it as superclass

10177565
google-chrome	safari
then i noticed that both google-chrome and safari have this behavior

10177569
navigationcontroller	pushviewcontroller
when i use pushviewcontroller the new viewcontroller appears with the navigationcontroller and the back button but the uitabbarcontroller disappears

10177570
superclass	subclassing
when you create a new subclassing object you can have that reference point to it because a subclassing is-a superclass instance

10177571
post	get
when we read sam ng s follow-up post we get the expression that that bug was not fixed because they believed a type-load exception would always be thrown

10177581
hide	show
you may need to wrap a div around the to do the show hide correctly

10177603
children	parent
that would stop the elements from being generated in children from parent

10177705
jboss	glassfish
obviously there are benefits to deploying to an application server like jboss or glassfish otherwise ears and app servers wouldn t exist

10177706
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
if you still need the navigation functionality just wrap your viewcontrollers inside a uinavigationcontroller and add the serounding navigationcontroller to the tabbar instead of the uiviewcontroller

10177716
sudo	passwd
i have ssh-key based authentication but a different sudo passwd on each machine

10177738
hex	binary
a 2048 bit binary data block would be 512 hex digits long

10177742
firefox	safari
after extensive testing in firefox and safari while being perfectly aware that i won t ever get both browsers to view it all perfectly pixel-precisely fine as the original design views in my photoshop i stumbled over the most disturbing of issues

10177774
hide	show
you will have to manually show hide them based on the information you loaded in the controller

10177803
width	height
you are setting the width and height of the canvas using css width and height and not the html attributes

10177803
width	height
you need to define the width height either in the canvas tag

10177854
maven	m2e
m2e maven integration for eclipse to at least 1.0.2

10177858
qfiledialog	qdir
my understanding of the documentation for qdir and qfiledialog is that the following should show a file dialog with only executable files

10177864
portrait	landscape
special layouts for tablets portrait landscape different dpi etc reading the docs should save you much hassle later -

10177883
sorting	filtering
when i call radgrid.rebind in its sorting filtering event handlers the data updates

10177942
alloca	longjmp
so what is going on here is that there s a bunch of stack space allocated for stuff that might be needed unwind handlers calls to setjmp longjmp alloca or other compiler builtin functions but which isn t needed in your case as you never call the functions or use the features that might require them

10177964
explode	substr
using a combination of php s explode function and substr you could use to build an array of the names like this

10177965
uiviewcontroller	uipopovercontroller
using an instance of a uiviewcontroller is there any way i can find the uipopovercontroller being used to present it

10177965
uiviewcontroller	uipopovercontroller
i would also want to find the uiviewcontroller that displayed the uipopovercontroller in the first place

10177969
ubuntu	linux
if you re using ubuntu linux

10177971
google-chrome	firefox

10177987
post	get
does it have something to do with there being a get and post addreview method

10177987
post	get
i don t think it should considering the link would pull the get and when i submit the form it should be a post

10178005
children	parent
essentially if i have 1 entity called i.e parent and the other entity which it has a relationship with is children and it is inverse

10178005
children	parent
if i create the parent entity will it create the children entity as well

10178005
children	parent
i ve set the parentchildrenrelationship to optional but it looks like every time i create the parent entity it creates the children entity

10178079
for-loop	loops
i tried editing the for-loop to be a while loops instead

10178162
stdout	stderr
sometimes when the external process crashes due to a jvm crash see these hs_err_pid.log files those threads which read the stdout stderr of that external process begin consuming 100 cpu and never exit

10178192
children	parent
the value of children should either be nil for a one-to-one relationship or an empty nsset or nsarray for a one-to-many relationship depending on ordering for a newly created parent entity

10178193
uigesturerecognizer	uibutton
this way the original target and action of each uibutton remains the same and the supplementary code to handle my popup is the action of the uigesturerecognizer

10178204
setinterval	settimeout
as a side note never pass strings to setinterval settimeout

10178245
width	height
i m trying to set the size of the children views of the gridlayout in such a way that with n rows and m columns the size of cells is directly related to the n m values and the width and height of the linearlayout

10178245
width	height
so for example i m trying to get the cell width and height as follows

10178245
width	height
i need to query for their correct or actual measured width height

10178330
hash	md5
also both the hash you cited have issues md5 more so and should not be used if there is any risk that someone could have any incentive to create documents having the same hash yet being different this is readily doable with md5 which is completely broken from a cryptographic point of view and possibly not far away with sha1

10178356
sysv	systemd
or use a platform specific ipc systemd shared memory via mmap sysv sockets etc

10178437
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
in firefox safari the event handler fires immediately after the click but i am observing weird behaviour in google-chrome

10178437
firefox	safari
notice that the event handler has not fired whereas it does in firefox safari

10178439
google-chrome	firefox
i m using the lastest stable version of firefox google-chrome on windows to test my application use socket.io

10178439
google-chrome	firefox
i bring the source code to run on ubuntu in a vm and test with firefox google-chrome on unbuntu it works well with websocket instantly

10178439
google-chrome	firefox
so i think the problems are my windows or firefox google-chrome on it

10178439
google-chrome	firefox
i try to uninstall firefox and google-chrome it still doesn t work

10178463
multiplication	exponent
that leave only rsa of your list and the answer is very implementation dependent depending on how well large integer multiplication is implemented choice of exponent etc.

10178503
google-chrome	safari
when using the jquery ui .button function to style a link item the position of link button is shifted upwards when viewed in any browser other than google-chrome and safari

when i retrieve a entity row with an intentionally unfetched many-to-one association and then try to update that entity i get the famous transient instances error

10178517
instances	transient
object references an unsaved transient instances - save the transient instances before flushing

10178517
instances	transient
but that transient instances was never fetched and so cannot even be transient

10178521
listview	gridview
since my itemtemplate consists of a border it doesn t have native support for drag drop like the gridview or the listview

10178521
listview	gridview
i tried using both gridview and listview for my squares before but the gui became too sluggish so i switched to a simple border which made it alot faster

10178532
shadowing	named
even in functional languages there is named shadowing

10178586
m2e	pom.xml
if you have an approximate idea of the dependency needed or can figure out the one you need given a list then m2e s dependency search can be the quickest way of adding a dependency to your pom.xml

10178638
packets	multicast
to implement the approach above i thought to write a multicast client in android that receives the rtp packets and stitches together the stream

10178638

10178723
post	get
get the post from the view and check if it already excists in my database

10178726
spaces	linefeed
so long as you use the xml api instead of trying to write the xml out directly yourself you should be fine with any valid text broken surrogate pairs would probably cause an issue but what won t be valid is unicode code points less than spaces u+0020 aside from tab carriage return and linefeed

10178733
maven	pom.xml
we merge maven pom.xml files from one repository to another

10178747
subtract	add
then add it to the first and subtract it from the second

10178756
paas	jelastic
at these days this became common and using paas services like jelastic you can even get it pre-configured out of the box

10178793
pop-up	dialog
if you bring up the dropdown pop-up menu for a pressing escape should close that not the dialog

10178827
free	malloc
to resolve this you need to dynamically allocate space for each new element you add with malloc and release them with free when you remove them

10178876
sctp	tcp
any way i would do this only if tcp or sctp netty 4.x supports sctp can not be used for the purpose

10179057
mergesort	timsort
timsort is used by python and java for their sort methods and is rather supernaturally fast but it s a more complex algorithm than mergesort which matters if you re working in something like c - so if you just need something that works pretty well and is simple go with mergesort

10179065
integer	unsigned
the unsigned integer into the correspondingly sized signed type will

10179065

10179393
nunit	mstest
nunit xunit or even mstest which comes with many editions of visual studio

10179395
int	chars
the thing is that when parsing and ruby sees that a number with more than two digits starts with the chars 0 it parses it as an octal int number

10179395
octal	decimal
thus when it parses 00 it is 0 in octal which is the same as 0 in decimal

10179402
ubuntu	linux
i am using gcc-4.5.2 on ubuntu linux

10179414

10181175
cvs	svn
you can not share the eclipse installation directory or the workspace but the projects themselves are easy to keep in sync using a version management system like cvs svn git etc

10181248
selecteditem	selectedindex
i believe you want selectedindex instead of selecteditem i m assuming here

10181279

for a start recall that the arguments to variadic functions undergo the default argument promotions chars s are converted to int s etc. which will totally screw things up

10181366
post	get
by default curl uses get and so does the standard facebook api request you have to pass post as a param

sudo	passwd	sudoers	passwd
to give user bob sudo access to cat without a passwd you would add this to your sudoers file

asp.net web forms is an attempt to mimic a stateful paradigm over a stateless enviroment

10181812

teamcity	jenkins
i have used and setup teamcity and jenkins aka the new hudson before and while i would agree that teamcity is a lot slicker to set up it is only free for teams of 10 users or less

10182091
teamcity	jenkins
the killer feature in teamcity is the pre-checkin workflow where you can test code before checking it into source control and the nicety of jenkins is that it is completely free even if you grow beyond the 10 users and build agents

10182131
put	get	submit	submission
i heard that i can request to put my app in a holding area when i submit the app - meaning that the app will get reviewed but not made publicly available until a later day and that date is undetermined at the time of the submission for example we probably would like to have some major marketing event planned for the app etc

10182472
for-loop	loops
even if the while is not wrong i d prefer a for-loop in this case the number of iterations is fixed - the number of lines â i sometimes think of while loops as the gateway to the halting problem .

ilist	icollection
i also have similar situations with icollection and ilist return types in other places

10182569
ienumerable	icollection
the reason i want to return either ienumerable or icollection is so that i m not returning more than needed

10182569
ienumerable	icollection
just to clarify what i m curious about is if it is okay that my return statement in the body is returning a but the method header has a return-type of ienumerable or possibly icollection collection etc.

10182639
for-loop	loops
instead of a for in loops you could as easily use a for-loop like so

seems like you can just to a form submit to end.php and pass in the variables via post or get variables

10182878
move	drag
now my solution is based on own polyline each click adds marker that should stick to that line next together with it should move as you drag and here occurred is that if there are more than 8 points polyline with markers is no longer compatible

10182880
google-chrome	firefox
step 2 open up your google-chrome object inspector or firebug if you are in firefox or if you are in ie then go download google-chrome and slap yourself for using ie

it s for a systray-driven app that will have some qdialogs and also a qmainwindow containing a table widget or is it possible to create a table into a qdialog

caveats i wouldn t do this without using versioning control and it will absolutely break if any core code changes happen between versioning upgrade

10183258
google-chrome	firefox
edit tested in firefox and google-chrome

if foo has a superclass that implements mynonvirtualfn or if the object it s being called on is actually an instance of a subclassing of foo that overrides mynonvirtualfn -- none of that matters

10183495
fadein	fadeout
the animation is done using fadein fadeout callbacks fadein occurs once fadeout is done

10183527

10184080
uiviewcontroller	uistoryboardsegue
as i am using storyboards i feel that the most versatile implementation would be subclassing uistoryboardsegue and on the perform method check if the user is attempting to access an restricted uiviewcontroller perhaps restricted controllers have a protocol property that specifies the required status logged in out

10184105

10184398
lsp	principles
yes returning a subclass would still satisfy lsp assuming the subclass does not decide to radically change the behavior of array such that it wouldn t be but the principles only states that a subclass may be substituted for its base class not that it needs to be

you can use the fseek and ftell functions

to remedy this i changed the origin to the center of the ship width 2 height 2 and also added those values to the drawing rectangle so that the sprite would draw correctly

10187165
mp3	wav
but if i m converting each of two wav files to two mp3 files it works fine

10187165

so i have a conclusion the commandline for converting one mixed wav file to mp3 file is wrong

10187212
min	max
if you need the first effective date entered just change max to min

10187213
int	chars
if the string wasn t exit check whether it s an int -- more precisely whether it s a sequence of chars representing an int

10187213
int	chars
the key point is that you ll need two variables an array of chars to hold the input line and an int int or long to hold the converted int value if the string holds the representation of an int

10187219
post	put
to make sure this is only run on individual post pages put this all between

10187736
try-catch	exception-handling
you should use this when you think the caller wants to do his own exception-handling else you should use a try-catch block and return a specified error value in the catch block like indexof from an array returns -1 instead of throwing an exception-handling

10187754
try-catch	exception-handling
in short if you are using a try-catch block for a particular exception-handling you are handling the exception-handling there

10187780
mouseout	mouseleave
you need mouseleave instead of mouseout because mouseout will also be triggered when you hover from the parent to a child element

10187780
mouseout	mouseleave
moving the cursor in this case from parent to child element will trigger the mouseout event but not the mouseleave event

10187780
children	parent
the mouseleave element will only be triggered when you move the cursor away from the parent and it s children

10187780
mouseout	mouseleave
update a very good article with a very clear live demo can be found here different between mouseout and mouseleave in jquery

10201906
strlen	substr
if whitespace does not count use ltrim rtrim before strlen and substr

10201909
for-loop	arrays
if you want to be strict about it quite frankly blake512_hash shouldn t return uint8_t arrays in the first place if you are expecting char arrays as the output all the time you could simply call in your for-loop and remove memcpy

if the min max interval contains 0 then an optimal solution can be realized as a convex combination of these two solutions

10202102
free	malloc
then when you use a new expression it ll invoke the class operator new to allocate the memory and that will call malloc so will end up allocating memory via malloc and likewise when you delete it it ll use operator delete which will call free

10202102
free	malloc
of course it uses operator new and operator delete instead of malloc and free like i ve used above

10202105
for-loop	loops
you declared a for-loop inside the while loops

10202107
sudo	passwd

10202145
free	malloc
since the user is free to declare their mutexes as auto variables or declare them as pointers to memory allocated from malloc 3 i m skeptical of storing the mutex structures on a global linked list -- it sounds too likely that one of them will go out of scope and lead to garbage

10202152
hide	show
for better or for worse i ve got tons of logic in my views like this to determine which elements to show hide based on values which are stored in the database typically from reading incoming post data beforehand and saving it off to the database first

10202152

10202778
implements	extends
i never saw it as an anti-pattern for the interface and abstract class to extends implements a common ancestor

10202778
implements	extends
then when you get to your customer dao impl you indicate you implements the customer interface and then have chosen to fulfill that by extends the abstract class

10202778
implements	extends
this allows the abstract class and the customer interface to grow or change separately if either ever wanted to not extends implements the generic dao but the other did

decltype	auto
if we start from this then decltype is basically giving us what would be t in this template and auto is giving us what would be x in this template

10205430
decltype	auto
i suspect the similarity to template type deduction made it much easier for the committee to accept auto and decltype into the language -- they basically just add new ways of accessing the type deduction that s already needed for function templates

screens	tablet
typically you would provide images in various densities so icons etc look good on all devices but if you re building an app to work well on devices of very different sizes small phones through to 10 tablet you should also provide layouts for the various sizes of screens - perhaps one for phones one for 7 tablet and one for 10 tablet

earlier in the project nhibernate was warning that i was not overriding equals and gethashcode to circumvent lots of code changes and to promote code re-use i made a compositebaseentity class

10205863
equals	gethashcode
as there are two keys to compare equality against we must override the equals gethashcode methods to become something like

10205955
oncreate	onstart
oncreate onstart and onresume are lifecycle methods called by the operating system and shouldn t be called directly

10206104

is there a way or piece of code that looks for post and get data and turns them into normal variables

10206104
post	get
i know the second example is impossible you can t get get and post data at the same time or so i know but the idea is that whether the page gets a get or a post variable it should turn it into variables automatically

10206513
junit	jmock
i know that junit and jmock everything is a class in java so there s no choice but i guess that the ability to descend from a class with nothing but virtual functions is probably the mechanism that allows googlemock to do its work.

10206518
post	put	post	get	put	get
entity body is not allowed with get request so you will have to resort some other http method put or post if you need to send data in the entity body which in your case is not semantically correct

10206574

use new and instead of malloc and free

10206574

realloc	malloc	free	malloc	free	realloc
never mix new delete with malloc free realloc

10207120
realloc	malloc	free	malloc	free	realloc
and malloc free realloc on non-pod types like std string yields undefined behaviour

10207120
realloc	malloc
using new malloc realloc on non-pod types means that your program loses any defined behaviour

cpu	processors
you re limited to 33ms per frame otherwise you ll be lagging behind too slow cpu or too slow code if you can t hit this target you won t be running at 30 hz and if you hit it under 33ms then you can yield processors time effectivly freeing up resources

10209233
fseek	fread
i replaced the fread call by memcpy as shown but i m missing the return value of fread actual read items and in the original code the filepointer was moved by fseek i wonder whether my approach using a temporary pointer is correct

10209233

my ultimate goal is to simulate the fread and fseek calls for resources with similar function prototypes

10209446
tesseract	leptonica
it probably means your tiff image has an alpha channel and therefore the underlying leptonica library used by tesseract doesn t support it

10209446
tesseract	leptonica
tesseract well leptonica accepts pngs these days and is less picky about them so it might be easier to migrate your workflow to png anyway

10209739
gridview	sqldatasource
since you re using an sqldatasource with the gridview already i would say using the allowsorting property of the gridview in your markup would be your easiest bet

10209739
gridview	sqldatasource
you could just change the selectcommand in your sqldatasource to end with order by added desc . this would be ideal if you do not want the sorting to be a dynamic user-prompted event but just a static default sorting of the gridview that does not change

10209791

you re not using less-than-or-equals greater-than-or-equals everywhere so it s not going to include values which are equal to the max or min

10210889
hide	show	tabcontrol	tabitem
what we ended up doing was creating a special tabcontrol i called it tabcontrolex which keeps all items rendered but chooses to simply show hide the contentpresenters for the tabitem

10210937
hide	show
you will notice images need to be fully loaded in order to run the slider this may not look very good so you will probably want to hide .mydiv while loading and show it once images are in place please refer to jquery toogle for this

10210945
google-chrome	firefox
i m seeing this in google-chrome and firefox

10210961

10211356
getter	setter
property declares a property which is a getter and optionally a setter for read write properties

10211356
getter	setter
the generation of the getter and setter is done by the synthesize in the implementation or by you writing the getter and setter

10211356
getter	setter
just to confuse you a bit in the very latest compiler you can omit the synthesize and the compiler will put it in for you as long as you haven t explicitly created a getter or setter

10211358
post	get
i spent a day trying to get the sample source into a project to test the post on wall

10211372

pull	push
that way you control precisely who can clone push pull for a given repository and you don t have to give access to anyone

10212032
stdout	stderr
one thing you could do is capture the program s stdout and or stderr streams and look for specific patterns or at least anything at all

10212112
width	height
i think there are some processing image loading altering the width height of some elements etc after document .ready before something .mouseenter

10212515
rsa	aes
i ve been playing around with rsa pkcs and aes encription

10212515
rsa	aes
what it does is encrypting the data with the symmetric aes system which uses a random key generated on-the-fly cyphers the password used for aes using the rsa pkcs#1 system and puts it in the result to be sent

10212515
rsa	aes
as you can see the aes password is encrypted with the server s rsa key

10212549

rather than implements a long anonymous class or extends abstractfuture or futuretask which are themselves complicated i find it simpler to just create a small holder class that implements future

10212891
int	boolean
i have created a custom property in a partial class hideboolean to convert the int property to a boolean

10212909
vim	emacs
vim emacs

10212940
client-side	server-side
you need to use some sort of client-side language javascript jquery etc. or server-side language php asp.net etc. to achieve that

10212971
int	double
a mat is a matrix of double while umat is a matrix of unsigned int

10213015

this compiles but i get a runtimeexception advising me to use onitemclicklistener rather than onclicklistener for an adapterview

10213042
submit	submission
when i submit the hidden field containing the device id i end up submission every device id that has the checkbox which is every one

10213042
submit	submission
i was hoping i could validate it and say before submission well if this is checked then only submit this specific device id

10213047
serializable	deserialization
however you might be able to achieve this effect by writing your own single serializable deserialization functions as in returning a c++ class to java via jni

10213057

width	height
you can then use .ajax get to fetch the page and locate that div once you have this div you can get the width and height of it

10213142
google-chrome	firefox
maybe you should look for google-chrome or firefox apis that would allow to achive what you want

10213153
post	put	post	get	put	get
in the documentation for ext.data.model under the subheading using a proxy there are examples for the various operations you may want to perform get put post delete - aka load save save destroy

folder	dir
this will read any .txt files in a folder named dirlists and for every line in each file do a copy from the dir specified by that line to the target dir .

10213185
client-side	server-side
reading around my understanding is that the current best practice for applying the dry principle in creating crawlable ajax-generated websites as described above is to use a templating engine that can use the same templates on the client-side and the server-side

10213185
freemarker	velocity
if that solution is correct then how is this different than approaches used 4 or 5 years ago by front-end heavy sites where sites essentially had to maintain two copies of the templating code one copy for users with javascript enabled nearly everyone and another copy in freemarker or velocity for search engines and browsers without javascript enabled nearly noone

10213185
client-side	server-side
does this imply that two templating model layers would need to be maintained one on the client-side and one on the server-side

10213185
ember.js	backbone.js
how advisable is it to combine those client-side templates with a front-end mvc mv mvvc framework like backbone.js ember.js or yui app library

10213202
stdout	stderr
to now show some events in stdout and some in stderr simply setup two streamloggers one for critical events and one for all others and disable the standard console logger

10213203
macports	homebrew
instructions for mac os can be found on the ack-website and require macports or homebrew

10213247
hide	show
you can use show and hide methods

10213305
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this solution has been tested in ie firefox safari and google-chrome

10213324
hide	show
if you choose this example you could could also think about adding a button to show hide all that you can achieve by using

10213337
put	get
when trying to make an example program like matrixmul i get an extensive amount of errors most of which are unknown type name size_t . i ve made sure to put usr local cuda bin in my path as well as usr local cuda lib in a .conf in etc ld.so.conf.d

10213375
public	protected
if i change the protected internal int to a public one it works fine but it seems like you should be able to map protected internal

10213379
textblock	itemscontrol
i need to define a global style for all textblock and textbox that exist within itemscontrol elements

10213384
versioning	upgrade
upgrade to rails 3.0.12 which supports the latest versioning of bundler

cos	sin
two problems sin and cos take arguments in radians not degrees

10213426
memcpy	memset
calling memcpy memset will change the memory for good

10213427
cos	sqrt	cos	sin	sin	sqrt
question if i want to add more functions i copy-paste what i do for the sin function for every single function like cos sqrt fabs and so on

10213435
folder	directory
also a quick tip on structuring sti in your app if you find that you have a lot of models that use sti like a productcategory commentcategory phonecategory clientcategory that all inherit from cateogory - i tend to organize them in folder inside model directory

10213440
google-chrome	firefox
that works for firefox and google-chrome

10213442
addition	multiplication
the operations multiplication addition can be implemented without loss in accuracy too

10213448
postgresql	mysql
note it must be generic sql which must work in both mysql and postgresql

10213448
postgresql	mysql
because i think the find_in_set works in mysql but not postgresql

10213452
textblock	itemscontrol
this will display all items in your itemscontrol with a textbox which uses your mytextboxstyle and your textblock with the mytextblockstyle

10213464
ant	maven
i found out how to do it with ant and antrun-plugin though it is very complicated i had much trouble with antrun plugin versions unable to make a recent version work even for a basic task and i d really like to stick to maven

10213464
ant	maven
if someone knows how to do the equivalent with je jacoco maven plugin instead of ant i m interested

10213515
listview	gridview
data source controls are just controls which bind data to ui controls gridview listview etc..

10213515
sqldatasource	entitydatasource
if your ui control need to bind directly to database you would use sqldatasource or if you are using entity data model a additional layer on database you would use with entitydatasource

10213520
int	boolean
so you have lost the true data type â int boolean float etc. and the data type checking that would be done by the rdmbs on insert of an incorrect values

10213544
int	chars
i need to make calculations with long hexadecimal number so i want to convert it to int but firstly i try to remove spaces and eol chars

10213560
nhibernate	automapper
then when you are querying nhibernate project directly into the model or use automapper to convert your object model into the view model

ggplot2	lattice
however if you use either lattice or ggplot2 not calling print on the object that that came out of ggplot2 or lattice

10213791
spaces	delimiter
imagine the common word count problem where in one file you have spaces as the world delimiter and in another file the underscore

10213829
cos	sin
in addition to the answer by pmr the standard functions aren t functors so you couldn t use them directly to specify unique specialisations of your class - you wouldn t have a separate template instantiation for std sin versus std cos which is what i gather you re aiming for

10213832
mockito	easymock
both easymock and mockito don t support mocking construction of objects

10213847
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	safari
now the right sound format plays in ie and google-chrome however when i open the page up in opera or safari the sound player appaears but the play button does not work when it is pressed as if the file cannot be found or something

10213893
awt	swing
it s all inside the swing awt code

rtsp	rtmp
only flash rtmp stream play in browser with flash player.if streams is rtsp then browser will open it in the external video player

10214077
opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari
however it only works with internet explorer and only if the site is trusted by ie firefox safari and opera all behave slightly differently but none will follow the redirect from the php script

10214084
post	get
is this the right process and if so is there anyone out there who can post some sample code as i m really struggling to get this right

the problem may be that your portrait is in a folder for normal-sized screens and your landscape is in a folder for large-size screens

10214159
put	get
create a get the map.entryset put it into a and sort it

10214164
for-loop	arrays
i m using preg_match instead of preg_match_all because from what i understand the for-loop is supposed to repeat based on the value of num_parts so using preg_match_all will just build an arrays of all those src elements instead of matching them one at time

10214174
centos	linux
i have micro instance free with amazon linux ami and i want to change to centos ami

10214244

before i was just surrounding my custom view class with a frame layout with a fixed width and height which obviously didn t allow any scrolling

10214249
maven	pom.xml
however the maven pom.xml files throughout the directory trees beneath these tags still refer to version 3.2.0 in both cases - am i missing something obvious please

10214276
width	height
and possibly explicitly define the width and height

10214278
gif	png
there is so much needed information for an image it would be an extremely lengthy parameter list for a method to accept raw bytes and create an imagine is it a bitmap jpeg gif png etc and all the additional data each of those requires to create a valid image it wouldn t make sense

10214302
put	get
you have to use getbyte method to get the bytes and the put these bytes into a datagram packet instance and then pass it to the client or send it.

concave	convex
i m looking for a method for finding an axis-aligned rectangle inside a concave or convex polygon

10214869
width	margin
width and right margin may change

10214873
width	height
but it seems when i set the width and height of a canvas to 100 it doesn t really make it as high and as wide as parent

10214873
width	height
i don t want to hardcode the height and width of canvas because it should change dynamically when viewed in bigger or smaller screen including mobile devices

10214971
width	height
use the width and height attributes of the canvas if you want it to actually be as big as the parent element

10214971

if you use the css height and width attributes then you are just stretching the canvas

10215079
int	boolean
boolean and int values should be set without quotes

10215079
width	height
since the width height and type are your fancybox settings they should go inside the fancybox function not in the ajax function

since a war folder necessarily precedes the creation of a .war archive since a .war archive is simply a zipped up war directory obtaining the war directory is provably easier than obtaining a .war file

10215562
filtering	grouping
with linq-to-object it probably makes little difference but with linq-to-sql or linq-to-ef etc. the grouping operation is performed on the database server rather than the client and so you may want to do an additional filtering on the grouping key which generates a having clause and then only get some of the grouping instead of all of them

10215594
post	get
you may set x_test_request true and post to and check if you get a valid transaction id back

10215597
lxml	libxslt	lxml	libxml2	libxml2	libxslt
the problem i am having is that pykml depends on lxml and lxml depends on libxml2 libxslt and i have not been able to install any of them

10215597
libxml2	libxslt
the documentation for libxml2 and libxslt is particularly confusing to me since there is mention of c language and compilers

10215597
lxml	libxslt	lxml	libxml2	libxml2	libxslt
could anybody indicate to me what s the proper way to install and test lxml libxml2 and libxslt to use with python

even if the div were sized correctly it was using the default position static which means that it is not the positioning parent of any children

10215724
width	height
the width and height attributes on a canvas specify the number of pixels of data to draw to like the actual pixels in an image and are separate from the display size of the canvas

10215724
width	height
it creates a js function shown below to both set a canvas to be the same display size as its positioned parent and then adjusts the internal width and height properties so that is has the same number of pixels as it shows

10215728
subscript	superscript
besides using css3 to allows the programmer to use custom fonts safely you could just superscript or subscript a b or a #

10215763

also note that i replaced all the double-quotes in your program with single-quotes

10215911
ssms	sqlcmd
but i ve shown that both ssms and sqlcmd can be made to work so i hope that gets you closer to running

10215911
ssms	sqlcmd
so unless you need sqlcmd access in the short term i would have the secondary users do their thing with ssms once you ve granted adequate permissions and hopefully krzysztof will have more info on the other items

10215927
ienumerable	iqueryable
what possible advantages could datatable have over iqueryable or ienumerable

10215990
width	height
update because you re invoking the functions on the anchor tags they need to have a height and a width similar to the following place your height and width accordingly

10215990
width	height
i just used firebug edited the html with the height and width and it worked fine

10215990
width	height
if you would ve implemented the below approach the image would have a height and width and since that is the image that is being targeting might make more sense

10216002
for-loop	loops
now you can loops through the properties with a for-loop and access the values

10216010
width	height
remember to set the tableview to have a flexible width as well as a flexible height

10216010
width	margin
this view should have a flexible width and a flexible top margin

10216114
stdout	stderr
i made the code using hacks as some things like mysql-escaping and outputting stderr and stdout in different variables are not available by default in bash

10216116

if you have firefox with firebug google-chrome or ie9 or above press f12 and choose console

10216183
google-chrome	firefox
and it works just fine firefox google-chrome and ie

if you are on a unix-like system including os x libxml2 and libxslt are probably already installed or can be installed easily through the native package manager

10216229
lxml	libxslt	lxml	libxml2	libxml2	libxslt
for windows lxml provides prebuilt eggs with libxml2 and libxslt staticly compiled in as stated in the lxml install documentation so you do not need to install them separately

you really want to make use of the platform you re running on s underlying pseudorandom number generator prng - dev urandom on a unix linux system or the crypto-api on a windows system - as these have been studied extensively and produce really random numbers that are suitable for use in cryptosystems

google-chrome	safari
here is an example the one on top is google-chrome the one on bottom is safari

10217354
int	double
the random number generator will produce a random double from two random int values

10217354
int	double
the internal seed has 48 bit so the random sequence repeats after at most 2 48 int values or 2 47 double values

10217392
post	get
for simple get post requests you can simply return an access-control-allow-origin header for more complex requests with other methods you ll need additional headers which can be found on the above resources

10217410

my css and js files are in seperate folder in the root directory

10217428

assume we have classes that implements the same interface and extends the same base

when you set the width height on an element it is relative to it s container

10217701
textarea	autogrow
you can also use the jquery autogrow textarea plugin

10217732
int	boolean
i ve had people do this and it took me forever to figure out why what i thought was a boolean or an int was a string

10217732
int	boolean
php s boolean true and false will get casted to the corresponding int and you won t have a problem using 0 1 in javascript

10217739
post	get
so a think that i have to create php file that will get the first letters that in the search box end calculate the appropriated post via wordpress filters

10217740
width	height
if you need good browser support or you need the content to reflow properly you ll have to make do with an alternative such as using javascript or restructuring your html such that the width and height properties will scale it correctly and affect element flow in a natural way

10217765
svg	vml
have you considered using scalable graphics svg vml or a custom font for your glyphs rather than images

10217808

i have extracted the datatables-1.9.1 folder but i don t know where to place it in my c xampp directory

10217864
width	height
in order to enable virtualization the radgridview control needs to have bounded width and height

10217864
width	height
putting a radgridview inside a scrollviewer gives it infinite width and height which disables the virtualization

10217864
width	height
my suggestion is to bound the width and height of the grid using the maxwidth and maxheight properties and then take the grid out of the scrollviewer you ve wrapped it in

10217913
int	chars
according to post i have to send control chars as ascii code int

10217916

10217924
converter	multibinding
i tried to use the multibinding with a converter like this

10217945
width	height
you are right that the scrollviewer simply lets the radgridview determine it s own size unconstrained and therefore it will fill up the width to accomodate all of it s columns and the height to accomodate all of the rows

10217945
width	height
you shouldn t have any width or height set on the radgridview because you want them set as auto the default to grow or shrink appropriately

10217975
ppl	tbb
like tudor has recommend i would also use a parallel_for pattern algorithm from either intel tbb or microsoft ppl

enable it in your httpd.conf and also enable .htaccess then add this code in your .htaccess under document_root

10218445
uiview	subviews
i suggest you subclass an uiview and implement the drawrect method so the view knows how to draw itself and implement the touchesended method in your view controller where you can check if you have touched a squareview then remove it from view controller s view otherwise create a squareview and add it as subviews to the view controller s view

you should use one element per icon and switch the class and image src when mouseover and mouseout are fired

10219977
google-chrome	firefox
expect to see this api live in google-chrome and firefox later this year

10219999

10220009
opera	firefox
only major holdbacks are firefox on osx some linux opera android less than v4.4 works only if you format it a certain way

10220023
interbase	firebird
there can be side effects to quoting field names for example in firebird interbase quoting a field name will make it case sensitive while they are normally case insensitive

ant	maven
i have a build.gradle file which loads a href rel noreferrer pmd a downloading it from upstream maven and then loads an ant build.xml file which requires pmd

10220101
sudo	passwd
you could configure sudo to not prompt for a passwd

10220101
sudo	passwd
you could write an expect script to read the passwd and supply it to sudo when required but that s clunky and fragile

10220137
put	get
if i put values using into wolfram alpha i actually get the presumably correct output the example in the link is the input of var_z shown in the logs at the bottom of this question

10220156
post	put
does not make a difference whether i set the method to put or post the behavior is the same

10220200
sudo	passwd
just sudo to invoke your script in the first place it will prompt for the passwd once

10220223
google-chrome	firefox
tested in firefox google-chrome

10220253
comparator	comparable
we all know if we want a class to be comparable and use in sorting i.e datagrid we will implement comparator

10220257

so you use vk.api photos.getuploadserver ... to get the post url

10220280

that works fine but when i am trying to get a list of the latest blog post a user has created i get an error

10220281

udp	tcp
i have an in-house app not for iphone store distribution so not subject to apple approval which needs to keep a handful of tcp and udp sockets bound while it is running

10220343
oncreate	ondestroy
a better option is to use allocatehwnd to allocate a separate dedicated hwnd just for handling the hot key messages then you can use the oncreate and ondestroy events again eg

10220360
integer	unsigned
in aes.php at line 230 there is hex number 0x100000000 which is not valid signed 32-bit integer in fact it requires at least 33 bits even if unsigned some php versions will throw an error or notice about it older mostly

10220369
comparator	icomparer
many of the places where comparator can be used will also accept icomparer

10220380
next	except
giving the code a quick look i would guess that one of your controllers next or previous is nil and since you can t insert nil into an nsarray except as the last object it is throwing an error

10220383
children	parent
i need a parent div to automatically resize when it s children do

10220383
children	parent
if you add a height to the parent div the children show up but i d like it to auto size to the children

10220383
children	parent
it s because the children base their height on it s parent and when the parent doesn t have a height the children height is then 0

10220409
public	protected
but if you want form1 to be able to access members of class1 without exposing them as public members you can make them protected instead

10220414
width	height
to fix it you can set the gear width and height to 40px that s the size of the image anyway -- i don t see the need for it to be 100px x 100px and then re-position it accordingly

10220424
width	height
what you should do instead is call your rest service with a url that includes parameters to pass into the control such as and then reference them within the control using param.get height and param.get width

10220456
apache	nginx
in most cases a rewrite rule is used in apache or nginx or whatever webserver is being used so the url can be in the form

10220464
post	put
i m actually asking if i can put the parameters that are always the same somewhere else from fromname username password host post smtpsecure smtpauth

10220471
children	parent
if the parent is zero and the children are 60 height of the parent they would also be zero

10220490
google-chrome	firefox
this works in firefox but google-chrome won t animate them

10220502
median	max
for example if your reducer is doing just a sum or a max it respects both properties but something like mean or median does not and thus you can not use it as a combiner

10220508
rss	feed
then when i add content it shows on top of my flash and my rss feed

10220516

10220634
packets	pcap
i know pcap library can be used to capture packets for any protocol

10220645
shadowing	named
the problem is shadowing when you declare a variable inside a method with the same named as a member variable it shadows the member variable

10220656
bluetooth	usb
an alternative is star micronics sdk for android printing via usb ethernet and bluetooth

10220673
put	get
i would like my lcd to display voltage sensorvalue but right now the only way i can get the program to recognize the value as i turn the potentiometer is if i put it in a loop

10220725
folder	directory
for some reason i can t find the existing maven archetype that just zips up the source directory and puts it into the target folder

10220739
lzma	lzw
depending on whether you prefer fast and simple or high compression ratio you could take a look into the lempel-ziv-welch lzw or lempel-ziv-markov chain lzma algorithms

10220743
equals	icomparable
here is the overloaded equals method in the public class order icomparable

10220743
for-loop	arrays
in main i try to create the 2 arrays so i can compare 1 to the other and check for dups as i go through with a nested for-loop but it is not working

10220743
for-loop	arrays
it just continues filling the arrays as if it never saw the second for-loop

10220754
stateless	stateful
the stateless nature of web applications usually requires a totally different design than stateful desktop apps

10220763
int	chars
for example a platform needs int should be aligned with 4 so 0x12345 can be void or chars but if you assigned it to int crash happened

10220763
unsigned	short
you can cast the void pointer to unsigned char first then convert 2 unsigned chars to unsigned short

10220777
superclass	subclassing
you can use nscfconstantstring anywhere an nsstring could be used due to subclassing superclass relationship but obviously not the other way around

10220780
cfstring	nsstring
your nscfstring is just a toll-free bridged string that can be an nsstring or a cfstring

10220781
width	height
when i say size i mean width and height

10220781
width	height
if i set the image control height and width the images are distorted

10220801
for-loop	loops
notice how i added wronginput so that right after the second for-loop it throws back to the beginning of the outer loops

10220813
width	height
in your html you should specify the actual height and width of the file

10220813
width	height
if you truly want to make an image 300x250 then you ll need to use tools like the gimp photoshop or imagemagick to resize and or crop it to the desired height and width

10220815
width	height
try setting either width or height

10220837
width	height
while displaying image you check the height width and make them smaller only if it exceeds your desirable limits

10220837
width	height
for all approaches if images have smaller height width than the ones you want then you would just have to leave them as it is otherwise they will get distorted

10220857
gif	png
basic gif and png encoding

10220860
versioning	upgrade
i have upgrade my mysql versioning from mysql5.0 to mysql5.5

edit i also use google-chrome and often firefox and google-chrome work when ie fails

10220875
menhir	ocamlyacc
while you can also write your own parser using a tool like menhir or ocamlyacc to do it for you is a very versatile and quick solution compared to messing around with the yuckiness of dealing with non ll 1 things in a simple recursive descent parser

10220932
folder	directory
and of course as the image folder directory isn t included the image will not display

10220953
spaces	linefeed
those characters includes spaces and as called out explicitly in section 5 of 2368 cr and linefeed

10220974
fastboot	adb
the second one is when you connect your phone to the pc switch it to fastboot mode with adb reboot bootloader or switching off on and holding some buttons and then use fastboot to perform rom update magic

10220974
fastboot	adb
issue exec or system calls to run adb reboot bootloader and then fastboot flash commands then finally fastboot reboot

10220974
fastboot	adb
if you have done everything correctly catch and process the output of adb and fastboot to check the results your device will get reflashed and rebooted

10221007

please suggest any good solution to work in firefox google-chrome

10221311
int	chars
there is a newline chars at the end of each line and int is not happy

10221311
for-loop	loops
also python can loops over a string with an ordinary for-loop so you can get a 5-character slice and loops over it to multiply the five digits together

10221327
int	double
i am confused to as why the java point class takes in two int paramaters and the getx and gety methods return double

10221334
int	chars
the problem is you are trying to turn a new line chars n into an int

10221350

division	multiplication
when dealing with different types of operations such as multiplication and division with data by different types int float etc what decides which datatype that gets picked

10221437
put	get
i will get 0 as result since the 5 and the 10 are temporarily stored in an int where we do the division and then we put it in a float

10221442
post	get
what you want here is to join the tables and get those rows in post that would normally be excluded by the join

10221442
post	get
if you run this query and get the expected set of rows post that do not have likes or dislikes by that user then you can add an outer query to count the number of returned rows

10221442
post	get
2nd edit this inner query will get you those post that have either value 1 in the taxi table or no value at all which results in 4 being returned for your example

10221451
mouseover	mouseout
i also tied them together through mouseover and mouseout events so that mousing over or out of any element causes all elements in a set to change color simultaneously

10221503

haskell	ocaml
in ocaml which is somewhat similar to haskell i would do something like

10231291

packets	pcap
i think i am following you here as packets are sniffed you would like to have them all written to a single pcap file

10231549
packets	pcap
while you cannot append to a pcap you can append the packets to list and then write them all at once to the pcap

10231549
packets	pcap
in this example i set the threshold to create a new pcap for ever 500 packets sniffed

10231549
packets	pcap
this should give you a little bit of leverage however the last few packets may get lost lower the value in the if statement to mitigate this. suggest using it on both sides at the same time so each pcap should line up later on you can use mergepcap as mike suggests to if you like

10232869
hash	md5
first of all those actions should be followed by a password verification and second you should add a md5 hash signature verification to the end and verify that signature on the server.

10232869
hash	md5
also you should send the password in a one way hash format md5 or sha1 and verify the hash value with what you have in your web server database.

10232869
hash	md5
the md5signature should be the md5 hash value of all parameters id mail password and a secret password like mysecr3tpass

10232869
hash	md5
so if id 12 mail mymail mail.com and pass aerf124f the signature would be the md5 hash of 12mymail mail.comaerf124fmysecr3tpass which would be 0b9492395c9c1a73a6622cab5a6a4de5

10232869
hash	md5
so in your php script you sould calculate the md5 hash of all parameters + the secret passphrase and see if those match

10232889

min	max
to sort out your problem you must first set the min and max dates for the date axis axis x

10233111
min	max
apparently only when the min and max values are set the renderer will use the value of tickinterval

10233111
min	max
as it appears the setting of min max and tickinterval is not enough as the values are still not every 3 months as each tick shows 30th day and it should sometimes be 31

10233111
min	max
in this case you do not need min max and tickinterval any more

ant	maven
in maven you can define a.k.a testing.staging live etc which allow you to configure settings for different environments.all you need to specify maven about the environment for which you want the things to move and maven is capable enough to take care of this.though this can be done with ant also but i believe that maven provides more flexibility

10236078
width	height
ok i am starting with an assumption that you did not write the class keyword with box and also omitted width height and depth declarations just to save typing

10236080
client-side	server-side
use a mobile browser detection either server-side or client-side

10236100
width	height
how about assigning a width and height to which is holding the in your code

10236111
inherited	subclassing
that s part of the point of inherited -- any code that uses test2 is only allowed to assume that it s a testparent or a subclassing of testparent and that code has to work for all testparent objects even the ones that aren t testbaby objects

10236147
udp	tcp
this is just a guess but the problem might be because you re using udp instead of say tcp

10236184
hide	show
when they click no i have a show hide that hide the div that contains the address but the form will never submit because the field even though it s hidden it s still required

10236198
client-side	server-side
strangely enough the validation works fine for server-side validation but client-side unobtrusive validation fails with an js error because js can t find the object with a name of just dontuse

10236280
google-chrome	firefox
i have a portlet application that works flawlessly in firefox and google-chrome but is bombing out in ie 8 and 9 but only if i have 5 or more instances of the portlet on the portal page

10236391
ember.js	sproutcore
the blog post is from the sproutcore days but core concept is still the same in ember.js

10236425
margin	height
the first would be to increase the height of the table cell just that particular table cell not all of the cells in your table so that the whitespace margin at the top and bottom of your segmented control is equal to the margin you currently have on the left and right of the control

10236442
children	parent
your parent proceses will handle the load balancing between children

10236451
hash	md5
add the -v option to the keytool parameter set and you ll get an md5 hash too

10236458
children	parent
however if you spawn children tasks after calling .getcurrentsession and before calling .commit you may run in to issues because other tasks may execute on this thread and .getcurrentsession would return the session used by the parent task

10236458
children	parent
this is almost certainly not what you want because the children tasks should presumably be doing the same thing as each other and you wouldn t want one arbitrarily sharing session state with the parent while others don t

10236477
post	get
however when i deploy the application to the webserver on 123reg httpverbs other than get and post appear to not reach my application at all initially a 401 not authorised response was returned

getter	setter
and you can also make gender a class scope variable so that you can access it with a setter getter

10236606
stdout	fflush	fflush	gets
but when i call it from an os.system or os.popen call in a python script on the same input file the output file the minified version of the js file gets truncated as though stdout were not getting fflush before the subprocess exits or as if jsmin were terminating early or as if maybe something were going on with disk buffering or something

10236606
stdout	fflush
the exit value is whatever i return from main even when the output is getting truncated and adding a call to fflush stdout doesn t make any difference and calling sync from within the same subshell after calling jsmin doesn t make any difference

10236606
put	get
i have put jsmin in the path and it is running i get most of the expected results in the .min file.

in my app i need to allow users to do calculations such as add subtract divide values from rows in different tables

10236782
multiplying	add
you d create 10 vdsp_deq22 filters run your audio through each one multiplying that band by a specified gain and then add up the output of all the filters in the filter bank into your output audio

10236809
backgrounding	multitasking
quiescence how busy is the cpu multitasking other things in the backgrounding

10236824
hash	salt
you should salt your passwords and hash using a decent hashing algorithm

10236847
post	get
the strange behavior is that i get duplicate post on the server and according to my appstats page i use 10x-20x more urlfetches than what was added with the code above

10236848
subtract	add
ok i have angle l currently 0 i add 45 or any angle and subtract 45 or any angle to get a and b my view angle

10236863
for-loop	loops
within this function a parent object is declared and a for-loop loops through the passed argument s length in this case keyarr creates new objects according the length of the passed argument

10236863
children	parent
the issue is that i am able to create the parent object mobj and children objects to mobj but am only able to assgin keys and values to the first child object obj0 not rest of the children objects correctly

10236869
memcached	apc
you can save data between requests using userland shared memory extensions for example apc xcache memcached etc

portrait	landscape
when i first visit the page either in portrait or landscape - it looks fine

10236920
portrait	landscape
when i go from portrait to landscape the viewport is wider than the 590px and vice versa

10236923
inherited	properties
edit if you instead want to change the label of the radiobutton control you can use the labelattributes properties inherited from checkbox

10236954

it s highly recommended to use dbms specific escape function mysqli_real_escape_string for mysql or pg_escape_string for postgresql

10236989
for-loop	arrays
the timestamp arrays goes undefined once it leaves the for-loop before it even leaves the function

i have carried out memcpy tests of a 16mb data block for the different sizes of reserved ram resmem_length on ubuntu 10.04.4 linux 2.6.32 on a supermicro 1026gt-tf-fm109

10237021
memcpy	malloc
from the first to the second run memcpy from mmap ed to malloc ed seems to benefit that the contents might already be cached somewhere

10237023
tabs	tabpanel
i have an existing intranet webapp solely internal built with extjs using an iframe architecture it has a top menu and a tabpanel on an index page and about 30 other separate webpages that open as iframes tabs inside the main tabpanel

10237037
google-chrome	firefox
i m seeing it in google-chrome and i haven t really checked if it also happens in ie and firefox

10237074
for-loop	arrays
for a quick and easy fix consider serializing the length of the arrays as an integer before serializing the children use a for-loop or similar construct to read the values - or serializing the arraylist itself

10237119
hide	show
i have a javascript function that takes in the element id and hide or show the table

10237136
fadein	fadeout
i have tried fadetoggle fadein and fadeout

10237164
integer	unsigned
if you want the compiler to guarantee that your integer values always take up 32 bits of ram and will always wrap around at 2 31 or 2 32 for unsigned no matter what platform you re compiling on go with int32_t etc

10237164
int	chars
i think the chars short int long approach was more useful back in the early days of c when computer architecture was more varied and cpus were slow enough that achieving full native performance was more important than safe coding

10237168
pop-up	dialog
here is my code to pop-up the dialog

10237168

oddly when i first pop-up the dialog i have to push a button on the dialog to load the form fields which works fine and loads the fields

i uploaded my rails app to heroku and would like to run it with thin instead of webrick

10237219
many-to-many	one-to-many

10237220
put	get
now it works completely fine except for some unknown reason if i put it the month of november or the month of march as the arguments i get an array of one day less

10237243

among other things it pulls in the config and attempts to schedule the upcoming cron jobs

10237469
min	rank
so the size of a b is m -by- n and rank a b is min m rank b

10237469
rank	max
if you want to search for a certain rank on b randomly you need to start off with a valid b with max rank and rotate a random column j of a random b i by a random amount

10237543
serializable	deserialization
i have yet to see any generic solution that will properly handle serializable and deserialization of any object no matter how complex if someone has one of these please post it here it would be useful to a lot of folks

10237544
getter	setter
the problem is that i have an animation timeline essentially scalar values at particular frames and the output of this needs to be piped to and from getter setter methods within the objects to be animated

10237544
getter	setter
the timeline only holds floats so whatever scalar type the object uses for it s getter setter methods must be cast i have a partial specialisation for floats that does away with the cast

10237544
getter	setter
objtype is the animated object type getter and setter are pointers-to-methods and scalar is the type getter and setter and expected to deal with

10237544
getter	setter
i thought this would be fine but compilation failed because some of the getter setter had other default-initialised arguments

10237544
getter	setter
i have also been looking at std function and std bind i was hoping to be able to store a std function as a member with the getter setter method s default args preset - and change the appropriate arg for one from the timeline just before calling

10237550
mdpi	hdpi
i put icons 72x72 in hdpi 48x48 in mdpi and 36x36 in ldpi

10237643
post	get
it s a restful api which can be called using get or post for example and the output is json which is easy to parse in pretty much every common language platform

10237668

10237682
focuslistener	listeners
try looking at focuslistener and windowfocuslistener to implement the listeners for either the swing components themselves or the jframe

10237688
width	margin
i did it by just calculating how much of a margin there was between the difference of body width - image width divided by 2 for the left margin

10237704
nsstring	nsdata
this is written in obj-c and allows for aes128 encryption of nsstring and nsdata

10237736
minimum	max
considering that sub lists can have different size get the minimum size or depending on need make it max

10237777
eigenvalue	diagonal
in addition solveh_banded will crash if i have too large a dynamic range of all positive values along the main diagonal even though this should not be an actual problem i m guessing that roundoff makes the smallest values seem effectively negative so it s seen as having negative eigenvalue and there s some chance a tridiagonal-specific routine would not hit this issue

10237790
public	protected
these variables are then used directly without a protected or public getter

10237803
uninstall	upgrade
major upgrade is not an option since we dont want to uninstall thrid party system dlls

10237855
getter	setter
will just use as your getter as your setter if the scalar s are implicitly convertible to from float s i d even use and resp.

10237855
getter	setter
there could be only one function that could serve both as a getter and a setter

10237887
serializable	deserialization
how would one deserialize an object serializable based on the first version with the deserialization constructor of the second

10237896
ubuntu	linux
it works well on my windows desktop but has memory leak on the linux ubuntu

10237896
ubuntu	linux
linux ubuntu 8g mem installed as virtual machine

10237907
getter	setter
okay below is a full activity file to demostrate this and has been tested with version 2.1...the only thing you need to change is the package name to match your project...note that this changes the variables in savedata to package from private if you want to keep them private which you probably should you need to implement setter getter but the below code should help you understand saving loading objects.

10237953
src	attr
as result only the first image cloned on its src attr has at the end of the base64 string something like a get parameter like this src ...fhff z

10238010

subtract	add
so how would you find the shortest amount of degrees between two other degrees and then if you should go clockwise or counterclockwise add or subtract to get there

10238094

10238246
background-position	background-size
use background-position and background-size properties instead

10238248
put	get
given your current predicament all you can do to get it to work imediatly is put a try catch around the new fields and then default them if they are not there

10238250
children	parent
that s why the parent property of the children doesn t get set

i have been using google to search for a way to get rid of them but have pretty much come up empty handed on what they mean much less how to fix them since every post i found with them has a compilation error and the warnings them selves aren t addressed

there is a definepropery method that will essentially allow you to create accessor methods getter setter on objects without the need to invoke a function call like setprop getprop

10238360

preorder	postorder	preorder	inorder	postorder	inorder
this article seems to indicate that for bt s a single inorder preorder and postorder traversal will not uniquely identify a tree uniquely means structure and values of keys in this context

10238435
preorder	postorder	preorder	inorder	postorder	inorder
we can uniquely reconstruct a bt with preorder + inorder and postorder + inorder

10238435
preorder	postorder
we can also use preorder + postorder if we also stipulate that the traversals keeps track of the null children of a node

10238435
preorder	postorder	preorder	inorder	postorder	inorder
we need inorder + preorder or inorder + postorder

10238456

i have previously asked questions about preventing users from deleting certain key files folder in their home directory by doing something like so

10238758
integer	radix
this means get the margin-left style parse it to the integer value with radix 10 multiply it by 2.5 and then return the value to the element

10238762
filtering	grouping
what is see is whenever i add a contextual filtering the query contains a line similar to where og_node.gid xx and the value there is the value of the grouping node entity id and not the gid

10238762
filtering	grouping
i have set the default value on the contextual filtering to current og grouping from context and i have set the validation criteria to validate on the content - grouping content type and node id

i tried hiding the background and showing the modal but then when i hide the modal and show the background it scrolls the page all the way back up again

10238857
shadowing	named
you ve used the same generic parameter named for the inner class so the type e of the inner class is shadowing the e of the outer class

10238879
getter	setter
my arraycollection instance variable was created by getter setter functions

10238879
getter	setter
i found xmldecoder.getexistingvalue uses describetype and does account for getter setter aka accessor

10238885
pop-up	dialog
the error will only occur when you try to interact with the sdk for example trying to execute the fb.login method will open the auth dialog pop-up which will show the following error message

10238924
width	height
set the transparent property to true set the transparentcolor property to a unique color that does not appear anywhere else in your form clfuchsia is commonly used draw your desired shape and bordering onto a tbitmap that is the same width and height as the form and has its background filled with the form s tranparentcolor and then you can draw the tbitmap onto the form s canvas in the onpaint event or alternatively put the tbitmap onto a client-align timage so you don t have to draw the form manually

10238942
post	get
i get an empty result as well and also if i try to search in the facebook search box and then select public post i get no results found for your query

to make changes in the future do your work on a development copy push that into the repository and pull down the changes on the server

10238963
apache	nginx
passenger will take care of launching your application when calls are made to the site you ve configured in apache or nginx depending on which you end up using

10239003
post	get
the default method for an ajax call in rails is get so if you want to do a post you need to include this with

10239015
sorting	grouping	sorting	filtering	filtering	grouping
the listcollectionview creates another layer between your source and display which handles sorting filtering and grouping

10239036
apache	nginx
for example if you run pyramid behind a reverse proxy with nginx or apache or something else

10239036
apache	nginx
this is a file like object that receives chunk of data from nginx or apache for example

10239040
width	height
my question essentially boils down to the best way to support dynamic height of uilabel s and i suppose other elements in a uitablecell and also correctly resize the label width height and cell height when rotating

10239040
width	height
autoresizing masks for the width of labels seem to be useless in this use case and in fact cause issues with the calculated height on rotation

10239040
width	height
in heightforrowatindexpath i calculate the cell height using the tableview width and the percentage i already grabbed

10239040
portrait	landscape
if your label s width isn t an equal percentage in portrait and landscape you ll need to know both percentages

10239048
hide	show
specifically i am trying to create a checklist for the user to hide or show items on the canvas when the checkbox is selected or deselected

10239083
fadein	hide
i do this by setting the z-index of the photo layers behind the background image i can t hide because i need them to load and be ready to display and have jquery change the z-index on click then fadein

10239144
width	height
i m trying to set the width and height of a listpopupwindow with no luck

10239185

i am not sure why you apply show and hide but this might be what you want

10239197
capitalization	uppercase
while doing that i fixed the capitalization so names aren t all uppercase and renamed a few countries to the name that is used on wikipedia so macedonia the former yugoslav republic of became macedonia for example

10239214
subobject	instances
auth_profile_module would then simply reference that single userprofile but its instances can then use the .content_object to get the specific subobject

10239242
uitableview	reloaddata
upon reading all the assets into an array i populate my uitableview mytable reloaddata to show the photos

10239292

i m now facing such kind of issue in the previous versioning of xcode it works fine but when i upgrade to 4.3.2 distribution profile missed tried many ways but all failed

10239304
versioning	upgrade
suggest to not upgrade to latest xcode versioning i will pending until facing blocking next time my product has been delayed because of this issue what a pity

however when i enter to the secure part of the site i get ssl errors because the images in the menu are being loaded via http rather than https

10239344
int	chars
alternatively if you want the ascii int values for the chars

10239376
antialiasing	transparent
in most situations it would probably be hard to tell the difference between a transparent 512px icon masked at a 90px radius and one masked at 89.825 but the antialiasing of the rounded corner would definitely end up slightly different and would likely be visible in certain circumstances especially if a second more precise mask is applied by apple in code or otherwise

10239492
children	parent
you may need a parent pointer for the children

10239520
uiview	subviews
i have a uiview with a shadow and a uiimageview subviews

10239558
submit	submission
you can either call submit to do the submission or use ajax

10239568
children	parent
notice that it could be as simple as just storing the parent if we don t need to keep the children of a node ordered

10239568
rational-numbers	fractions
the idea behind nested intervals is that there s an infinite number of rational-numbers between any two integers so you could store the new node as a fractions of its previous and next nodes

10239568
children	parent
django-mptt actually uses a mix of nested sets and adjacency lists since it also keeps a link to the parent and can use it to both query children more efficiently and to rebuild the tree in case it gets messed up by someone

10239610
stdout	stderr
in unix shell scripting it is possible to redirect the stderr and stdout from the within script itself as below

10239652
submit	submission
this issue happens because the page unloads submit the form before the geolocator s done doing its thing but this way we stop the form from submission and itsworking only gets called after the geolocator has done its thing so we don t submit the form until the end of itsworking when we ve done everything we wanted to do

i m having problems in my script that when i have an iframe w div set to 200x200px my fancybox size should be 200x200 tried to remove the default width and height on the .js itself but still nothing happens any suggestions would be appreciated

10239701
width	height
note that ive remove the default width and height on the fancybox.js wishing that it would copy the width and height ive set on my iframe

10239705
implements	extends
cglib provides support for proxying classes because it can dynamically generate bytecode class files meaning it can extends classes at runtime in a way that java s proxy can implements an interface at runtime

10239783
for-loop	loops
for such scenarios you cant use for-loop or any other loops since it gets executed with in seconds and the points will move in seconds so cant observe the movement

10239821
hide	show
the remaining task is to programmatically show and hide the markers infowindows on mouseover of a list of addresses which i display beside the map

10239824
floating-point	integer
apart from the value being negative the string -9.4351e+0.007 is not a valid number as the exponent part of a floating-point constant can be only an integer

10239830
children	parent
what xml markup do i need to promote the children of home as the parent level menus

10239839
children	parent
these child processes can do the work in smaller chunks in their own memory space while the parent process fires off multiple children

10239890
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this works every time with firefox google-chrome safari

10239903
google-chrome	firefox
it seems this is not yet implemented in firefox but should be working on google-chrome

10239910
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
all s fine in ie google-chrome firefox safari

10239925
typedef	struct
in fact on a project where we needed to write code that runs on five platforms with different compilers we made it a companywide coding standard requirement to have the forward declaration separate from the struct s typedef

10239952
mouse	keyboard
use something like ahk auto hotkey it is a simple language that can be compiled to an exe and is designed for automating the keyboard and mouse

10240005
width	height
well i have made it working by getting screen height and width

10240005
width	height
if width is less than height just discarding it and if above allowing it

10240008
wordpress	vbulletin
or the code is exsist from vbulletin like function on wordpress wp_create_user

10240013
firefox	safari
this technically does sorta that but in firefox it triggers when you click to open and when you click to close which you can actually do in one click which produces the exact same thing in safari and firefox

10240058
hide	show
maybe even hide that textareas and show divs with actual rendered content and catch clicks on them

10240078
folder	directory
its much clearer to me on the unix side that you can pull a project into a local folder but its not at all clear how the typical directory structure of a vs project is supposed to be affected by subversion

10240094
puts	gets
what i m trying to do is to have it also log all my puts as well as my sql queries like it does in development mode except it still gets logged to log delayed_job.log

10240138
for-loop	loops
i want to automate the process -- to run a for-loop that loops through a portion of the elements in the table and outputs their fit parameters

10240158
post	get
post get is out because to my knowledge the user would have to do something to submit it and the user s not even going to see the page

10240163
restrict	shared
semaphores are used to control restrict the access to a shared resource lets say a global variable from multiple threads

10240205
google-chrome	firefox
however it only works in firefox not in google-chrome

10240206
width	height
then i use the updated label width to determine the height of my labels and add any necessary cell padding to calculate my cell height

10240210
mouse	keyboard
you can bind arbitrary events mouse keyboard window manager and possibly others to any widget in tkinter

10240236
width	height
i found that adjusting the width and height of the input element does not make the microphone larger

10240244
width	height
presumably one of the dimensions either width or height will be exactly the dimension called for in your thumbnail call

10240244
width	height
you can determine which one by comparing the ratios of thumbw width and thumbh height the smaller of the two will be used

10240244
width	height
the thumbnail dimensions are nominally width ratio and height ratio

10240284
post	put
now my thought is put the div which displays the blog post within a slider then we can display subsequent post as each div refreshes

10240285
textview	imageview
but you should change textview to an imageview and then perform zoom operations

10240285
textview	imageview
here is the link to convert textview to imageview converting a textview- bitmap- imageview and nothing #39

10240287
draggable	droppable
when i drop the draggable it changes the position of the div droppable on the page

10240472
installation	upgrade
of this project and it will upgrade existing installation

10240474
ant	maven
based on the details you have given in the question the right direction as far as i can see to solve this kind of use scenario build multiple applications from single source base is to adopt external build tools like ant or maven dominate build process both provide the ability to fine-control on every single step compile dex package and etc

10240474
ant	maven
i am not a fun of phonegap but have a quick look through its get started guide base on my understanding it is just another programming layer stack on top of android sdk to provide ability to write mobile app by mainly using web programming language html css javascript the application still keep the original project skeleton so i would not expect much trouble to write ant maven script to build the phonegap app

10240493
integer	unsigned
the problem is that comparison between signed and unsigned values are machine dependent because they depend on the sizes of the various integer types

10240565
post	get
this does not include get or post parameters or the domain name

10240577
typedef	struct
near as i can tell this compiles with c because in c struct names and typedef names are in different namespaces but it does not compile with c++ evidently because typedef and struct names are in the same namespace

10240601
udp	tcp
i need to establish two channels between client and server first is a udp channel for data transmission and second is tcp channel for sending key and iv for aes-128 in udp channel

10240601
udp	tcp
server needs to be able to connect to multiple clients the tcp and udp socket are used in select as follows

10240601
udp	tcp
when the server receives the data in udp socket the server decrypts it using the key and iv received using tcp connection

10240601
udp	tcp
when i don t use my tcp socket in select and use it outside before select to accept connection get key iv from just one client the code for accepting connection and receiving key iv from client is exactly the same as when used inside select and in select just use udp socket to send receive data

10240638
addition	multiplication
most operators include this usual arithmetic conversions step before the actual operation addition multiplication comparison etc etc

10240638
integer	unsigned
otherwise if both operands have signed integer types or both have unsigned

10240638
integer	unsigned
otherwise if the operand that has unsigned integer type has rank greater or

10240638
integer	unsigned
signed integer type is converted to the type of the operand with unsigned

10240638
integer	unsigned
all of the values of the type of the operand with unsigned integer type then

10240638
integer	unsigned
the operand with unsigned integer type is converted to the type of the

10240638
integer	unsigned
otherwise both operands are converted to the unsigned integer type

10240675
width	height
frankly i just wish i could say autoresize height based upon the label s font and width and text but that just doesn t exist. still i agree with you that it s weird that it doesn t work better

10240675
portrait	landscape
but isn t didrotatefrominterfaceorientation too late because i m seeing my portrait uilabels flash up right after it goes to landscape but before the landscape redrawing invoked here takes place

10240680
gif	png
for example gif jpg png txt html pdf

10240704
google-chrome	firefox
i m a little confused when i try to bind a function to an event like click in ie7 ie9 google-chrome 18 firefox 12 it s work great but when i try to remove the associated function to the event only ie7 and firefox are capable of dis-attach the function

10240705
serializable	deserialization
if you need something more custom than this you can use custom serializable and deserialization

10240705
serializable	deserialization
custom serializable and deserialization

10240731
google-chrome	firefox
all this doesn t work in google-chrome only work in firefox

add relative position to the .box and add absolute to .dropbox and then make .dropbox explicitly fill .box with width and height

10240748
apk	dex
the jar files and the class files are never needed .your code when converted to apk is not converted into different classes and jars but apks.if open you see apk file they are just zip files you will see no jars and classes .they are converted to dex files

10240804
uidatepicker	uipickerview
with built in uidatepicker you cannot do that.you will have to create uipickerview with specific dates you want

10240817
pull	push
i currently the only way to route such messages to the appropriate client is through pub sub however a i want to decide how to route at runtime by sending a routingto tag along with the message body b i want to use push pull to forward to clients not pub sub because i want to implement blocking functionality when setting the high water mark property c i want to have c1 and c2 connect on exactly 1 port for pushing and 1 port for subscribing

10240817
pull	push
after running below code push pull - pub sub and sent all messages and have received confirmation that all messages were received the client that pushed messages out still displays a huge memory footprint apparently there are still huge amounts of messages in the push socket s queue

10240865
folder	directory
i want to keep them the way they are not move them into separate folder but then when i am in that directory and tell it to commit how will it know which repository i am talking about

why use an unsecure hash like md5 to digest the information instead of using sha-1 or sha-2

10241034
onresume	onpause
make use of onpause onresume to pause resume games

10241043
postgresql	mysql
mysql postgresql sqlite are all opensource

10241097
int	chars
i think vb does t support typecasting from string to int by chars values

10241097
int	chars
use val mid url k 1 to convert chars to int and do shifts and other math operations on it

10241129
g++	gcc
you need to specify the library on the gcc g++ command line after the files that depend on the library

10241143
google-chrome	safari
it works great in google-chrome and safari

10241143
opera	firefox
the issue is that in firefox opera the #tagboxleft and #tagboxright sides sections refuse to accept height 100

10241143
opera	firefox
i ve got a jsfiddle demo that works in both firefox opera so i know it s possible but why does all my content overflow in firefox and opera

10241147
portrait	landscape
i don t know how this happens but when i take image from camera in portrait mode and upload to server it is displaying fine but when i take the same image from photo library and upload to server it is displaying in landscape mode

10241154
width	margin
i think typically it should have flexible left margin flexible width and also flexible right margin

10241192
portrait	landscape
the cell should appear at the bottom in landscape as well as portrait modes

10241212

10241226
google-chrome	firefox
your code works in my example in ie8 firefox and google-chrome the event will be removed after five seconds

10241244
width	height
the idea was to do cropping letter-boxing for the background according to the canvas s width height and maintain the correct ratio of size for the smaller images

10241275
opera	firefox
the fact is that firefox and opera do not support mp3 files in html5 audio tag

10241286
post	put	post	get	put	get
the way datanucleus rest api works is that in your application you send receive http get s post s of the form shown here and these are translated into jdo calls to put retrieve your data into from the datastore

10241323
put	get
i suspect you just want to get the raw data out of the database and put that into the byte array

10241354
wxpython	pygtk
py2exe can freeze standalone programs that use the tkinter pmw wxpython and pygtk gui libraties

10241354
cpython	pypy
other systems of study that are working on future development pyrex is working on the cpython system the parrot project the pypy is working on replacing the pvm altogether and of course the founder of python is working with google to get python to run 5 times faster than c with the unladen swallow project

mp3	flv
flv is a container format and can support several different video formats such as h.264 and audio formats such as aac and mp3

10241577
mp4	h.264
the mp4 container can also support h.264 and aac so if your input uses these formats then you can simply copy and paste the video and audio from the mp4 to the flv

10241611
superclass	subclassing
then create 2 subclassing from upper superclass

10241626
min	max
during some operation in the application min value and max value get assigned to the date field

10241626
min	max
the min value and max value are 4 years prior to the current dat but when the date picker opens up it opens to the disabled current dates

10241626
min	max
anyways i can update the datepicker to open up by showing the date between the min value and max value

10241626
min	max
this sets the min and max value

10241639
ready	each
it is easy to get a worker to pop a single job off of the queue when it is ready but i would like to have each worker run 5 threads such that when all 5 threads are processing that worker does not pop any jobs off the queue

10241654
extjs	mootools
apart from that you can try mootools extjs very nice components but requires a bit learning and yui definite learning required for me

my solution was bitmap.createscaledbitmap b1 width height true

10242017
getter	setter
excuse the lack of setter getter etc

10242045
serializable	deserialization
note it is strongly recommended that all serializable classes explicitly declare serialversionuid values since the default serialversionuid computation is highly sensitive to class details that may vary depending on compiler implementations and can thus result in unexpected serialversionuid conflicts during deserialization causing deserialization to fail

10242048
width	height
the width and the height are the sizes of the square in the big picture

10242057
for-loop	loops
the reason for loops is a for-loop in the last line of the following section of the inputrendercallback function

freebsd	linux
i was curious what kind of buffer sizes write and read could handle on linux osx freebsd so i started playing around with dumb programs like the following

10242370
freebsd	linux
this is the same on osx and linux however my freebsd vm is not only much faster at running this test it also can go on for quite a ways

10242370

in the configuration properties under cuda c c++- device you have already set the code generation to compute_20 sm_20 although you should probably set sm_21 if your gpu has capability 2.1 but you should also ensure that you untick the inherited from parent or project defaults

10244118
inherited	properties
then check that the properties for the file in question have not overriden the project settings basically repeat the above but this time the inherited from parent or project defaults should be checked and there should be no additional entries

see also wikipedia for the mp4 file format h.264 video compression format and other parts of mpeg4

10251069
for-loop	loops
but i have a question let s say we have a for-loop and we want to use a variable inside the body of that loops

10251100
equals	tostring
this way you generate the tostring hashcode equals readobject writeobject and possibly their builder classes as well from a single definition

10251198
interbase	firebird
we have used interbase firebird for many years and have adopted the password hashing from the interbase security database as a convenient standard for some non-critical encryption uses

10251237
jlist	jtable
i think that you have to read tutorial how to use lists especially part writing a custom cell renderer concept of renderer is the same for jlist jtable or for jcombobox too

10251263
apache	lighttpd
for practical reason i use xampp for php projects because xampp runs on both windows and linux so the only thing i need to do is a simple folder installation then a simple lighttpd apache configuration and that s it

10251290
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
when i call then evaluates to true whereby parentviewcontroller is the uiviewcontroller that presented the modal view note not a uinavigationcontroller

10251317
x86	64bit
note that the x86 in windows means 32-bit or just edit your project and pick a 64bit jvm

10251349
width	margin
remember if you assign a 50 of width for one block the one to its right must have about a 48 of width because you gotta include the margin s and padding s that s why sometimes when you have a div of 1000px and you assing 500px for a child and 500px for the other child the second one is below of the first one

10251354
width	border-box	box-sizing	border-box
they are able to use 50 width while still specifying some horizontal padding by applying box-sizing border-box

10251387
put	get
when i call the fnreloadajax i put the get parameters in the first function argument like this

10251401
post	get
and whenever there is a query into the website database i post into the site and get the contents loaded html code into textview and webview as seen in demo app pic below

10251401
post	get
i know i can use json and php scripts to post and get results but the thing is i don t have access to the webpage or the server

10251426
apache	nginx
i would prefer this approach for web - when you just return an url and it s handled by browser and apache nginx so you don t have to worry about streaming at all

10251435
implements	extends
yes depending on what you want to achieve you can override the method ontouchevent on your class that extends view or implements a touchlistener to your object

10251503
google-chrome	safari
alternatively i could use the -webkit-scrollbar pseudo elements css offers but that ll only work in google-chrome safari and other webkit browsers right

10251529
stdout	stderr
you can use the and parameters to subprocess.call to direct stdout or stderr to a file descriptor of your choice

10251555
google-chrome	firefox
the problem occurs on firefox working fine on google-chrome and on ie

10251573
quicksort	mergesort
what i noticed was that some of the implementations used a tuned quicksort while others used a modified mergesort

10251650
folder	directory
first go to the directory where you have set up a folder to put all the files of your app from command line using dos commands

10251681
quicksort	mergesort
quicksort is used for arrays of primitive types while mergesort for object arrays

10251681
quicksort	mergesort
hence quicksort is used except when sorting an array of objects for which mergesort is performed

10251713
post	get
is there a way for me to get unduplicated authors at the first level and then be able to iterate through associated post and their comments

10251722
put	get
just put your data in the text box don t write it somewhere else then try to get it back and put it where you want it

10251735
children	parent
it seems as though you have a foreign key constraint defined which enforces referential integrity and prohibits you from deleting a parent row if children exist

10251740
getter	setter
it you don t want that you ll need getter and setter for the values

10251743
put	get
however in order to provide some convenience to the user i am allowing this form to get loaded with data prepopulated - the main form will instantiate this form with the data to put into the textbox and this btnfetch_click handler will get called from the constructor

10251787
hide	show
another option is to use javascript to show hide the proper elements

10251813
for-loop	arrays
if response.d is an arrays you could place it in a for-loop like so

10251814
mouseleave	mouseenter
there is obviously a label inside it for the text and when i click on the label it obviously doesn t trigger the buttons click event or mouseenter or mouseleave

10251830
jar	war
after resolving obvious code jar path errors i then check if i can export a war file correctly

10251844
equals	gethashcode
when you override equals don t forget to override gethashcode as well - these must be overriden together

10251875
post	put
however if i put this customized control into an update panel and click on this button after post back the update panel will change the button s render to only have tag and delete tab outside the which could potentially change my css selector

10251960
post	put	post	get	put	get
currently my app can handle http requests allowing users to retrieve contact information through get requests or add edit contacts through put post requests the requests have an xml body

10251964
hash	salt
what you can do is once you have received the imei from the user you can apply an algorithm on it you can for example shuffle the string and add some salt on it and them generate a hash of it

10251992
onresume	onpause
i have also notice that onpause onstop onresume are never being called

10252030
int	double
there are a number of cases where func eval is unavailable yet people still expect to see a display for primitive types like double int etc .

10252036
onresume	onpause
the home button does not kill the application it should call onpause when hit and onresume when you come back to the app afterwards

10252045
min	max
you can use the max-height property rather than height but it won t work in ie6 which doesn t respect any min max properties

10252049
verilog	vhdl
i have a top level verilog module that instantiates a vhdl block with a few outputs that are records

10252085
post	put	post	get	put	get
to send get post put delete request the user must send his request using curl

10252201
free	malloc
11614 address 0x0 is not stack d malloc d or recently free d

10252225
strdup	malloc
the strdup function calls malloc internally and then copies the source string into the target

10252256
int	boolean
in c++ int can be treated as boolean and you got no errors at compile time

10252292
contour	imshow
in case anyone comes across this article looking for what i was looking for i took the above example and modified it to use imshow with an input stack of frames instead of generating and using contour on the fly

10252293
jruby	mri
i have read that jruby is roughly equal on speed with mri

10252302
mousehover	mouseleave
third since label s doesnt have flatappearance property you have to set it manually by hooking the mousehover and mouseleave events of the label and set the colour u want

10252302
mousehover	mouseleave
fourth you should also hook the button mousehover and mouseleave events to set the label the required color too

10252321
width	margin
if i had a set number of links this would probably be a lot easier as i could create a parent with a fixed width and use margin 0 auto

10252364
client-side	server-side
what regular expression would i use for this in asp.net page and also would the asp.net regex validator automatically validate on server-side using the client-side regular expression or i would need to write server-side validation code

10252369
rtp	rtmp	rtp	rtsp	rtsp	rtmp
you could perform the necessary fixups here to transmute rtp rtsp into rtmp but as mentioned such effort is currently outside the development scope of your application

10252372
post	put	post	get	put	get
rest does not force you to use get post put and delete

10252432
subtract	add
one way to speed up a little bit is that when you slide the c c window you don t re-compute everything but only subtract the ones that are moving out of the window and add the ones that are moving in to the window

10252437
uiview	subviews
i had a similar problem-- a rotated uiview with several uiimageview subviews

10252437
uiview	subviews
to fix this i created a containerview that held the uiview and uiimageview s which were previously subviews of the uiview and applied to the uiview and to the uiimageview s

10252476
google-chrome	firefox
this happens in firefox google-chrome and ie

10252511
int	boolean
for a recent project i felt the need to move away from .ini for our default settings file - so that we no longer had to convert some strings to int or boolean afterwards since parse_ini_file parses values as strings or are both string values

10252525
jar	war
how you get the jar files that you exclude from the war into the web container s classpath depends on your environment

10252544
mathml	mathjax
on mathjax the op asked for wysiwyg and i d argue that being able to quickly write out a math expression in ascii latex or mathml and have it directly interpreted by a one-line script included on a page provides as much or more immediate accessibility and feedback than a gui interface

10252589
min	max
if you are handling things at the level of mean count sum deviance min max of a population there s a variety of tools that can handle what you want

10252592
integer	radix
you have to convert it to integer using parseint string radix

10252732
post	get
i m assuming you meant to use get not post

10252748
google-chrome	firefox
this produces a origin null is not allowed by access-control-allow-origin. error and does not get a response from the server for google-chrome or firefox i don t care about ie since this is a small project for my use

10252748
google-chrome	firefox
when i try as a jsonp google-chrome firefox doesn t produce this error shows a unexpected syntax error unexpected token

10252748
google-chrome	firefox
i ve tried this in google-chrome and firefox and looked at dev tools firebug for each and seen the same thing though firefox doesn t produce the origin error but that s apparently a bug with google-chrome anyway

10252758
maven	pom.xml
we usually add a task to our maven project pom.xml files so that findbugs is ran every time our code is compiled

10252760
post	get
i say you re using get despite your form tag indicating post because of your follow up result.php

10252778
serializable	deserialization
and then i try to read it out expecting the serializable deserialization will restore my object.

it works fine in ie and firefox but not google-chrome or any webkit browser or safari

10252871
put	get
get an at t 3g microcell and put a packet sniffer on its ethernet connection

10252885
width	height
what is the best way to scale attributes like text size width and height via styles

10252885
width	height
then in order to change the height of a view all one would have to do is create a new folder with the target min width and edit the values of layout_vals.xml and leave all the extraneous junk about width gravity background etc alone leaving for a much cleaner setup and easier editing

10252886
x86	64bit
platform string x86 or x64 for 32-bit or 64bit compilation mode respectively

i myself actually want to mount my ext4 sd card to sdcard because i regularly suffer from sd card fat filesystems corruptions and iâ m not the only one having those with android

10252929
post	get
you can even set the type option to post so there will not be a query-string sent this should ensure you don t get multiple of the same page in the dom at a time

10252979
multiplying	add
you have a set of inputs like shift left add constant multiplying by a constant etc

10252982
hide	show
this does what you would expect hide the marker but i can t get the marker to show again on any subsequent hover event

10252998
vb.net	vb6
is there a good tool anyone can recommend to convert a commercial vb6 application into a vb.net application

10253002

config variables can either be done manually via heroku config set or you can use the plugin detailed at the bottom of this page which allows you to push and pull your heroku variables into a .env file suitable for running with foreman locally

10253035
subtract	add	multiplying	add	multiplying	subtract
in any case nearly all special functions break down into basic operations add subtract multiplying divide so as long as you provide those you can implement anything

10253102
int	double
you do the arithmetic in int and then convert to double

10253102
int	double
that is you do the division round to the nearest int and then convert to double

10253124
ssms	sqlcmd
you might want to look into running your script via sqlcmd instead of going through the ssms gui interface

10253141
mvp	presenter
using gwt 2.4 with mvp i have a presenter where the top portion can swap between a read-only presenter of a set of data or an editor for that data depending on how you arrived at the page

10253164
vb.net	vb6
the result that you get is not really good whatever tool you use because vb.net code is quite different from vb6 code despite the syntax similarities

10253204
folder	directory
if you add the following before the doxygen call anything created in the directory will inherit the group of the parent folder which is essentially what you want

10253245
portrait	landscape
rotating the device to portrait shows only the selected email as you would expect and rotating the device back to landscape shows both the email list and selected email again

post	get
so i m planning to start out without using any frameworks until i get reasonably accustomed to the language fundamentals i have got this suggestion from other post in so

10253257
google-chrome	firefox
it constantly generates the error on google-chrome firefox etc.

10253261
vb.net	vb6
if your vb6 project is well structured and well commented and you are an expert in both languages vb6 and vb.net you can give it a try otherwise the conversion could become a nightmare

10253350
x86	64bit	x86	mips
and for different target processors x86 arm mips etc or different flavors of x86 if that is the native compiler you use 32 bit vs 64bit etc

10253350
clang	llvm
and then llvm clang for different targets

10253362
box-sizing	border-box
box-sizing property in css3 for content-box and border-box padding-box was originally a mozilla proposal so it doesn t exist in ie

10253455
draggable	droppable
the options can be dragged into the input fields but there can t be two draggable into one droppable

10253455
draggable	droppable
this works perfectly if you don t move the draggable over the droppable

10253589
prepare	execute
build your queries as a string and either execute immediate them for update insert or ddl s or use prepare open fetch for select s

10253624
japplet	jdialog
you probably shouldn t do this but rather if you want to open another window from the japplet create and show a jdialog

10253653
button	checkbox
obviously you could copy android s resources over to your local project and use those to reset the checkbox s button but that would mean you would have to take into account all the different styles from themes let alone any changes device manufacturers might make to those resources

10253672
ssl	https
from there there are many different ways to switch to https using your ssl cert

10253672

your case might defer slightly from this eg you will not have the redirect portion in the 1st vhost but only a simple vhost and the second one for https ssl

10253677
codeigniter	yii
once you have good or atleast basic knowledge of php then you should learn some mvc framwork like codeigniter or yii e.t.c

10253713
ubuntu	linux
recently i have got a small c++ soap client project ubuntu linux to build using gsoap

10253762
super	implements
if your super class doesn t implements equals then calling super.equals will get you the object implementation which only compares references so in any normal equals implementation where you want to compare a business key it would actually cause a lot of false negatives

10253788
folder	directory
now i can t find any xcode directory at this point neither i can t found xcode.app in applications folder

10253793
gif	png
if you want to check to see if its an image url and react accordingly you can use a regular expression in your onchange event of the text area to see if it contains a gif jpg or png

10253816
superclass	subclassing
in your example the use of super.equals is probably correct as long as the superclass doesn t provide a definition of equality which is counter to the one your subclassing wants as object does for instance

10253817
nssortdescriptor	nspredicate
creating the nsfetchrequest nssortdescriptor and nspredicate inside the performblock doesn t fix the problem either

10253834

10254117
reshape	rep
pdl doesn t have seq and rep specifically but it does have constructors and the ability to manipulate and reshape multi-dimensional data

hash	salt
the first one hash the password given on signup form with a dynamic salt and the second validates the password

10254130
hash	salt
i m not sure what s wrong but it seems i m splitting the hash and dynamic salt in the correct place because when i echo out it shows the first 128 chars sha512 then the dynamic salt 23 chars but when echoing out the two 128 chars hash they do not match by this i mean they are completely different hash

10254138
client-side	server-side
perhaps the best way to do this is to generate a key on the server-side pass that to the client-side code that contains the ajax call then make ajax send it back to the server and verify that it is a valid key

10254171
many-to-many	one-to-many
it will be a many-to-many relationship between user and product and one-to-many relationship between frequenceofuse and userproduct the latter being a relationship itself

10254181
express	node.js
there are so many template engines for node.js and express and there is even this detailed comparison this led me to check out ejs mu2 and jqtpl and i spent some hours on experimenting which of them fits my needs best

10254207
scatter	graphing
i am graphing the data directly using scatter and then plotting a fit line least squares from scipy using plot

10254243
post	get
also when a user has filled out the form and pressed the button they have a linkable url and even though it was a post if they refresh the page they don t get that annoying message about re-sending data to the server

10254249
initializer	class-method
in the 1 class i have the 2 classes initializer with private visibility which prevents the 1 class object from accessing the 2 class-method

10254264

the height and width in the iframes are badly formed

10254358
post	get
how can i use query to get the full list of emails and post it as follows to rails

10254360
put	get
your if xhr is effectively doing this - a browser won t normally send that header if the address is put in the address bar but a user can easily get the same effect outside of your ajax code

10254368
dictionary	map
then use a dictionary for to map the 1-many relationship of colors-values

10254446
superclass	subclassing
of course if these different classes have lots of common methods and properties you can create both as subclassing to a common superclass

10254547
pull	push
i believe my problem is that .project files are being overwritten at each push pull when switching between machines

10254547
pull	push
this causes a constant loop of deleting the project adding the project conf git pull dev push

10254547
pull	push

10254607
integer	unsigned
uint24_t denotes an unsigned integer type with a width of exactly 24 bits

10254615
post	get
i ve changed type from get to post - you are accessing the php _post global in your script so the php would have been looking in the wrong place for variables

10254653
int	chars
chars c1 is an eight-bit signed int type which is set to 0b11111111

10254722
pull	push
or do i just add a function getnumofclients and disconnectclient to the push and pull services

10254734
google-chrome	firefox
i have a couple of run configurations set up for running on an internal server one for google-chrome one for firefox but i find having to use the run button s drop down menu every time i want to run my application quite tedious

10254743
portrait	landscape
thus from portrait rotation in the details fragment to landscape and back again the view remains and is shown correctly

10254755
udp	tcp
i have guessed udp would be faster than tcp due to tcp s three-way handshake scheme but are there any other considerations which need to be made

10254759

what i would suggest is to make sure you are using visual studio 2010 sp1 then install iis express which is an upgrade to cassini and is much more like real iis and then switch your project to use iis express and see if you get the same exception

qmenubar	qstatusbar
qdockwidgets a qmenubar and a qstatusbar

10254814
qmainwindow	qdockwidget
probably the easiest solution is setting the minimumsize for the widget inside qdockwidget so that the layout manager in qmainwindow will not shrink it beyond that

10254831
setinterval	settimeout
combined with the settimeout or setinterval function you could easily achieve your goal

10254844
onclick	onsubmit
you can try changing the onsubmit or onclick function that is running the ajax request to return false and i think that should fix it

10254845
versioning	upgrade
perhaps that issue is fixed in versioning 6 but i m not willing to upgrade right now

10254872
folder	directory
one solution would be to include the splitted database in the assets folder and copy it to the database directory on the first startup

10254872
folder	directory
but this would consume disk space twice - one time in the assets folder where the file can t be deleted and one time in the database directory where it has been copied to

innodb	myisam
the fact that the join to the icons table has no entry for possible_keys leads me to believe you are running a myisam storage engine or an innodb storage engine with no fk constraints

10255169
nsurl	nsstring
use the nsurl method absolutestring to get the path and then use nsstring methods pathextension stringbydeletingpathextension and finally lastpathcomponent to get the extension and name

width	height
i am now trying to get the width and height with action script so i can load another movieclip into it and make it the same size

10255384
width	height
however when i do the following code i can t position it correctly because the scale is width and height displays the original size and not showing the scaled size cordinates

10255384
width	height
so when i place the new clip inside of it the i can t make it be the same width and height as the rescaled clip

10255438

after this rules you need to make a rule to drop all requests to tcp udp connections to port 3306

10255477

kademlia s designers do not appear to have taken into consideration the use of ipv6 addresses or tcp ip instead of udp or the possibility of a kademlia node having multiple ip addresses

10255497
fgets	feof	feof	fgetcsv
what about using the php fwrite function to write the quiz data to file s then recalling the data on your results.php page s with the fopen and or related functions feof fgets fgetcsv etc

10255574
textarea	textbox
the idea is that a user is presented with say 50 tags inside a textarea but instead of just selecting a tag word and removing it there is an x alongside that removes the tag from the list and there is a textbox where a new word can be added

10255656
gridview	sqldatasource
edit it does appear that if you use autogeneratecolumns true on the gridview and populate via sqldatasource it will automatically bind the values of the controls by name to the appropriate parameters in the sql query without any extra code

10255663
fputs	fflush
if both fputs ack and fflush are commented out everything does work as intended

10255669
for-loop	if-statement
i made it work by setting and then running an if-statement in the for-loop to change the value as a string

10255693
google-chrome	firefox
i m using bouncycastle to generate a ca certificate and a http-suitable certificate and i ve noticed that sslstream will not accept any certificate signature algorithms that are not md5withrsa and this means that google-chrome and firefox will simply refuse to open pages because it expects sha1withrsa for it s signature algorithm

10255701
width	height
as jin35 said your problem was that the view s width and height haven t been calculated yet...the dimensions aren t calculated until after the layout pass

10255701
width	height
using a fixed width and height from dimension resources from a values dimens.xml file is one workaround since then you don t need to wait for the view s onmeasure to occur -- you can get the value of the same dimension resource you used for the view you re interested in and use that

10255702
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
opera mini doesn t work with my site - so unfortunately this otherwise perfect example from opera doesn t work but any of the current versions of the big 5 ie google-chrome firefox opera safari would work with my site flawlessly.

10255714
children	parent
in the flexbox layout model the children of a flexbox can be laid out in any direction and can flex their sizes either growing to fill unused space or shrinking to avoid overflowing the parent

10255756
width	height
flexible sizing the size of the boxes can be computed as the explicit size using height width max-height max-width... or the size of the parent box and available space with box-flex

10255765
int	double
it s probably because you are wrapping the query in double quotes but the variable is in single quotes so it s being treated as a literal and if the column is int you will get a 0 instead

10255783
google-chrome	firefox
i can not reproduce the problem in neither firefox nor google-chrome

10255805
width	height
you must explicitly set width and height

have you tried it in other browsers like google-chrome or safari

10255889
hash	salt	hash	md5	salt	md5
one simple but good example is using md5 hash + salt md5 password + random_string - no matter php or mysql you use - result is the same

10255889
hash	salt
find something with random salt so every password can have almost unlimited amount of hash make few changes combine it with other hashing algorithm - problem solved

10255893
shadowing	named
what s happening is that inside foo you create a copy of b and assigns it to a shadowing the empty dict you sent as an argument by reassigning a new object to the same named

10255938
hide	show
currently i have assigned a link i.e with id #link20111 for each of these divs div with id #20111 that when clicked hide the children of #bottomrightbox div and show the specific div

10255938
hide	show
so my code as seen below simple responds to the onclick function of each link and then hide all the divs within the parent div and show the specific div that is assigned to it by name

10255938
hide	show
link with id #link20111 - click - hide children of #bottomrightbox - show div with id #20111

10255938
hide	show
link with id #link20112 - click - hide children of #bottomrightbox - show div with id #20112

10255938
hide	show
link with id #link20113 - click - hide children of #bottomrightbox - show div with id #20113

10255944
hash	salt
that said for passwords you are probably better off with using a strong hash sha1 alongside a salt for storing passwords

10255964
qtcpsocket	qiodevice
certain subclasses of qiodevice such as qtcpsocket and qprocess are asynchronous

10256004
children	parent
all the rules are generic although they can refer to different rows via parent children relations etc so some form of recursion is required

10256020
jar	war
build path or not you need to make sure that the primefaces jar file ultimately ends up in web-inf lib folder of the built and deployed war file

10256020
jar	war
if you really insist to keep the jar elsewhere and manually manage the build path for some reason then you d need to manually add it in the deployment assembly section of the project s properties as well to get it to ultimately end up in the web-inf lib folder of the war

10256032
put	get
if user confirms that location then put it onto geocoding and get the location address it will surely return an address maybe exact or nearby and if user likes it user will confirm it simple

10256041
width	height
i recently switched from using an opengl viewport of 0 width 0 height instead of -1 1 -1 1 so i can get away with converting all my drawing calculations buffers to ints instead of floats if it is desirable for performance

10256041
width	height
a related question is whether i would loose any smoothness in my rendering by doing this rounding if my viewport is from 0 to width and 0 to height in pixels

10256045
put	get
if i get a chance i ll put in a pull request for the next release

hash	md5
i don t know delphi at all but the error message says your md5 hash should be base64 encoded but it appears you re using hexadecimal encoding

10256098
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
so in addition to animating the width and height from 100px to 200px also animate the margin from 0 to -50px

i recommend using some css classes to hide show the divs

10256160
hash	md5
the md5 hash used by the simple hash-based token is not a vulnerability of that approach

10256160
hash	md5
using md5 to hash passwords is dangerous because given the hash value of an existing password you can find another password that hash to the same value using a rainbow table

10256160
hash	md5
however in this case md5 is not being used to hash passwords but is being used as a mac

mouse	keyboard
the above answers will block both keyboard click and mouse click this will block the enter key from doing anything on that link

10256299
int	chars
for small types chars int it makes no sense to pass by reference when the variable is not to be modified

10256320
subtract	add
you only add four characters and subtract one compared to the dynamic approach

10256331
jobs	cron
i am learing cron job and delayed job so i want to send mail using background job and for that i use delayed_job i don not want to start worker manually by giving rake jobs work command but want to set this rake in cron job so when ever user login to dashboard this command is fire and mail sent to his address following is my code

width	height
intvalue integer values setting width and height of scroll

10256411
put	get
i highly recommend either stepping through your code in a debugger or if you re not sure how to do that at least put in a bunch of cout statements in your set function so you can check that the variables are getting set to what you think they should get set to

10256418
put	get
my second thought is that i could only put the user id as hidden field in the edit.jsp and when the form is submitted i could use to get the corresponding user object and set the fields school or address to those newly entered ones by something like user.setschool command.getschool

10256449
lessphp	less.js
don t know if you re using less.js or lessphp like in wp-less plugin for wordpress but with lessphp you can unquote strings with

apparently template specialization takes precedence to polymorphism and working around that isn t possible without boost or c++11

10256493
trie	tree
similar to pjwerneck s suggestion you could use a tree or more specifically a trie to store the lists in parts but extend it to treat the categories specially

10256510

10256560
icmp	udp	traceroute	packets
note - the below code works however this is a udp traceroute sends a udp packets and receives an icmp one and i need my program to send an icmp packets and receive an icmp packets

10256560
icmp	udp
this is because these days firewalls are smarter than they used to be and don t always send an icmp response after receiving a udp packet for a random port

10256560
icmp	udp
essentially the udp socket needs to be changed for an icmp one

10256565
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i suggest you to use uinavigationcontroller for this because for your purpose this can be done with uinavigationcontroller instead of uitabbarcontroller

10256589
median	minimum
here is a function which will give you either the element of the median or the first match to the mean of the median similar to how which.min gives you the first element that is equal to the minimum only

10256593
keydown	keyup
the keydown keyup and keypress events are supported by all browsers but there are some interoperability problems because the values of the keycode property of the event object have never been standardized

10257059
subtract	add	multiplying	add	multiplying	subtract
to improve your algorithm precompute the exponents of magic_exp and use them to roll your hash - basically just as with polynoms you need to subtract the highest degree multiplying by magic_exp and add the hash of the symbol to the right for moving the hash to the right

opengl-es	glblendfunc
for more information about gl_blend and glblendfunc you can refer to opengl-es 1.1 reference

10257164
stdio	getc
this is the general case with stdio streams that you must do some kind of synchronizing operation because back in the dim time actual stdio implementations had only a single counter per stream and it was either a counter of number of characters left to read from stream buffer via getc macro in read mode or number of characters that can safely be written to stream buffer via putc macro in write mode

10257172

awt	swing
note the file is a simple gui front end code which works perfectly on the source which used simple libraries from awt and swing

vsto	add-in
its tricky and to do it without any external dependencies resort to keyboard hooking to achieve it with a vsto excel add-in

10257266

i can handle the resizing part pretty easily there is a lot of tutorials on the web but i don t know how to write the part with dialog box pop-up

10257655

to get your probably desired behavior you can either assign the id value to a global variable bad choice or pass in the rest of the functionality as a callback function with the id as an argument directly to the post success function

10257661
hide	show
in the mainwindow i have 2 buttons hide settings window btn1 and show settings window btn2

width	height
while in here the createscaledbitmap method i am using itself as the source and some variables from an activity used to retrieve the window height and width from screen preferences

10257677
portrait	landscape
the thing is the rotation is always shifted by 90 degrees ie when i rotate to landscape right i get portrait

10257686
portrait	landscape
and if your requirement is that inspite of phone is in portrait landscape mode and you require an single oreintation then you can lock it through code as follow in oncreate method

10257702
prepare	execute
this is because prepare statements prepare the sql query first to find an efficient query plan and send the actual values that presumably come in from a form later - at that time the query is actually execute

pydev	virtualenv
to do so you should add your module to the eclipse s pythonpath and then reindex your virtualenv the one defined in pydev

10262133
realloc	malloc
am i doing somthing wrong in malloc realloc or storing the values

10262149
post	get
but i get a 404 instead of a 200 as if it s not actually doing a post

10262150
put	get
to allow code compiled w native extensions to run on the simulator we had to put code that used native extensions in methods that would never get executed when on the simulator

10262162
erd	entity-relationship	erd	diagram	entity-relationship	diagram
the reason your textbook may have said that you could skip the likes table in an entity-relationship diagram is that in a conceptual or logical erd many-to-many relationships can be represented by a line instead of a box assuming your erd notation uses lines for relationships and boxes for tables

10262193
maven	m2e
i have an existing library that i am building in eclipse and have added the maven nature to my project using m2e to add dependencies

10262193
folder	directory
when i convert it to a maven project my existing source directory and my bin become normal folder

10262308
for-loop	arrays
i start from with lowest well formed number of the given size just fill arrays with for-loop

10262310
for-loop	loops
the last loops in your for-loop runs

10262420
pascal	delphi
i m new to delphi and pascal in general so may be i just overlooked something obvious

10262435
flip	slide
it seems to have something to do with the type of page transition specified fade or slide or flip etc

10262445
post	put
so it is more convinient to put it in a single cell in post array that do subarray

10262565
distance	pdist
i am aware of the pdist x distance in matlab to take an nxd matrix of points and calculate the pairwise distance between them

10262638
stdout	stderr
i am trying to hide stdout stderr from displaying and can t get the syntax right

10262638
stdout	stderr
any ideas on how to send the email hide the stdout and stderr and run it as a background program

10262673
post	get
i do a post to index with correct credentials and then get as expected a redirect to login.php

10262676
client-side	server-side
i know i can use openssl ssl sslsocket on the client-side but i have no idea what to do on the server-side

10262676
post	get
if you know how to do this in a language other than ruby just post the code and i ll translate it i ve been working on this for about 8 hours and i need everything i can get

10262685
bash	zsh
the difference between bourne bash ksh zsh would be in the shell wildcards patterns that each shell has as an extension to the basic patterns the bourne shell supported

10262722
children	parent
it sounds like what i m really after is a parent build that has two children - the 32 and 64 bit build

10262730
google-chrome	firefox
the described behavior is in google-chrome and firefox on win7

10262736
google-chrome	firefox
each post has a 20 width it looks ok in google-chrome but in ie and firefox the last column gets pushed below so there are only 4

10262737
unix	bsd
you can either use whatever sockets api your operating system provides typically a c api on unix operating systems it would be the bsd sockets api or you can use a c++ library like boost.asio which is cross-platform

10262793
stdout	stderr
example 10 in stdout twice another 50 in stdout once rest 40 in stderr

10262793
stdout	stderr
note redirect stdout to one file and stderr to other file .

10262822
mousemove	mousedown
but instead of mousedown i would like to create a custom event called mousedrag which would be a combination of mousedown and mousemove

10262871
implements	extends
in your custom adapter your probably extends arrayadapter implements the getcount method and return the list of conferences size

10262885
crypt	salt
the php docs for the crypt function do provide some information on how to use the salt string to specify which algorithm to use

10262885
hash	salt
crypt_std_des - standard des-based hash with a two character salt

10262885
crypt	salt
using invalid characters in the salt will cause crypt

10262885
salt	md5
crypt_md5 - md5 hashing with a twelve character salt

10262885
crypt	salt
the salt will cause crypt to return a zero-length string

10262885
hash	salt
crypt_sha256 - sha-256 hash with a sixteen character salt prefixed

10262885
hash	md5
it will automatically use the best algorithm on the system unless you specify that you want a hash that is compatible with multiple systems in which case i think it uses md5

10262913
int	double
i m working on an assignment and i m getting stuck on one part of it the output of int and double to a binary file

10262913
int	double	int	chars
when i m outputting a regular string i can just typecast it using chars or use the .c_str function however i m having trouble with the double and int

10262913
int	double
how would i go about outputting int and double to binary

10262935
zipalign	jarsigner
even if somehow php had a fully-functioning jarsigner embedded in it it is unlikely to also have zipalign

10262935
zipalign	jarsigner
note though that by sdk tools you only really need the java sdk for jarsigner and the zipalign binary which afaik has no other dependencies

10262949
profiling	debugging
i ve used the profiling in chrome s debugging tools for this purpose before

10262961
for-loop	loops
i know that python lists can be tricky to modify in a for-loop and i tried changing my code to loops over but that didn t solve my problem

10262991
sorting	filtering
if you ll change numbers of rows or colums or filtering sorting then you have to notified jpanel for rezize jtable#getpreferredscrollableviewportsize + dimension for ontop jtable only with tableheader

10263004
for-loop	loops
your solution is to not re-declare j in loops but rather declare it once as a long before loops or once as an int in the for-loop initial condition as you re doing

10263015
mouseover	mouseout
this means that whenever any image is receives a mouseover or mouseout event the opacity will always change for the last image in your list of images

10263019
content-disposition	content-type
after playing with headers in php i find that removing content-type and content-disposition seems to have an impact but i m just messing around and can t really understand what s wrong

10263026
min	max
at each new step of an iteration i want to efficiently be able to find the min or max value so i want the data structure to be sorted at all times and upon the request to insert a new element the oldest element be automatically or at least able to be efficiently popped discarded

10263026
queue	fifo
so i guess i am looking for some sort of of fifo priority queue

10263036
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i am working on a personal html 5 css3 project that takes the old 1970 s super hero read-along book and records and plays them in a compatible browser safari google-chrome firefox

10263089
hide	show
ajax refresh causes show hide of some components

10263091
google-chrome	firefox
i have a php script that uses implicit_flush to output data when it s ready the problem is that when i start two instances from google-chrome or firefox the seconde instance remains loading without outputing anything

10263112
portrait	landscape
the idea is when the user change the orientation for the tablet landscape to portrait and should change the orientation for this element

10263118
getter	setter
well it breaks encapsulation you should really have public getter and setter for the data you want to expose allowing access like you suggested allows the caller to corrupt reassign etc

10263127
portrait	landscape
i almost done but i need to insert new user-control in portrait view as a child element of landscape root page

10263127
portrait	landscape
when i change supportedorientation to portrailorlandscape in rootpage and toggle orientation in emulator to portrait then every child element that was in landscape is cutted

10263134
width	height
i want to have an imageview with width fill_parent and the height should be whatever the width is

10263134
width	height
i m not sure if the above is even correct not sure if the width measurement even takes place before the height measurement for example

10263191
udp	tcp
the wcf just implements some concrete protocols over the tcp so if you need something else like ip or even udp you still need to use the sockets

10263242
queue	fifo
why not have both an std set or multiset and a regular fifo queue like std queue of iterators into that set

10263264
post	get
i made the changes to the get post but it gives nothing i think its the form that is making this difficult the form just below this section here am i doing something wrong

10263264
post	get
i can t tell but know one thing for sure when i use the name and not submit go for the get the post i get error saying undefined index name whats up with that i did what you said but nothing

10263279
sorting	grouping
please take a look the code does work as it should set grouping happened fine and the sorting as well

10263300
children	parent
to give a new example say you have a ranking system which will ensure that objects of a particular class parent are created before other classes that are dependent on it children you may have some children who are in the same tier and it does not matter which one is created first

10263318
min	max
put each element x in bucket number floor x - min x n - 1 max x - min x

10263318
min	max
the width of each bucket is max x - min x n - 1 and the maximum adjacent difference is at least that much so the numbers in question wind up in different buckets

10263318
min	max
now all we have to do is consider the pairs where one is the max in bucket i and the other is the min in bucket j where i j and all buckets k in i j are empty

10263318
min	max
max x - min x length x - 1

10263338
width	margin
just add the content of the menu into another div with width 500px margin auto

10263349
width	height
if you want to implement this for the menu you will have to make the menu fixed height everthing else and its width can still be fluid due to the type of opacity you use in the layer

10263350
ssl	https
if i have a page outside of my site and it posts to an https page on my site ssl is setup will the server and client exchange keys before the data is posted and then encrypt the data or will the data be posted in plain text from the client to the server then be given the key to encrypt

10263352
width	height
however i need to know the height and width of the grid in my viewmodel

10263358
jboss	glassfish	jboss	geronimo	glassfish	geronimo
in an ejb3 container such as geronimo jboss glassfish etc

10263389
width	height
but my question is should i use one image say the medium size and stretch it for the alrge screen by putting min width min height and fitscalexy

10263389
width	height
i was thinking of specifying width and height for each screen layout size instead of wrap content

10263405
put	get
you can only get words that you have put in

10263413
abstract-class	superclass
superclass interface or abstract-class or simpleclass

10263413
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
my second question is when they say program to an interface is that mean that the code is in the interface superclass then subclassing just inherited it

10263416
getter	setter
maybe i misunderstood when and why to use the properties vs instance variables but outside of init methods and such i was under the impression it was better to use the setter getter

10263455
google-chrome	firefox
there is only some beta development happening for google-chrome and firefox that will be publicly available not really soon

10263464
hash	salt
i have a datacontract and in my service i am trying to hash salt the password datamember

10263473
client-side	server-side
you could use a javascript implementation of rsa to encrypt the password client-side and then php on the server-side to decrypt it

10263515
google-chrome	firefox
works great in firefox google-chrome but ie9 and 8 so my qa tells me randomly pop a windows security login dialog asking you to log into the remote server

10263553
width	height
this is the same text centered roughly using the width and height of the text

10263584
range	min
because in the range min input min input +m 2 there are at most m unique elements and you can handle that

10263584
range	min
2nd run only operate on elements with value in range min input +m 2 min input +m 4 and

10263593
width	margin
add a left margin to the center one whatever the width of the left div is

10263603
ienumerable	ienumerator
you have to cast explicitly to ienumerable to use the overload that returns ienumerator which may be where your problem lies

10263632
getter	setter
i read several articles informing that entity beans in a java ee environment are considered as anemic means only containing getter and setter without implementing behaviour

10263632
stateless	stateful
so that session beans stateless or stateful could delegate all business logics to them for logic making sense to be owned by entities

10263642
mp3	wav
but you should compress the wav file to mp3

10263654
prepare	execute
furthermore you should not only prepare your statement but execute it as well

10263670
fasta	biopython
i m assuming you have parsed your chromosome fasta file and have the sequences of all the chromosomes as a chrom_sequences name seq dictionary and also that you have a reverse_complement function both of those things are easily implemented by hand but probably better done with biopython

10263673
trie	tree
if no use an std unordered_map it handles collisions and you don t want a multimap or a trie critbit tree depending on the keys it may be more compact than a hash which may lead to better caching behavior

10263714
hash	salt
i am trying to hash salt my datamembers passwords in my datacontracts but when i add a new student and then get that student collection the password field hasnt been hash salt it comes back as what i typed

10263795
cpu	processors
when the bytecode is interperted it is executed through the jvm interpreter not directly on the processors when it is compiled it is compiled to native machine language and executed directly on the cpu

10263803
jar	war
note that the change is done in the jvm only the class jar war files are not changed and remain as bytecode

10263822
maven	pom.xml
we have distributed a headless version without the web front-end that allows a user to simply download the pom.xml and run the server directly - maven downloads all the pieces if necessary and calls the main class with command-line args

10263871
int	chars
i am using the python c api and would like a c function to take a python long int argument npylong and convert it to a chars array nstring in base 10

10263871
int	chars
the api reference mentions a function which converts a c chars array to a python long int given an arbitrary base but i cannot find a function which does the inverse

10263871
int	chars
one idea is to convert the python long int to a python string object and then convert to a c chars array but there are no string functions to handle long int either

10263893
equals	gethashcode
if you want that behaviour you must either use a value type a struct instead of a class a custom comparer as you have done or you must override the equals and gethashcode methods of keyclass

10263926
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
note that your can and will break particularly if you have multiple inherited as it won t adjust the inner pointer at address to the right offset within the subclassing to get at whatever superclass is needed

10263930
google-chrome	safari
i m trying to send a url to google-chrome for viewing flash quit safari in the meanwhile so it s not using up memory and then as soon as i quit google-chrome go back to safari

10263930
google-chrome	safari
it s not predictably going back to safari after i quit google-chrome so i need help with the repeat loop

10263951
superclass	subclassing
not all superclass is the high-level component and not all subclassing is the low-level component

10263951
superclass	subclassing
this means here caffeinebeverage superclass is the high-level component and coffee subclassing is the low-level component

10263951
superclass	subclassing
in this case superclass didnt need subclassing to implement its go method

10263951
superclass	subclassing
even if a class has abstract method that needs the subclassing to implements it doesnt mean superclass is the high level component

10263970
tiff	png
convert the png to a tiff

10263976
int	boolean
it is part of the language specification so any python implementation should implement the boolean as equivalent to the int

10263976
int	boolean
the boolean type is a subtype of plain int and boolean values behave like the values 0 and 1 respectively in almost all contexts the exception being that when converted to a string the strings false or true are returned respectively

10263982
multiplying	add
also i can advise you not to multiplying selects or options but add selected values to page as text

10264002
system.in	system.out
you can use system rules instead of mocking system.out and system.in

10264007
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this should not have any affect on other browsers - firefox google-chrome safari opera - they will all display it as they do now

10264028
int	boolean
even if youâ re only returning a scalar return value such as a string int or boolean the result will always be enclosed within the â œdâ

10264040
qtableview	qpushbutton
i want to be able to drag drop from a qpushbutton into a cell of a qtableview

10264049
hash	salt
when i get my student collection the password field will say system.byte where as i want to get the hash salt password back

10264127
decoder	encoder
you can decoder base64 using base64 encoder decoder base64.exe -d dropbox_python_sdk_gae_patched.7z.base64 dropbox_python_sdk_gae_patched.7z

10264131
maven	cargo
maven cargo thanks to the other answer is a good way too

10264154
equals	gethashcode
rather override the gethashcode and equals methods in keyclass

10264155
png	tga
if your texture format supports an alpha channel png tga dds etc

10264158
superclass	subclassing
is it right to say that not all superclass is the high-level component of the subclassing

10264169
sorting	filtering
however i needed to add a sorting and filtering function for the jtable

10264181
qtkit	avfoundation	qtkit	quicktime
i mean quicktime qtkit had an updatemoviefile method to do this i can t believe avfoundation doesn t have something similar

10264187
oncreate	onstart
from oncreate and onstart it has no effect

10264197
min	max
you can even take further shortcut by using bultin min and max and do it in a single line

10264225
map	quadtree
a lot of groups access the map segments via quadtree which usually don t need much traversion to get to the nearby parts

10264240
daemons	launchd
perhaps win32 daemons is doing this for you but of course it has no way to know about any processes that are launchd from your batch file

10264256
repo	egit
all you need to do is to create an eclipse project specifying the source directory being not in the default path eclipse workspace but wherever you cloned your repo as described in getting started with eclipse + egit - confused

10264321
int	double
primitives such as int and double cannot go in these classes because they do not inherit from nsobject and hence cannot participate in collections etc

10264367
int	chars
if either of the two assumptions signedness and 8-bit chars s doesn t hold the value will beâ¹ 255 since 255 is representable as an unsigned 8-bit int or as a signed or unsigned int with more than 8 bits

10264425
mamp	ampps
i have tried two different local stacks mamp ampps which are running php 5.3.6 5.3.10 respectively and the same thing occurs on both

10264437
google-chrome	firefox
i test on firefox and google-chrome cleaned all cookies.

10264457
google-chrome	safari
edit it appears to work fine in google-chrome but does not work in safari either

10264459
for-loop	loops
when i run this function it seems to just loops around the inner for-loop without actually calling itself again

10264549
implements	extends
you need to extends abstractcelleditor and implements treecelleditor and actionlistener

10264589
hide	show
when user hover #roxo-um .image need to hide with jquery ui drop effect and show .text with same effect sliding to up

10264589
hide	show
when user leave #roxo-um do the same but hide .text and show .image

10264662
everyauth	connect
i m trying to build a foursquare app and i ve selected the everyauth module to implement the authentication connect with foursquare

10264668
content-disposition	content-type
i believe the only way to do this in a totally client agnostic way is to force it from the server-side using a content-type of octect-stream and content-disposition of attachment with a suggested filename

10264683
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
and furthermore i am aware of uitabbarcontroller s delegate pattern but i don t know what view controller i can hook it up to note my uitabbarcontroller is generated from a modal segue from a uiviewcontroller

10264714
cvs	svn
what dvcs systems bring to the table that cvs and svn don t is that every merge is a 3-way merge between two heads and the most recent common ancestor

10264744
rspec	minitest
i m thinking about minitest or rspec

10264746
cvs	svn
you might want to look into subversioning in the form of git svn cvs or any of the others

10264783
hash	md5
use md5 sha1 hash instead

10264784
versioning	upgrade
upgrade to the released versioning from the jqm alpha

10264830
guard	simplecov
for those specific tasks i use simplecov and guard respectively

10264830
rspec	capybara	webrat	cucumber
by the way the rspec book is an excelente book about it and it covers rspec cucumber webrat very similar to capybara the most popular now and selenium

10264838
portrait	landscape
when the app starts listingactivity 1 is called and depending on if the device is in portrait or landscape either listfragment a is displayed only or both listfragment s are displayed

10264838
portrait	landscape
when the device is in portrait mode the user should go back to listingactivity 2 but if they are in landscape mode they should go back to listingactivity 1

10264851
uiviewcontroller	uiwindow
i have a uiviewcontroller whose view is added to my uiwindow

10264869
put	get
and the php script on his server was missing aswell don t worry about the error but if you are to put an app on the appstore make sure to get rid of the nslog code snippets just for good memory management

10264880
post	get
the assignment is supposed to get us used to basics so apologies ahead of time for the lack of knowledge and really long post

10264884
public	protected
no when you derive publicly from a base class only its public and protected members are accessible for the derived class

10264885
public	protected
only the public and the protected data members are accessible in inheritance when your inheriting publicly

10264893
hide	show
i then added a repeat of the slide function using hide first was show to make the sheet disappear again

10264939
getattr	setattr
the getattr and setattr operations let you use the name you computed to get and set self.top_left self.top_right and so on

10264944
layoutparams	viewgroup
you can use custom adapter for your gallery view with an image view and use match_parent or fill_parent for layoutparams of image view in custom adapter in getview int position view convertview viewgroup parent method

10264967
google-chrome	firefox
my advice is you could use firebug in firefox or something else develope tools in google-chrome to see the xhr response

10265001
int	chars
you can freely assign these int values to a bool signed chars value

10265025
int	chars
i found another reference stating that hibernate casts a chars to an int even though the documentation state chars is a usable data type...

10265045
post	get
here are 2 examples of how to stop process.php from running both using a combination of a set session and a check on if the request is a post others have mentioned just checking submit is set but a bot would only need add that value to its params but by using a random key the bot would have to visit the form page and get the key at least once also for some extra security you could unset the session variable so process.php will only run once per form view this would slow down but not stop a brute force or spammer

10265086
put	get
when i wanted to put down 101 or 212 i get these

you re calling a properties called year whose get accessor calls year whose get accessor calls year .

10265299
profiling	instrumentation
in instrumentation there is a trace template named time profiling you can actually see how much time your application spends on each tasks

10265324
superclass	subclassing
the reason it is required to call a super constructor is that the superclass usually has some state it expects to be in after being constructed which may include private variables that can t be set in a subclassing

10265334
int	chars	unsigned	short
and accessing the value as a signed or unsigned chars short int int

10265560
google-chrome	safari
i realize this may not work on all browsers but i just threw this together on my laptop to demonstrate what is happening for me on google-chrome on w7 and also google-chrome safari on mac os 10.6.8

i need a pair of standard integer types signed and unsigned that correspond to a reasonable interpretation of the machine word size and that are guaranteed to be the same size as each other

10265847
int	chars
maybe you can use read chars code 12 instead of read int code 5

10265847
int	chars
if you do read chars you ll need to convert from ascii to int

10265852
folder	directory
you could also do an export command to create a full non-versioned copy in a target directory to avoid the manual delete of .svn folder

10265875

for each of the signed integer types there is a corresponding but different unsigned integer type designated with the keyword unsigned that uses the same amount of storage including sign information and has the same alignment requirements

10265884

combine the substr left and charindex functions

10265897

i have q4e installed as well along with m2e but still doesn t work so i don t know if q4e is not working with maven 3 or i m doing something wrong

10266066
put	get
ok your idea is fine if your web hosting lets you do http put you can get the file using get modify it using the dom and put it back

10266085
int	chars
all chars may be represented as ascii when entered from keyboard to memory but the read_int syscall will try to parse an int from that ascii and it will fail for non-numeric chars

post	get	width	height
heres a secure safe way todo it a post request needs checking just checking is not enough needs any special chars stripped needs checking its set and is numeric file specific type extension needs finding also allowed mime types need cross matching plus width and height sizes need checking lots to think about uploads can be extremely insecure not to mention images can have php injected into the file comments and if not handled correctly may get executed

typedef	struct
small note when doing oop i prefer to typedef the struct and give them camelcase names

i have tried any number of ideas suggested by lots of people who have hit a similar problem like forcing the encoding to be json and setting the datatype in the jquery post call to be json like putting a brief sleep in the php script like using a get instead of a post

10266859
firefox	safari
i have tried this out on ie firefox and safari and get the same problem on them all

10266880

fadein	fadeout
so far i have fadein fadeout for each list individually or i can get each list to fadein and stay open but not fadeout whenever i move out of the div

10266984
fadein	fadeout
the line commented out in the javascript is what changes between all the lists staying visible or the list fadein fadeout on hover

10266994
onresume	onpause
edit you should call setreceiver this in onresume and setreceiver null in onpause to avoid leaks

10267001
getter	setter
a property has a getter and a setter

10267001
getter	setter
one is enough the compiler can figure out if the setter or the getter is intended from location of the property identifier relative to the symbol left is setter right is getter

10267341
tex	mathjax
but if you do not want to resort to a tex renderer then you may want to investigate the css behind a mathjax fraction with chrome inspector

10267352
textview	imageview
is this possible with just a textview or do i need to create a relativelayout containing a textview and an imageview

10267359
hide	show
sounds like you wish to have hide show text linked to the respective countries

10267359

10267614
dictionary	map
while that doesn t give you a full-fledged dictionary by itself you can build a dictionary on top use a hash of the actual key as the key of the underlying map and have the leaves point to lists of key value pairs of the same hash value

10267644
realloc	malloc
the problem that valgrind reports i won t touch on the other ones is the use of malloc and realloc

10267652
multiplying	add
since it also leads to memory fragmentation it probably doesn t use less memory than an increase by a larger amount say an increase by a constant factor double the size multiplying by 1.5 and add one to make sure the size is really increased

10267683
google-chrome	firefox
this code works fine on ie but not work on google-chrome or firefox

and as a matter of fact the gumball only knows of states in its various getter and setter in your code

10267739
button	checkbox
curiously the other items in the view that contains the listview checkbox and a button do receive clickevents

10267758
put	get
the aim is to have x servers each with the same application and for each to be able to get records and process them but have the level of processing items to process shared amoungst the servers so incase if one server or service fails the other can take on that load until another server is put back

10267779
versioning	upgrade
you could use this a starting point and then modify the created files as needed to upgrade the various frameworks to later versioning

10268062
public	protected
if i modify the navigation property t2 to make it have a protected or public setter

10268085

you can use autosize to adjust width and height according to the text and maximumsize to auto-wrap the text remaining text will go the next line if its width exceeds 200

10268102
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome percentages work fine but when trying the same in firefox latest version the content div is not expanding horizontally and vertically anymore

10268128
libstdc++	libc++
i should mention that i corroborated these calculations by looking at the implementations of std vector in gcc libstdc++ and llvm s libc++ and by testing on a live system

10268132
implements	extends
i d actually suggest implements runnable rather than extends thread too

10268141

10268320
union	distinct
i need to select distinct value from a multiple union

10268323
getter	setter
for instance you will have a form for login login.xhtml and you will present all getter and setter of the values that are needed in the form in loginbean.java

10268362
hash	md5
there s nothing wrong to use the md5 hash of the select query because you don t need any other information to uniquely identify the result set

10268375
union	distinct
union gives you the distinct result already

10268399
width	height
for testing purpose i changed the width and height value to 30 in the html code and tried

10268448
union	distinct
however you don t need the distinct there at all the union already removes duplicates

10268461
hide	show
by tinkering with the form s toplevel property so you can put it on a panel the form s visible property is no longer a reliable indication whether you last called show or hide

10268461
hide	show
or just call show and hide when you need it be in visible calling show when it is already visible or hide when it is already invisible doesn t matter

10268469

10268626
google-chrome	firefox
try google-chrome s developer tools firefox firebug or similar

10268637
super	self
you should call event.__init__ self ... from typetwoevent.__init__ or use super but if you re not familiar with it read up on it first so you know what you re doing

10268639
super	extends
to extends it you need to explicitly call the constructor of the parent with a super call

10268642
int	chars
secondly the error message is quite clear - you re trying to convert to int some varchar column that probably contains some literal chars as well and not only numbers.

10268658

i need to figure out the width and height in pixels of a string when using drawstring to paint it on a jpanel

10273600
width	height
right now your iframe is getting cut off yes but not due to you setting overflow scroll nor due to you setting a width height property of the container frame

10273600
width	height
to prove this add a background #ff0000 to your container div and you will see that it truly is not the div s width height that is defining the cutoff region of your iframe but rather some default iframe dimension properties

10273600
width	height
my recommendation is given you said your div is of fixed dimensions set up your iframe with width height properties of those same dimensions so that it matches

10273600
width	height
you can either do this using the width and height attributes or more cleanly using css justas you have done for the container div

10273600
width	height
once you give the iframe the correct width height the cutoff should match what you expect and the browser shouldn t scroll to the size of the contents of the iframe but rather to your specified dimensions

10273628
lambda	first-class-functions
i was under the impression that blocks were supposed to resemble first-class-functions and allow for lambda calc-style constructs

10273650
width	height
it manages to fit it to the width but messes up the height making it shorter than it should be

10273692
range	minimum
it allows you to input a minimum maximum number to grab a range from

10273693
background-image	background-size
the value of the css3 background-size property is just that the value of the style property how the image should be displayed and says nothing about the size of the actual image referenced by the background-image url

10273708
int	boolean
converting a boolean to int gives 0 for false and 1 for true

10273790
int	double
this is something minor but just for future reference when you assign ticketnumber it s an int but your comment says double

10273814
post	put
if you want to set the on which blog the post should be published after writing you have to put the blog_id into the whitelist by setting attr_accessible

10273824
pull	push
once you located the file there s a couple buttons on the top right corner to pull push files from the device

10273829
nsstring	nsdata
all you have to do is pass through the nsstring of the encoded byte array and it returns the equivalent nsdata object back ready to be loaded into the uiwebview

10273851
width	height
note i did 0-50 0-50 because that puts the point of origin in the center since the width and height are 100

10273853
fseek	fread
i have a script that does a whole bunch of fread and fseek calls on a binary file using a file pointer created like this

10273853
fseek	fread
the script deals with around 2 500 separate files within the binary each of which attracts a number of fseek and fread calls so total operations on the file pointer probably well exceeds 20 000

10273876
subtract	add
when you define data_desc as a pointer to a struct data_desc the compiler knows to add or subtract sizeof struct data_desc when you increment or decrement the pointer by one

10274312
width	margin
the idea that an element s width included the margin border and padding was blasphemous and an abomination to their senses

profiling	debugging
you could compile ghc with debugging symbols or just throw in some dummy unique system calls to ensure you can differentiate the two system call profiling to find out

10274530
intersect	contains
what that means is that for me to ascertain whether or not a specific user say myuser belongs to a particular organization i have to query for all the groups that the user belong to via and then query for all the groups that are associated to the organization i am interested in via and since i now have 2 lists that i need to compare i can do which will return a new set which may contains 1 or more groups that intersect

folder	directory
we found that we could really easily share our changes by just sharing our repo folder through windows using our active directory accounts right click on folder share with specific people however i d like to completely block out the possibility of having someone to push to a repository

10286684
nunit	mstest
instead try using the expectedexception attribute the attribute is the same for nunit and mstest and set the type to the exception you are expecting

10286688

drive	createfile
below is my c++ code it is suppose to locate a connected usb drive create a handle using createfile and write a raw image .img to the device

10286780
post	put
anyway the issue is that odata services need the method that addresses the edit operation delete put merge to be sent as a custom request header on a normal post rather than it being an http method

10286811
submit	submission
but at the time of submission it should actually submit the key

10286840
entity-relationship	diagram
i m working on a group project and my partner sent me a .mwb file so i could take a look at what they did for the entity-relationship diagram but she can t figure out how to send a .sql file for the database itself at least i think those are .sql files

10286871
post	put
anyways how do i perform a http post with a uiwebview so that i can update the view when needed for a different flyer to put put there etc

10286877
folder	directory
i m trying to create a branch spec that only pulls down specific folder from a repository but preserves the directory structure

10286877
folder	directory
what i m trying to do is create a branch for each project that pulls down all folder except in the 1.0 project sub directory it should only pull down the project folder specific to that folder

10286877
folder	directory
i ve tried creating a seperate codeline with a client view mapping every directory under project and beign sure to only map the project specific folder but it didn t work and i d really like to avoid having to create a new codeline for every project

vertica s variant of sql is the same as postgresql

10286915
hide	show
you can show and hide the dock icon of an application with nsrunningapplication+dockicon but beware this code uses undocumented apis

10286920
aiff	caf
since you cannot play the caf files by clicking it i suggest to have a try to convert it to other formats like wave or aiff

10286920
aiff	caf
i usually use caf for sound effects and use aiff for background music

10286938
uiview	subviews
however i tried adding an uiview with a button inside all in the uiscrollview and the button receives the touch event just fine so the problem is only with programmatically added subviews

10286952
put	get
in this cases either you put several asserts on one test knowing fully well about the cons of that approach or you can extract the arrange and act sections of the test in a method and create several tests that call upon that method get the result and assert on the specific piece of data

10286976
geocoding	geocode
the completion handler is run after the geocode has finished geocoding

10287110
folder	directory
mac applications usually store their image files in the application bundle s resources folder but the mac version of sdl sets the working directory to a different location

10287110
folder	directory
the solution is to change the working directory to your application bundle s resources folder

10287159
min	max
center of the bounding box of all the points - you do this by finding the min and max points which are then then corners of the box

10287159
min	max
the center of this box is then min + max 2

10287169

right now all i can think of is breaking each word into a token and displaying positioning it differently uilabel uibutton etc however this is terribly inefficient

10287215
maven	pom.xml
in my opinion nothing should be put into the dependencies section in the parent pom.xml and seeing the warning it seems maven feels the same

10287246

i am trying to implement facebook into my application however whenever i go into header search paths and drag and drop my src file i still get an error for fbconnect fbconnect.h

10287261
vsto	add-in
is there a way to deploy a vsto excel 2010 add-in to a list of machines automatically

10287276
post	get
i guess info from the previous question you want to get the item price data using ajax based on the selected item in the dropdown and send that to your action method as part of the normal form post

10287317
width	height
for instance i have a control with a height and width and i want to display the height and width on the control as a formatted string height x width

10287317
width	height
then i bind to content of my label to the displaystring property which seems a lot more convenient than using a imultivalueconverter to convert from the width and height properties

10287317
width	height
the inconvenient part is that anywhere i need to notifypropertychanged for width or height i also have to remember to notify for displaystring

10287329
google-chrome	firefox
the table sorts perfectly with firefox google-chrome ie 8 but i have a strange behaviour with ie 9 alone

10287338
sorting	filtering
one can use the option forceclientsorting true to force sorting and filtering of data on the client side before the current page of data will be displayed in jqgrid

10287356
folder	directory
newer versions of intellij uses directory based project settings in the .idea folder since like intellij 9 i think

10287450
put	get
to get around it you could use a text area where you put the value in between the tags

10287468
int	double
this will use floating point arithmetic because of the 10.0 instead of 10 and store the result in a double which has precision past the decimal point unlike an int

10287473
int	double
you could divide by 10.0 or change int percent to double percent in order to force a conversion to double

10287473
int	double
here is a relevant question java int division how do you produce a double

10287510
int	double
1 could be interpreted as int int float or double but none of these except int belong to the bounded class

10287515
multiplying	division
if you really need the result to be an int you could do the multiplying before the divide to avoid the integer division giving you zero

10287529
textarea	textbox
i have forms with about 100 input fields each textbox textarea radio checkbox file etc

10287529
textarea	textbox
but in textbox textarea input types the change event only occur when elements loses focus

10287567
width	height
the most straight forward answer is to get the width and height of the web view

10287567
width	height
bounds should be a cgrect and by getting half of the width and half of the height you can get the exact center of the view

10287586
width	height
you need to set either the width or height to 0dp depending on whether the linearlayout is horizontal orientation or vertical orientation respectively

10287591
hide	show
- show hide from dock works as expected

10287595
erd	diagram
if you already have an erd what additional alternate property do you want to illustrate with a uml class diagram that the erd doesn t give you

10287600
sorting	grouping
the problem arises from what access does behind the scenes in response to the report s sorting and grouping or aggregation

10287600
sorting	grouping
in report design remove everything form the sorting and grouping dialog and do not try to sum anything in the report header or report footer

10287636
vim	emacs
if you are using vim emacs then this whole thing could be simplified by passing to a shell based sql beautifier but for the life of me i can t find one

10287672
post	get
this app has a variety of get and post operations that are accessed via jquery and exposed via mvc 3

10287672
post	get	webclient	webrequest
i m having difficulty figuring out how to get and post via the webclient and webrequest objects

10287674
pull	push
as long as you re sure people are using push and pull to get the changes to from the shared directories which is the only safe way

10287679
width	height
this is our scale factor that we ll use and multiply the height by to match your target width of 300px

10287695
int	double
but for defaulting only types listed in the default declaration of the module are considered - in the absence of a default declaration the default default of int double is assumed to resolve a constrained ambiguous type variable first int is tried and if that doesn t satisfy all constraints double is tried

10287695
int	double
in the case at hand neither int nor double satisfy the bounded constraint so defaulting fails

10287710
button	checkbox
further i d rather use or instead of or just remove the event altogether it defaults to the right value already valuechange which will render onclick in checkbox and radio button components

10287713
getter	setter
it declares a property which is syntactic sugar for getter and setter method declarations

10287713
getter	setter
it synthesises your previously declared property by creating the getter and setter methods

10287801
bufferstrategy	bufferedimage
double buffering techniques are for reducing or eliminating flickering in fast painting code which is what you should be accomplishing via the bufferstrategy internally using a bufferedimage

10287806
uilabel	uitextview
all text in a uilabel or uitextview has to be the same font color

10287838
post	get
however the basic idea is you get post using something like .post or .get in jquery to an action basically a url

10287851
uiview	calayer
when you need to draw content eg in the draw selector on your uiview subclass you should read currenttime from the calayer animation if necessary proceed through the avassetreader s video frames using copynextsamplebuffer until cmsamplebuffergetpresentationtimestamp returns currenttime draw the frame and then draw the calayer animation content over the top

10287947
mongodb	bson
i have a collection of documents in mongodb that has an attribute being stored as a string when it would work better if it was saved as bson objectid

10287978
hide	show
i was thinking that i could use the text value of the span id ctl00_m_g_c9d562b9_1531_47ac_b0f0_24f06ecea4cc_messagelabel you ve got to love sharepoint naming lol and jquery to show and hide the comments portion based on if there is a value of success

10288039
filtering	grouping
pig s language pig latin is a simple query algebra that lets you express data transformations such as merging data sets filtering them and applying functions to records or grouping of records

10288048
width	height
my thoughts where to find the lowest height rectangle and create a rectangle that fits the width of the remaining rectangles and with some recursion figure out the rest

10288075
ubuntu	debian	mouse	keyboard
if using this exact cpu is not super important i d recommend a beagleboard or pandaboard mainly because ubuntu has installers targeted to the boards and ubuntu debian offers opencv packages out of the box and this is going to remove a whole lot of hurdles if you re new to embedded development -- basically it turns your dev board into a full-featured computer just plug in a monitor keyboard and mouse

10288075
debian	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	linux
you may be able to install debian on your board and get access to opencv packages this way but i can t vouch for the ease-of-use of this method compared to ubuntu which is difficult enough especially if you re new to linux

10288140
min	max	minimum	max
can t you keep a queue with your numbers and their arrival times along with the current maximum minimum values in the queue will probably need to keep count of the number of values at the same min max and total value of all numbers in the queue and count of elements

10288140
min	max
then when a number arrives add it to the queue and adjust the min max value and count

10288140
min	max
then look at the other end of the queue and remove all elements that are not within 1 sec of the arrival of the last number and again adjust the max min count total value

10288140
min	max
then you don t need to keep calculate anything at an instant just return the precalculated stuff ie read the current value of min max or total count

10288140
min	max
as yaman pointed out you can t retain just the min and max as when one gets removed you might not know the new one

10288140
minimum	max
then you just add and remove each number from this list as well so you ll always know the max and minimum values

10288140
min	max
this saves you having to scan all elements in the buffer to find the new max min at the expense of keeping 2 copies but updates to this list should be cheap as it is already ordered

10288165
post	put
here is a simple function which you can put in you functions.php file and add your script code and it will only show up on the new edit post page

10288167
put	get
i need to get some information about some plants and put it into mysql table

10288190
min	max
articles are average 8kb size min is 2kb max is 12kb

10288195
.htaccess	httpd.conf
enable mod_rewrite and .htaccess through httpd.conf and then put this code in your .htaccess under document_root directory

10288199
min	max
as events come in buffer them completely and calculate a running sum count min max trivial

10288199
min	max
when a request for average min or max is made loop through from the back of the buffer and start removing values older than one second

10288199
min	max
in this scenario you have average min and max updated efficiently

10288199
min	max
if the values are below min or above max you ll need to loop through the rest of the array and recalculate it

10288199
min	max
that is keep the running min max sum and count on those 10 chunks

10288199
min	max
then when you reach an invalidation scenario you generally only need to look through the latest 100ms of data or a quick pass through the min and max of the other 9 chunks

10288199
min	max
ja72 provided a great idea to save on finding the min and max values if they are invalidated

10288199
min	max
instead of keeping the min max values x_min x_max keep instead the index of where they are located in the x i array with i_min and i_max

10288199
min	max
then finding them can be trivial sometimes but when the last value considered holds the min and max the entire list needs to be scanned to establish the new limits

10288203
post	get
the closest you can get is setting up a form with hidden fields that post to their server to log them in but they check the referer header so that doesn t work

10288217
width	height
layout the first line with the width limit and get line height and fitrange using ctframesettersuggestframesizewithconstraints

10288217
width	height
layout the second line below the first one with the proper width limit â from the height of preceding lines and the spacing you want you can calculate the origin.y of the current line which you use to figure out whether this line will run against the image continuing at the end of last fitrange

10288218
int	boolean
i have a dictionary of int boolean

10288220
min	max	minimum	max
if the deleted element is minimum or maximum you ll have to calculate new min max

10288220
min	max
if it isn t you will update min max according to the new arrivals

10288241
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and firefox will just ignore the final comma

10288243
min	max
when an item is added if it s the new max or min adjust those variables accordingly

10288254
pop-up	dialog
currently when the user hovers their mouse over any image for 3 seconds a showupdateimagedialog method executes which causes a jquery dialog to pop-up

10288257
width	height
you can find the height and or width cggetimagewidth cggetimageheight

10288261
min	max
instead of keeping the min max values x_min x_max keep instead the index of where they are located in the array with i_min and i_max

10288261
min	max
then finding them can be trivial sometimes but when the last value considered holds the min and max the entire list needs to be scanned to establish the new limits

10288263
short	base
in short you cannot put a derived object in an array of base objects

10288264
min	max
if the numbers are coming one after the other then use a stopwatch and a while loop to get every number one by one for one second and calculate min max and avg

10288264
min	max
then return min max and avg

10288422
min	max
as btilly suggested in their comment on sam holder s post it would be more efficient to use a max heap and a min heap than to use a list we would again need to use a single node with pointers for both heaps and the list so we don t have to search for elements to remove them and it might be necessary to spend some time considering how to properly remove elements not at the top of the heap while maintaining the guarantee of o log n insertions and removals

10288535
junit	jmock
what makes up the standard jmock libraries and the junit libraries

10288535
junit	jmock
junit only has one jar so that s easy but jmock comes with over 10 different jars

10288554
width	height
i have figured out a few things namely that i can set the size of the widget using width and height options and that i can find the pixel height or width of said widget

10288571
google-chrome	firefox
if you are using internet explorer try using firefox or google-chrome and see if the problem persists

10288595
pull	push
i have a rails app hosted on heroku and i want to push the code to github aready created a repo on there .i tried to follow the steps in this question .since i already have a local repository and currently can push and pull from heroku i skipped step 2 and 3 .but when i do step 4

10288644
division	multiplication
multiplication division and other math functions will vary considerably in implementation depending on the numeric type so i ll need some sort of switch to determine whether to include certain headers and perhaps alter the implementation based on the numeric type

10288648
google-chrome	firefox
for example in firefox it contains the full path while in google-chrome it appears to contain only the filename haven t checked if it is the case with js access

10288652
width	height
there is only one parameter for something like width and height

10288656
ubuntu	linux
i m coding an app for linux ubuntu 11.04 with c# and mono

10288727
pull	push
now you can push and pull to any you like

10288753
post	get
on the post action i get this as null

10288764
width	height
akonsu is correct there is no support for width and height largely because calculating it is very expensive especially in vectors and groups with transformations on children

10288774
width	text-align
in that case you can use a combination of text-align center and width to get the desired effect

10288810
getter	setter
bean validation is performed on javabeans class fields with getter and setter

10288830
hide	show
so i am trying to use the validation code but in addition once all required fields are filled in and the submit button becomes active by it s return being set to true i want to a hide the form container div and b show a previously hidden div

10288832
width	height
the framelayout is set to fillparent width and height and the imageview is set to adjust view bounds so that the resulting imageview is a perfect square with each side being the length of the height of the landscape layout right aligned

10288832
width	height
the top left hand corner of the imageview is 0 0 and the bottom right corner would be the displayed width and height coordinates so that i can work out if the clicked point was past the mid-point of the imageview

10288888
profiling	debugging
set your project s debugging scheme s signing to use that developer profiling

10288895
google-chrome	firefox
this works perfectly in google-chrome and firefox

10288895
google-chrome	firefox
load this in google-chrome or firefox and either refresh or hit the next button and you ll see it retrieves a new charity

10288905
cassini	iis
when you debug it locally make sure you are running the cloud project which uses iis and not the web project which will use cassini webdevserver which does not understand the system.webserver section

10288910
web-inf	facesservlet
assuming that the jar is placed in webapp s web-inf lib folder and that you re using jsf 2.x and that webapp s context path is contextpath and the facesservlet is mapped on an url pattern of then you can reference it by the following url

10288942
httpresponse	request
additional info - below are httpresponse headers from the same exact get request one from the local deployment and the other from the gae deployment

10289008
post	get
you ll need to do some pre and post cleaning before it will get them all though

10289012
getter	setter
getter and setter are omitted

10289045
implements	extends
it looks to implements tablemodel but does not extends abstracttablemodel or defaulttablemodel

10289124
post	put
so basically take the .post call you have here and put it inside the callback of the other post or ajax and then in this callback keep what you have

10289144
for-loop	loops
if the user just closes the window it seems like it would still be executing the for-loop especially because of the scanf inside loops

10289152
google-chrome	safari
happens on safari and google-chrome webkit not sure about others

10289193
hide	show
then whenever i call startanimating i also show the imageview and when i call stopanimating i hide the imageview

10289218
vmware	esx
esx scales much better and run much faster than any of vmware desktop products like workstation or player

10289243
post	get
if you want to get fancy and process stuff in parallel can t tell the post is too confusing then use qtconcurrent run for just one example of how to launch a new thread for processing

10289250
cassini	iis
just to be sure have you replaced localhost with the actual webserver name deployed on iis since cassini doesn t accept external request

10289257
google-chrome	firefox
both google-chrome and firefox are open source and you can look at the implementation of any part of the javascript engine in the source code for those products

10289271
accessor	properties
everything is working as it should and xcode is complaining type of properties x does not match type of accessor setx as expected

10289292
google-chrome	firefox
it is possible for you to examine a browser s implementation of javascript if the browser is an open source version eg google-chrome firefox as given in other answers listed

10289298
pull	push
so i want everybody have read access to all repositories got +10 repo and +20 machines where the users can do commit pull and push

10289298
pull	push
i need to restrict only the push i want user can continue doing pull and clone but not push only 2 users can push to master

10289314
midi	osc
chuck natively supports osc and midi but i ve never seen any example of chuck exposing a raw tcp socket

10289339
width	height
since it is probably an imageobserver this can be used in place of null when getting the image width x height

10289371
implements	extends
does anybody know of a library that might contain this or will i need to extends the seekbar to implements it

10289412
post	get
now if i post to below link i get an access token but this does not work for reding the insights the access token is a relatively short string

10289415
width	height
really the only way is to use the winfo_ commands width height geometry

10289512
int	chars
â int main int chars â file.cc 180 38 error â createfooâ was not

mousemove	mousedown
i want to integrate both jqueryui draggable and sortable in my project and distinguish them using the time difference between the starting time of mousedown and first mousemove events

10289689
getter	setter
also there must be javabean style getter and setter methods for the fields of interests

10289711
draggable	droppable
so i dont think there is a way to do this without making the element only draggable since droppable would need to be dragged anyhow

10289730
versioning	upgrade
i ve just upgrade my android sdk versioning and had exactly the same issue

10289739
ubuntu	linux
i lunched a simulator program which developed on c++ in my ubuntu 11 when i want kill this process from process list of linux and want to run it again i faced to this error

10289742
union	distinct
note i took out the distinct clauses the union will make the result distinct anyway so it is superfluous

10289758
portrait	landscape
after that all you need to know is what the current orientation is portrait or landscape in order to know which bits of code to call with findviewbyid ...

10289815
restrict	shared
the problem with all these wrappers and container abstractions is that they restrict you to the common subset of the functionallity that all the containers shared

10289846
ubuntu	debian
here it is for ubuntu debian

10289894
google-chrome	safari
the first step would be check the web inspector in safari or google-chrome

10289894
google-chrome	safari
if you need to use remote debugger functionality just like web inspector in safari google-chrome you could use weinre

10289937
put	get
even if you fix the difference in types you ll need to keep in mind that what will get put on to the vector are copies of the queue which may or may not be what you want

10289947
google-chrome	safari
looks like we ll have to settle with safari google-chrome

10289947
google-chrome	safari
if you choose safari or google-chrome you donâ t need to install gears.

if you want to get rid of this bugging message consider to switch you webdriver automated browser to google-chrome if firefox is not the required browser for your implementation

10290080
int	double
this is so due to the fact that you are using the int data type when you should be using a floating-point data type such as double

10290090

children	parent
this is because only the parent knows the amount of space available for each child this method is being called after all children are measured and the container knows it s own given size

10295144
width	height	children	parent
this method exists because if parent would set width and height on children directly they would immediately turn into fixed size children and they won t be measured anymore

10295144
width	height	children	parent
using this method only the rendering size is being changed - not the explicit width and height but _width and _height - meaning if for some reason the container resizes again the children will be resized by given rules percentage of the parent expanding to child component s children size etc.

10295144
width	height
by non attractive i consider the layout that isn t supposed to do anything smart like change the width and height of children at all like absolute layout

anyway it is rendered with proper width and height because at rendering time the dimensions are known
