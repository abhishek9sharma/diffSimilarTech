46900549
min	max
previous to adding them the slider worked but it wasn t auto-calculating min max and no errors were thrown so i just hard-coded min max

46900549
min	max
it appears though that hard-coded min max break the slider when i tried to swap attributenames irrespective of whether the values were in attributesforfaceting

46900549
min	max
so i removed the hard-coded min max and since i d added the attributes to attributesforfaceting the min max were calculated correctly and i was able to swap between attributes just fine

i still can see the original root directory for instance the upper level of xenial-32bit folder

46900822
ceil	floor
if floor t2 t1 is the number of times that task1 interferes in task2 why the function applied to t2 t1 is floor and not ceil

46900827

you declared that the variable will have setter and getter both in protocol

46900847
hide	show
if the applet loads then the background is opaque so it will hide the content in the bottom if it never loads then it will show the content in the back

46900869

my program needs a fifo queue to hold all of these events going

46900893
range	minimum
for range find the histogram index with the minimum value index

46900902
avaudiosession	mpvolumeview
however for the input and that includes bluetooth devices with hfp profile if the proper audio session mode is used avaudiosessionmodevoicechat or avaudiosessionmodevideochat for example one can get the list of the available input via avaudiosession s availableinputs and those inputs are listed there even when that device is not an active route - this is very useful when a user is doing a manual override via mpvolumeview from bluetooth to the speaker for example and since hfp is a 2-way io has both input and output you can judge whether output hfp bluetooth is still available by looking at the inputs

46900930
getter	setter
to the getter or setter function by property contract is provided the instance of the object that holds the property itself lineitem in this case that in turn can access to the storage_name variable

firstly use a int object not a double as you are working with 3 int

46900976
int	chars
in brief create a int array of length 26 which represent 26 chars let s call this the counter array

46900976
int	chars
for each chars encountered increment the corresponding int in the counter array

46901022
int	double
however if i wanted to have an image with 64-bit unsigned int for each rgba component i know it s absurdly high how would i go about finding a float double between 0 and 1 that represents how far between 0 and the max uint64_t my pixel value is

46901022
int	double
i assume that converting to double wouldn t work because double are generally 64-bit floats and you can t capture all 64-bit unsigned int values in a 64-bit float

46901044
width	height
i define the main plot s height width explicitly

46901045

i don t believe an arrays is necessary for this program you could probably just do both your input and output in a single for-loop but if you wanted to use one it might make sense to put the results of your calculations in it

46901360
for-loop	arrays
you can use a for-loop to put things into and read values out of the arrays - for example reading the values out of the arrays might look like this

46901426
folder	dir
for example the path variable above has 5 sub folder inside the images dir currently right now

hash	md5
it then calculates the md5 hash of the configuration file and looks

46901605

short	base
the short answer is because the libstc++ standard library implementation used by gcc and clang on linux implements std tuple with a non non-trivial move constructor in particular the _tuple_impl base class has a non-trivial move constructor

46901813
libstdc++	libc++
you can see this clearly if you switch to using libc++ rather than the linux default of libstdc++ - this implementation doesn t have the explicit move constructor as marc glisse mentions in the comments they are stuck with this implementation for backwards compatibility

width	margin
now if you want to center it then use left 50 and then give it a negative left margin equals to half of its width margin-left -10px

46902350
width	margin
if the second image should not be exactly in the center and it needs to be off the center to overlap some spot of the first image then change the value of the left margin until you get the result you want or you can do it scientifically by measuring how much off-center the spot on the first image is then subtract half of the width of the second image and change the result to negative then assign that value to the left margin

i was wondering if it is possible to import an object in a matlab level-2 s-function within simulink

matlab	simulink
my work flow is as follows the main matlab function where policy object is initialized calls the simulink file with the dynamic model

i cannot keep the object only within the s-function hence initialising it within the initialisation function because i need to update its weights in the main matlab script

and if i decide to double the number of columns in my gridlayout the gray area has a width and height of 100dp etc

46914837

fortunately the docs give an example how to replace the percentframelayout which works great if the gray box has a fixed width and height

width	height
i ve used resize_to_fit to reduce images to a specific pixel size depending on the longer side but i m wondering if it s possible to do it with this logic instead for any image whose width x height product is greater than a set value resize the image so that the new width and height values are as large as possible while still being under that value

46915587
width	height
so let s say an image has a width of 2793px and a height of 1970px

46915587
width	height
it thus goes through the conditional statement and as of right now outputs a new width of 2030 and height of 1432

46915587
width	height
but there are other possible width x height combinations whose product could be much closer to 4 000 000 pixels than 2 906 960 is

min	max
i have researched this issue and tried to solve the problem by implementing this solution but by using min instead of max

46916269
min	max
for example i have a row with a cell containing the value 10.2 which is the only cell highlighted in this row even though it is neither the min nor max of the specified row

46916275
width	height
i am using selenium getsize function to get width and height of an element

46916326
min	max
if you are ok with an approximate solution render the text to an empty canvas use getimagedata to check the transparency of all pixels and figure out the max and min x and y where you find filled points

46916326
width	height
you might think in increasing the canvas size if this happens to get the real width and height but if you don t limit the font size and the amount of text you might end with a canvas so big that slows down the browser or maybe even crashes it.

46916326
width	height
you might think in using the width provided by measuretext might help but unfortunately to get the top and height you need to scan the full image

uninstall	upgrade
generally the real fix is to create a minor upgrade or a minor upgrade patch to hotfix the error in the uninstall sequence and then uninstall the product the normal way will work regardless if it is a major upgrade uninstall or a manually triggered uninstall

46917737
uninstall	upgrade
this is possible because a minor upgrade doesn t uninstall the existing product the failing uninstall custom actions will never run but just updates the product in place or overwrites it

46917737
uninstall	upgrade
the easiest approach for your minor upgrade package is probably to set a condition that will always be false on all failing uninstall custom actions so that they never run once uninstall is actually triggered

46917737
uninstall	upgrade
this caches the new msi on the system and is crucial for minor upgrade to work correctly - in particular for your purpose of fixing the uninstall sequence

now compare the sizes of each one and set the columns according to your need for example a device tablet in portrait can achieve 1024px so you can use col-md-2 or col-lg-2 this will create 6 same sized columns inside one row and for a larger screens such as more than 1024px you use col-xl-2 it will create 6 columns in one row

46918041

46923610
box-sizing	margin	box-sizing	border-box	margin	border-box
if i use the box-sizing property to border-box does it make resetting margin and padding to 0 irrelevant or is it still something i should do

46923661
getter	setter
in all respects this is just the same as in java since access to private properties with default getter and setter is optimized so that no function call overhead is introduced

46923672

inherited	properties
if i understand your question right it sounds like you want your new class test to simply inherited all of the binary and unary methods defined for the class of the properties x and operate on properties x when invoking them so that you don t have to redefine them all yourself

46924763
inherited	properties	inherited	subclassing
if this is what you want then i think the only feasible way to do something like it is to actually use inherited and make your class test a subclassing of the class of properties x

46924909
fgets	fread
as far as how to read the data from disk it probably doesn t matter since calls like fread and fgets use buffering in both the c standard library and at the filesystem layer so that even if you are reading in small amounts one line of text at a time by the time the request hits the actual i o hardware it is a larger more efficient read-ahead request that will use the hardware efficiently anyway

46924909
fgets	fread
that is to say you can try reading in a megabyte or 100 megabytes in a single fread call if you want to and then going through the giant buffer to parse out the individual lines of text but i think you will find that it isn t noticeably faster than just calling fgets in a loop until you get to the end of the file

46924938

installation	upgrade
normally the suite isn t used to install a temporary package like the minor upgrade would be nor does it have a clean way to automate package removal during installation

46935947
versioning	upgrade
if you follow the pattern of the ispreventdowngrade entry and custom action you can use a type 19 error custom action to show a message and abort the major upgrade when the older versioning is present

46935947
versioning	upgrade
if all specific range of versioning exhibit this behavior but older ones work fine consider adding a secondary detect only major upgrade and condition your custom action against the secondary upgrade s action property

46935947
uninstall	upgrade
note you can try to couple this with a ui sequence action that attempts to automate the uninstall or minor upgrade

46935947
versioning	upgrade
but there s an option in attributes column of the upgrade table that allows you to ignore failures during the removal of the older versioning

46935947
versioning	upgrade
i would strongly recommend some thorough qa on this approach including faking a newer major versioning to ensure that further upgrade still do the right thing

46936035
lambdify	sympy
i already wrote a wrapper function around lambdify that unpacks the values before applying the sympy expression and packs up the result but it involves checking whether the type of an argument is a list or a container which is against the whole duck-typing philosophy of python

comparator	comparable
binarysearch invocations without passing a comparator assume that your objects are sorted based on their natural ordering which implies they are comparable which we cannot know with your code

the 32x32 favicon would be repeating if you made the width height of the container bigger or made the background-size smaller like this making the background-size 32px or you can just remove that property if you actually just want it to be the default size of the image

46938368
filtering	grouping
which provides a list of all security grouping but showing nested data for any sgs with 22 0.0.0.0 0 and successfully ignoring any 0.0.0.0 0 acls for other ports in the output below sg1 is what i m interested and sg2 sg3 needs to be filtering out

istream	getline
so i rebuilded by using getline directly from the istream instead of the std library but the same happens

46938935
implements	extends
you should implements ambientmode.ambientcallbackprovider instead of wearableactivity then you can extends fragmentactivity instead

46938981
post	get
but what i d really like to do is make sure that comes into the various methods post get etc. with whitespace already stripped so i don t have to process each variable manually each time

46938998

int	chars
bufferedreader.read returns a single chars as an int

46939188
int	chars
to turn this into the correct letter use chars reader.read which can then be put into a string read to an int - currently if the reader reads 5 it will give you the number value of it 53 and you convert that to a string 53 and parse that to an int 53 again

division you should be able to figure out multiplication is just shifting and adding and can turn that into multiple operations as well

46939603
multiplying	add
n bits n bits 2 n bits so if you have an 8 bit 8 bit 16 bit multiplying you can use that on an 8 bit system otherwise you have to limit to 4 bits 4 bits 8 bits and work with that or if no multiplying then just do the shift and add

i would like to create a vertex class and would like to genericise it by being able to create a 32 bit float and 64 bit double version and maybe int version

46939706
for-loop	loops
your output looks weird because you re missing a closing div tag in your loops and if you want to reverse the order of your list you can just turn your for-loop around by counting down to 0 instead of counting up to length

46939749
children	parent
if you wanted to each parent s children listed together for example

46939912
hide	show
so far i am able to hide code chunks results and comments using below but my html file still show graphs from my code

46939923
getter	setter
i also don t think getter and setter are as common though not unheard of since python is so dynamic anyway

46939932
min	max
in r functions already exist to find the element-wise max and min so i could easily create a new variable that is equal to the largest or smallest value across the columns of interest

46939934
dictionary	map
just create a mapper a dictionary and then map onto the middle columns

46939938
min	max
however my 10 and 150 threshold come from some upstream pipe command and i would need to refer to them as min and max so if i do

46939938

your app would them just make an http post request send the image and get the resulting text as a response

for-loop	loops
note that since you ve declared your map mymap inside the for-loop you re creating an entirely new map every iteration of loops

46944771
setinterval	settimeout
solutions involving settimeout setinterval and polling are hideous and in the first case will almost certainly make the page load more slowly for the actual user who is not googlebot particularly as they are probably using a mobile phone - mostly only webkit browsers ios android chrome did not support the load event on link elements at the time this question was posted remarkably ie did since ie7 or earlier

46952620
swift	objective-c
if swift is supposed to be a better version of objective-c and with swift 4 we can do nearly everything in swift that objective-c can do why doesn t apple just convert over to swift and outdate objective-c i understand it will take time and money to do and its not just gonna happen overnight

46952620
swift	objective-c
it seems to me that swift would be way simpler to learn then objective-c for beginners i know because i learned it in like 2 months and swift is less complicated and better laid out then objective-c

46952620

unfortunately the security rule method above won t work as a way to filtering the grouping list but only as a method to deny access to specific grouping nodes

46954107
filtering	grouping
instead you ll need to retrieve the list of blockedgroups for the user and retrieve all the grouping then do a client-side filtering to ignore or discard the grouping that the user doesn t want to see

46954107
filtering	grouping
alternatively depending on the requirements for your app if you don t want to perform client-side filtering you could flip the grouping management to be opt-in rather than opt-out and use a list of subscribedgroups instead and then loop through this list to retrieve each grouping from the database individually by key

46954134
for-loop	loops
you are using the variable i in the inner second for-loop which resets the value of i hence the infinite loops

i can aggregate groups of columns in the example above with mean min max

i guess this is possible in artifactory and nexus 3 as well but i do not have experience

with those simple arrays they are able to use something like a for-loop with

46957613
flyway	liquibase
you can do data migration with liquibase and flyway

46957613
flyway	liquibase
possibly flyway and liquibase are better thought of as database versioning tools

46957613
flyway	liquibase
so all that said i think you might have the wrong idea about flyway and liquibase

46958061
for-loop	loops
if you want to use for-loop then you will need to also create outer function because variable defined in that loops will not be lexically scoped so you can end up with submiting same form multiple times

instead of moving the value pos by half each time you just set it the average of min and max which is not correct

46962974

basically it gets the orientation confused so you need to check the width vs the height to make sure it is doing it right and rotate it if not

46983542
portrait	landscape
i changed the config.xml to landscape instead of portrait or landscape but it made no difference

46983570

can i use java getter and setter in mybatis result map

46984107
min	max
when the form loads i have min as o.3 and max as 0.5

46984107
min	max
so if u change the field min as 0.8 the error shows up as min should be less than max till that moment the field will be shown as red border since it is wrong

46984107
min	max
when i go and change my max as 0.9 the red border should automatically disappear since technically now min is less than max

int	double
the command if compares double quoted strings always with including the double quotes as strings and never runs an int comparison on using double quotes on any side

stdout	stderr
results in output of ffprobe.exe written to handle stderr being redirected also in the background command process to handle stdout for being also captured and processed by for

46984109

but the for command line should work in case of ffprobe.exe outputs really just ac3 to either stdout or stderr and nothing else

46984115
width	height
and then obtain height and width

46984182
min	max
therefore need to define common histogram breaks across all columns we can do this by finding the min and max of all data and decide on binwidth that we use consistently across all histograms

hide	show
to header class- this is because when you are hiding the content then you are increasing the height of div by height of text and if height of text is more than 400px then on hiding the height of header will increase which will result in non-allignment of two divs it will happen in the case when you show the second div and then hide that div.try without max-height

46985061
oncreate	ondestroy
in scenario 1 where we attach detach the view in oncreate ondestroy once the async login operation finish and we should replace to registrationfragment or show errordialogfragment there is a chance we will meet the famous illegalstateexception

46985061
onresume	onpause
in scenario 2 where we attach detach the view in onresume onpause once the async login operation finish we won t be able to replace fragment or show a dialog because the view is already detached

46985077
width	height
..just choose landscape orientation and if the width of the device will fit the height of the screen you can choose 100 and then rotate the device even if it won t all fit on screen

46985080
int	boolean
for example the int 0 is treated as false in a boolean context while any non-zero int is treated as true

realloc	malloc
if i want to try to preform the malloc again and allocate less data do i use realloc or do i use malloc again

46985347
realloc	malloc
if allocptr was equal to null couldn t i use malloc on it instead of realloc on it because i thought realloc can t take a pointer that equals null

46985650
realloc	malloc
the second is the possible similarity between realloc and malloc in error cases

46985650
realloc	malloc
realloc takes amongst other things a pointer to the memory block previously allocated by malloc

46985650
realloc	malloc
however if the pointer happens to be null then realloc works exactly the same as malloc and a new block is allocated

46985650
realloc	malloc
and if the realloc call should fail the return is a null pointer just like malloc .

46985650
realloc	malloc
references c++ malloc c++ realloc

onitemlongclicklistener	onitemclicklistener
the the cursoradapter can be easy to handle as the item listeners onitemclicklistener and onitemlongclicklistener are passed the value of the _id column note that as such the cursor used must have an _id column a good reason to have _id integer primary key or _id integer primary key autoincrement the former is more efficient for most cases

46986030

46987669
median	minimum
sample input wood having cut with 1 3 5 9 16 22 would have minimum cost 163 when we first start with median 9 then we would have wood of mark 1 3 5 9 and 9 16 22 now first solving the left wood we would have 1 3 5 5 9 now again cutting we have 1 3 3 5 5 9 and the one which was left 9 16 22 now on operating this wood we have cut all the marks and the list would be 1 3 3 5 5 9 9 16 16 22 and the cost on this operation would be minimum

47005230
for-loop	loops
this code contains a for-loop similar to while loops that is commented

47005238
for-loop	arrays
the callback in array.map has to follow a set format for its arguments callback element index arrays but by having the callback act alone in a for-loop that restriction is lifted

47005437
floating-point	integer	min	max
i was wondering about some of the math or theory of whether a signed integer or signed floating-point representation in n bits encodes more granularity between its min and max values or if the two encode the same granularity

47005437
min	max
max min will be the sample with the largest absolute value observed and 0 will represent silence

47005437
floating-point	integer	min	max
my instinct as that integer and floating-point representations will contain the same level of granularity because each can encode 2 32 distinct values between min and max

47005437
min	max
my instinct is that a floating point representation would concentrate more of its granularity around zero and retain less granularity near its max min values

47005446
des	aes
the standard sunjce factories for des and desede do check fix length and parity fwliw but the bc ones plus aes beginning with 1.56 don t even do that

multiplying	transpose
if a vector is multiplied to a matrix from the left the result corresponds to to multiplying a column vector to the transpose matrix from the right

47005569
multiplying	transpose
this corresponds to multiplying a column vector to the transpose matrix from the right

47005569
multiplying	transpose
thus multiplying a vector from the left to a matrix corresponds to multiplying it from the right to the transpose matrix

47005569
multiplying	transpose
your solution works because if a vector is multiplied to a matrix from the left the result corresponds to multiplying a vector to the transpose matrix from the right

47005569
multiplying	transpose
you initialize the uniform with the transpose matrix and you multiplying the vector from the left to the matrix

47022792
for-loop	loops
your for-loop doesn t need an initializer since you already did that outside loops preceding it

47022823
int	chars
and use a list-comprehension to get the corresponding int for each chars in the string from the dictionary and then join these together to form one complete string of numbers

47022825
dictionary	map
as a workaround i see two routes possible to achieve this effect manually invoke the get method for a dictionary by using the elemment wise apply or chain a map followed by a fillna which both have the advantage of being vectorized operations

47022838
hide	show
and additionally go even further at the page level saying hide show the delete button if the user s role does not have claim deleteproduct kind of like what this view-based authorization documentation is saying

47023636
jobs	cron
i have noticed scheduling jobs with cron yaml but the number of calls is limited

47023671
width	height
the best looking option is to write a custom viewport class that sizes your world width and height such that you will be always be drawing the sprites pixel perfect or at a whole number multiple

47023671
width	height
as a shortcut rather than writing a custom viewport class i used a stretchviewport and simply changed its world width and height right before updating it in the game s resize method

47023671
width	height
now you may still have rounding artifacts if your pixel scale becomes something that isn t cleanly divisible for both the screen width and height

47023671
width	height
you might want to do a bit more in your calculations like round pixelscale off to the nearest common integer factor between screen width and height

47023687
sorting	grouping
or desc designators but relying on implicit grouping by sorting is

47023687

47023767
google-chrome	firefox
i have found that the code below works fine to scrap the contributors count if the repo s url was previously loaded in a browser google-chrome or firefox but it fails and returns an empty element when or if the html page wasn t loaded first in a web browser

47023768
width	height
you can use a textarea element and set a specific height and width

47023791
for-loop	loops
so this loops named range-based for-loop

47023825
int	chars
as for converting to chars arrays as mentioned in the comments it s worth to notice that the convertion function will do similar arithmetic operations in order to convert the int to chars array so doing the reversing using int seems more convenient

47023877
width	height
and move calculation of desired width and height based on props into componentwillrecieveprops where animated.timing starts

47023877
width	height
also you have to separate width and height into different animated values and than join both animations with animated.parallel

47023960
sorting	filtering
that is keep the 5-10 main columns that you use for filtering and sorting as real columns then put the rest of the key-value junk into a json column

47023965
button	checkbox
there s another workaround which is to change the android button in a checkbox to another drawable with an xml template but it s a bit more complex requires at least 2 more files for the states

with swift things are a little more complicated because by default swift methods are not exposed to objective-c unless we explicitly make it so via the objective-c keyword if the method is an override of an objective-c superclass method or if the method satisfies an objective-c protocol

i realize that this post does not mention bootstrap css as a keyword or tag but one thing i would mention is that if you are having the exact same result which is that the radio buttons do not show up in google-chrome but are present in firefox and ie but you are also using bootstrap css then you will want to ensure that you do not have the class name form-control on the radio button input tag specifically

children	parent
viewport units vh vw is commonly used to give a parent a responsive but fixed height where percent on its children will work though can sometimes not be possible

47034130
children	parent
a much better practice is the use of sigchld signal which is sent to parent process when one of its children dies

47034130
children	parent
thus catching it in parent can let you make every decision you need for example construct a list of currently died children by waiting the way you basically did looping on waitpid in non blocking mode

i would actually put the authorization check before the controller is being called kinda like described here i really need to update that old post

put	get
it would normally be easier to do with with two or three queries and put the data together elsewhere - especially as you have different things in each column and you will probably have to wrap the whole thing in another selection to get the ordering that would make this work

47035355
put	get	post	get	post	put
also note that get and delete methods have different signature than post and put there is no payload parameter so you need to pass as second parameter for those methods

47035426

47036077
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
whenever it says server receive it means that the server found a sent object from the client and when it says server send it would be the sent object by the server via the objectinputstream and objectoutputstream

47036077
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
i conclude from this log output that objectinputstream in the client and the objectoutputstream in the server are indeed functioning correctly however the object sent by the objectoutputstream on the server is not equal to the object immediately received by the objectinputstream on the client

47036094
post	get
the only difference between the post and get methods is their signature

47038163
x86	64bit
now it seems this is due to the way floats and doubles are represented and i m using a 64bit x86 vm with an old rhel

47038190
folder	directory
based on doclet docs i have to use colon to separate multiple source folder colon-separated list of source-file directory like this

47038205
queue	fifo
my implementation used a fifo queue but even if i built a tree the pairwise merge would require more memory

47038232
cout	cin
since the left-hand operand here is std cout or std cin you don t have much control over its members or its namespace

47038274
box-sizing	border-box	height	border-box
remember to use box-sizing border-box on the .header element so that the declared height will take into account the border

47038286
width	height
an inline element does not have height or width so these are 0x0

47038320
prometheus	grafana
i use prometheus 2.0.0-beta.2 and grafana to view the graph for a simple gauge time series of the form

47038320
prometheus	metrics	prometheus	grafana	grafana	metrics
10 30 and that these values are included in the graph in some instances but not others perhaps due to the period shown by grafana shifting at odd offsets relative to new recorded metrics arriving in prometheus

47038342
bower	npm
background i m trying to move this package moment-recur from bower to npm in our angular 1.5 app and having some trouble

47038407
gdal	ogr
is there any way to dissolve merge overlapping polygons using any gdal ogr api or command line tool while keeping the resulting non overlapping areas distinct

47038477
uiview	subviews
from figure while loading the uiviewcontroller bs view as a subviews into the uiviewcontroller as uiview the frame size set to the uiviewcontroller bs view is not reflected and as a result the tableview goes out of screen

47038477
width	height
in viewcontroller b all the ui elements height and width are defined relative to the controllerbs width and height

47038508
hide	show
on my second view i then show hide the controls based on the updated claim

47038533
packets	multicast
i am trying the multicast sample of boost asio document to receive udp packets

47038545
symfony	silex	laravel	silex	laravel	slim	silex	slim
of course it is very basic example and for real site it is much better to use some micro- framework like silex slim laravel symfony etc

47038560
apache	nginx
sometimes this is not easy but we can manage it for example we can use nginx instead of apache to have a different webserver after we tested it on our laptop

47038588
libxml2	libxslt	lxml	libxslt	lxml	libxml2
in order to import it i copied the recipe files of bs4 and the necessarry libraries lxml libxml2 libxslt which are written at this website

47038588
folder	directory
i created new recipe folder in .buildozer android platform python-for-android-master pythonforandroid recipes directory for bs4 and it s dependencies and then i put the __init__.py files to these new folder according to the above website

47038588
folder	directory
i put this folder in .buildozer android platform python-for-android-master pythonforandroid recipes directory

47038590

47038672
maven	pom.xml
a popular framework is maven based on the project object model pom.xml specification

47038708

what you want to do is to show or hide the span element containing the error message depending on the input value

47038727
int	chars
i would like to turn each chars in the int into a variable so like this

47038739
entities	entitymanager
why doctrine recognize my entities namespace when i created them when i did the crud but it does not when i using the entitymanager

47038751
versioning	upgrade
to solve which i had to follow first suggestion upgrade plugin versioning to 3.0.0-beta7 and sync project

47038905
division	modulo
use the modulo and force integer division

47038933
width	height
i am trying to resize the image change the width height and quality of the image but even after many attempts i am not able to achieve the desired result

47038940
for-loop	loops
it should show me every time 1 row but now the for-loop count to top and then it goes to the while loops

47038945
google-chrome	firefox
some seconds in other browsers when using google-chrome while other browsers ie firefox load in normal time

47038958
integer	fractions
you are performing integer division which will only return integer part without fractions part of the result which in your case is always 0 because number of heads tails is never greater than flips

47038960
prometheus	metrics
there s no store of server metrics - you can use something like jboss operations network to collect them or if you enable jmx you could probably collect them in prometheus

47038967
httpresponse	request
from the logged httpresponse i can see the request which was actually sent -

47039047
versioning	upgrade
i want to upgrade opencart versioning from 1.5.6 to 2.2 - but i get an error

47039067
put	get
with angular your pages get placed inside of a container div and then you can put anything that shows up on every page header nav footer outside of the container

47039121
sudo	passwd
the sudo passwd issue will depend entirely on your source ami source_ami ami-61bbf104

47039121
sudo	passwd
if the ami is self managed you will need to ensure the user you are using centos has the ability to sudo and providing you have other security in place ssh keys you could remove the passwd

47039125
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
i tried viewing the page on google-chrome firefox and safari and the results are the same

47039128
opera	google-chrome
i tested on google-chrome opera and internet explorer which output the printing perfectly fine

47039155
folder	directory
i want to copy in a single folder all files just the file not the directory that contain the file from multiple folder in a single path

47039161
put	get
using this knowledge you could get the number of years of the tree since it s an assignment for collegue i guess... i ll not put the code for that but i will give you a hint of a way to do it substract inside a loop until you have zero leaves

47039205
apache	nginx
this works great on my dev machine which is using apache instead of nginx so it s definitely something with nginx php configuration that s causing this

47039241
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
if you visit this web page on a mac desktop using firefox google-chrome or safari you can drag drop any file or group of files onto the red target and see the file name s displayed in the javascript console

47039241
dropbox	icloud
then bring up the files app in split screen mode and drag and drop files from dropbox or icloud onto the red target

47039250
hide	show
one of the ways do that is to handle the hide and show inside each of the child component comp1 and comp2

47039250
hide	show	prop	each
so you will still render both comp1 and comp2 from the parent component but you will pass a prop to each one of them to tell them if they need to show or hide inner content if show then render the correct component content else just render empty

47039310
hide	show
the basic idea here is to hide one panel and show another

47039316
pull	push
ideally i would like to be able to commit to projectroot as a normal git project and push and pull changes from the 3 additional repositories as needed

47039346
grafana	metrics
i m trying to build a graph in grafana that aggregates a metrics over hour time periods

47039350
hide	show
be able to hide show columns using checkboxes on a pop-up window

47039384
uiview	subviews
i am trying to create the following setup with autolayout to my uitableview before i add it as a subviews of its wrapper uiview

47039413
google-chrome	safari
it works in google-chrome but in safari the css animation stops as soon as the form is submitted

47039413
google-chrome	safari
save the contents in a html file and open it in google-chrome first to see how it should behave and then open in safari to see the issue

47039433
tiff	png
this renderer can open images png jpg tiff but can t open pdf file

47039448
boost	eigen
since a single running lasts for tens or hundreds of hours even when using 20 cpu cores simultaneously it would be highly required for me to be able to use the eigen library along with boost odeint to gain a factor of three in runtime

47039448
boost	eigen
i have also found very similar situations see using boost odeint with eigen matrix as a state vector or using several eigen matrices as statetypes in boost odeint

47039448
boost	eigen
the next thing i tried was to use the support to eigen provided by the boost odeint developers

47039448
boost	eigen
it seems like boost odeint v1.65.1 is not compatible with eigen v3.3.4

47039448
boost	eigen
my question is if there is an un official header file that provides a support of eigen 3.3.4 to boost odeint 1.65.1 or did i make something wrong during template specializations and or operator overloading for the vector space algebra

47039458
superclass	subclassing
since the objc_getclasslist is objective-c and it cannot get the superclass uilabel but all the subclassing only but for uikit related swizzling we just want to run it once on the superclass

47039512
for-loop	arrays
i want to copy this arrays into the parallel for-loop region in such a way that each gang is going to have a copy of this arrays and will be able to change their own version of arrays and not the others using the recursion function

47039523
react-router-dom	react-router-redux
i think you should change version of react-router-redux because react-router-redux 4.0.8 works only with react-router v3 but you use react-router v4 react-router-dom

47039525
bots	api.ai
i m trying to integrate a bots that we are creating with api.ai

47039529
prop	classname
when typing you are just declaring that you send to optionsmenu component a prop named classname that holds the value classes.optionsposition

47039529
prop	classname
in optionsmenu component you can use this prop and apply it as a classname on a html dom element div span etc

47039581
min	max
if you have varchar or varbinary columns then the difference between min and max can be quite substantial and your actual memory use is usually somewhere in between but can be difficult to predict because it depends on the actual size of the strings that you load

47039677
for-loop	arrays
so if you iterate over the length of the arrays with a for-loop and find any index where the age is 15 you can match that index with your name arrays

47039713
google-chrome	firefox
since all major browser google-chrome firefox edge showed the same behavior i suspected that they were working as intended

47039726
getter	setter
generation of setter or getter also do not work

47039763
put	get
can this get them in trouble if i make software that would get that info and put it in a database

47039785
children	parent
basically the parent is the first column of the table and the children are the others columns

47039787
move	drag
now i see that it s a feature since your finger is in the way and you can t really see well if it doesn t move the screen during a drag

47039792
put	get
all what we want to get in the output has to be put inside a list instruction

47039860
superclass	subclassing
there are several strategies to eliminate the need for subclassing to have methods not present in the superclass

47039860
superclass	subclassing
if a subclassing requires additional inputs compared to the superclass provide these inputs via the constructor rather than creating seperate methods that operate on these inputs

47039860
superclass	subclassing
if a subclassing requires additional behavior not supported by the superclass support this behavior via composition read strategy pattern rather than adding methods to support additional behavior

47039860
superclass	subclassing
once you eliminate the need to have specialized methods in the subclassing not present in the superclass your code automatically eliminates the need to have instanceof or type checks

47039881
primefaces	omnifaces
i m using primefaces with omnifaces i can t eliminate render-blocking javascript and css in above-the-fold content from omnifaces.combined

47039898
width	height
pin the current plot dimensions width height in inches

47039911
width	height
the textureregion will hold a reference to a texture where the region is stored as well as the width height x position and y position of the image in the texture

47039944
qstring	qtextedit
you need to get each line of the wrapped text as it displayed inside the qtextedit as a separate qstring right

47039944
qtextedit	qtextdocument
qtextdocument from qtextedit control stores its text by paragraphs represented by qtextblock each paragraph laid out as a set of text lines qtextline

47039948
for-loop	arrays
so the for-loop won t iterate over a zero index arrays it would have no sense.

47039984
postgresql	mysql
i wrote an article about how you can map json objects on both postgresql and mysql

47039992
range	min	range	max	min	max
we just check if the max of time equal the min in the specific range you have in where clause

47040049
versioning	upgrade
i think you ll need to upgrade your docker for mac versioning for this to work

47040062
post	get
using the medium api is it possible to get all of the post i have recommended or clapped

47040080
getter	setter
though i added getter and setter i was getting the same error

47040080
getter	setter
later i found a bug that is by sonar s advice i cgahnged the getter and setter as protected which was causing the issue

47040089
google-chrome	firefox
works perfectly fine on google-chrome firefox etc

47040089
google-chrome	firefox
however when i enable under attack mode websockets fails to connect on google-chrome receiving 503 service temporarily unavailable but can connect on firefox

47040159
put	get
then i try to put them in an associative array using the variable i get an error

47040160
client-side	server-side
i do not like having both client-side and server-side scripts bound to the same button the execution order of the code is not easily managed

47040181
squash	merge	squash	branch
i would like to know how squash all commits of merge branch like this

47040195
mamp	wamp
you will need to use something like wamp mamp vagrant or docker to manage your php mysql environment

47040196
hash	md5
in my previous version images are distributed into sub-directories of wguploaddirectory based on the first two characters of the md5 hash of the filename

47040238
min	max
there appears to be one way to do this using a dataframe as a lookup table with min and max values shown here and that seems to be one possibility example below

47040331
width	height
the first dimension is the width the second the height and the last will be the color channels r g b

47040339
put	get
for a handy way to get the simulator folder put a breakpoint somewhere in code then in xcode debugger

47040369
int	chars
you can use some hashing algorithm which will convert that to an int hash and then consider each bit of it as part of the bit array or chars array

47040371
google-chrome	firefox
that height is respected on firefox but collapsed to 0px on google-chrome

47040372
build.gradle	gradlew
to the library s build.gradle file but a gradlew error pops up saying unable to resolve dependency and could not resolve project app

47040373
folder	directory
i m using windows server 2012 r2 with apache and php 5.6 and only i need to put these files in that working directory not working in htdocs in apache folder

47040378
folder	directory
at the moment i have to navigate to the casa... bin directory and type . casa but i need to access casa from other folder in future

47040388
width	height
both position relative and position static which is the default btw so any element that has no position definition is static means that the elements are arranged in the flow of all elements according to their settings height width content in the order in which they appear

47040418
folder	directory
one word of caution with 500 000 files in the folder and all of the files having very similar prefixes if your file system has 8.3 directory naming turned on which is often the default it is possible to run into problems using wildcards

47040445
whatsapp	hangout
add to maps camera facebook set as profile picture whatsapp hangout save to google drive etc

47040499
inherited	properties
properties are inherited only from parent poms

47040531
google-chrome	firefox
when you have flex-basis 0 google-chrome and firefox compute to flex-basis 0px

47040570
min	max
ok so what i ve done is use a cte common table expression to get the aggregates you require min max prices i like cte s because they are simple and easy to read but they are not always the best way forward however in this case it fits the bill nicely

47040570
min	max
so with the min and max figures isolated against each productid it s simply a case of grabbing the the current price which based upon your data example is a simple where clause that checks if the enddate is null

47040601
for-loop	loops
have seen other posts but i don t know when to enter the while loops or for-loop for my program run until it meets conditions which is enter a number between 1 and 20 and the run the code

47040674
put	get
why don t you just put your data into a data frame then just get the first 60 of the row and put it into a train df the next 20 in a nottrain1 df and last 20 in nottrain2 df

47040693
waitpid	fork
if you really want to use waitpid 2 you ll better use the usual fork 2 and execve 2 in your own code but that is not the qt way of doing

47040718
post	get
i call the rest api as documented to get the post i want

post	get
because the documentation only show get method and not post

47040877

firefox working perfectly ie safari too

47041168
min	max
see what are elastic searches max and min dates by default

47041177
getter	setter
i have a typescript class where i have a few getter and setter methods for few variables

47041177
getter	setter
i would like to add one more variable to this class and add a getter setter for this

47041177
getter	setter
however this variable is not a simple string boolean primitive but needs to be some sort of json that would could have its own properties say color size shape that can be set i do not want 3 extra variables for these 3 propeties with their corresponding getter setter methods but just one json that would hold 3 different properties

47041179
google-chrome	firefox
also of note there appear to be only firefox and google-chrome options in the project from seleniumhq

47041209
tensorflow	bazel
check out the instructions on bazel build for tensorflow here

47041214
min	max
you can drill down at various resolutions such as routes or individual endpoints in real time and it can report min max mean time for completion and more just using jconsole

47041243
many-to-many	one-to-many
this works great on one-to-many relationships for getting the values of lookup columns like type or status columns but i ve run into a snag trying to get many-to-many joins working

47041252
pop-up	dialog
press ctrl + - and from the dialog that pop-up choose shift cells left

47041256
getter	setter
you should avoid such getter and setter in typescript

47041256
getter	setter
this is a java idiom but typescript can define getter and setter for regular properties if needed

47041258
getter	setter
side not you could use typescript accessors for getter setter if you wanted

47041278
ubuntu	linux

i want to start using shopify but i still need to know if it is possible to create custom post type a bit like wordpress a new button on the admin panel where there is product orders customers etc where i could put a whole new kind of post for blogging or image gallery

47041532
multiplication	exponent
however an exponent too big to fit in int generally means the results will be totally off the scale anyway and couldn t feasibly be calculated by iterated multiplication

47041539
hide	show
you should know that if you show one of your div it won t hide the others

47041539
hide	show
in order to do that you need to hide the one that is show

47041540
int	chars
using vsprintf the c code below converts a chars array to an int

47041556
pop-up	dialog
in this case no other handler functions are called and the system displays a pop-up dialog box that asks the user whether to terminate the process

47041556
terminate	timeout
in this case the system terminate the process when handlerroutine returns true or when the timeout period elapses

width	height
i m not sure why but adding a width of 75 to .video-container makes it smaller but adding a height of 75 does nothing

47056513
width	height
because the trick behind this method is that there is no height in play at all and the element is spanned up by the padding instead - this is what makes â œrespecting the aspect ratioâ work here in the first place using width height only you could not achieve that

you should always set env variable like this when using capistrano because sometimes depending on the way you have capistrano set up env variables on the server will not work you could be using a different user to deploy or you could be using rbenv or rvm

47057909

because you are not using the longhand definitions like font-size and fontfamily you need to follow the spec for shorthand which says that size is one of the required attributes

47058621
qwindow	qwidget
we have a desire to switch from using qwindow to some kind of qwidget for compatibility with touch gestures and generally better overall compatibility with the rest of our application

47058621
qapplication	qwidget
the answer to that question did not solve my issue because we are using qapplication not qguiapplication as this is a qwidget based application

47058629
inherited	properties
these are closely related but would benefit quite a bit from inherited but still differ in properties validation and business logic

47058650
width	margin
can i ask max width and also is it possible to make it start from a margin and then scale

47058705

you will need to create a corresponding submission controller which will allow you non-admin users to submit answers to an exam

47058725
for-loop	loops
our assignment is to make a for-loop program and while loops program out of our switch statement program so i just need to know why my for-loop program isn t running and if you want to check my while too that would be great

width	height
how ever this method is only usable for an exact size of width and height 300px and 50px not usable for sizes by percent

47059013
post	get
the most logical explanation is that you get string from post

47059079
min	max
the code base heavily relies on utilizing protobuf functionality such as enumerator min max extracting a string from the variable field - has_variable function - isvalid etc

47059079
min	max
my health_state_type is my enumerator but i don t have a min or max unless i hardcode one and i can t extract type_failed as a string

47059092

for-loop	arrays
while the extra step of split and the for-loop may look cumbersome it has the advantage of making all your embedded data available by name in a handy arrays

47059134
margin	height
you can use the margin to compensate for the height change

47059134
margin	height
in a normal setting you have 50px as the height and 10px as the bottom margin

47078382
put	get
im trying to have my apps reference eachother in django but i get the error importerror cannot import name question .what i dont understand is that when i create a new project and put 2 new apps inside it i can reference the apps no problem

47078389
cpu	affinity
it may be overkill just to get the pid but if you want other things like cpu and thread id and specifically thread affinity it may be adequate for you

47078392
spaces	delimiter
in the above snippet we simply call split on the value of the entry which is returned from entry.get using the spaces character as our delimiter

47078392
spaces	delimiter
we could do this with any delimiter if for example you wanted to have each element separated by a comma character you would simply update the delimiter to or if you wanted to remove the spaces as well

47078404
alarmmanager	appwidgetprovider
to do so set an alarm with an intent that your appwidgetprovider receives using the alarmmanager

the parent component can set the props of its children based on the state

47078490
children	parent
you can use callback props on the children to set the parent components state

47078503
subtract	add
but basically you want to get the location of the first and add 4 to get the month assuming the date is always 2 digits like in your example and then use that as a start index for a search of the first blank that ll be the end of the month name and subtract the first index we found to get the length fo the month

47078520
bionic	libc	bionic	newlib	libc	newlib
or rather use a hermetic libc like musl newlib or bionic

47078557
post	get
at least i think you should first try to get something working without ajax so you learn the whole request response cycle stuff working with get and post using django forms etc

47078588
multiplying	add
assuming that is what you want to achieve just multiplying your result with 100 and add round function

47078591
google-chrome	firefox
runs like a charm in google-chrome and firefox but when it comes to web component tester

47078619
unsigned	short
in c++ i can declare a variable as either an unsigned short or an unsigned char with 2 bytes as shown below

47078692
hide	show
to achieve this i have added two inputs exitname and exittitle with ng-show in my expander and in my controller i show and hide my inputs for the question

47078749
tabcontrol	tabitem
if you swap the order of the two tabitem or set on the tabcontrol you ll find that the one that s initially visible is always the only one that works

47078778
post	get
have whatever process updates the sheet also send a get or post request to your script deployed as a web application

47078778
post	get
get method is used for illustration here you may find that post makes more sense for this operation

47078778
post	get
important when execution is triggered by a get or post request the methods getactive.

47078781
min	max
in your build-heap loop you simply call trickledown just like you would with a min heap or a max heap

47078781
min	max
that function will move the item accordingly depending on whether it s on a min level or a max level

47078781
min	max
trickledown determines if i is on a min level or a max level and calls the appropriate method trickledownmin or trickledownmax

47078787
width	height
remove string with this pattern from one column in a table width 480 height 70

47078818
google-chrome	firefox
the object gives an error in firefox but seems to be fine in google-chrome

47078828
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
my code doesn t use a while loops because i m not sure how to use one to iterate through the arrays but a for-loop isn t working either

47078881
inherited	properties
basically you can t use that syntax because curly braces indicate that you are using a markup extension in this case it would mean that there is a separatorextension somewhere in your codebase that inherited from markupextension and it has a properties named converter but this won t work either because uwp doesn t support custom markup extensions

47078907
move	drag
when i drag or zoom the diagram the background image should move and zoom accordingly

47078946
versioning	upgrade
solution was to upgrade to newer wl versioning with had that method overrided

47078953
versioning	upgrade
the above code seems to be working in upgrade versioning of typescript that i was working i.e 2.3.only small modification has to be done instaed of

47078955
width	height
i ve tried all the ordinary width height playinline variations but i still get black margins when i resize the window

47078977
put	get
when trying to put the instance id in the w-component of my normal vector after transformation ofc i get strange results

47079073
google-chrome	firefox
i tried in google-chrome console and firefox console

47079076
stringr	stringi
and preferably using functions from stringr or stringi

47079083
put	get
you can type which echoscu to get the path to it if it s not in usr local bin i don t know if different distro s put stuff elsewhere

47079087
for-loop	arrays
as mike said it s generally a bad idea to use a for-loop to iterate through an arrays while modifying it

47079107
maven-failsafe-plugin	maven-surefire-plugin
however like with maven-surefire-plugin you can run junit 5 tests with the maven-failsafe-plugin by specifying the dependency on the org.junit.platform junit-platform-surefire-provider 1.0.1 with the earlier version of the maven-failsafe-plugin 2.19.1

47079109

47079124
swift	objective-c
gcd is very simple and easy to use a good start will be to read this tutorial to go a bit deeper you can check out this article objective-c and here is a swift version

47079139
folder	directory
i personally had the error because i was missing the folder directory entity

47079162
range	max
so if the range max is 12 31 2015 can i revert the value back to a cell range d10

47079177
udp	tcp
the reason why you want to use udp over tcp is to have a faster and less overhead protocol

47079177
udp	tcp
udp is faster and requires less bandwidth than tcp

47079177
udp	tcp
so relaying the udp over tcp defeats the purpose of using udp in the first place

47079192
put	get
most of the time a few apps get automatically put on the whitelist of these phones like whatsapp

47079217
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome it works ok but in firefox it seems that request function is somehow called before url is defined

47079222
spaces	delimiter
the way this works is it takes the value of the cell and split will use the delimiter double spaces and replace the first value into the cell

47079255
range	minimum
here binary search is being used to find the optimal solution.for binary search you need a range represented by high and low .you know the optimal answer lies within this range.in this particular problem low is represented by the minimum number of folders that a worker will have to look for which is going to be the maximum number of folders in a cabinet

47079316
versioning	upgrade
but unfortunately due to the requirements of the system i am working with it is not possible nor feasible for me to upgrade from my current versioning of python to a newer versioning

47079318
udp	tcp
when a client wants to relay udp traffic over the socks5 proxy the client makes a udp associate request over the tcp

47079318
udp	tcp
the socks5 server then terminates the udp connection created for the client and then terminates the tcp connection

47079351
int	chars
what does int argc chars argv mean

47079433
width	height
i don t know in advance how width the curly bracket will be and i can have multiple curly brackets on the same page with different width but the same height

47079463
post	get
you can use to get the uri for the post

47079497
post	get
i m trying to use post id to get post like share and comments using facebook api in codeigniter

47079504
swift	objective-c
i would suggest that your uitableviewcell should call a block objective-c or a closure swift whenever your specified event is triggered to achieve what you are looking for

47079551
swift	objective-c
this technique is also applicable to hybrid frameworks frameworks with swift and objective-c code

47079584
pull	push
configurations that push into and pull from gitlab seem to be working

47079586
popover	tooltip
i am trying to apply bootstrap popover and tooltip on the same element glyphicon-plus .it is not working

47079595
x86	64bit
if i put the git2-1196807.dll file in the deployed location . lib win32 x86 and the 64bit equivalent then it runs fine but that defeats the point in using costura.fody

47079705
filesystems	btrfs
currently only some filesystems among them btrfs ext2 ext3 and ext4 have full support for returning the file type in d_type

47079736
post	get
it turns out that whilst the regular org.springframework.web.client.resttemplate class is sufficient for get requests you need to use org.springframework.security.kerberos.client.kerberosresttemplate for post requests

47079741
range	max
max - get the highest row number that works because we want the last value in the range

47079758
getter	setter
instead of properties it has standard private members with public getter setter methods

47079769
getter	setter
for me writing test cases for getter and setter just to make code coverage percentage high is stupid

47079769
getter	setter
these api allows you to write only few lines and behind the scene cover all your getter setter code coverage

47079806
polymorphism	specialization
specialization works on bounded polymorphism where type variables such as a are constrained

47079827
scatter	graphing
i want to change the screen tip which appears below the mouse pointer when it hovers over a point on an excel scatter graphing preferably using vba to do so

47079842
post	get
the reason you get the error is that the user post save signal tries to create a registration instance but you don t supply values for all the required fields

47079897
post	get
it does exactly the same thing as the get method but it is necessary when included in a page that is returned from another controller s post method

47079915
int	double
therefore arguments int a and double b still exists in memory

47079917
put	get
to work correctly a put key value should be performed synchronously to allow an immediate get key operation

47079919
super	self
if you use python 2.x use super faultinsertionboard self .__init__

47079922
google-chrome	firefox
i tried from both firefox and google-chrome it does not seem to depend on browser

47079950
prometheus	grafana
we use monitoring with prometheus and percona dashboards in grafana so it was clearly visible

47079954
versioning	upgrade
to fix it you need to upgrade your spring versioning to 4.1.x latest release.below is pom.xml

47079966
popover	tooltip
given that we have two separate html elements and why not place the tooltip in one and the popover trigger in the other

47079966
popover	tooltip
note also that this solution allows you to use data-placement for positioning so you don t need to limit yourself to all tooltip or popover utilizing the same placement

47079992
children	parent
therefore a datasnapshot with children is considered a parent node so doesn t have a specific value so val won t work here

47079997
inherited	properties
controls in a view leverage databindings to the datacontext properties of either the control itself or the parent containing control which it will inherited

47080073
versioning	upgrade
so i just upgrade my gerrit to 2.14.4 which is currently the latest stable versioning

47080087
put	get	post	get	post	put
i have a class which has a contained object.i am using common dto for post and put operations.so using validated and using groups attribute i am trying to activate annotations like size as needed by post or put .but the issue is that the validations annotaions dont get activated for the variables inside the contained object.they apply ony for the direct varibales of the dto.is there something that i am missing on

47080138
width	height
for normalization i first divide each coordinate value by the image pixel width or height

47080142
for-loop	loops
error 1 if you compare in a for-loop that loops will only run a time.you must fix it into

47080142
for-loop	loops
you mustn t declare a variable b in a for-loop because the variable b in that loops will disappear from loops when it stop repeating.thus the value of the variable b in the for-loop won t assign

47080143
width	height
setting the width or height does not work

47080143
width	height
so my question is very simple how to set a containers width and height to eg

47080152
folder	directory
a hacky solution to this is to mount the etc nginx conf.d folder into a directory on your host let s say usr local share nginxconf and change the file there which is in another namespace and different permissions afaik

47080161
post	get
when using my shortcode function along side my jquery i get a list of all post profile pages site urls etc

47080162
width	height
i usually edit the width and height because it s not very common to have a sprite s size that works out perfectly in tiles

47080175
post	get
in fact i researched and i read many post that talk about that but i get failed to make this library working

47080208
tunnel	packets
i can see every ip packets passing trough the tunnel coming from my device but after trying a lot many days i assumed that is impossible to see the android hotspot s traffic

47080208
tunnel	packets
according to my knowledge it could be because the layer of the android hotspot is below of the vpnservice and the packets are sent transparently out of the tunnel

47080288
mouse	keyboard
i believe this is the method that is invoked by the mouse or keyboard logic to change row selection

47080288
mouse	keyboard
remember to design a user interface that support both mouse and keyboard effectively

47080297
maven-install-plugin	pom.xml
simply invoking mvn install without any configuration of the maven-install-plugin in your pom.xml should work

47080305
width	height
i m supposed to get the user input of the color of the triangle and the width and height of the triangle but i can t even display the output

47080321
width	height
add position relative to your td then make your a height and width 100 to fit your td

47080328
int	boolean
and you will get an error if you try to convert boolean value to int

47080354
actualheight	actualwidth
i mean i need to get the space that something consumes on the visual space like a button with a dropshadoweffect applied and not just the values of actualwidth and actualheight properties

47080380

47080484
google-chrome	firefox
i ve figured out a way that works for firefox and one for google-chrome

47080484
google-chrome	firefox
but if i add both only firefox works and google-chrome doesn t

47080489
bash	zsh
if zsh has a debug signal sent before each command is executed bash does this you can achieve the desired effect by adding escape sequences at the end of your ps1 variable and resetting it to its default value just before the output is displayed by trapping bash s debug signal

47080499
pop-up	dialog
i am working on typescript and html to show the result of webservice call as pdf in pop-up dialog in same page

47080569
carrierwave	fog

47080571
free	malloc
an alternative is to declare and call the c malloc and free functions or some variant like mmap and munmap

47080571
free	strdup
since it is very important that the correct c standard library free is used for a pointer returned by strdup you cannot rely cffi to magically do the correct thing but instead as you suspected you should expose free

47080572
inherited	properties
in fact the link type only has a source and a displayname properties that is inherited from the abstract displayable base class

47080581

the problem may not indeed be a problem at all your md5 hash can be correct from both processes

47083903
hash	md5
trying pre-filling your temporary string with all null values then copy across your password so that you are sure that the rest of the string buffer is empty before you md5 hash it

47083903
hash	md5
also from this explanation if your password length was exactly sixteen 32-bit words 4 times 16 64 characters long then the md5 hash should be the same regardless of what follows in the character array after the null character as the algorithm will not look for more characters after the 64 char boundary

i have an assignment that was to make a subclassing which adds on to the existing superclass and this is run by a third class with a main method which creates an object of the subclassing and calls appropriate methods

47104837
superclass	subclassing
my problem is that calling methods in the superclass works correctly but calling the two additional methods i have written in the subclassing gets ignored

47104837
subtract	add	multiplying	add	multiplying	subtract
specifically the superclass is a memory calculator with basic add subtract divide and multiplying options as well as an option to clear the current value

47104837
superclass	subclassing
the subclassing is a scientific memory calculator that overrides the menu method in the superclass to include options for power and logarithm and has methods for both

47104839
children	parent
set the parent .divsholder to display flex and make all the children the same width with flex 1

47104840
cos	math.h
hi i was self-studying about function in math.h then i tried to use cos fuction to find the cos of radius in the program

47104867
versioning	upgrade
upgrade to a newer versioning of spark-java 2.7.0

47104933
children	parent
the commits span up what we lovingly call the directed acyclical graph which is a fancy way of saying that every commit has arbitrarily many parent 1 for a regular commit 2 for a regular merge 3+ for octopus merges that nobody of us is likely to ever see in practice and children

47104943
post	get
i ve can get it to post to my person facebook feed and i ve also gotten it to post to my business page posting as my personal user account

47104948
for-loop	loops
if in a for-loop i have a variable it doesn t change for 30 times i will stop loops

47104949
google-chrome	safari
i made a few tests and it seems that the error only occurs with some user-agents mozilla safari google-chrome etc are all fine but setting my useragent to googlebot crashes everything

47104959
getter	setter
if you are looking to improve your java skill further you may want to get familiar with the java specific conventions always make fields private and only let them be accessible via getter and setter

47104965
versioning	upgrade
however during the last round of library versioning upgrade gradle doesn t like xwalk any more

47104965
versioning	upgrade
to make matters worse i also upgrade android studio to versioning 3 and now i m stuck not being able to revert my repository to something before the breaking change so that i could hunt for the issue

47104970
superclass	subclassing
you ve got two different currentvalue variables both private one in the superclass and one in the subclassing

47104970
superclass	subclassing
the methods in your superclass are changing the value of its variable and the methods of the subclassing are changing the value of its variable

47104970
superclass	subclassing
make currentvalue protected in the superclass and remove it from the subclassing

47104970
superclass	subclassing
based on the must be private comment you still need to remove the extra currentvalue variable in the subclassing but as oleg points out you can obtain and update the value of a private variable in a superclass using get and set methods defined in the superclass

47105001
debian	linux
i m working with a debian based linux

dotnetzip	sharpziplib
i ve also tried dotnetzip and sharpziplib

47105032
int	double
to retain the decimal values you can cast the operands to double or perform arithmetic with decimal values which will promote your int to double

47105043
superclass	subclassing
then you define that only in the superclass and use super to defer to it in the subclassing

47105048
int	double
you assign to a double but you do your calculation as int arithmetic which is probably not what you want

47105048
integer	fractions
remember that integer arithmatic will drop fractions

47105048
int	double
the trick is to convert at least one int perferably the first one imo to double

47105048
int	double
then all the int get promoted to double and the result is 1 and 1.5 for the example above

47105054
min	max
i don t think you can avoid doing 2 layers because you are calculating min max by svc_ord_nbr then using those calculations for a subsequent count

47105069
getter	setter
this is the leaf node class rectangle of course with all setter and getter

47105069
getter	setter

if a sub-product exists it is delimiter from the product by a dash surrounded with spaces -

47105101
for-loop	arrays
john is correct that you are initializing a new resu arrays every iteration of the for-loop

47105101
for-loop	arrays
if you do need a duplicate of the rows arrays for some reason you can still omit the for-loop and instead you should initialize it this way

47105160
daemon	cron
the cron daemon has a reboot command

47105173
flatmap	concatmap
to preserve the order of the observables use concatmap instead of flatmap

47105413
free	malloc
so you go and do some research and discover c s memory allocation functions like malloc and free

47105476
linkurious	sigma.js
it is available as a plugin in linkurious fork of sigma.js

47105488

47105507
implements	extends
i have custom camerapreview extends surfaceview implements surfaceholder.callback class app shows realtime preview

47105509

spaces	delimiter
substrings also contain spaces so the trick is figuring out when a spaces is acting as a delimiter versus when it is merely a component of a substring

47105861
x86	64bit
however if your drive letter is different say d instead of c a_programfiles will know this and point to the correct location as well it will differentiate between 64bit os versions and will point correctly to c program files x86

for-loop	loops
the for-loop sets i to 0 loops for as long as it s less than or equal to a.count-1 and increments after each iteration

47106477
children	parent
the parent object holds the animator for the children

47106493
for-loop	loops
despite this i decided that i wanted to make the while loops that is nested in the for-loop into a for-loop

47106494
min	max
i have tested the plotspace variables and they are on the money min max for the y axis is as expected and the x y coords through the delegate functions shown below number and numberofrecords are as expected

47106501

int	chars
int parameter you will generally call it using a chars

47117553
int	chars
although this isn t literally how things work for the purposes of this analogy let s pretend that a chars represents a single decimal digit and that an int represents four decimal digits

47117553
int	chars
if you have a chars with some numeric value you could store that chars inside of an int by writing it as the last digit of the int padding the front with three zeros

47117553
int	chars
numerically the chars value 7 and the int value 0007 are identical to one another since we padded the int with zeros

47117553
int	chars
in actuality on most systems a chars represents a single byte 8 bits and an int is represented by four bytes 32 bits

47117553
int	chars
you can stuff the value of a chars into an int by having the three higher-order bytes all hold the value 0 and the low-order byte hold the chars s value

47117555
int	double
a and b are instance of int and double so kotlin will infer them as their lca

47117555
int	double
however int and double are subclasses of number and comparable at the same time and kotlin doesn t know if you want a number or a comparable so kotlin treat it as an instance of any

47117555
int	double
and in this way you can apply any comparable to it instead of int double and string only

47117555
int	double
it s in int or double

for an example i assigned the chars with an int of 0 in one array and 100 in another array as you can see above in my ordopstable class in the method setoperatorprecedence

47117810
equals	tostring
when the character class equals method is called here without using operatorvalues class s tostring my debugger says the inline value for curr s in this equals method shows obj ordopstable operatorvalues 636

width	height
the issue i have is that the canvas which is currently fixed has a transparent background color and is set to 100 width and height blocks the div underneath with a lower z-index meaning the links can t be clicked

47117931
mousemove	pointer-events
using pointer-events none on the canvas isn t the solution as it disables the mousemove effect

47117941

what you can do would be to extract them from the output of that very command the example - python 2.7 - assumes they come out on stdout if they re not also check stderr in the same way

47117972

47118313
children	parent
each qtreewidgetitem is associated with its parent so if it moves to the parent the children will also move

47118313
qtreewidget	qmodelindex
this is the most complicated task because when qtreewidget uses drag-and-drop it uses the mimetype x-qabstractitemmodeldatalist that stores the information of the row and column associated to the qmodelindex of the item plus a dictionary with the roles and their values

47118313
children	parent
so knowing the row and column it is impossible to obtain the item and therefore also your children since you must have the parent

47118371
public	protected
the visibility of a property a method or as of php 7.1.0 a constant can be defined by prefixing the declaration with the keywords public protected or private

47118463
children	parent
the way the c3 linearization algorithm works you have to linearize the parent then as long as there isn t a contradiction you can linearize the children

47118463
put	get
the algorithm as i would put it is that you respect parents left to right but go depth first unless you would get to a shared parent blocked by a child f blocked by it s child d in which case you would look for other candidates d then not being a contradiction is fine then you can select f and the remainder of c s mro.

47118628

width	height
the camera takes in two variables the width and height of the world

47121030
width	height
if the width and height of the camera is 300x300 that means there s 300x300 units visible on the screen even if the screen is 1920x1080

47121030
width	height
you set the width and height of the camera to a given value

47121030
width	height
the batch you use to render uses the projection matrix of the camera meaning it converts screen coordinates to world coordinates based on the width and height of what s visible at once

47121030
width	height
if you think the world is too small meaning what you render shows up as too big you can of course zoom out by adding a scale factor but you can also increase the width and height of the camera

47121030
width	height
i have no clue what you set the width and height to but if you increase the width and height it ll probably work

47121044
put	get
since lookups in arrays are comparatively slow and don t scale well they get significantly slower with increasing number of elements in the array you could also put the reference values in a hashtable so you can do index lookups which are significantly faster

edit i m still stuck in this problem so i figured out and i need to every time that i add a new item to the list i need to read the status of the checkboxes and edittexts and save them somewhere then i have to use the data and add a new item and finally put them one more time on the listview so i don t know what is the right way to go over the listview to get those states

47125680
preorder	postorder
so instead of calling them at the end of your function preorder like you do now if you call them earlier postorder

47125720
express	node.js
am i supposted to use https protocol on node.js express app

47125752
width	height
window height width seems like it should be the correct code to use

47125765
int	double
as it walks that map it knows how to add primitives int double etc to that file

47125767
min	max
you should decide to print the output out of the loop and if you want to count to max and min appear time you should add one more if statement to check when max tab i and min tab i

47125767
min	max
if you do this after if tab i max and if tab i min you don t need to initialize mincounter and maxcounter at 1 otherwise they need to be initialized at 1

47125852
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
then the while loops executes i++ at each iteration so that when the following for-loop iterating over j executes note i and not j i points to an index that has never been set in the arrays therefore returning 0 the default int value

47125863
put	get
also the finally bit is always executed so if you put illegal values for x or y you will still get an error

47125865
hash	salt
that is a bad idea use a hash with a salt for instance something like bcrypt

47125878
uiviewcontroller	uipageviewcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uipageviewcontroller
it might also be helpful that the subclasses uipageviewcontroller is presented modally from a uiviewcontroller in a uitabbarcontroller

47125889
msg	eml
i believe there is a need to support outlook msg format in nodemailer which at least parses eml correctly

47125889
msg	eml
use msgconvert linux command to go from msg to eml

47125906
hide	show
if i normally do hide and show every item on the page goes hidden or show

47125926
post	get
now i do not get how to add that jsonobject part into my post request and also how to add the content-type header

47125958
put	get
if i were you i would put a loading screen which would get replaced by the stacknavigator structure once the data is ready

47125974
folder	directory
when i set file_to_watch to a .py file the log returns the correct source path but when i change it to a .txt file in the same folder it stops at the directory

47126014
temp	tmp
first thing was splitting the list of images into an array then run gettempfilename and changed tmp extension by the extension of the image in the link so that bitmap constructor knows what type the content of temp file is and would be able to create bitmap object

47126029
apache	nginx
i m running the express server directly via node without apache nginx

47126052
implements	extends
you can use the extends view.onclicklistener in this class and implements the method onclick

47126116
ldd	glibc
running ldd aapt2 indicated that some shared libraries were missing mainly glibc

47126127
superclass	subclassing
detailed explanation as requested theme.appcompat.light.darkactionbar is a subclassing of the superclass base anyway

47126148
post	get
how to get all post from db with category tags if any feature_image and other related to post in one row

47126171
put	get
so with what i have here i m able to get the first 3 out of 4 pieces of the line and put them into an array which i can then move into variables

47126197
tidyverse	tidyr
both of these options allow me to transpose but i m wondering if there s a tidyverse method of achieving this using tidyr s gather and spread functions

47126216
wav	riff
also don t assume that the length of the riff header prior to the data chunk is a fixed length in your input wav file

47126283
int	boolean
a direct interpretation of boolean as int in the machine code not bytecode

47126286
subtract	add
if the goal is to actually change when an event occurs then you can use datebyaddingtimeinterval to add or subtract the amount of time you want to adjust it by

47126315
hash	md5
md5.csv contains the md5 hash last write time size and full path for every files in cwd at the rime it was last executed

47126315
hash	md5
do full hash md5 last write time size full path and append to md5.csv because this is a new file

47126315
hash	md5
md5 hash only those files that missing from md5.csv

47126315
hash	md5
build the whole line with md5 hash last write time size and full path for all files that are not in the md5.csv all new renamed moved and edited files

47126359
dictionary	map
because the data structure printed out to the console uses equal signs instead of colons it is not a dictionary nor a hash map

47126402
integer	unsigned
so i now n gives me the not operation on the integer n but is there any way i can read this as an unsigned int

47126409
bower	npm
now i m trying to move to webpack as part of removing bower and using npm instead

47126454
distance	pdist
to compare the results we must be aware that pdist computes only the upper triangle of the square matrix of distance because the matrix is symmetric and the principal diagonal is identically equal to zero so we must be careful in checking our results hence i check the off diagonal part of the first row of dists1 with the first 99 elements of dists2 using allclose

47126465
ubuntu	linux
note 2 i am experiencing this on ubuntu linux 16.10

47126490
post	get
also if you use post you can change get to post

47126510
post	get
first your route get should be route post in this case.

47126527
post	get
however with my current script that i will post below i get the following result

47126532
post	get
what makes every post unique is actually the key i am trying to get

47126532
post	get
query to get all post and filter the ones that match with the userid

47126534
jscrollpane	jviewport
you add the notificationbox to the jscrollpane s jviewport which is good but then you add notificationbox to the panel which will remove it from the jscrollpane s jviewport which is bad

47126536
width	height
bitmap.createbitmap bitmap source int x int y int width int height

47126623
subtract	add
to minimize dom traversing it is better to request the current value of the total sum and then add subtract the price of the selected item to from it

47126624
g++	gcc
i have tried this command gcc myapp.cpp -omyapp -lboost_date_time and it s does not work because i am using g++ in cmake project and i haven t find nothing for g++

47126627
onclicklistener	onitemclicklistener
use onclicklistener inside the getview in adapter instead setting onitemclicklistener for gridview

47126637
rss	feed
i learned from some sites such as from this that i can use keywords with rss feed links but i have not succes when i try this with a particular site

47126637
rss	feed
is this way of access rss feed a general one or it is limited somehow

47126801
int	double
it exists for int double but not bytes

47126806
theano	tensorflow
it seems that you have a tensorflow backend - not a theano one

47126809
int	double
the method boxed is designed only for streams of some primitive types intstream doublestream and longstream to box each primitive value of the stream into the corresponding wrapper class int double and long respectively

47126860
put	get
i get the same error no matter what i put in after the -i ex

47126867
button	checkbox
but checkbox and probably radio button don t work with oninput for pretty obvious reasons but i ve been able to get onblur to work to some extent

47126867
button	checkbox
the problem is that i m a beginning coder and i don t quite know or understand how i ll take all the results from all the checkbox and regurgitate them out into a nice list when there are many ids and many choices and it doesn t seem sensible to try and write all choices from a single thing into their own function or how i ll handle the same thing with radio button

47126928
equals	tostring
gettype .getproperties - returns 7 methods such as equals tostring etc

47126939
hid	keyboard
i have recently converted a 122-key terminal keyboard to usb as a configfs usb gadget the keyboard portion is using hid codes it works quite well in except that i cannot seem to get my archlinux installation to recognize certain hid codes specifically at the moment f13-f24 and translate them into event codes that i can use in x

47126939
hid	keyboard
all of the normal hid codes work in fact this message is being typed on the keyboard right now so it must be something between the receipt of the hid code and its translation

47126979
for-loop	if-statement
you get the right result with both solutions but i personally like the second solution better because there is no additional if-statement that is executed every iteration of the for-loop and the program is slightly faster

47126997
nullpointerexception	classcastexception
typically nullpointerexception or classcastexception

47127025
maven-jar-plugin	pom.xml
inside its pom.xml there is a maven-jar-plugin and it has several different executions for each of the example

47127058
google-chrome	firefox
this works in google-chrome firefox edge ie11

47127107
readonly	temporary
this requires additional programming and redundant storage but you will readonly required data in required order without temporary tables and additional processing

47127126
weka	libsvm
you can load data in libsvm format into weka

47127159
inline	constexpr
static constexpr variables like other constexpr variables are defined inline

47127160
range	min	range	max	min	max
the solution must be within the range min max

47127174
for-loop	loops
as addrecords increments the int pointer to reflect that change back to main the for-loop is changed to a while loops

47127178
versioning	upgrade
if i create a clean virtualenv upgrade my pip versioning to 9.0.1 most recent and try

47127220
inline	constexpr
constexpr on a variable definition will imply inline

47127262
put	get
to get an efficient program you put as much instructions as you can outside of the loop

47127284
post	get
you should also check whether you need to send the content-tye text xml header and whether you should be using a post or a get

47127310
min	max
you used random.next min max to generate a random number

47127310
min	max
msdn points out that min is the inclusive lower bound of the random number and max is the exclusive upper bound of the random number returned

47127310
min	max
so the problem is that you tried to create a random number with 17 inclusive as min and the lists count which is also 17 exlusive as max

47127318
width	height
second you just need to use the width and height variables to draw your shapes

47127318
width	height
the width and height variables are automatically updated when you resize the canvas

47127385
width	height
are you giving it width and height

47127418
width	height
and then we can add a dimension to it as the cv2.canny outputs a mat object of shape height width

47127418
width	height
now the shape represents height width channels

47127422
confd	consul
as an alternative you might want to consider some configuration templating structure such as confd or consul template

47127454
min	max
this seems to run through the list and check for max min values fewer times

47127470
width	height
in libgdx it is possible to set a virtual width and height for a viewport

47127470
width	height
i was wondering if it is possible to use virtual width and height in pygame primarily because the physics simulations in games are more accurate

47127489
google-chrome	firefox
i found out after some time that someusername was not acceptable to firefox although it works on google-chrome

47127494
ubuntu	linux
in linux ubuntu use this

47127498
width	height
the same can be done for the element by defining it its width and height as 100 of the container

47127534
width	height
i have tried to fix this by adding a width and height to the css this resulted in a stretched out canvas

47127550
gridview	repeater
if you want more complex things get rid of the gridview and use a repeater to create your html table instead

47127551
swift	objective-c

google-chrome	safari
but a lot of features css javascript are not working well on safari neither pywebview and works perfectly on google-chrome

47127621
put	get
usually what you can do is put your cursor there on the function name hit alt + enter and then you ll get a bunch of options

47127624
subnet	vlan
this will be a router with layer 3 vlan interfaces in the cisco world they would be svis that would be acting as the default gateway of the subnet in your network

47127648
ubuntu	debian
an under-appreciated aspect is that you can in fact get some of these as binaries from either debian or ubuntu but i leave the legwork of finding this out for yourself

47127660
udp	tcp
udp should be much faster than tcp because there are no acknowledge and congestion detection

47127660
udp	tcp
if you need to transfer files between two end-points in the internet unless you manually implement a reliable transmission mechanism on udp at the application level you will want to use tcp

47127685
put	get
get data from the database host port pass user from the database and put it on the various textfields in the passworduploadcontroller.java class where the textfields are located

47127695
width	height
you re setting the height and width of the scene and then call sizetoscene which makes the previous calls redundant

47127705
swift	objective-c
the generated interface is like a swift header file for your objective-c file that should tell you the exact name of the method

47127723
scylla	cassandra
i wrote a detailed description of the sstable format on scylla s site scylla is a more efficient c++ re-implementation of cassandra to which i contribute

children	parent
use props to pass data down to the children and events to pass data from the children back to the parent

47127879
uicollectionview	uitableview
if you re using uitableview or uicollectionview you need to set their draginteractionenabled property to true in order to solve your problem

47127881
installation	upgrade
i later discovered that nothing was wrong with the installation but with my new upgrade ubuntu 17.10

47127905
ubuntu	linux

47127936
free	realloc
realloc word 0 is equivalent to free word

47127938
prop	each
i m not getting how can i access variable defined in map method outside render function in order to alert the variable value after clicking on the button and also even though i m passing key in array it is still throwing me warning each child in an array or iterator should have a unique key prop

47127965
post	put
in many cases this is just post but could include others like put delete and so on

47127984
versioning	upgrade	migrate	upgrade
i need to upgrade my project from was 7 to was 8.5 along with that want to upgrade java versioning as well as present my project support java6 now we want to migrate it to java 8 if not at least to java 7

47127987
scylla	cassandra
if you absolutely care about speed and performance-per-dollar you should also take a look at scylla a re-implementation of cassandra in c++

47128032
int	chars
i m trying to get it to print out one random alphanumeric chars starting with a chars and ending with a one or two digit int

47128035
folder	directory
both directory are source folder which is incorrect but good enough to handle correct maven projects

47128074
public	protected
when it s public or protected it can be over-ridden and the method called will depend on the object

47128136
pull	push
i ve been trying to find an introductory guide but it seems that appart from enter your github info and push pull away via the gui

47128153
integer	unsigned
if you have a bit field say bits 6 though 3 four bits total packed into a value w some type of unsigned integer then you can set the field with a value v with

47128154
jtextfield	jlabel
depending on what number is selected in the jcombobox i want my gui to add a jlabel and a jtextfield

47128165
ubuntu	linux	ubuntu	mint

47128171
apache	nginx
what makes nginx apache a web server haproxy not

47128173
ionic	angular
but for a commercial level project you must use angular js or higher angular version ionic - extended version of cordova to get better user experience

47128199
integer	unsigned
i noticed that both fields have different datatype for example in your carts table coupon_code field is an unsigned integer but on coupons table you have code field as strings

47128201
width	height
i realize there s a lot more to do to be able to render this but i can already figure out the width and height of views and i m hoping i can find a way to measure text to select a font based on the screen size rather than trying to depend on points

47128243
int	chars	int	double
what does a machine do to differentiate between interpretation protocols between data types for example between 1-byte 2-byte 4-byte int floats double chars and unicode formats

47128259
cos	sin
i use math_real a lot for in-line generating sin cos tables.

47128259
modelsim	vivado
i ve used this in quartus ise vivado modelsim successfully

47128324
outputstream	inputstream
from the outputstream i get what i wrote down in the inputstream but not the result

47128341
folder	directory
since the notifydatasetchanged method did not push updates to the dialog correctly without creating an entire adapter class for the initial creation stage - something which i considered far too time-consuming and inefficient for my purposes - i worked around the issue by relaunching the dialog every time an update was needed and tracked the current directory s position in the master tree relative to the source directory by using an arraylist with a pointer that updated every time the user switched folder

47128343
subtraction	addition
addition and subtraction dont know about unsigned vs signed so it is just bits

47128343
implements	extends
the processor doesnt know a bool from an int from an unsigned int some know some different widths in that they can mask pad or sign extends but the human and the compiler know all and assemble the correct mixture of lego blocks in the correct order to implements their vision

47128368
setinterval	settimeout
by using settimeout outervar s value can be seen in the call to setinterval

47128484
vsts	tfs
based on the offcial article migrate data from tfs to vsts currently the following version s of tfs are supported for import is are tfs 2017 update2

47128484
vsts	tfs	migrate	upgrade
so you need to upgrade tfs 2015 to tfs 2017 update 2 first then migrate to vsts

47128488
setinterval	settimeout
using settimeout instead of setinterval

47128519
try-catch	exception-handling
i keep getting errors on my code and i cant seem to able to fix them can someone look over my code and see what errors im making with my try-catch and exception-handling class

47128543
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
on the user side the platforms vary from mobile devices could be running the latest version of ios or andriod to desktop and different browsers google-chrome firefox or safari

47128657
post	get
well the url navigation would be submitted via get requests whereas the submission is handled via post

47128657
post	get
get requests are exposed to the end-user whereas post requests are not

47128662
google-chrome	firefox
i was only able to execute this test the first time using google-chrome and not firefox but then i started getting errors connecting to google-chrome and went back to firefox

i ve tried mouseout mouseleave etc.

47128708
pull	push
i am not sure how to make my own repo that i can push and pull with over different computers with github desktop

47128711
min	max
ideally the legend should have a legend title and label the line colors as min mean and max

47128712
for-loop	loops
i ve been trying to loops it in for-loop but i can t seem to get it right

47128758
mouse	keyboard
i m trying to work with android emulator but every time i press the control key on my keyboard the whole emulator window not just the device frame become black with only the mouse cursor for pinching showing

47128780
post	get
so the idea is to directly use this url and post data you can get the id from the link element and the token from the js code on the first page and then use curl php to post these data

47128785
width	height
but for scaling and keeping aspect ratio so it doesn t look funny you would find the proportional equivalent for height with the fixed target width

47128785
width	height
since we already know out target width lets get our target height by using a simplified version of our cross-multiplication

47128797
swift	objective-c
objective-c or swift

47128832
d3.js	leaflet
currently i have a leaflet map and a d3.js chart where i can select a point and get associated data for a line chart

47128849
apache	nginx
with nginx and apache you can specify a root directory from which files are served and you can specify paths that are to be serviced by code running in languages like perl php python etc

47128849
apache	nginx
both nginx and apache can also be used as proxy servers as haproxy can but haproxy is specifically designed and optimized for that primary purpose -- proxying and load balancing against multiple back-end selecting the back-end using various rules and algorithms.

47128884
for-loop	loops
the function takes a dataset inside for-loop it loops through and provides different values for number of clusters to kmeans function

47128893
imageview	picasso
you can use picasso library to show images in imageview

47128909
int	chars
it looks like you were trying to retrieve one of the chars from the string which would be 2 3 5 or 7 and then subtract 0 from it to result in the int 2 3 5 or 7

47128968
int	chars
subtract the chars from 0 not the int

47129023
try-catch	exception-handling
it even can handle error and raise exception-handling so that you can use try-catch seamlessly no need to use error callback

47129024
tostring	compareto
i d then use a abstract class to implement the core or common functionality like tostring and compareto and would then make a concrete implementation

47129089
min	max
what i m hoping to do is find some property that i can set that will cause values to not be used to skew the min max

47129089
min	max
here is how i m currently trying to code the data which results in the skewed min max and skewed color scale

47129089
min	max
this heatmap is part of a larger charting application where i won t necessarily know the domain of values could be too different for a min max to be determined ahead of time

47129089
min	max
i d prefer to let highcharts figure out the min max and colors on most of the cells

47129111
maven	pom.xml
if jars are missing which you placed in pom.xml and you want to download then right click on your project and run as maven install it will download the missing jars

47129123
range	minimum
the question i have is how to use the apply function to return the range specifically the maximum and the minimum points of a column of a dataframe.

47129148
minimum	max
is there a way to easily determine the max and minimum number of nodes in an avl or red black tree given just the tree height and or the black height in the case of the red black tree

47129155
filtering	grouping
below is data that has been grouping and filtering by using spark dataframe in scala

47129165
width	height
one thing to remember by someone who s new in ios a view should have width height x and y

47129185
cdr	cons
then consequently using the cons car and cdr to update the list

47129196
int	chars
you are trying to add a string chars with an int

47129204
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
firefox firefox developer edition safari windows google-chrome

47129213
stdout	stderr
in your case there may not be any specific benefits but primary use of freopen is to change the file associated with standard text stream stdin stdout stderr

47129219
strlen	strcpy
while you can achieve this with strcat and without storing the lengths you should always remember that string lengths are not stored anywhere in a c program and that everytime you use strcpy strcat or strlen the program will scan the string to find the terminating 0

47129238
viewdidload	viewdidappear
1 place your usernametf.becomefirstresponder in viewdidload instead of viewdidappear

i want to add more space kind of padding between the min max of the line chart and the x-axis top

47146031
min	max
so basically i want the min and the max of the y-axis to be 10 of the respectively min and max of the chart

47146038

47146106
put	get	getter	setter
performing a get or put operation on a throws a rangeerror that states maximum call stack size exceeded pointing to the this.a in the getter and the in the setter

47146106
getter	setter
if the properties inside the getter and setter are underscored they work however

47146126
getter	setter
it won t be possible for any other code to accidentally step on the private actual property used by the setter getter pair because that s what symbol is for

47146127
getter	setter
you need to have a variable that has a different name then the getter setter

47146127
getter	setter
otherwise if you don t do this you will have an endless loop of calls to the getter setter

47146128
keras	tensorflow

47146296
free	malloc
if you only export those functions which are actually called by the jni interface and not malloc free etc. this should work

47146296
free	malloc
the jni api has callback functions which will call malloc free and those will remain the ones from the original process but things will remain consistent because the malloc free implementations will match

47146333

scikit-learn	xgboost
i tried to build a binary classifier using scikit-learn xgboost also tried gbm

47146625
google-chrome	firefox
the problem is these builds have been designed to be seperate so there is significant overlap in the variables and settings that the images use that you would also need to unpick in your custom build to control and run both google-chrome and firefox at the same time

47146625
google-chrome	firefox
you can run firefox google-chrome or phantom js nodes in docker or connect standard nodes from anywhere else

47146625

47146627
for-loop	arrays
the quiz is about a multidimensional arrays and wants us to use a nested for-loop to cycle through each element and replace the values that are divisible by 2 with the strings even and odd for even and odd numbers respectively

min	max
you can always calculate the min and max as min - 1 and max +1 respectively to always get have an offset of 1

47146782
min	max
here is how you can build a simple plugin to add an offset to the linear char min max

47146808
apache	nginx
for example you can set a variable in the apache vhost or nginx fastcgi configuration based on the url you are visiting from - such as or on a live server set as you like or you could list both of them in the index.php and choose which one from there - although taking the option out of the code and setting it in a server configuration would probably be safer in the long term

47146811
put	get
during processing if you get a message with you put the id into the store

47147012
daemons	systemd
so is it possible to handle stop restart events without a daemons when using systemd

47147030

that s exactly a memory leak because you now can t free the memory earlier returned by calloc

the crash happened in viewwillappear because my code counts on viewdidload being the first thing that is called after viewdiddisappear

47168973
viewdidload	viewwillappear
afaik it is legitimate to count on that since viewdiddisappear is supposed to mean that the view was closed and thus has to be reloaded and viewdidload called before any other life-cycle method can be called viewwillappear should not have been called before viewdidload

nb the use of either min or max in this may matter depending on your data but i there is only one value in the data per output location then either function can be used

min	max
so the min max functions and the group by flatten the result so we end-up with the wanted result

47192186

after the migrator has run you ll notice that the swift 3 objective-c inference build setting has been set to on â you ll want to test your program with this build setting to ensure you don t get any runtime warnings about objective-c entrypoints that aren t marked as objective-c and then change the build setting to default when done as discussed in this q a

47212195
try-catch	exception-handling
too many try-catch would complicate code and reduce the code readability which will lead to swallowing an exception-handling and its much more worse than performance issues as it can crash your system unexpectedly

47212195
try-catch	exception-handling
if you are expecting multiple points in a single method that can throw exception-handling then club them into one try-catch and handle them appropriately

47212195
try-catch	exception-handling
again there can be exception-handling to this specific question but you should always try to reduce multiple try-catch in single method

47212505
uicollectionview	uitableview
i went with uitableview uicollectionview and auto layout

47212505
uicollectionview	uitableview
often uitableview uicollectionview auto layout can prove expensive in terms of dropped frames while scrolling

47212724
google-chrome	firefox
i was able to do this on my local machine using either google-chrome or firefox but i want to have jenkins do it automatically on a nightly basis

47212772
put	get
you could however put milestones in and reference past runs to get a semi-accurate time calculated from the variance in actual time so far this run compared to previous runs as is done when copying large directories of files on windows for instance or when downloading large files in chrome

47212832
for-loop	loops
incrementing the counter will fix the issue you re having in your do while loops but i d also suggest you might be better suited just using a for-loop as this is exactly what they re made for

47212862
width	height
i have given them a height and width and when the nodes render they spill outwidth said height and width and are therefore invisble

47212871

47212972
udp	tcp
does nat block udp packets coming from a server connected using tcp

47212972
udp	tcp
just because the nat has established a tcp connection between two machines does not mean it will automatically forward udp packets as well

47212972
udp	tcp
how server can t establish connection over udp while it can over tcp

47212972
udp	tcp
tcp is a connection oriented protocol while udp is a connectionless protocol so there is technically no such thing as a udp connection

47212972
udp	tcp
instead you could build your game using just tcp then once it is working and deployed experiment with more advanced communication channels like udp hole punching or webrtc data channels

47212981
filesystems	ntfs
sda1 and sda3 are ntfs partition.when the partition is opened accessed in file browse nautilus the partition is mounted in media 277e107a0xxxxx .i assume the partion is temporally mounted in mnt first and then moved to media 277e107a0xxxxx in order to comply with the filesystems hierarchy standard that mnt directories is a temporary mount point.please clarify my confussion for 1 why mnt bootinfo mnt boot-sav

public	protected
third typically if you run sonar and do code review and static analysis on large projects i have found out that typically 80 of the methods are public and 20 are private protected

47213314

thus the main idea of using private or protected methods is to protect the data properties from being accessed by bypassing the accessor

47213320

i put the simple script to build everything into package.json so you can run npm run-script complie to get both server and client code complied into dist folder

47213367
filtering	grouping
i think it is better to filtering out the grouping with peak_pcent all is na and set when using the max function

47213373
int	double
so you would not be able to declare a single arr array variable in fill s scope and have the array type be int or double based on user input well unless you use std variant or std any but that is a topic of its own

47213416
opera	google-chrome

option 1 submit the form using post get

47213932
submit	submission
this entails you having a element enclosing the inputs along with a submit button for submission the form

47213932
post	get
the data in the form is sent using either the post or get method to the script you specify in the form-tag

47213932
post	get
again similar logic applies you serialize the data in some way provide an endpoint usually a script to talk to and communicate the data to that script via post get

pull	push
there are roughly two categories of apis here pull and push

47214496
pull	push
push - pull

47214496
pull	push
to build push on top of pull constantly be pulling from the pull api and then push out the chunks to any consumers

47214496
pull	push
to build pull on top of push subscribe to the push api immediately create a buffer that accumulates all results and when someone pull grab it from that buffer

47214496
pull	push
push and pull have distinct not-very-overlapping areas where they each work well and saying that we should pick one of the four apis you mentioned and stick with it as some people do is shortsighted and leads to awkward code

qpainter	qimage
one likely reason is that at the point you create a qpixmap from your qimage object the qpainter s changes haven t been all flushed out to the qpixmap yet

47214733
qpainter	qimage
by putting the qpainter inside a separate scope we force the qpainter s destructor to run before setpixmap is called thus making sure that it has flushed all of its changes out to the qimage object already

particularly when calling git from applications such as visual studio s team explorer it is important that stdin stdout stderr are closed properly

47232450
stdout	stderr
mingw optionally redirect stderr stdout via the same handle

47232450
stdout	stderr
then stderr will simply be written to the same handle as stdout

47233446
width	height
then i have a photo with vertical orientation please notice that height is higher have 6000 pixels and width have 4000 pixels so it is definitely vertical photo

47233446
width	height
and the problem i have is that bitmap recognize height and width incorrectly

47233446
width	height
in debug it is clearly seen that height have 4000 pixels and width have 6000 pixels

int	boolean
i was thinking one solution to reduce code would be to make an interface called executable with the declared method execute int a int b which returns a boolean

47233820
inherited	properties
the usermanager has an internal properties store which inherited from iuseremailstore which has the methods used by the usermanager when you ask it to confirm an email address confirmemailasync calls iuseremailstore.setemailconfirmed and also when you check to see if an email is confirmed

ng-init	ng-app
ng-init runs when the view is loaded so in this quantify and price are default getting set by ng-init to 1 and 20 ng-app is a directive to denote that from here onwards anything inside this div is a angular app and ng-init is used to execute expression or value on the load of the view.and by default the input values will increase and decrease by 1 only as it is default functionality of input type number it is nothing to do with whatever default we are setting in ng-init so your value increases and decreases by 1

47234033
width	height
so after digging a bit into the problem i realized that the problem was that a simple document.getelementbytagname img and modifying the entire img s is not appropriate for instance if you just want some printable img to have a custom height and width you cannot just suddenly shrink and re-grow all the images so it s a better approach to take your printable content to a hidden div and then in the hidden div do all the maninpulation and then use that hidden div for printable content

47234056

47234513
min	max
i want to compute the max and min across the third axis 3 elements and then divide by the remaining number element

47234533
post	get
or can you tell me the easy way to get photo from post page facebook

47234568
min	max
the trick to finding the third one is subtracting from 3 those max and min indices

47234568
min	max
the borderline case would be when max and min indices are the same all three elements along the last axis are the same for which the third element index would also be the same

47234568
min	max
we could get the summation along the axis and subtract min and max values to get the third element and simply plug that into the formula -

47234574
do-while	goto
without the goto statements the program will not loop back to the beginning of and instead it keeps looping itself when it reaches the do-while loop

lazy loading working fine with google-chrome but when we access the pages on safari lazy-loading not working

47234603
put	get
edit order is important here to if you have any other routes going to the same url eg users user_id friends when you nest resources you need to put get users cu_id friends .

47234622

some so post note similar problems with google-chrome - printing bootstrap from google-chrome causes height truncation google-chrome truncates page contents in print preview - but i get the issue on a wide variety of browsers ie firefox google-chrome .

47234713
chown	chmod
it would not achieve the same success as chmod does not actually change the ownership which chown does

47234713
chown	chmod
so chmod is in reference to defining who can do what to a file chown is determining who owns the file

47234776

when creating staticlayout you assign its width and can check its height it will automatically start the text in a new line if it s too long

47236415

just iterate over your texts array for every line of text create a staticlayout with your desired width and make sure it s height fits inside your textview height if not decrease the font size and recheck

the justification for bounds-checking of strcpy memcpy always comes back to this rule - those functions are defined to behave as if they were a series of character assignments from a base pointer that s incremented to get to the next character and the increment of a pointer is covered by p +1 as discussed in this rule

userid	app-id
if there is one and it is not completely stopping this approach dead in it s tracks say a few hundred per app rather than five you could use multiple app ids if you don t need to relate data between user accounts too much - because the app-scoped userid will be different per app id so that could making connections between friends that are in different app-id test groups etc

octal	hex
per shell rules you cannot include a single quote within a single quote delimited string foo bar though no amount of backslashes will work to escape that mid-string so you need to either jump back out of the single quotes to provide a single quote and then come back in with foo bar or use the octal escape sequence 047 do not use the hex equivalent as it is error prone wherever you want a single quote foo 047bar

47254288
ssl	https
the same happens on the production server ie https is still enforced when requires_channel is removed or set to http but there i can live with that because in the end i will have to generate certificate and launch ssl connection in apache config files but i can t work on dev version

put	get
so we have one protocol that allows us to ask dns about services and we have one protocol that allows us to ask a group of hosts to answer dns queries â when we put the two together we get a way of asking hosts for services

47254740
bonjour	avahi	tvos	ios
the combination of those two protocols is sometimes called zeroconf networking and is already implemented in macos ios tvos and watchos where it is called bonjour android most unices via avahi a portable implementation of those two protocols and many home devices such as tvs

47254740
bonjour	avahi
then assuming that your application registers itself with the os s mdns service bonjour on macos avahi on unices â you would get back a list of all hosts on the local network that support your protocol

i ve looked at mac mouse trackpad speed programmatically but the function is deprecated

47254781

i had put a claimstransformer together on some earlier attempts i can get claims added using that see the change above in bold in the login controller code but what do i now do with the claimsprincipal variable identitywithinfoclaims

47254876
getter	setter
it s pretty obvious that they are used as getter and setter for class attributes with the parameter being the instance from which the attribute should be retrieved

47254877
multiplying	add
if you multiplying divide and add diffferent floats you might get something like 0.99999999999999999f due to representation errors and rounding

47254893
int	double
on the other hand would fail as this results in a int being added to a double thus resulting in a double that cannot be put in an int

47255676
width	height
they have different src width and height
