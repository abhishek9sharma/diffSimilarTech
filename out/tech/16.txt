width	height
but remember your file has 2 integers at the begining -- width height which determine how many more to read another width height number of integers

600010
width	height
you will need to use two buffers -- one for the width and height and then depending on their value another one to read the rest of the file

600017
dxcore	coderush
this will producethe effect described here lines between methods in the c# editor coderush dxcore plugin

subtraction	modulo	subtraction	multiplication	division	modulo	division	multiplication	division	subtraction	multiplication	modulo
since most hash functions used for hash tables are of k c_1 c_2 the difference to an array lookup in a rather sparse and or optimal hash table consists of one indirection two multiplication a subtraction and a division an efficient modulo implementation using the cpus capabilites might reduce that by a subtraction and a multiplication and the array lookup

600451
width	height
if you do take this approach your css will need additional properties for the height and width of the background image

in some browsers in firefox google-chrome and apparently ie8 you can use the data url scheme to embed an image file in html

600830
integer	unsigned
both these can be stored as a 4 byte integer and if space is really tight can be combined into unix time seconds since the epoch 1 1 1970 as an unsigned integer which will be good till around 2106 as

600830
integer	unsigned
unsigned integer max val 4 294 967 295 - can hold 136 years of seconds

the parent table gets the autoincrement oid column and the children get plain oid columns

600885
implements	extends
also unless you are doing something fancy in changeview that can t be done using the methods in a uiviewcontroller object then you should just use it instead if it is neccesary to implements your own view switching method then you can extends uiviewcontroller instead of implemtning part of the view controlelr in your view

if you re using 10.4 then you have to write custom getter setter see apple s docs on creating non-standard persistent attributes

601301
polymorphism	specialization
basically c# just doesn t want you to work with specialization except for polymorphism

601325

i usually use centos or debian

601663
getter	setter
they are analogous to getter and setter in java

601696
next	except
continuing with the next line in the original proc function would be a very bad thing - it would mean the code executing radically differently in a debugger to in release where the exception would indeed cause execution to exit that proc function unless there s an except finally block

entity-relationship	diagram	mockups	balsamiq
but balsamiq mockups is a really easy tool for mocking up diagram sql and entity-relationship included

601833
ant	maven
in particular 1.7 comparing maven with ant has an interesting discussion

601833
ant	maven
maven has strong points but nothing that can t be done by an ant build process

601833
ant	maven
dependency management ant has the ivy subproject which can interact with maven repositories

601833
ant	maven
build logic reuse maven plugins you can also achieve that in ant with macrodef s and task libraries

601833
ant	maven
the thing is with maven you get these features out-of-the-box while with ant you need a rock-solid build a very strict set of rules and a way to enforce them for instance make sure that everyone follows the conventions when they create a new subproject that they reuse the existing blocks instead of doing everything from scratch etc.

601833
ant	maven
then i would try to balance the cost of adding the missing features to the existing ant script against the cost of migrating to maven if you don t know maven that also includes the cost of learning it

601844
freebsd	linux
i use python on my mac mostly for development of server side applications which later will run on freebsd linux boxes

cxxtest	cppunit
we intend to use a testing framework like cppunit oder cxxtest

601996
wxhaskell	gtk2hs
my impression is that wxhaskell allows you to spend a little more time in the higher-level bindings but i ve not done much gtk2hs and in any event you definitely find yourself working on the thin end of the wrapper for both libraries - and i think the overall programming complexity is similar in both cases

601996
wxhaskell	gtk2hs
wxhaskell is probably a little easier to build if you are not on linux gtk2hs is likely easier if you are linux hosted but both are pretty complex to build to be honest as there are a significant number of dependencies in both cases

601996
wxhaskell	gtk2hs
i would admit that with only a small amount of extra work the same could be done with gtk2hs so this is probably the weakest argument in favour of wxhaskell

602044

602279
stringbuilder	stringwriter
what is the difference between stringwriter and stringbuilder and when should i use one or the other

602286
stringbuilder	stringwriter
a stringwriter is used to write text to a file memory and a stringbuilder is used to append strings together in a memory-efficient manner

windows	wow64
what s meant by that incompatibility you read about is that 32 and 64-bit assemblies can t be part of the same application - an application has to target either one or the other though 32-bit application will generally run fine on windows x64 using wow64 which just acts as a translator

602759

602904
client-side	server-side
even ignoring the server-side stuff there s a huge client-side problem

602913
hide	show
by default all of the values are are show in the list so you need to hide certain columns by setting their widths to 0

602914
uiview	calayer
i do this so that i can share the same core animation calayer layout code between my iphone application and a mac client the iphone inverts the normal quartz coordinate system for calayers to match that of the uiview

mouse	keyboard
there is other event handlers that you can use to intercept keyboard input but they have some limitations the winproc will allow you to check any message directed to the control including delete backspace copy and paste etc mouse clicks etc

603297
postgresql	mysql
for database i think you can get mysql or postgresql as they are both free and will lower your costs

603307
ant	maven
if you re using ant and you want maven style dependency management without maven take a look at ivy

603307
maven	pom.xml
it can download from maven repositories and can even read maven pom.xml files

603370
versioning	upgrade
did you upgrade from a previous versioning

603381
uninstall	upgrade
upgrade work fine if no components have changed but any time a component changes the upgrade fails and it requires the user to manually uninstall and reinstall

spaces	delimiter
the other option is delimiter name pseudo name spaces trick

603411
post	get
when i get home i can post the full code if you like

603428

603444
antivirus	mcafee
we have shadowprotect installed on the server along with mcafee antivirus

603454
inline	member-functions
this is not about virtual function in particular but about inline and member-functions generally

603454
inline	member-functions
for member-functions if you define your function in the class it is implicitly inline

603458
instances	transient
but for access from scripts and actions the way is to inject transient variables into the process instances keeping in mind you may need to work around bug jbpm-304 by sub typing script and adjusting the associated hibernate mapping files

603506
ant	maven
you should also keep in mind that there is a plugin for running ant commands from within maven

603533
maven	cobertura
if you use maven for doing your builds you can use the cobertura plugin

603542
folder	directory
delete the entire activemq_home directory and reinstall it in a different folder

603573
opera	firefox
this works in firefox 3 ie7 and somewhat in opera 9.6

603592
division	multiplication
you can use some simple multiplication and division

603616
gridview	rowdatabound
use the rowdatabound event built into the gridview then you could do something like this in vb.net

603630
lxml	beautifulsoup
okay first in regards to parsing the html if you follow the recommendation of zweiterlinde and s.lott at least use the version of beautifulsoup included with lxml

603630
lxml	elementtree
secondly .find and .findall come from lxml trying to be compatible with elementtree and those two methods are described in xpath support in elementtree

603689
post	get
as for doing it in php you can easily make the button send a post or get request for the starting amount

603705
folder	directory
if not then start looking at the iis configuration and make sure that web site directory is the same folder as you are dumping the web service files

603783

move	drag
on the iphone if you touch and hold your finger on an icon it starts vibrating then you can drag them around while the other icons move aside and rearrange dynamically

604047
ant	cruisecontrol
the cruisecontrol ant invocation has nothing to do with the svn label that is contructed as such

604047
ant	cruisecontrol
the svn label is used to annotate the build-names whereas the build.log is really just the output from ant as it is passed through cruisecontrol

604047
ant	cruisecontrol
another way is to use the svnlabelincrementer to assign the revision number to the label and pass that onto the ant script using the buildproperties that are passed from cruisecontrol to the build scripts

604123
calloc	malloc
objects that are allocated by malloc or another function of that family like calloc have allocated storage duration

604143
selecteditem	selectedindex
when this happens the combobx sees it as a complete reset of the selection and clears the selecteditem selectedindex

604143
selecteditem	selectedindex
note the last case - the reset...when you load a new itemsource you end up here and any selecteditem selectedindex gets blown away

604153
free	malloc
if you allocate something on the heap using malloc that memory is good for as long as you want to use it - until you call free at which point it is released

604161
margin	font-size
i have an h1 with a defined font-size and line-height and zero padding and margin

604176
rss	feed
rss certainly has astronomical adoption rates compared to atom so if you re interested in being in the mainstream i suggest providing an rss feed

604219
getter	setter
in java the getter and setter are in essence properties

604225
getter	setter
the way i see it properties allow me to interact with the exposed data in a natural way without losing the encapsulation provided by getter setter methods

604225
getter	setter
all of this can be done with getter setter methods but the verbiage is much higher and the usage is much less natural

604231
button	checkbox
if you have an existing pdf that you want to populate and that pdf just has text fields no checkbox or radio button then cam pdf may be able to help you

604314
width	height
if the problem is strictly with images i believe you can use the height and width attributes of the tag to tell the browser what size the images will be

width	height	width	margin	margin	height
edit someone else suggested css and i believe that using the height and width directives from css will give you the same result as using the same attributes of the tag but doesn t limit you strictly to images and a will play nicer with any margin or padding directives you might use

604338
fink	macports
if you get python from macports or fink you will not be able to run wxpython unless you run it through x11

604372
int	chars
i threw int chars another type and it was all caught the same way

604396
getter	setter
this makes it so that you can specify getter and setter for properties as necessary but makes it so that you don t have to define boilerplate functions for every property just the ones where you want to do some sort of processing on it before returning the value

604407
cvs	svn
i use cvs not svn

604410
mouse	keyboard
such as loading a large amount of data this would cause the keyboard and mouse to lockup

604410
mouse	keyboard
i m looking for a lightweight solution that would allow this to be done without tying down the keyboard and mouse

604430
sqlcommandbuilder	sqldataadapter

604460
prefuse	flare
so i took alook at all the given answers and links it looks like prefuse flare will by the optimal choice

604467
ioexception	objectoutputstream
you should also consider that the objectoutputstream constructor can throw an ioexception so may want to cover this case in your tests

604470
int	double
functions with only simple arguments int double worked fine but i could not determine how to marshal the arrays

604477
put	get
the low-tech way to get around this is simply to set the property licenseaccepted to 1 and put some useful readme type information into the license box

604484
folder	directory
edit -- i did as suggested and added the output folder to the linker s additional directory

604499
getdate	dateadd
the key thing is using the proper syntax for a jet database and that means that the first argument for dateadd is a string value d and that you can t use a sql server function getdate but must instead use jet s function for the same purpose date

604500
toggleclass	slidetoggle
i might also suggest slidetoggle and toggleclass

604505
int	chars
the streams and strings use those traits to figure out a variety of things like the eof value comparison of a range of chars widening of a chars to an int and such stuff

604528

i am using single table inherited and have comments on all the subclassing

604891
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
the following code works fine in firefox google-chrome safari ie8 - but not ie8 in ie7 compatability mode

604902

605057
kerberos	ntlm
fiddler2 will indicate if the authentication header is ntlm vs kerberos

605124
cos	sin
i was aware from this as a possible issue from the outset and so have limited my use of non-integer position math as much as possible but for smooth diagonal movement at varying speeds i m calculating the angle between points in radians then getting the x and y components of movement with sin and cos

605124
floating-point	fixed-point
i m also doing some calculations for line segment intersections line-circle intersections circle-rect intersections etc that also probably need to move from floating-point to fixed-point to avoid cross-machine issues

605124
put	get
if i can get this working i plan to open-source the math functions i put together so that there will be a resource for other c# programmers out there

605130
post	get
the parent code would handle connection tracking keep alives get post head requests and feed them off to handlers that were loaded on start up

605171
spoofing	traffic
this will protect you in two ways firstly it will protect you from spoofing an attacker will be rejected if he does not have your certificate even if he bypasses iptables by spoofing his address or because your iptables config gets overwritten by an admin and secondly it will protect your data from prying eyes an attacker will not be able to snoop traffic for your passwords. some applications most database engines net-snmpd set up in v3 mode etc. support ssl natively

605196
apache	nginx
there have been two pretty good blog posts lately about setting up nginx but both are using nginx to serve static or cached content and apache + mod_wsgi to serve django

605196
apache	nginx
edit ok i dug out an old tar file with my nginx + django + virtual host config files from a year ago before i switched to apache + mod_wsgi

605240
debian	linux
in my experience properly configured it can be helpful even for large installations like debian linux 2gb download though for debian case there are specialized tools like apt-cache

605260
inherited	subclassing
off the top of my head you could subclassing qcombobox and override hideevent qhideevent inherited from qwidget

605260
mouse	keyboard
i looked at the qt source code and it looks like when the keyboard and mouse events are captured that as soon as qt has decided to emit the activated int index signal hidepopup has been called

605295
accessor	properties
i am having an issue where an exception being thrown from within a properties set accessor is not being caught by my global exception handler

605308
.htaccess	httpd.conf
does every server have the equivalent to block xml files and if they do can they be altered on a folder level like the .htaccess can and not just a httpd.conf file

605337
cvs	svn
for example in full branch source control like cvs or svn merging can be difficult and you might be better off with the first model while if using more complex system like ibm clearcase and with a larger size of team you could be better of with the second model or a combination of the two

605337
cvs	svn
the above model does not make much sense with teams under 50 developers and source control system without sparse branches and proper merging capability like cvs or svn which would just make this whole model a nightmare to setup manage and integrate

605380
joomla	vbulletin
gallery vbulletin and joomla all use the second method i mentioned

605385
portrait	landscape
i m working in landscape so might not have noticed any deficiencies in portrait mode. here s my code - it s part of a categeory on uiimage

605395

bazaar	git
distributed version control systems such as mercurial bazaar or git are better suited for such tasks

605476
hash	md5
with md5 hash

605544
int	double
the range of double is way greater than the range of 32 or 64 bit int which is why std floor returns a double

605544
int	double
casting to int should be fine so long as it s within the appropriate range - but be aware that a double can t represent all 64 bit int exactly so you may also end up with errors when you go beyond the point at which the accuracy of double is such that the difference between two consecutive double is greater than 1

605547
int	double
another reason is that the range of double is far greater than that of int

605547
int	double
it may not be possible to round all double to int

605565

605828
implements	extends
i m extends a class arrayblockingqueue that implements the serializable interface

605828
serializable	deserialization
however it is strongly recommended that all serializable classes explicitly declare serialversionuid values since the default serialversionuid computation is highly sensitive to class details that may vary depending on compiler implementations and can thus result in unexpected invalidclassexceptions during deserialization

605829
draggable	droppable
you ll need to install jquery and also jquery ui and then use the draggable and droppable plugins

605939
suppressfinalize	finalizer
calling suppressfinalize tells the gc that there s no need to call your object s finalizer presumably because all your cleanup was done when dispose was called

605939
suppressfinalize	finalizer
if you don t have a finalizer on your class then you don t need to call suppressfinalize at all since there s no finalizer to suppress

606017
int	chars
it should be possible to cast explicitly or implicitly the chars to an unsigned int and then just use such constants

606028
imperative	declarative
when comparing to ant it s pluggable in a similar fashion but it s declarative rather than imperative with standardized dependency management and a build result repository which may even be distributed

606050

606328
post	get
if you wanted to send the person back to the previous page and have it work regardless of the referrer being set correctly you can append a get parameter to the url or post

606341
put	get
i d say you might get faster perf if you put everything in one regex but put the most likely option first followed by the second most likely etc

606347
subclass	abstract-class
the only difference between virtual and abstract is that an abstract method or propery has no implementation in the class where it has been defined the abstract-class and that it must be overriden in a subclass

606369
regasm	regsvr32
you must now register it with regasm instead of regsvr32

606375
vmware	virtualbox
another approach i would suggest is to install server 2003 iis6 server 2008 iis7 on a virtual machine - virtualpc vmware virtualbox if you don t have access to msdn downloads of server images you can always download trials - server 2008 trial is good for 60 days plus two resets

606398
int	double	int	chars
i m sure by now - cause i ve taken my time typing this - there are lots of answers telling you how to do this tryparse int first then double then test length for chars if not then it s a string etc but if i were you i d try to not do that and see if there s any way you can get or pass some meta-data that will tell you what type it is and not just what type it might be

606406
matplotlib	scipy
the basic packages you will probably need to get started would be numpy basic array numerics scipy more algorithms and matplotlib plotting

awt	swing
also jws is similar to clickonce but runs on all platforms and requires that you use either awt swing which is painful or javafx which isn t very mature

606456

uiview	uiwindow
if you look at the docs for the uiwindow class you ll see that it has additonal methods above and beyond what a regular uiview has

607034
implements	extends
i guess the best way would be to implements a special field class that extends filefield with custom validation of the uploaded file

607075
cairngorm	mate
if cairngorm is a sledgehammer then mate is a leatherman

for-loop	loops
don t be tempted to think in java i d use a for-loop here how do i do for loops in lisp

607378
min	max
i d try to integrate it simply reading its text output to pick the values you want to min max imize

607385
stdout	stderr
in addition pre-defined console streams such as stdin stdout and stderr will be set up

607448
super	self
super d self .__init__ is called

sql is a declarative language rather than the imperative languages you are most used to

607560
hash	salt	hash	md5	salt	md5
i then take the users password concatenate the salt to it and store an md5 hash of this salt password in the same database row

607560
hash	salt	hash	md5	salt	md5
3 - when a user then logs in i take the password she s entered and concatenate the salt to it create an md5 hash of that and compare it to what i have stored in the database - if they match the user has entered the right password and their username is written to the session

607580
int	chars
hence it would put into the array a one byte op code followed by 0 1 or 2 bytes which could be a chars an int or a pointer to a string based on the op code

607580
int	chars
my simple solution 4 separate stacks s one for the opcode enum and one each for chars int and string

607609
stdout	stderr
here s how you would redirect stdout and stderr to a log file

607609
stdout	stderr
the redirect stdout to a file and and the redirects stderr to stdout so any error messages will be logged as well

607612
salt	md5
if valid update the user table salt and password with a new salt you have the password from the user so you can md5 it and the salt again

607619
rss	feed
i wrote something cute and small like this last summer but i cheated using an actual sms server and used twitter to receive my text messages in a specific format then had a daemon service running through my rss feed every n time units to pull in the data and store it in a flat file

i m trying to parse the title tag in an rss 2.0 feed into three different variables for each entry in that feed

607763
antivirus	norton
the client swears that the only change they made to that computer since i installed this app was installing norton antivirus which has never caused problems before with our software

607804
rss	feed
as a side note you might want to look at the universal feed parser for handling the rss parsing as feed have a bad habit of being malformed

607814
rss	feed
you can use an rss feed from currency source to get information that s about as up-to-date as possible

607827
width	height	actualheight	actualwidth
i am currently working with panel s in wpf and i noticed that as regards the width and height properties there are also two other properties called actualwidth and actualheight

607841
width	height
it like with winforms there was a size and a clientsize property the differ slightly and you should use the atual client size of rendering and the width height for layout

607849
width	height
width height is the i requested or layout i size

607849
actualheight	actualwidth
actualwidth actualheight is the i rendered i size

607934
superclass	subclassing
i have an abstract superclass and various subclassing

607947

add the jar to your project - create a dir in your project optional maybe call it lib and import the jar into it using file- import or if your os supports drag it as an icon into the folder on windows i open an explorer window and drag it from there into the folder in eclipse

607967
put	get
put the data someplace statically accessible and have the subclasses get it from there

607972
superclass	subclassing
if you have a fixed set of subclassing then you can put the data in the superclass

607972
superclass	subclassing
you might get subclassing let the superclass know of their existence from the static initialiser or use an agent

607972
superclass	subclassing
generally superclass should not be aware of their subclassing

607972
superclass	subclassing
however you might want to think or better refactor your superclass into a supertype and some other class responsible for your subclassing

607975
put	get
if no match then i get the record from the database and put it in the array

607978
subclass	abstract-class
the other option is to put a registry map in the abstract-class - if you need to mandate it the abstract constructor takes the static value or just stores the subclass if calculations are needed

607984
awt	swing	button	checkbox
the swing awt components palette has a whole bunch of stuff that the javafx script code clips palette does not it has button checkbox combobox comboboxitem label radiobutton slider textfield and togglebutton

you set up the now loading in viewwillappear but you never see it since by the time viewdidappear completes it s done with the heavy work

608207
base	fractions
most decimal fractions cannot be represented as base 2 floating point numbers

608207
base	fractions
precision as displayed will round based on the number format so a number format of 0.00 will cause it to round to two decimal places - but most decimal fractions are not representable by excel s base 2 number system so 0.58 might still get you the same thing when written to xml

width	height
found an apple dev sample that created rendered each character and got its pertinent info width height offset etc.

608286
udp	tcp
how does one set the tos flags dscp flags in ruby on a udp tcp stream

608291
width	height
id sec subj type viewrec2 year faci mywindow width 800 height 800 left 0 top 100 screenx 0 screeny 100

608324
tstringlist	tlist
one way would be to create a tstringlist and have each item s object point to another tlist or tstringlist which would contain all of your values

608330
boost	stl
it will work on any stl collection vectors boost array etc

608335
vsto	add-in
the answer is installing vsto 3.0 add-in for office does work for wix but i dont know anything about this wixofficeextension

608340
int	chars
if it is one row that suggests a data issue - i doubt non-ascii special chars would cause this but try returning just an int to test that - or even select 1 .

608357
firefox	safari
i ve tested in firefox 3 and safari 4.

608377
merb	ruby-on-rails
would it be worth it to use ruby-on-rails or merb on a project as small as this

608450
folder	directory
to scan the directory of a folder which is used for zip uploads

608450
folder	directory
i want to be able to find all the folder inside my folder so i can delete them and their contents leaving only the files in the directory

608483
merb	ruby-on-rails
merb is merging with ruby-on-rails for ruby-on-rails version 3.0

608491
ubuntu	debian
on ubuntu debian you can use the following

608532
onkeyup	onkeydown
onkeypress onkeydown onkeyup methods in javascript

608533
bash	tcsh
the only thing i could think to try is to change the shell settings plesk has a dropdown list of bash csh tcsh and so on next to the allow ssh using option

608540
filtering	grouping
sometimes it makes sense for a single type to have a lot of methods - such as system.linq.enumerable but partial classes can help in such cases if you can break the type up into logical grouping in the case of enumerable grouping by aggregation set operations filtering etc would seem natural

608556
filtering	grouping
however if you assign temp out to a send port grouping the message is sent to all the ports in the grouping irregardless of the filtering set on each port

608571
vb.net	vb6
the software was written in vb6 and ported to vb.net we want to update it to use .net functionality but i am not sure where to start with my research

608571
sqldatareader	sqlconnection
we are currently using sqlconnection sqldataadapter sqldatareader to connect to the database

608579
umask	chmod
the container folder has chmod 775 and the umask is set to 022

608634
switching	screens
the info screens has a back button to switching the views back

608640
button	checkbox
namely you can tab between fields you can select lots of checkbox and you have a click a button to actually submit your data

608686
implements	extends
probably the class that you are extends or potentially interface you are implements implements java.io.serializable

608697
rss	feed
then automate retrieving what you need from those resources using rss feed comes to mind such that they can seamlessly be used offline

608718
min	max
if your numbers are large enough you could wrap through the min max values for integers and end up in a mess

608728
int	double
int int + double is essentially

608728
int	double
int double + double

608728
int	double
the int + double forces the result to an int while the other one requires casting

608793
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
that ll work in ie6 firefox google-chrome and safari

608811
int	double
double + int returns double so

608811
int	double
double double + int is legitimate see jls 5.1.2 widening primitive conversion

608811
int	double
int double + int is narrowing primitive conversion and requires explicit cast

608832
mouse	keyboard	hid	keyboard
the transfer cable isn t explicitly an hid like a mouse or keyboard but it conforms to the hid spec

608839
equals	gethashcode
okay so if i override equals i need to override gethashcode and vice versa

608848
qmainwindow	qdockwidget
you ll need to dig abit into qmainwindow code to see exactly how to do this and probably to inherit from qdockwidget which is something you usually are not supposed to do

608893
daemons	systemd
systemd administration commands and daemons

608895
width	height
using objective-c cocoa how do you calculate the width and height required to draw a string based on a particular font

608904
cos	sin
the cpu sounds a bit high are you using a lot of trigonometric functions like sin cos

608924
equals	gethashcode
if i override equals and gethashcode how do i decide which fields to compare

608931
equals	gethashcode
if you as the class designer consider two instances of that class to be equals if they share the same myid then you only need to test myid in your overriden equals and gethashcode methods

608936
equals	gethashcode
a question if i override equals and gethashcode how do i decide which fields i compare

608962
put	get
but i can t get this to work if i put it between the tags .

609033
nhibernate	llblgenpro
i haven t actually done this in nhibernate yet but we did this with llblgenpro and it worked out really well

609058
sqldatasource	detailsview
i dont know how to setup sqldatasource and detailsview to accomplish this

609089
division	modulo
the modulo returns the remainder from a truncating division

609133
int	chars
for highly stressed servers you are going to have to get more involved in how bytes are sent back and forth but at this level you should abstract out your sends into a separate protocol type class that builds the data to be sent and sends it in a burst and have a receiving protocol that receives a bunch of data and processes it as a complete unit instead of breaking things down to sending receiving an int chars byte array etc

609156
memcached	apc
for this in php you need apc which comes pretty much as standard with php these days and will be standard as of php 6 --all you have to do is enable it in the config--or memcached particularly if you ve got some sort of clustered solution

609168
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in ie firefox but in google-chrome it seems that it can t find the background image and makes the background nothing

609180
division	modulo
the modulo returns the remainder after division so

609181
gnupg	gpgme
you may want to leverage pgp by using gpgme gnupg made easy a library designed to make access to gnupg easier for applications

609216
disk	ram
it 1.6 ghz n 1 gb of ram no multiple disk just a single read slow disk for sql server os and extras

609250
button	checkbox
the form can also contain a varying number of input fields such as text fields radio button checkbox dropdowns select tags and textareas

609255
firefox	safari
it works fine in firefox and safari but bombs in ie

609260
mbunit	nunit
the steps taken in this nunit example apply to an mbunit implementation

609279
free	calloc
in the second calloc and free are used instead of _alloca

609279
free	calloc
the weird thing is that i use the calloc free technique in almost every other gmp wrapping function i have and they all work

609313
gtk	gdk
the difficulty here is that swt talks to gtk which talks to gdk which then talks to x

609326
submit	submission
next if the request type is a post and the mime type is application x-www-form-urlencoded or multipart form-data then that is usually a form submission a user has clicked submit or similar. 2

609436
outputstream	inputstream
what i d like to do is hand my communicators an inputstream and outputstream or reader and writer that could be from a serial port file stdin stdout piped from a test function whatever

609438
public	protected
since jsdt is a reimplementation of the jdt interfaces it may just be reusing jdt s private protected public model best it can without an actual way to mark fields methods for access control

609528
websphere	ibm
ibm websphere voice

609561
width	height
is also a relative unit in this case relative to either the height or width of a parent element

609577
getelementsbytagname	getelementbyid
both getelementbyid and getelementsbytagname just perform some operations but only effect they have is my cpu usage jumping to max

609610
implements	extends
to support it natively you probably have to extends webhttpbinding or make your own binding and implements custom encoder

609632
pop-up	dialog	versioning	upgrade
the dialog that pop-up has a section for a minimum required versioning for this application which lets you enforce that a user upgrade to a specific versioning

609632
versioning	upgrade
they ll also be forced to upgrade if they re running a versioning older than the minimum

609663
nstreecontroller	nsarraycontroller
the controller key pop-up menu is a way to help you discover what keys the controller typically a nsarraycontroller nsobjectcontroller or a nstreecontroller presents

609668
getter	setter
it is important to note that getter setter method signatures can be used in an interface as well

609668
implements	extends
often times and interface and an abstract class are used together to achieve different results utilizing inheritance and polymorphism extends implements

609674
int	chars
an enum can not use chars as it s base type but you can use chars literals to specify an int value

609698
opera	google-chrome
the results are very different for different browsers with google-chrome getting all the points for speed and opera a good second - but that s not the question here

609700
width	height
2 ensure that the source image width and height are multiples of 16 possibly by cropping the images

609723
sqldatasource	objectdatasource
our application uses objectdatasource sqldatasource and code-behind data binding

609723
sqldatasource	objectdatasource
these errors seem to appear only in the pages the use sqldatasource but not in those using objectdatasource or code-behind data binding

609774
erd	diagram
dezign from datanamic erd tool can read in access databases and make a diagram out of it

609785
kde	gnome	dia	visio
some projects that strive to be alternatives to visio are kivio kde and dia gtk gnome

609872
bazaar	git	bazaar	svn
i m relatively new to git but i want to give it a try vs svn and bazaar

609891
postgresql	informix
some older unix-based db s such as informix se or older versions of postgresql would fork a single process per connection maintaining shared data structures by attaching to a shared memory pool

609945
fast-forward	merge
the imporant bit is that afaik push can only do fast-forward merge that is upload the changes and set the new head

609980
width	height
to do things such as variable width and height cells rows column as well as other advanced features - try extending the advanceddatagrid rather than the older more boring datagrid

610063
ssl	https
if you set up your server to use ssl then you can have encrypted transmission via ajax using https

610080
hash	md5
i would prefer to use something like an md5 hash but if i m wasting my time then i won t bother

610081
freemarker	velocity
velocity or even better freemarker

610090
scrypt	pbkdf2
therefore you should use something like bcrypt scrypt pbkdf2 with a large number of iterations

610094
hash	salt
you should use a salt cryptographically strong hash such as sha256managed

610098
freemarker	velocity
servlets in combination with velocity or freemarker for that matter offer a very good seperation of logic and presentation

610104
versioning	upgrade
it also isn t guaranteed to return the same hash value on different versioning of the .net framework meaning that an upgrade could potentially produce a different hash for the same string rendering your passwords unusable to you

610104
hash	salt	hash	md5	salt	md5
it is recommended that you use a salt hash or even md5 at a push

610120
capitalize	capitalization
real names have special capitalization rules the van der in johannes diderik van der waals is never capitalize farrah fawcett-majors has the m and cathal ã heochaidh uses the non-ascii ã and h which modify eochaidh to mean grandson of eochaidh

610125
postgresql	mysql
mysql ms sql express or postgresql

610147
strncmp	strcmp
you may consider using strncmp as a safer alternative to strcmp

610149
strstr	substr
try strstr if that is the case it finds substr

610159
ubuntu	debian
if am not wrong ubuntu s postgresql packages are derived from debian

610159
ubuntu	debian
if that s the case debian and all it s derivatives like ubuntu will depict the same behaviour

610223
folder	dir
the problem then is that the plugin uses the dependencies from in the plugins folder while the executable uses the dependencies from the root folder which are basically the same file in a different dir so while running the clr sees them as 2 different dll s and that really confuses the clr

610229
hash	salt
the client adds the salt to the password hash it and sends it to the server

610231
draggable	droppable
if you also include jquery ui and make your main div a draggable and all other divs droppable all you need is hook up on the droppable s over event to get notified when the main div is dragged over the other one

610232
width	height
if you re using jquery you can find the left top width and height of a div by using these

610238
strdup	strncpy	strcpy	strncpy	strcpy	strdup
while i admit that it s usually better to use strncpy in order to avoid buffer overflows the following an implementation of the strdup function for those not lucky enough to have it safely uses strcpy and should never overflow

610238
strcpy	strncpy	strlen	strcpy	strlen	strncpy
is guaranteed to have enough space to store and using strcpy saves us from having to store the strlen result in another function to use later as the unnecessary in this case length parameter to strncpy

610238
memcpy	strncpy
yet some people write this function with strncpy or even memcpy which both require a length parameter

610238
memcpy	strcpy	memcpy	strncpy	strcpy	strncpy
if you have a good reason not to use strcpy in this situation please give it - i d like to know why it might be better to use strncpy or memcpy in situations like this

610238
memcpy	strcpy	memcpy	strncpy	strcpy	strncpy
basically i just want to know why some people use memcpy when others use strcpy and still others use plain strncpy

610248
hash	salt
if the server only accepts the salt password on a connection which originally challenged with that salt then the hacker would have to keep connecting until he got the same salt as the one he saw the hash for

610260
memcpy	strcpy
i d tend to use memcpy if i have already calculated the length although strcpy is usually optimised to work on machine words it feels that you should provide the library with as much information as you can so it can use the most optimal copying mechanism

610260
memcpy	strcpy	memcpy	strncpy	strcpy	strncpy	strlen	strcpy	strlen	strncpy
but for the example you give it doesn t matter - if it s going to fail it will be in the initial strlen so strncpy doesn t buy you anything in terms of safety and presumbly strncpy is slower as it has to both check bounds and for nul and any difference between memcpy and strcpy isn t worth changing code for speculatively

610275
strlen	strcpy
what happens if this function is interrupted after successful memory allocation and thus the call to strlen the string grows and bam you have a buffer overflow condition since strcpy copies to the null byte

610277
strcpy	strncpy	strlen	strcpy	strlen	strncpy
but yeah strcpy is as good as strncpy in any situation where you are allocating memory for the destination buffer and have already used strlen to find the length

610280
hash	salt
if you can make sure that the server sends a sufficiently large salt and never the same salt twice i suspect a small portion of decent random numbers plus an incrementing counter then hash may be enough but i cannot prove that it is that d probably be enough

610288
strcpy	strncpy
the reason why people use strncpy not strcpy is because strings are not always null terminated and it s very easy to overflow the buffer the space you have allocated for the string with strcpy and overwrite some unrelated bit of memory

610288
strcpy	strncpy
with strcpy this can happen with strncpy this will never happen

610298
strcpy	strdup
well strcpy is not as evil as strdup - at least strcpy is part of standard c

610301
min	max
words can be blocked due to min max length restrictions and or the stopword file

610301
innodb	myisam
if you have the storage to spare what you can do is put the main canonical version of the data in an innodb table and then create a separate myisam table that contains a copy of the freetext content purely for use as searchbait

610316
strcpy	strncpy
strncpy is not by origin a bounded strcpy and the committee has preferred to recognize existing practice rather than alter the function to better suit it to such use

610397
fflush	gets
be sure any pending output gets fflush from the output buffer

610404
memcpy	strcpy	memcpy	strncpy	strcpy	strncpy
frankly if you are doing much string handling in c you should not ask yourself whether you should use strcpy or strncpy or memcpy

610440
strstr	strcpy	strlen	strcpy	strlen	strstr	stdio	strcat
i used stdio calls strlen strstr strcpy and strcat to do the string manipulation rather than win32 calls so your only dependancy is the c run time

610470
folder	directory
and like any other django project i have got apps inside the project root directory and some special folder like extensions a.k.a custom django command extensions

610489
width	text-align
padding-left - 1 2 width of element and text-align center

610491
blitz++	ublas
on the other hand high level c++ libraries like blitz++ and ublas allows you to state your intentions more clearly than relatively low-level fortran code and allows for whole new classes of compile-time optimizations

610494
strcpy	strncpy
once you get to real string ops like modifying the middle of a string it s almost as easy to pass the wrong length into strncpy and especially strncat as it is to call strcpy with a too-small destination

610494
strcpy	strncpy
of course you might still ask whether to use strncpy or strcpy in implementing that abstraction strncpy is safer there provided you fully grok what it does

610510
jquery	simplemodal
jquery is your friend for this try simplemodal

610530
gif	png
gif or png

610542
gif	png
png is a newer format and often better than either jpeg of gif - especially for screenshots

610557
gif	png
gif is not really a very good format and png can replace it completely in compression and quality for most applications but sometimes there are compatibility issues not sure if these have been ironed out in all the current webbrowsers

610563
gif	png
png is good in both regards but that discussion tends to get a little religious because there are license fees to pay if you develop a programm that reads writes gif or jpeg while png is free

610565
gif	png
png can do all that gif can except animation and even that is coming in apng and should almost always be smaller

610565
gif	png
if png isn t smaller than gif then your software may be saving it poorly - look for png optimisation progams like pngout and pngnq

610573
gif	png
historically gif was here first then jpg then png

610573
gif	png
jpg and png work well for most applications but the files will be larger than gif for very simple graphics

610585
gif	png
jpeg can have a higher compression ratio than png gif but is lossy as the cartoon above demonstrates

610597
gif	png
despite myths to the contrary png outperforms gif in most aspects

610597
gif	png
png is capable of every image mode of gif apart from animation and when using the same image mode png will have better compression due to its superior deflate algorithm compared to lzw

610597
gif	png
png is also capable of additional modes that gif cannot do such as 24 bit color and alpha transparency but this is where you need to be careful if you forget to convert to palette mode your png image may be saved in 24 bit color which will take more space

610597
gif	png
if you find png files are larger than the equivalent gif files then you re saving the png in 24 bit color and the gif in palette mode because a gif is always in palette mode

610628
runtimeexception	invocationtargetexception
however this exception is wrapped in other exceptions a number of times in an invocationtargetexception which in turn is wrapped in a runtimeexception

610649
int	boolean
since we re dealing with boolean is true and is also true you may wonder why this didn t either work anyway true being treated as an int quantity should still mean true true is a true value or throw an exception eg

610716
put	get
the problem is that it seems when the updates are performed they don t go to mongrel with the put action instead i just get the cached page no action in the database no flash message no nothing....

610744
move	drag	qstackedwidget	qdockwidget
maybe you could use something like a qstackedwidget in the dock widget and use drag and drop events to create new qdockwidgets or move the contents of a qdockwidget into a new qstackedwidget

610769
gif	png
despite myths to the contrary png outperforms gif in most aspects

610769
gif	png
png is capable of every image mode of gif apart from animation and when using the same image mode png will have better compression due to its superior deflate algorithm compared to lzw

610769
gif	png
png is also capable of additional modes that gif cannot do such as 24 bit color and alpha transparency but this is where you may run into problems on the web

610769
gif	png
if you find png files are larger than the equivalent gif files then you re saving the png in 24 bit color and the gif in palette mode because a gif is always in palette mode

610769
gif	png
if you find that your png files with transparency aren t working properly in ie6 while your gif files are then you are using 24 bit color + alpha transparency in png and palette mode with a transparent color with gif

610771
portrait	landscape
this seems to works ok at the moment however all the images are of the same size regardless of their orientation portrait landscape which means that only some of the photos appear properly and no all crushed up

610990
width	height
you could certainly just use a templatefield and an img tag without specifying width or height to address this

610994
union	distinct
your result set with union will eliminate distinct values

611038
appdata	denied
access to the path c users chloraphil appdata local temp tmp873b.tmp is denied

611047
mbunit	nunit
i want to add a plug for mbunit which i think is pretty much a superset of nunit features

611075
vmware	esx
i am just having a look at using powershell along with vi-toolkit to produce reports and charts showing vmware esx performance and resource usage

611102
post	get
you could use a webclient to send the login credentials to the server s login page via whatever method is required get or post but that wouldn t persist a cookie

611102
post	get
there is a way to get a webclient to handle cookies so you could just post the login info to the server then request the page you want with the same webclient then do whatever you want with the page

611122
abc	isinstance
so hasattr is useless but isinstance together with abc s provides a clean solution

611123
memset	memcmp
the problem is memset sizeof struct and setting structures members one by one produce different byte-to-byte result and therefore memcmp returns not equal result

611123
memset	memcmp
in my real code i m working with arrays of structures via generic pointers to execute memset memcmp and i m usually don t know exact type i have only sizeof struct value

611136
ncover	xunit.net	ncover	fxcop
also msbuild is intended for building something so i guess that ncover xunit.net and fxcop should not be part of it or should they

611150
jar	war
bundle code into a jar war or ear file

611154
portrait	landscape
one i keep in landscape and one i keep in portrait mode

611155
portrait	landscape
we have 1 28 monitor in landscape and 2 24 monitors in portrait which flank the big monitor

611218
hide	show
if you scroll down you can see that this function returns an object with show and hide methods

611244
width	height
your listsetcontainer needs to contain some non-floated content for it to hava a height width

611244
width	height
add a non-breaking space to the container then you should be able to set its width height as there will be something in it to render

611248
n-gram	words
a data-driven approach similar to n-gram frequency analysis that finds sets of semantically related words

611303
ostringstream	std
i prefer std ostringstream for complex concatenation

611371
int	chars
could you leave it as an int and format it for humans in your sql for example to pad with zeros to 4 chars wide

611374
getter	setter
you could use standard javabean setter getter to encapsulate your field

611472
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
rather than do it the way everyone else does windows explorer firefox google-chrome internet explorer opera certmgr etc they specifically only allow verisign

611484
uiview	calayer
i did a similar thing in order to invert the coordinate system the other way on the iphone so that a calayer hosted in a uiview would obey the mac s quartz coordinate system using the following code

611491
folder	directory
when my page loads onload i call a method createstuff that create a number of linkbuttons representing folder in a current directory which are wired to an event that changes the current directory to the one that is associated with the linkbutton

611491
folder	directory
therefore i also call createstuff in onloadcomplete resulting in the linkbuttons being updated and reflecting the folder in the new current directory

611491
folder	directory
the result is that while the text-property of the linkbuttons reflect the folder in the new directory clicking the linkbuttons doesn t fire the event

611493
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
right off the bat if viewed with firefox opera safari etc. when you click submit w o entering any values you get some nice error messages in the form the intended effect

611512
versioning	upgrade
can i downgrade the versioning level of tortoisesvn to match subclipse or upgrade subclipse

611542
memcpy	strcpy	memcpy	strncpy	strcpy	strncpy
memcpy can be faster than strcpy and strncpy because it does not have to compare each copied byte with 0 and because it already knows the length of the copied object

611689
ffmpeg	avisynth
you can use ffmpeg or mencoder to do the actual encoding and avisynth .avs files for the actual editing

611713
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
build in a more-compliant and developer-friendly browser like firefox first test thoroughly in ie and safari google-chrome webkit and opera periodically

611851
google-chrome	firefox
this code will work fine in webkit google-chrome but not in firefox where the second span will drop do you know why

611860
subtraction	addition
also watch out when doing addition subtraction

611898
hide	show
the results are that the style declaration hide every fieldset but the script doesn t show step1 at all

611906
post	put
such as post put and delete in a

611906
put	get
the methods get head put

611956
post	get
where there could be advantages disadvantages might be in how specific client platforms work with post and get routines in their networking stack as well as how the web server deals with those requests

611956
post	get
nonetheless from a programmer s perspective i prefer allowing either a post with all parameters in the body or a get with all params on the url and explicitly ignoring url parameters with any post request

612012
children	parent
give the parent element an id and you can use getelementbyid to grab it and iterate its children

612022
post	get
a web form can t be used to send a request to a page that uses a mix of get and post

612035
put	get
get put and delete methods are required to be idempotent

this code will work fine in webkit google-chrome but not in firefox

612146
client-side	server-side
this has the advantage of working even when javascript is turned off accessibility but at the cost of doing much more work on the server spending more time reasoning about the logical state of your page and possibly needing to duplicate client-side and server-side logic

612164
setinterval	settimeout
settimeout executes only once whereas setinterval repeats every x milliseconds so you d need only one

612164

without the typedef in some cases you can just add a forward declaration of struct foo

612439
uniq	grep
but my stubborn nature insists that i should be able to do it in bash using standard commandline tools like sort uniq find grep cut etc

612465
post	get
in that case your server could redirect non-js users to a get post page version

612476

my experience with floating point variables has always involved 4-byte multiples like singles 32 bit doubles 64bit and long doubles which i ve seen refered to as either 96-bit or 128bit

612533
hide	show
on each row of the form are links that when clicked launch a script to show new links allowing the user to add view or hide comments

612546
accessor	properties
the way i would approach this would be to manually observe the cost properties of each invoicelineitem object by implementing the to-many kvc accessor for the lineitems properties on the invoice class doing an addobserver removeobserver call in the insert remove methods respectively and then trigger the totalcost change manually using willchangevalueforkey didchangevalueforkey

612577

getter	setter
if you want to custimize it you can get great use of getter and setter though this is often used for more complex situations but may be interesting

613265
client-side	server-side
you risk not getting it trimmed if the user has js disabled or doesn t support it 10 of internet users plus the development overhead of keeping your client-side and server-side logic in sync

613410
sorting	filtering
each view would need its own cursor sorting sequence filtering etc

613428
getter	setter
i m aware that refresh fails to use the correct property getter and setter on the entity to raise the change notification events but perhaps there is another way to accomplish the same thing

in fact i tested this on firefox 3.0.3 on windows xp firefox 3.0.4 on macos 10.4 safari 3.2.1 on macos 10.4 and omniweb 5.8 on macos 10.4 and it all works the same

613705
google-chrome	safari
it uses webkit safari google-chrome etc. to render an html page into pdf and it is free

613743
width	height
although i am sure many will suggest to use a one-dimensional array with width height elements

613761
width	height
what daniel is talking about is that you will need to allocate memory for your array dynamically when your test width height method is called

613809
kerberos	ntlm
acting on behalf of the user on another box requires delegation to be set up if integrated windows authentication ntlm kerberos is used

613897

i need to have the first couple of pages in landscape then switch to portrait at a certain page and out

613995
post	get
php s own session module supports fetching the session id from get and post data besides cookies

614006
post	get
since the user has a session cookie the browser will get a response and there s nothing stopping the site from doing an ajax post to save the sensitive data on their server

614091
disk	ram
for example i would like to read the assembly as a stream of bytes from the network or from a zip archive and run it from ram itself without having to create an image on the disk

614126
google-chrome	firefox
to my surprise the push method often showed to be faster especially in firefox and sometimes in google-chrome

614148
public	protected
use a public method and chain it to a protected virtual method with the core shared implementation

614188
post	get
get method is use to send the less sensitive data whereas post method is use to send the sensitive data

614188
post	get
using the post method you can send large amount of data compared to get method

614188
post	get
data sent by get method is visible in browser header bar whereas data send by post method is invisible

614237
x86	64bit
everybody seems to know it but i just found out yesterday when i used this code in a new poject if you are compiling this with vs on a 64bit windows you have to set the target platform to x86 or the code won t run

614253
integer	unsigned
when calling put on an array object the argument has to be converted to an unsigned integer first because all property names - including array indices - are strings

614255
inherited	properties
all js object s so not strings numbers true false undefined or null inherited from a base object type -- the exact implementation varies it could be c++ inherited or manually in c there are benefits to doing it in either way -- the base object type defines the default properties access methods eg

614255
put	get
otherwise the value is placed into the array s own storage if the data is sufficiently compact then the engine will use the flat array storage in which case insertion and retrieval is just a standard array indexing operation otherwise the engine will convert the array to sparse storage and put get use a map to get from propertyname to value location

614255
put	get
the specifics of how the additional storage and how put get are dispatched differs from engine to engine -- but this is the clearest i can really describe the design implementation

614275
width	height
images must have same width and height else it s useless to compare their hash values

614279
getter	setter
i heard that .length property of array in javascript engines in fact uses invisible setter and getter to achieve functionality of ecma-s standard that says whenever the length property is changed every property whose name is an array index whose value is not smaller than the new length is automatically deleted

614279
getter	setter
i understand that setter is needed in this case but what with getter

614299
getter	setter
getter and setter can be defined in as of javascript 1.6 i think but it s not widely adopted and i haven t seen much use of it

614299
getter	setter
getter and setter can are called by the engine depending on direction of assignment

614340
put	get
to get to the parameter values from within the accompanying xsl file i put param elements in the root element

614378
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome uses a different javascript engine than safari

614386
getter	setter
a property is either implemented as a field or as setter getter methods

614386
getter	setter
if you have a setter method in order to perform something more whenever the value is set you also have a getter method to match even if the getter method doesn t do anything more than just return the value

614451
post	get
you could probably get an oo design but you will need to post a snippet of the xml or a detailed specification

614495

inherited	properties
i m struggling to find sufficient information about the properties inherited tree or inherited context used by dependencyobject and dependencyproperty

614624
inherited	properties
i would like to use the value inherited capability of dependencyproperty outside of a typical wpf page such that object a is the logical parent object b and thus a value assigned to a properties on object a will automatically propogate to object b unless it has been locally set a bit like the flowdirection properties works in wpf

614624
dependencyobject	uielement
if object a and object b are derieved from dependencyobject and are not children of a uielement in other words object a is it s own root then how do you establish the logical tree so that dependencyproperty understands that b is a child of a

614649
put	get
i also haven t had much success with making the image a background image because i haven t been able to get it to show the full image--it just shows enough of the image to put behind the div

614696
telerik	componentart
although it depends on your project size and requriments i recommend devxpress and telerik web windows .i ve used componentart telerik devxpress and i think telerik is better if u are developing web applications.and devxpress are better in winforms.by the way while developing in some cases i came across especially performance problems in telerik products.nevertheless telerik is good choice for web development

614701
xslt	schematron
assuming the source data that is being validated is also in xml one approach would be to transform your set of rules into schematron which would not be hard in xslt and then use the schematron infrastructure ie stylesheets to validate your content against the schematron file

614738
equals	tostring
an alternative to calling tostring is to use equals

614753
spaces	delimiter

you could put your images in a zip file inside the jar get that using a zipinputstream and extract the images from there

614886
client-side	server-side
use jquery to add textbox from client-side and you will have to collection at server-side

614935

615114
opera	google-chrome
tested in opera 9 ff3 ie6 google-chrome

615150
haskell	ocaml
it is up to what exactly is the kind of applications you want to program for example for websites that need access to databases i would go for ruby and ruby on rails framework for financial applications or applications that need a lot of parallel processing i would go for a funcional programming language like haskell ocaml or the new f# these last 3 wil make you a better programer even if you don t programm a lot in them by the way c# has been lately in the latest versions adding more and more funcional programming features

615201
hex	binary
either way it s a much better idea to actually convert the hex code to a binary string before hashing it

615202
children	parent
the method is called on the root node after that children may have two parent so it isn t as simple as calling the parent property on each node and traversing back up

615271
cos	sin
switching to lookup tables for sin cos acos

615343
post	get
1 pass via get or post the text control id

615359
cos	sin
if your goal is to rank compare distances then approximations sin and cos table lookups could drastically reduce your amount of computations required implement quick reject .

615359
cos	sin
using lookup tables with 1000 samples sin and cos sampled every the lookup uncertainty is at most 0.006284

615359
cos	sin
so if evaluating using sin and cos lookup tables for two coordinate-set pairs distances yields a certain ranking one distance appears greater than the other based on the approximation and the difference s modulus is greater than the threshold above then the approximation is valid

615377
datarow	dataview
i know this may sound crazy but i swear that on two separate ocassions via intellisense i ve seen an overload for the dataview constructor that took in a datatable and either predicate or func i don t remember what t was either datarow or datarowview

one caveat you need to make sure the one machine that holds the namenode the master machine and single point of failure in an hdfs cluster is solid - raid mirroring backups the works

615524
drawrect	touchesmoved
to refresh your screen on demand try calling from your touchesmoved method which will setup the proper contexts for a call to drawrect

615544
cos	sqrt
i use a different algorithm for calculating distance between 2 lati longi positions it could be lighter than yours since it only does 1 cos call and 1 sqrt call

615551

multiplying	add
the answer of 9 10 gets truncated to 0 and then you multiplying that by 100 and then add 100 to it

616286
int	double
you need to do the calculation as floating point by casting the variable to double or using a double constant then allow truncation to give you just the int portion

616291
int	double
if the values you ll be working with are less clean use double literals instead of int literals

617045
installshield	orca
originally we just gave the customers instructions to use orca but that really only enables them to update properties values - if you need to replace a config file then it ends up a bit complicated for most it staff unless they have access to wise installshield or similar

617093
x86	64bit
what do we do if we have some devs working on 64bit machines and some on 32 bit machines but we need to reference unmanaged assemblies that need to be in x86 for half the team and x64 for the other half

617219
updatepanel	onclientclick
edit how you tried to explicitly call the update method in the button s onclientclick event for the updatepanel

617317
versioning	upgrade
if i remember correctly vsts team suite is about twice the cost of a specific role versioning of vsts so rather than purchasing multiple role editions most people just opt to upgrade to team suite since the cost is approx

617321
redhat	fedora
if you are using redhat fedora centos you should use rpm for perl dependencies wherever possible

617767
pascal	delphi
yes you can do it in delphi and friends free pascal kylix etc. but not in more standard pascals

617803

i m not aware of any ant tools which can do this but i ve switched from ant to maven a few years ago and never looked back

618403
geany	kdevelop
lots of people use emacs and have done so for years but is it better to learn emacs than just use an ide such as geany or kdevelop

618403
vim	emacs
whether learning to edit using emacs vim and compiling debugging using the gcc-toolchain is worth it instead of just using an ide and why

618419
vim	emacs
one real benefit is that you can learn how to work with emacs or vim and this can help you in the future when you will use remote terminals

618446
inherited	properties
when i call the get i return the actual selected value so in essence you need a custom class which inherited from the radiobuttonlist and give it an extra properties

if you put your help source files under version control then you will get all the benefits of a wiki without having to migrate to a new system - people can make edits to the help files easily - those changes can be tracked reverted etc

618524
ant	maven
well maven is not supposed to be good in doing fine granular tasks it is not a scripting language like bash or ant it is rather declarative - you say - i need a war or an ear and you get it

618524
put	get
if you however put enough effort in your poms and few custom plugins you ll get a much better build environment as with ant for example depends on you project of course but it gets more and more true for bigger projects

618631
prepare	execute
edit in this case your real problem appears to be mixing up prepare statements as supported by mysqli prepare and mysqli_stmt execute with plain old queries as done with mysqli query

618698
fish	bash
the availability of a powerful shell i use bash and fish under linux is the other time-saver for me

618737
google-chrome	firefox
i ve checked it in google-chrome firefox and ie7 and it looks good in all three

618766
dictionary	map
something like a c++ map or a python dictionary

618793
prepare	execute
the problem is not in the prepare statement but in the call to the query method that shouldn t be there - as it is used to execute standard not prepare statements

618839
ant	maven
what are the minimum steps i should follow to replace ant with maven

618850
awt	swing
i m not familiar with awt swing but based on knowledge of other gui frameworks i d say something derived from a say jpanel that draws the video when a repaint request is made or a new frame is available. i would like to be able to process every new frame and loop on x y over all the pixels

618852
filtering	grouping
using multiple port grouping each port grouping can then directly subscribe to the desired message type and filtering on promoted properties

618859
boost	stl
the exact task is absolutely stupid and the lecturer told us it need to be self-compilable should be able to compile itself - so he meant not to use libraries such as boost and stl

618860
wordpress	joomla
as mentioned by others joomla might be a good option for you although wordpress may also work and it s easier

618871
getter	setter
getter setter functions for accessing global variable which is a good practice in particular in multithreaded situations

618881
shadowing	named
it is much more complicated at higher levels at deciding which function class choose named shadowing ambiguous named between namespaces etc. or when compiling to bytecode running ast

618900
post	get
i would like to enable a asp.net classic asmx web service for http post and get requests

618900
post	get
my question is can http post and get requests be enabled per web service or web method level rather than per application or machine

618905
jar	war
compare the war jar ear to the old version see if there is any change

618971
width	margin
i don t exactly know why the -1 but it probably has something to do with the margin and border not being counted towards width and the fact that a single pixel can t be devided into subpixels

618973
min	max
one way is you could group by a time scale seconds minutes etc. and query the avg max or min to reduce the data points to a smaller scale

618978
post	put
the obvious way is to put your manipulation in the callback of the load ajax post etc ajax call

619014
free	calloc
thus i was trying to calloc zero bytes and free didn t like it

619041

hide	show
it s about databinding let s say i have an object for binding to my ui and i want to hide show it based on other properties of the object

619128
hide	show
if you have a container widget which holds a panel you want to show and hide why not layout your inner panel however you want then add it to the container panel then use static methods against the container to say

619191
put	get
when put into il - you get this

619244
boost	stl
this means teaching them about the stl containers and algorithms and some of the boost libraries at first so the first thing they think about when needing a group of things is a vector

619247
pop-up	dialog
when it fails the first thing it does is pop-up a dialog saying the feature you are trying to use is on a cd rom or other removable disk that is not available. the dialog provides a text box to enter a path and a browse button to find it so i provide the path click the open button and get this error error 1706.no valid source could be found for product microsoft .net compact framework 3.5

619251
yacc	bison
6 take a look at lex and yacc or flex and bison

619296
snmp	mib
there are jmx snmp connectors you can use to map values to a mib and generate traps

619382
mp3	wav
if you need to analyse a digital audio stream mp3 wav live input etc bear in mind that while pitch detection of simple monophonic sounds is quite advanced polyphonic pitch detection is an unsolved problem

619406
multiplying	transpose
multiplying it by it s own transpose

619428

there is only one modern use for escape unescape that i know of and that s as a quick way to implement a utf-8 encoder decoder by leveraging the utf-8 processing in uricomponent handling

619437
cpython	ironpython
what are some advantages it will bring to the table over its siblings cpython jython and ironpython

619491
versioning	upgrade
if this were a paid product would customers pay to upgrade to this newer versioning

619544
cpython	pypy
part of the compiler toolchain includes an experimental jit generator now in its fifth incarnation and starting to work really well - the goal is for a jited pypy to run much faster than cpython

619564
ienumerable	ienumerator
can anyone explain ienumerable and ienumerator to me

619564
ienumerable	ienumerator
what are the differences between ienumerator and ienumerable

619572
ienumerable	ienumerator
ienumerable and ienumerator are both interfaces

619572
ienumerable	ienumerator
ienumerable has just one method whereas ienumerator has 2 methods movenext and reset and a property current

619574
ienumerable	ienumerator
ienumerable is an interface that defines one method getenumerator which returns an ienumerator interface this in turn allows readonly access to a collection

619608
serializable	deserialization
if so custom serializable and deserialization with explicit schema version numbering i d say

619636
ienumerable	ienumerator
an ienumerable is a thing that can be enumerated...which simply means that it has a getenumerator method that returns an ienumerator

619636
ienumerable	ienumerator
but you d still need to return that ienumerator in an ienumerable class

619648
mouse	keyboard
i need to automate load tests on a .net desktop application using an automated script preferably one that is able to record mouse clicks and keyboard entries

619713
bazaar	git
take a look at this article comparing subversion mercurial git and bazaar for managing the files in a home directory including image files and large photoshop files that are being edited and versioned

619804
stdout	stderr
i am suspicious that the mysql password prompt is not actually on stdout or stderr although i don t know how that could be or if it means i could trap it

619804
stdout	stderr
it simulates a tty and gets all output even that which bypasses stdout and stderr

619819
hide	show
edit this code should go into your handler i assume you already have your show s and hide s in there

619838
tinyurl	bit.ly
i would do a lot of research on tinyurl and bit.ly to see how they ve addressed these issues

619847
post	get
this works on the rewritten pages but on the default.aspx in the root dir i get a message that the verb post is not allowed on iis 6 and i have no control over mappings

619849
monodevelop	sharpdevelop
sharpdevelop monodevelop

619868
children	parent
the multi-model screencast from ryan bates explains how to add multiple children on the fly but doesn t delve into multiple parent

619900
getter	setter
the user class has the expected load insert update and delete methods setter getter and a few others

619957
calloc	malloc
since you are using c99 you could avoid calloc malloc if you really want to by using c99 s variable array declaration

620011
hash	md5
a good idea for passwords is to convert the password into a md5 hash and store that as the user s password

620040
pull	push
looks a little weird but basically it gets fired after a push or pull is completed but before it is committed

620041
versioning	upgrade
i m using oracle 10g and hibernate 2.1 old versioning but not allowed to upgrade to fix

620045
getter	setter
i know about properties and i could write getter and setter on the person object

620119
hash	salt
furthermore you should store just a salt hash of the password instead of the password itself

620119
hash	salt
you can use the following function to generate and check a salt hash with a random salt value

620121
telerik	radwindow
you could use radwindow from telerik the jquery ui dialog plugin like tvanfosson recommended or you could take a look at

620139
jquery	jqmodal
i have used both the ajax modal extender as well as the jquery jqmodal both have worked pretty well

620139
jquery	simplemodal	jquery	jqmodal	jqmodal	simplemodal
if i were to pick an option today i would probably pick the jqmodal or simplemodal for jquery

620144
wmi	managementeventwatcher
- using wmi query with managementeventwatcher

620153
post	put
i ve put together a basic applet where the user selects a file from their hard drive it reads the first line of this file and passes that off to javascript for some additional preprocessing and then when you click a button it tries to upload that file through an http post request

620172
sproutcore	cappuccino
since then two amazing frameworks have appeared sproutit s sproutcore and 280 north s cappuccino +objective-j

620249
chown	sudo
sudo chown -r youruser yourgroup .

620302
getdate	dateadd
in sql server you can use dateadd mi -1 getdate

620304
int	double
on some cpu s double in general suffer from the same problem - on the other hand while a floating-point square root will block the fp pipeline it won t prevent you from executing int instructions simultaneously

620317
pull	push
first attempt to pull from the same refspec that you are trying to push to

620336
int	double
when i is an int and d is a double works but does not

620348
int	double
i i + d does not work because you would be assigning a double to an int and that is not allowed

620348
int	double
the + operator casts the double automatically to an int so that is why it works

620399
hide	show
at runtime you can call setstatusbarhidden on your application to show hide the status bar

620439
pull	push
push pull with per-user permissions not tied to linux accounts

620446
int	chars
i can convert an int to a chars for bit data by using the chr function but how do i get it back to an int

620465
equals	tostring	tostring	getter	getter	setter
this in turn references a source template for getter setter equals tostring etc that was written to trim all java.lang.string properties in the setter

620470
width	height
how can i get the width and possibly the height of each string

620530
superclass	subclassing
so looking up str would return a string and looking up classb would return this is classa or a subclassing the problem is i don t know how to find the superclass or rather trace the mro chain of a type object

620532
sproutcore	cappuccino
sproutcore and cappuccino are frameworks for front-end development that require the user to have both javascript and css enabled

620532
sproutcore	cappuccino
i like the fact that sproutcore and cappuccino and probably others are testing the limits of what s possible within a web browser

620542
width	height
in order to set the height and width of the element you need to set it s display mode to block and use float to align the elements horizontally

620550
width	height
in css elements with display inline cannot have width or height applied to them

620550
width	height
ie will incorrectly convert any inline element to inline-block if you give them a width or height

620570
onchange	onblur
on the onblur or onchange clientside events you should check two textbox s values

620595
button	checkbox
when the submit button is clicked use javascript to post the post data by grabbing everything in row whose checkbox is checked

620621
cvs	svn
a developer should have enough know how today to setup a development environment with a webserver ftp ssh svn cvs on a unix based system.

620653
children	parent
in that i am showing the data in hierarchical format in that i have one parent with two children

620653
children	parent
in the parent i have a checkbox and when i select the checkbox i have to remove the existing data of children and replace with new ones

620662
nsxmlparser	nsurlconnection
then you can use a combination of nsurlconnection nsxmlparser and key-value coding to make it almost as easy

620672
floating-point	integer
for example it used to be true that computations done in a floating-point unit were almost always slower than similar computations done in an integer unit

620672
floating-point	integer
if you can keep multiple integer units and a floating-point unit busy at once that s a plus

620695
getter	setter
because you have implicit getter and setter functions and you cannot modify the result of a function as it is a const parameter

620695
getter	setter
see the different behaviors in the following code with the explicit getter and setter functions

620702
sorting	filtering
if you re just displaying data or sorting and filtering using the methods properties provided by arraycollection rather than editing the array directly it should have no effect on the underlying shared array

620721
int	double
if you have a type that is constantly created and discarded like an int float double etc then you can get a good boost by turning these into structs

620724
cvs	svn
it is similar to cvs you can use revision you just have to set the keyword property for that file for svn to know it is supposed to do a keyword replace

620726
sproutcore	cappuccino
in this regard sproutcore and cappuccino are giant improvements in my book

620749
simplemodal	blockui
for simplemodal displays i ve found blockui to be a great solution

620752
post	get
in the edited section of my post i have included what error messages exactly i get

620816
post	put
the only ones that will do what you want according to the specification are put and post

620816
post	put
so if you don t want to use post use put

620859
width	height
you need to offset by the width height of the tile

620871
implements	extends
you can further extends this by creating objects that all implements the same interface and are in a repository of handlers that your run method can iterate over to see which will handle it

620876
clsid	createobject
when vbscript uses new or createobject the registration ensures that com knows what dll to load in order to make a new instance whether by name or clsid

620928
prng	random
say you did use a base pseudo random number generator prng

620928
prng	random
since your simulation would only be as random as the other prng you were using you may as well just use the other prng directly without all the extra work

620928
prng	random
in fact your simulation may not do anything except make the output less random than the values from your base prng

620929
width	height
actually the width of the background orange in this case is identical with the height of the surrounding jframe which is .

620932
firefox	safari
testing with firefox 3.0.7 safari 3.2.2 and msie 7.0.5730.13 all on winxp sp3 it appears that everything within the tags is completely omitted from the dom tree

620957
updatepanel	scriptmanager
you have to register your script with the page scriptmanager to work within an updatepanel

620976
cpython	ironpython
i m not sure exactly how you re drawing the conclusion that ironpython is faster than cpython

621003
rar	zip
text files will be mostly alphabetical characters while binary files - especially compressed ones like rar zip and such - will tend to have bytes more evenly represented

621015
inherited	subclassing
if you had things that were subclassing of other things in the lookup or you wanted to support multiple inherited you d have to pick out the one that was the first in mro

621033
width	height
if you have this label in the center of a borderlayout the size is always the full size of the container minus north+south height minus east+west width

621079
subtract	add
your best bet is to probably have a sorted dictionary of coin sizes and then loop through them checking if your change is greater than the value add that coin and subtract the value otherwise move along to the next row in the dictionary

621087
folder	directory
it s located in the root directory of a web application so for sharepoint it s usually located in the folder c inetpub wwwroot wss virtualdirectories sharepoint80 where sharepoint80 is the name of your web application

serializable	deserialization
over the wire it is transfered as an array of objects this is the standard way of sending lists arrays etc but wcf does the serializable deserialization for you so as far as your client server are concerned the collections are generic

621168
suppressfinalize	finalizer
i don t see any need to call suppressfinalize if there s no finalizer defined

621230
jboss	glassfish
all you need is an ide like intellij eclipse or netbeans the jdk the java ee download and a servlet container like tomcat or a full-blown application server like glassfish or jboss

621293
integer	unsigned
wikipedia page on signed number representations explains the difference in the representation at the bit level and the integer computer science page provides a table of ranges for each signed unsigned integer type

621319
versioning	upgrade
these determine how the msi can be installed and if it upgrade overwrites or installs beside any other versioning of the same application

621319
versioning	upgrade
for instance if you have two versioning of your software and they have different upgrade codes then to windows they are completely different pieces of software regardless of what the name is

621343
globalization	localization
if instead you are asking whether or not you can use something like code pages in vb.net the answer is an indirect yes although i see no reason to jump through that hoop to support globalization localization as the paradigm has shifted

621344
post	get
i m also planning to add ways to get extra mojo like post of the day or favorite blog of the week contests with prizes of around 3-10 mojo

621392
hide	show
c don t hide anything and make the wordpress install show up with a different theme

621396
firefox	safari
i only tested it on firefox and safari

621396
firefox	safari
the web app runs fine on both safari and firefox but it gives a permission denied error on ie

621396
firefox	safari
this does not happen with either firefox or safari

621401
width	height
i specify the span s background color image width and height in css

621418
postgresql	mysql
i use sql server 2005 mysql and postgresql regularly

621418
postgresql	mysql
i m tired of using microsoft s sql tool for sql server phpmyadmin for mysql and pgadmin for postgresql

621423
postgresql	mysql
you could try a company called toad by toad soft they don t handle postgresql but there are tools for mysql and sql server

621434
cout	cin
you can then use infile as you would use cin and outfile as you would use cout

621447
getter	setter
the advantage to this is that you have a nice clean interface to how port_t objects must be used and lets you keep private things private non-private things need getter setter functions for the client to access them

621478
jruby	rubinius	ironruby	rubinius
a look at the different ruby virtual machines jruby maglev ironruby rubinius macruby and how to choose what fits best within the enterprise

621503
dbml	edmx
also dbml is used in linq to sql l2s - edmx is the mapping used in the ado entity framework

621519
datamapper	activerecord
i would suggest looking at the activerecord and datamapper patterns

621565
vb.net	vb6
i have upgraded my project from vb6 to vb.net

621653
hash	md5
why not take first 21 chars from md5 or sha1 hash

621661
x86	64bit	16-bit	64bit
and the exception of course is x86 where a word is 16 bit wide because x86 was originally a 16-bit cpu a dword is 32-bit because it became a 32-bit cpu and a qword is 64bit because it now has 64bit extensions bolted on

621671
x86	64bit
all you youngsters yappin on about 32 bit thiss and 64bit that you know there were and are other machine architectures than the x86 family

621716
ubuntu	linux
and i also get a completely different scan code on linux ubuntu from getrawkeycode

621739
button	checkbox
make the next button a submit button which goes to the next page read the checkbox values out of the post data and set them manually on the next page

621753
width	height
now the system loops all the child elements and gets their dimensions width height left right into array like this

621770
freebsd	linux
you likely want uuid4 which generates a random uuid and uses os support if available on linux mac freebsd and likely others

621844
telerik	radcombobox
i m using the telerik radcombobox control

621849
width	height
the getsubimage method will take the x y and the width and height of the desired subimage so the desired sprite can be obtained

621860
srp	principles
in particular this blog is a good place to read up on srp and the other keystone principles of good oo design

621869
width	height
you just have to specify the source image where you want to draw the sprite on your graphics object x y width height and in what frame of the image the sprite is located x y width height

621869
width	height
assuming the width and the height of the sprite are the same width and height that you want to draw on the drawing area you could define your own method to draw a sprite frame as follows

621869
width	height
you could draw them with tiles so you d be drawing four sprites for each of the big images in this case or you could manually figure out what x y width and height to use for those sprites

621869
width	height
here x and y are the position you want to draw the sprite on your graphics object 15 is the number of columns in your sprite sheet 19 is the frame numbering starts at 0 and 25 is the width and height of each sprite i approximated

621891
innodb	myisam
you ll find people who are using myisam or those that are using innodb but aren t using it anyway

621891
union	distinct
the difference between them is that union all is a simple concatenation and should be preferred wherever possible whereas a union will implicitly do a distinct to remove duplicate tuples

621891
union	distinct
union like distinct have their place

621893
many-to-many	one-to-many
i then will use many-to-many and one-to-many tables to display the info

621902
free	malloc
you will need to create special malloc and free wrappers in port.h as well

621909
post	get
now imagine that you just do exactly that but instead of taking your main thread to that action you fire an asynchronus thread that will work just as any other link for instance which will post get data and get an x response which you can handle through js later on thus giving you the ilusion of real time queryes

621947
implements	extends
in actionscript 3.0 i want to extends classa and implements interfaceb

621947
getter	setter
flex builder won t compile this and asks me to override the getter setter methods as they are defined in classa but overriding the data property in classa is not what i want

621964
put	get
the left and top values i ve put in may be a little off but you can tweak to get what you want

621964
width	height
i ve corrected the pixel values and added a width to your line div and a height since ie defaults all divs to one text line high

621964
width	text-align
also your title div should be full width with text-align right so that the title will expand to the left instead of the right

621967
children	parent
if you do you can have position absolute on the children and their position will be relative to the parent

621973
post	get
if possible you may want to get the profile from the request object itself rather than what s being submitted from the post values

621992
sorting	grouping
to avoid the overhead of sorting that grouping by produces add order by null

621992
children	parent
the answer above only gets children of a parent not all descendants

622000
subtraction	modulo
written this way to avoid an unneccesary extra modulo or subtraction

622003
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
this will display consistently in firefox 3 ie 7 ie 8 opera 9 and google-chrome 1

622017
ready	each
i tried to find a place where i can find ready to copy list of all functions and classes available in each stl header file

622019
printf	fgets
i would like the output to reflect that it called fgets and printf at least 14 times and it did hit the disk after all - there should be some measured time surely

622032
profiler	shark
shark is the profiler that is included in the developer tools

622047
valgrind	callgrind
i think that you could try various valgrind tools especially callgrind used to get call counts and inclusive cost for each call happening in your program

622060
perl	tcl
does all your 4 points and also works for perl python ruby and tcl

622097
srp	principles
the trick here is to follow the single responsibility principles srp and separate those kinds of code that you have to fiddle with from those kinds that are deterministic

622097
ocp	principles
so if you are writing the kind of code that is hard to test first you should take care to follow the dependency inversion principles dip and the open closed principles ocp in order to keep the code decoupled enough to test after the fact

622134
client-side	server-side
but client-side javascript cannot access the filesystem from the web browser so you would need some other way server-side code to make changes to the css file itself

622140
width	height
i have the coordinates of the top left point of a rectangle as well as its width height and rotation from 0 to 180 and -0 to -180

622140
min	max
min y max y min x max x

622145
inherited	properties
a virtual inherited properties can be overridden in a derived class by

622153
ocp	principles
read more about the open closed principles here uncle bob s original ocp whitepaper

622266
inherited	properties
in the example above it s okay for gettypeid to query the typeid of attr because typeid is a properties of an attribute and because attr is a t it must be a type that inherited from attribute

622301
hide	show
then it s just a matter of wiring up events to show and hide the popup and you re all set

622303
post	get
you can pass information between pages using get or post methods

622308
dnf	yum
you can use sudo apt-get install python-mysqldb for debian based distros yum install mysql-python for rpm-based or dnf install python-mysql for modern fedora distro in command line to download.

622336
cassini	iis
i m using win xp and i was using cassini but i want to give a tray to iis instead of

622354
touchesmoved	touchesended
basically you have to remember the last position on each touch event and draw a line from the last to the current position in touchesmoved and touchesended

622366
post	get
you are looking for post and get variables it s done in the method parameter of your html form

622366
post	get
post and get were made for different purposes

622367
mouse	keyboard
by idle i mean the state when there s no user activity keyboard mouse or any other else

622374
min	max
just to make clear i understand that constants like ï need somewhere and functions that are applied on more than one number like min max

622374
pow	sin
the question was mainly concerning methods which only effect a single number such as round abs sin pow etc

622393
spaces	linefeed
what you can t see here is that there is a blank - either a spaces or cr linefeed after the closing

622394
disk	ram
if you ve got swap space enabled the system should be able to swap out any low priority processes such that they re not consuming and real resources but beware of a big hit on disk i o each time your folding home client swaps in and out of ram

622403
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i don t have a mac and really don t wanna incur the test cost of ie firefox opera safari google-chrome across all the myriad versions and platforms

622423
cpu	affinity
of course if you intend to set affinity to a single cpu only that cpu would be of interest its still the sixth field in units of user_hz or typically in 100 ths of a second

622423
jobs	cron
cron jobs tend to run

622442
src	attr
#buttonimage attr src data.imagesrc

622443
migrate	staging
having a reversible migration is fine for development and staging but assuming well tested code it should be extremely rare that you would ever want to migrate down in production

622450
folder	directory
however if you do find yourself with mergeinfo properties on individual files and folder there are two things you can do the first thing is simply to remove the svn mergeinfo property from the files and directory in question

622454
post	get
you can change method from post to get

622463
firefox	safari
i have some of my users what os and browsers they are using and they usually say a mac os and firefox or safari

622484
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
i regularly use ff3 and ie7 so my vm has in it ie6 ff2 google-chrome opera and safari

622491
post	get
since the ajax call in convertnow uses get instead of post it is possible that a browser is returning a cached result whenever parameters are identical to a previous call

622645
webkit	gecko
you need a html renderer gecko webkit et al

622707
qpainter	qimage
this is easily possible by opening a qpainter on a qimage

622729
direct3d	directx
the most important competitor to opengl is direct3d not the whole directx

622730
postgresql	mysql
db your obvious choices are mysql and postgresql

622763
easymock	jmock
i did not found a way to do this expectation in java using easymock or jmock and i think it is not possible

622773
nsmutablestring	nsstring
for instance objective-c and cocoa define both an nsstring class immutable and an nsmutablestring class

622784
post	get
back in your action you can create an instance of your form class and validate your post get vars against that form

622787
erlang	lisp
many functional programming languages such as lisp haskell erlang f# and clojure encourage immutable data structures by their very nature

622835
multiplication	modulo
short answer multiplication and modulo operations

622837
apache	lighttpd
rest offers two advantages here first the tcp ip time often does dominate the message transmission and that s pretty well optimized in production web servers like apache or lighttpd

622857
mouse	keyboard
is there any way to prevent all the mdi windows toolbars and other controls from receiving mouse clicks and keyboard input during my background threadâ s operation

622858
children	parent
clarification setting enabled to false for a parent control will also disable any children

622876
hide	show
hide all forms and only show the one main form

622934
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome both support the const keyword

622949
hash	md5
md5 is generally considered insecure if hash collisions are a major concern

622949
hash	md5
you can try to create your own hash â it would probably not be as good as md5 and security through obscurity is likewise not advisable

622949
hash	whirlpool
and in the light of comments let me make it clear i mean publish both the sha-256 and the whirlpool values for the file â not combining hash algorithms to create a single value but using separate algorithms to create separate values

622955
salt	md5
another good option is used salt md5

622955
hash	md5
for example the input to your md5 hash function is appended with string acidzom

622981
int	double
objects are passed by reference value where the value is the reference things that inherit from object primitive values int long double etc. are passed by value

623022
post	get
specifically talking about php the arrays are used very often the language itself uses them for example to grab the get and post parameters

623031
int	chars
the putchar function echoes to the screen whilst returning the int value of that chars

623040
vim	emacs
i am currently using nano and i ve heard of vim and emacs but don t know what the benefits of them are over eachother

623053
for-loop	arrays
these days when ever i see the boilerplate for-loop to iterate over an arrays one-by-one using an index variable it makes me want to scream

623053
for-loop	arrays
clearly the code has meaning to iterate over the collection rather than the old for-loop saying how to iterate over an arrays

623060
vim	emacs
i am currently using nano and i ve heard of vim and emacs but don t know what the benefits of them are over eachother

623060
vim	emacs
vim and emacs are very flexible editors that support a whole bunch of different usages

623068
vim	emacs
vim and emacs but don t know what the

623068
vim	emacs
emacs via a variety of lisp and vim via its own scripting language

623068
vim	emacs
i personally use emacs so i can t say much about vim but you should be able to find lots of information about both online

623068
atom-editor	sublimetext
i recommend looking at sublimetext or atom-editor

623075
vim	emacs
for editors you probably want either vim or emacs

623077
scons	autotools
gnu autotools cmake scons jam etc

623095
width	height
for the player and each ghost i can retrieve the x y image width and height attributes

623115
vim	emacs
i am currently using nano and i ve heard of vim and emacs but don t know what the benefits of them are over eachother

623115
kde	gnome
if you re using linux with a window manager kde gnome etc. you could also consider using the standard text editor for your window manager

623115
vim	emacs
the main benefit it would have over vim emacs nano is that it would seem more familiar to one coming from a windows environment - an editor written to run on the window manager has a menu bar file open save dialogs undo redo and plenty of other neat features that console editors probably can t match

623115
vim	emacs
though emacs and vim are pretty sophisticated these days so who knows

623121
postgresql	mysql
ms sql and it s derivatives are database applications much like oracle mysql or postgresql

623159
hash	md5
my text file says the quick brown fox jumps over the lazy dog however when i try to get the hash from this file both the md5 and sha1 is different from the wikipedias result

623215
width	height
these provide the height and width of the image file itself rather than just the image element

623228
typedef	typename
typedef typename in ancestor types aren t inherited by template classes

623237
getter	setter
everything else inferred variables automatic getter setter collection initializers property initializers lambda are just compiler magics not dependent on 3.5

623241
post	get
silverlight only supports setting headers using the post method not the get method

623250
mouse	keyboard
the formclosingevent provides a formclosingeventargs with a closereason but the reason doesn t distinguish between using a mouse or the keyboard

623294
vim	emacs
editor vim and emacs are popular

623294
scons	autotools
i am quite familiar with both scons and autotools but i still use make for small couple of files projects

623322
super	implements
if i see that it or any of its super classes implements idisposable i make sure i call dispose on it

623397
hide	show
mind you i don t want to change which tab is active i want to completely hide one tab then show it and hide another tab

623417
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i tend to agree with the use a table advocates but after messing around for a while in a not really knowing what i m doing kind of way i came up with this variation which fixes the vertical align problem in firefox safari google-chrome etc and doesn t make it any worse in ie

623503
yacc	bison
what is the difference between flex lex and yacc bison

623503
yacc	bison
can i install pure lex and yacc on ubuntu or i can install only flex and bison

623506
yacc	bison
bison is the gnu implementation extension of yacc flex is the successor of lex

623509
vim	emacs
before you turn into a bash shell vim emacs junkie try a few gui based tools first so you have some transition time.

623509
vim	emacs
i m sure the longhairs will scoff and claim that vim or emacs gives them the best and fastest development environment but different strokes for different folks

623518
folder	directory
or will it suffer from infinite recursion if say the directory structure was such that some folder was actually a symbolic link to one of its parents

623520
getattr	setattr
from my python knowledge i would say that datetime overrides setattr getattr but i am not sure

623535
yacc	bison
yacc and bison are pretty closely compatible though bison has some extra tricks it can do

623535
unix	aix	unix	solaris	solaris	aix
lex and yacc are maintained by the unix svrx licencees - companies such as ibm aix hp hp-ux and sun solaris have modified versions of lex and yacc at their command

623564
folder	directory
with every different solution you have create folder foreign name foreign silverlight toolkit in this case in your root solution directory

623610
pop-up	dialog
once the user clicks ok the first dialog is dismissed you check the result in your application and if the expected file doesn t exist pop-up an error dialog informing them that the chosen directory was not correct

623610
pop-up	dialog
you could give them the option of retrying which would just pop-up the first dialog again

623614
disk	ram
this tells you the percentage of pages that were read from ram that didn t have to incur a read from disk a cache hit ratio lower then 85 will mean that the server will benefit from additional ram

623618
accessor	properties
i tend to think of accessor as implicitly being properties accessor -- that is the term implies that it s more or less there to provide direct access to the object s internal state

623626
getter	setter
so generally that applies just to getter and setter

623630
pop-up	dialog
when i run or debug my compiled program i d like the option of having a dialog pop-up which asks me for the command line parameters

623631
getter	setter
by accessors i tend to think of getter and setter

623631
getter	setter
it seems fairly straight forward that the add instance method is not a getter nor a setter

623661
button	checkbox
the problem with this method is when the usercontrol is visible i cannot click any controls button checkbox in the window behind the usercontrol

623696
width	height
testing this out shows that the width is updated correctly but the height can only expand.

623703
draggable	droppable
im using the standard ui draggable and droppable

623736
inherited	properties
i personally usually find control more useful to inherited from because i usually don t need a lot of the extra stuff you get from webcontrol such as the styling properties since i usually just style through a single cssclass properties

623751
awt	swing
in java awt or swing the reverse is really true

623809
fputcsv	fgetcsv
try searching php.net for fgetcsv and fputcsv

623824
accessor	properties
i am looking to extending an interface by providing set accessor to properties in that interface

623839
spaces	delimiter
what is your opinion on whether a tagging user interface widget should require commas or spaces as the delimiter

623851
spaces	delimiter
i think for a programming site most of your tags will not be multi-word so it makes to use a spaces delimiter

623856
getter	setter
if you want getter and setter for a field you must do this

623930
ffmpeg	libavformat
and you do have the libavformat implementation in ffmpeg as a reference

623954
swt	swing
it works with swing and swt its syntax is very concise and clear and it has a debug mode that s unbelievably useful

623961
ati	nvidia
nvidia and ati both support exr data in their graphics cards

623976
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
the problem i am having is that within a select box only firefox supports .hide on option values i can t figure out a snappy approach for ie safari opera and google-chrome

623996
getter	setter
chris answer is likely all you ll need for the scenario you ve outlined but consider a slightly more complex scenario where you need a getter setter on your class but the interface only defines the getter

624010
switching	screens
you can visualize the distinction by putting your computer into screens capture mode cmd-shift-4 and pressing the space bar to switching to capture whole window

624050
wxpython	pyqt
wx and wxpython has two events i miss in pyqt

624066
mouseleave	mouseenter
instead of the ismouseover property you can use mouseenter and mouseleave events

624082
min	max
this is more efficient as you only have a worst case of two if statements checking the angle whereas the other approach has a worst case of twelve 6 for each component when checking the other three corners to see if they are greater than the current max or less than the current min i think

624090
udp	mtu
packet encapsulation for vpns poorly-designed or implemented udp protocols and l1 l2 protocols that drop the end-to-end mtu below endpoint values can all cause ip fragmentation

624172
post	get
in other words i am going to make multiple get post requests and i want the cookies to be persisted to a storage so that consecutive request will be identified by the remote host

624322
ready	each
you could just wait several times for a single object each until you have collected as many ready objects as you want

624327
codeigniter	cakephp	struts	stripes
for php there is codeigniter kohanaphp and cakephp and in the java realm you might want to look at struts 2 stripes and spring

624333
min	max
i have been trying unsuccessfully to write a query which finds the first hole of n size between the min and max numbers

624333
min	max
if i want to find a hole of size 50 row 1 s max of 200 would be returned there is a hole of 50 between that and row 2 s min a hole of 20 would return row 2s max of 300 etc

624338
width	height
you can t change the stage width and height from actionscript those properties are read-only

624347
min	max
my solution if you re able would be to change your database schema and code so that each time a new row is inserted the previous row is updated with the difference between the max of that row and the min of the new row with that difference value stored in its own column

624365
width	height
but if the swf is embedded in a web page then changing its element width and height will change the stage size and scalemode will determine how that is handled

624444
post	get
don t expose user ids passwords in urls which might be cached login via form post rather than get url

624446
folder	directory
if you want to compress the entire directory you ll need to walk the entire directory and call deviceiocontrol on each file folder

624456
ubuntu	debian
the package is also available in debian ubuntu repositories

624457
button	checkbox
ultimately my goal is to build arrays of radio checkbox button dynamically server-side

624554
int	chars
java arrays use a java signed int for access as per the languge spec so it s impossible to have an string which is backed by a chars array longer than integer.max_int

624580
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
it contains several checkbox radiobuttons and a dropdownlistfor

624612
memcached	apc
for read performance you can implement a caching system using apc memcached or others

624614
versioning	upgrade
background to facilitate auto-updates from within media center we may execute msiexec.exe qb i mediabrowser.msi if a user elect to upgrade an existing versioning

624616
rss	feed
if you have a simple rss reader with a database you might have a couple of tables for storing feed ignoring dealing with subscribers here

624616
rss	feed
this works in most cases but for many websites web based applications you might have a main feed from the frontpage and then category feed if you take both into the above sort of system there s going to be a lot of replicated data due to the same post appearing in several rss feed

624616
rss	feed
i had thoughts after reading the responses of linking content and removing duplicates only when the post is no longer in either rss feed to save on space but again as assaf has said the space savings could make this a waste of time

624657
config	ini
any hidden component ini config registry key

imperative	declarative
i think that the gap between engineers and non-engineers customers marketing slave traders etc. is a little like the contrast between declarative and imperative programming

624674
extjs	mootools
why not use a framework such as jquery mootools extjs dojo prototype etc. that has already solved all of these problems

624677
post	get
there s a great new post series going on over at that actually is describing from the get go how to go about designing an application with ddd in mind

624680
min	max	minimum	max
i m not following your logic there - the gap between the maximum of row 2 300 and minimum of row 3 330 is 30 if you are including either the min or max values 29 if not

624704
pull	push
implement this using three stacks and constant additional memory so that the amortized time for any push pop or pull operation is constant

624721
rss	feed
..but what happens when bob decides to add adverts to his rss feed changing the content from hi

624721
post	get
there s possibly neater ways to do that but my point is that it can get very complicated and you will probably only save a few kilobytes assuming the database engine doesn t do any compression itself on a very limited subset of post

624723
rss	feed
i m attempting to load up an xml document specifically an rss feed via an ajax request parse it and insert some information based on said feed into my page

624723
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
the code works fine in firefox opera google-chrome and safari but not ie7

624761
bazaar	git
this is the kind of problem that a centralized model will ultimately run into and one of the motivating factors behind systems like bitkeeper git bazaar and mercurial

624819
folder	directory
once compiled the directory is not included as part of the precompiled folder

624853
prepare	pdostatement	prepare	execute
give pdo prepare and pdostatement execute a read

624913
prepare	execute
i went the other way and made a class that extends pdo with a bunch of wrapper functions around prepare execute and it s much nicer than the built in functions though that s a bit subjective...

624914
hash	md5
then i have blobs of xyz bits required for my checksum md5 sha1 sha512 etc one blob for each in a checksum hash table looked up by fileid

624999
rss	feed
when following sites like this using an rss feed you don t have to read every article that comes through

625013
hide	show
my custom tab control is built dynamically with asp.net but the tabbing and the hide show functionality is all jquery

625025
google-chrome	firefox
the menu looks great in firefox google-chrome etc but in ie7 the menu drop downs don t break through the nested divs

625059
gridview	repeater
i have a gridview control nested within a repeater

625076
awt	swing
the app is pure java and i think it s all mostly swing and awt

625102
sorting	filtering
i can pass in delegates for filtering and sorting which works fine but being able to use linq expressions would be much more elegant

625123
ienumerable	iqueryable
update it works when i make query ienumerable instead of iqueryable

625132
versioning	upgrade
that environment was upgrade to versioning 4 before we did the export â import process for migrating it to the current environment

625201
post	get
you can also streamline the pages that you re sending to your mobile users so they don t get a big bloated page when they just wanted to read your blog post or whatever

625225
put	get
i m using sclistener to get the iphone s volume but i d like to put an observer on the volume

625256
folder	directory
is it simply a matter of copying my django project folder to another directory launching the server there and continuing my dev work in the original directory

625258
post	get
therefore you can use a post request when the size of the data exceeds the intrinsic size limitation for a get request

625270
free	malloc
doing free request_buffer will it free all the bytes allocated by malloc i.e sizeof ts_request_def + 2 1024 1024

625320
multi-query	mysql
for mysql you can use multi-query to execute multiple sql statements in a single call

625323
put	get
edit to store more than one piece of data in one node or list slot write a class that has your data as fields private and exposed via set and get methods if you want it to be particularly clean and put instances of that class into the list

625336
jquery	jqmodal
try one of the excellent jquery plugins for displaying modal windows such as jqmodal

625358
inherited	properties	inherited	subclassing
thus i have defined an abstract subclassing of usercontrol that defines these properties and updated the .xaml.cs and .g.cs files to inherited from this base class

625392
put	get
if you ve used unpack to get the data from have you tried using pack to put the data back in there

625396
free	malloc
all it takes is to free the malloc ed block

625418
width	height
dockpanel - fixed to the height and width of the vb6 form

625430
free	malloc
malloc free doesn t know or care about the type of the object just the size

625442
pop-up	dialog
i have found the jquery dialog very easy to create pop-up s

625476
min	max
max opposite of min 100 10 100

you can do this with fpdi extension for fpdf

625530
vsto	add-in
okay weird situation i need to debug a vsto office add-in

625542
hash	md5
i am wondering if someone had his file match my file would salting the md5 or sha-1 hash change the result so both files no longer collide

625559
hash	salt
adding salt to your hash function doesn t really serve any purpose if the digest function has been compromised because the salt will have to be made public to be used and the attacker can adjust their file to factor this in too

625559
hash	md5
md5 has shown to be vulnerable to hash collision but i believe sha-1 has not so far

625562
hash	md5
as for collisions i don t think you need to worry about entire files having the same md5 or sha1 hash

625562
hash	salt
if you add salt to the file you need to send the salt so the user can verify the hash

625582
hash	md5
md5 and sha1 are cryptographic hash intended for the second kind of application

625582
hash	salt
as for salt it makes the computation of the cryptographic hash local by mixing in some random non-secret value this value is called the salt

625585
hash	md5
the attack against crc-32 is irrelevant if the hash you are using is not crc-32 - md5 and sha-1 are not vulnerable to that kind of attack yet

625585
hash	md5
the current attacks against md5 are where an attacker creates two documents with the same hash

625585
hash	salt
salt are used for password verification - they prevent an attacker performing an offline attack against the password database - each user s password has a salt attached to the plain-text before the hashing - then a pre-computed rainbow table of plaintext - hash text is useless

625640
hash	md5
i seen md5 and sha1 hash on the net to verify files

625687
folder	directory
in my c project src folder i have only the test.java file and the assets directory which contains pacman.png

625721
superclass	subclassing
i have a superclass with two subclassing

apache	lighttpd	apache	nginx	nginx	lighttpd
so you have one or more processes getting http requests from your web server apache nginx lighttpd etc.

625889
mouse	keyboard
my 3rd and 4th monitors for email twitter tweetdeck im weatherbug pandora feeddemon and a tv tuner card are actually two additional computers both connected to the main keyboard and mouse using synergy

625994
tabcontrol	tabitem
in a prism v2 application i define two regions each a tabitem in a tabcontrol

625994
tabcontrol	tabitem
so what do i need to do here to make this dynamic so that the ui changes dynamically based on what modules are loaded so that i could load 10 modules views in my bootstrapper and there would automatically be 10 tabitem in the tabcontrol

626084
readonly	temporary
then if somebody s readonly report is totally borked you can let it work temporary by issuing them a new login and telling them it s referring to the wrong database

626096
width	height
basically i now have a field that indicates whether to swap height width which is only active for the time when the original jlabel does its painting

626123
realloc	malloc
in our c++ iam current using realloc method to resize the memory allocated by malloc

626143
free	realloc
once realloc successfully returns the previous block has been free and all pointers to it have become dangling â adjust them

626143
realloc	malloc
realloc as well as malloc don t care what is the pointer type - you can use void as well as anything

626175
put	get
but no mater where i put that declaration i get error syntax error

626205
gridview	objectdatasource
assuming you have a table with tasks and assigned dates create a dataset with a tableadapter for said table and use an objectdatasource on your page that takes the selected calendar day as a param and returns the rows to a gridview

626241
realloc	malloc
malloc and realloc are c functions

626241
realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
actually realloc does malloc and free depending on the arguments you pass

626241
realloc	malloc
if you pass it a null pointer realloc does what malloc does

626241
free	realloc
if you pass it a zero size realloc does what free does

626243
rss	feed
one of the commenters suggested that with some web fora allow you to get an email notification when activity happens and another suggested rss feed

626246
put	get
then again if all of this is a stretch then try honesty all the developers want to play with the new .net 3.5 toys and get skilled up on the latest greatest so we can put it on our resumes

626284
libpcap	wireshark
you could also try using libpcap which powers ethereal wireshark

626328
mockito	easymock
now when i look at mockito samples or easymock ones in the java world i see

626337
mvp	presenter
mvp presenter

626356
mockito	easymock
iâ ve never worked with mockito or easymock but i donâ t think the call does what you think it does

626359
for-loop	loops
the following for-loop will take you into an infinite loops

626400
jboss	weblogic
i have a set of resources which include many weblogic instances jboss instances and tomcat instances running across many servers

626407
versioning	upgrade
the point isn t about justifying the upgrade but more planning where and when it is going to be sensible to do the update especially in a .net versioning upgrade where backwards compatability is mostly fine

626410
gridview	repeater
or do i need to replace the asp table control with something else like a repeater or gridview to make it work

626412
onchange	keyup	keydown	keyup
you will need to use a combination of the onchange keyup and keydown event to capture possible changes to the form so that you can re-select the please select option

626443
uilabel	uibutton
i keep thinking in interaction problems with the uilabel due to its touch events not getting through the uibutton s view

626443
uilabel	uibutton
on the other hand with a uilabel as subview of the uibutton i m pretty confortable knowing that the touch events will always be propagated to the uilabel s superview

626499
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
as javascript gets faster as jit compilers start showing up like in google-chrome firefox 3.1 and safari 4 and as html support gets better html5 the need for plugins to display fancy rendered widgets will diminish

626541
icmp	udp
the cases i am referring to are when an attempt to send to a udp socket results in an icmp destination unreachable packet being generated by the remote host

626541
icmp	udp
if i attempt to send a udp packet to a host that s up but that the port is not listening i can see the icmp message arriving back with a packet tracer but the question is how do i get access to that from my c# code

626541
icmp	udp
below is a wireshark trace showing the icmp responses coming into my pc from an attempt to send a udp packet from 10.0.0.100 my pc to 10.0.0.138 my router on a port i know it s not listening on

626541
icmp	udp
my problem is how to make use of those icmp packets to realise the udp send has failed rather than just waiting for the application to timeout after an arbitrary period

626557
realloc	malloc
why are you using malloc and realloc

626572
sudoku	minesweeper
it s a series of puzzle games minesweeper sudoku fifteen available for windows os x and linux and as java applets

626580
jquery	scriptaculous
i don t know if you are able to make use of any libraries like jquery or prototype scriptaculous which may increase your available options

626593
globalization	localization
with this in mind slapping your globalization localization code in the presenter is not a great idea

626606
temp	tmp
also - fyi - my tmp and temp already pointed to a different disk - but the installer isn t smart enough to figure that out i guess.

626624
free	malloc
you can say that both sides should use malloc free but what if they are using diffeent compiler implementations

626627
temp	tmp
re-setting tmp and or temp to a partition with more space seems to have worked

626635
rss	feed
basically i have a uisearchbar searching an nsmutablearray of stories that make up an rss feed and when you select a story it loads in my app s uiwebview

626643
vb.net	vb6
i m mainly a vb6 developer but am currently trying to write a web service using vb.net to allow for communication between our product and a third-party

626655
post	get
but i am sure these things can get your started thinking as well as the other post

626657
width	height
each item has the same width and height

626698
scons	autotools
in the end what really defines a project is a leaf makefile -- and why restrict ourselves to makefiles what about scons autotools ant b jam aap

626698
pop-up	dialog
when i run or debug my compiled program i d like the option of having a dialog pop-up which asks me for the command line parameters

626817
punctuation	words
what if the words starts with punctuation like ...word

626822
int	chars
if you have those you can define an appropriate function pointer type int fphasher chars

626850
put	get
i haven t got time to verify this but off the top of my head if you put your event on the canvas and don t specify a background for it then you should only get the click event when the user clicks on any of the paths it contains

626867
hide	show
i have a jsp with a javascript tree control and i want the user to be able to hide or show this tree at the touch of a button and for this change of state to be carried through to other pages visited if on page a the user hide the tree then on page b the tree should remain hidden and so on until the user decides to show the tree

626867
hide	show
if i invoke the show hide button i get a java numberformatexception error because the query string is lost

626907
serializable	deserialization
the performance comparisons show that protocol buffers outperform the built-in serializable in terms of both size and serializable deserialization speed

626927
folder	directory
specifically you probably want allusersprofile to get the location of the common user profile folder which is where the application data directory resides

626932
stdout	stderr
does abap allow writing to stdout and stderr

626952
punctuation	words
you want words capitalized even if there is punctuation before them try something more like this

626953
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i ve tested this in internet explorer 7.0 mozilla firefox 3 safari 3 and google-chrome

626965
put	get
if i put a info light button in the lower corner of my screen on dark background and check shows touch on hightlight i get a nice highlight effect when the user touches the icon

626976
hide	show
what code is behind the show hide button

626977
stateless	stateful
if you re writing an ip telephony type application then you re probably going to want something fairly stateful if you can get away with stateless it s likely to be cheaper and easier to do it that way

627000
stateless	stateful
i m not personally familiar with all of the design issues of stateful versus stateless but i do know that nfsv4 is stateful after 15 years worth of previous versions of nfs being stateless so apparently statelessness became a significant limitation for the nfs designers

627028
rtp	rtsp
you should have a look at the rtsp + rtp protcol

627036
for-loop	arrays
i need to retrieve data from several rows and then insert the results into an enumerated arrays so then i can use a for-loop to echo it.

627050
button	checkbox
the first 8 pages have a total of 256 labels button list boxes textboxes and checkbox on them

627097
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
i m looking for answers for each of the major browsers since ie google-chrome safari and firefox will of course all handle that differently

627124
opera	firefox
in firefox and opera you can determine if your browser is in quirks mode by checking page info

627124
google-chrome	safari
in google-chrome safari and ie run this javascript in the address bar

627131
folder	directory
the above code shows how i get the number of free bytes on a particular drive which contains the folder manager.capdir it is the variable containing the full path name of the directory

627132
sctp	tcp
newer ip protocols such as sctp are designed to solve some of the shortcommings of tcp that could lead one to use multiple ports

627135
ienumerable	ilist
first off for usability i recommend switching your ilist to an ienumerable

627140
maple	sage
if there s any way you can get the analytical derivative of the function using pen and paper or a computer algebra system such as maple mathematica sage or sympy this is by far the best option

627153
for-loop	arrays
this isn t really an answer to the question but if you want to print out an arrays as a comma-separated list it s better to use the implode command than a for-loop

627225
free	malloc
you don t always have to use free on a pointer just ones declared with malloc

627232
post	get
in general you want to be using the post redirect get pattern to avoid postbacks and there is almost never a good reason to use â history.back â or â javascript â urls

627254
typedef	struct
typedef struct

627310
free	malloc
the need to free doesn t depend on whether or not you ve declared a pointer but rather whether or not you ve malloc ed memory

627310
free	malloc
so the pointer in your question temp doesn t go away when you call free -- rather whatever your code allocated when it called malloc goes away

627342
hash	hmac
in my case i discovered that the validation key is used to create the sha1 hmac keyed hash

627406
ubuntu	linux
to add to what ori has already said some linux distros still use initab but ubuntu and possibly others have switched to etc event.d

627440
accessor	properties
in addition we have made the whatami properties accessor abstract so that we can implement our own specific properties accessor logic in each derived class and have also defined a constructor that accepts a string argument and assigns the value to the _name private field

627440
accessor	properties
in addition each class implements it s own properties accessor for whatami returning a string of their type respectively

627440
accessor	properties
the static method describeanimal accepts an ianimal as an argument and writes out the values returned by the whatismyname and whatami properties accessor for the passed in ianimal

627511
post	get
i hear everyone recommends redirecting the user http get after he submits the form http post

627517
pop-up	dialog
i would even like to disable the incoming call dialog window that pop-up on incoming calls since we ll be presenting our own answer prompt

627536
for-loop	arrays
try initializing the arrays elements in your structure individually say with a for-loop

627547
subclass	abstract-class
abstract-class describes basic functionality and let specialized functionality to a subclass

627547
subclass	abstract-class
on the other hand you may have an abstract-class defining all common behavior the object may have and let the subclass define specialized versions

627547
inherited	subclassing
of course if the identification may be based on the common attributes the cars may have the getidentifiableid may be implemented by the base class and the subclassing will inherited that method

627566
client-side	server-side
although it seems you want to do this client-side to save yourself some headaches now on the server-side programming in the long run investing some time on this now to get it server-side will avoid these troubles

627576
free	malloc
and this is done by using the standard functions malloc or derivatives and free

627576
free	malloc
it is a trade-off where you don t have to worry about free ing objects which is not a minor thing as simple examples might make you think but where gc_malloc here is more complex than a simple malloc and there s invisible code executing at that where temp goes out of scope

627589
uiview	subviews
in addition to its own properties to control the text and overlays uitextview is a subclass of uiview so you can control the background colour and add your own subviews

627641
boost	allocator
if this is the case should i still be using the boost shared_array template for new style allocator

627653
versioning	upgrade
my planned iphone application will work a remote https web service quite hard so until a user decides to upgrade from the free to pro versioning of my app i need to generate a trickle of click revenue per free user

627660
filtering	grouping
as soon as you ve done a report users want another one or change the colour or optional grouping or more filtering or.

627698
folder	directory
if you deploy the executable together with your project to the same folder you can use the environment class to get the working directory of your executable

627712
shadowbox	lightbox
i want to use a lightbox like shadowbox or similar inside a firefox extension

627715
post	get
when the post succeeds in your controller persist a transaction identifier for the user you can use the asp.net profile provider for this and redirect to a completed page get

627749
ubuntu	linux
apparently most of the sifr demos i found fail to work with ff3 on ubuntu linux

627783
client-side	server-side
once the post data received gather the same information size checksum server-side from the received file and compare it with the information generated client-side

627805
width	height
either with its textwidth textheight properties for its visible size or by its width height properties for the bounding box size

627835
getter	setter
you may have to make a setter which will inform the outside of some of your internal details but there s no need to make a getter

627846
versioning	upgrade
the deal was i had to dl the trial versioning and then do an upgrade

627846
installation	upgrade
the suggestion to use programs and features to amend the installation doesn t work as it does not give me the upgrade enter serial # option as described

627854
awt	swing
so my question is does anyone know of an interesting java gui library that is not swing or awt

627878
udp	tcp
i was planning to try several types of encoding with tcp udp connection and measure the traffic and data loss

627888
opensuse	linux
update i just tried this on linux 2.6.25.5-1.1-default #1 smp x86_64 gnu linux opensuse 11.0 x86-64

627896
chown	chmod
these mechanisms let users share files more easily by lessening the need to use chmod or chown to share new files

627896
chmod	mkdir
if commands like chmod and mkdir routinely cleared these bits on directories the mechanisms would be less convenient and it would be harder to share files

627922
freebsd	linux
please be aware that this is a security risk and know what you are doing when you enable it in freebsd but i believe linux as well it requires special mount flag to be enabled and will change the way files in that directory behave

627975
stdout	stderr
below sets stdout stdin stderr to use utf-8..

628006
ienumerable	ilist
you can set a variable of type ienumerable or ilist to a null reference and it will compile

628045
getter	setter
as noted by mauris javascript 1.5 does support getter and setter see also here - you can think of them as methods disguised as properties

628049
multiplying	add
part of the methods are add polynomial multiplying polynomial etc

628057
affinity	processors
so i tried to play with processors affinity via sysinternals process explorer and limit those pesky processes to 3 cores out of 4 and dedicate the 4th core to the third party web server and it seems to work quite well

628061
width	height
so that it can be given a width and a height

628061
width	height
the and must be the same height and width

628076
affinity	processors
and beware processors affinity is inherited

628081
affinity	processors
as processors affinity on windows is a bitmask you may need some experimentation but i d assume 1 being the first core therefore 7 being the first three cores and f being all four

628084
affinity	processors
you can use the single-proc affinity application shim to force one processors on the executable level which will force the process onto one core

628157
getter	setter
your object needs to create a copy of the string in both the getter and the setter

628204
getter	setter
there s no getter setter or operator overloading in js yet so you really do need to write a function to set the price and get those fun side-effects

628235
google-chrome	firefox
this works in google-chrome and firefox i believe but i don t have it here

628270
haskell	scheme	imperative	declarative	lisp	scheme
i think that functional declarative programming haskell scheme lisp etc is more powerful and more abstract than imperative programming and therefore is intrinsically harder to learn

628301
firefox	safari
i ve made a simple page to demonstrate the problem here firefox safari only

628334
vbscript	jscript
the ms scriptomatic tool can generate wmi scripts in python as well as vbscript jscript and perl

628360
concave	convex
that handles convex concave features etc

628385
kerberos	ntlm
this occurs only when using ntlm and not kerberos it s part of the ntlm authentication process

628428
children	parent
the fact that float ing a parent element will cause it to expand to contain all of its float ed children

628437
sorting	filtering
i then map the observablecollection to a collectionviewsource so that i can get filtering sorting etc. without having to return to the database

628445
getter	setter
are you just looking for a property getter setter

628447
innodb	myisam
it could be some write table locks issued by the myisam engine but converting to innodb doesn t seem to make it any faster the system is in test and so not easy to simulate the same sort of load that production would receive leading me to believe that it is not lock related

628472
content-length	content-type
what s very odd about this crash is this if i do not call sethttpbody with my nsdata object setvalue application json for content-type and setvalue requestdatalengthstring for content-length the crash does not happen

628500
width	margin
text boxes have margin borders padding by default which makes a 100 width text box larger than its container

628504
background-color	transparency
background-color transparency

628624
bash	zsh
the following works in at least bash and zsh

628638
hash	salt
do you use salt hash

628645
getter	setter
can you just use a getter setter instead

628652
rtp	rtsp
but for video audio i suggest looking here and i would guess rtsp and rtp can be used

628739
folder	dir
what i would like is to not only have all the binaries dropped in the bin dir but also have each executeable program have it s own deployed folder similar to what each website gets

628746
post	get
what you describe is the ultimate battle to get more information of the httpfileupload in html 2.0 specs as that the is html spec you are referencing for a form post

629141
x86	64bit
i am using vs 2005 64bit x86 machine

629149
int	chars
in your case chars int and bool are different sizes so it will go by that information rather than your bit field hints

629163
post	get
for example after a post you should probably redirect to a get page to avoid that the result page cannot be reloaded without re-posting

629166
inherited	properties
i would rather not have my class inherited any other classes because i want to keep it clean from supurfulous properties and or methods

629171
pylons	turbogears
the pylons admin interface is very similar to turbogears

629189
int	double
that is if it s a double i don t want to return an int

629198
getter	setter
it s not a performance issue either as the getter or setter will be inlined by the compiler if it s simple enough

629199
put	get
where should i put a url to get it to appear in the version information in windows

629216

629236
boost	stl
i used a queue from the stl and threads condition variables and mutexes from the boost library

629247
int	double	int	boolean
i have also seen implementations where a value class was used to store results of calculations results that could represent either a string double int or boolean

629247
int	double	int	boolean
but the problem was that client code had to check a value.type property of an enum string int double boolean and then either cast the value.value property which was exposed externally by the value class as an object type or use the specific valuestring valuedouble valueint valueboolean getters

629255
int	double
why not just use string double and int

629256
daemons	systemd
in this case i would write a daemons run by a systemd user that accepted socket connections and relayed them to the appropriate device then use sockets within the web application to talk to the daemons

629290
freebsd	linux
an example of setting up user authentication with ldap on linux and freebsd is on my blog in french comptes unix stockã s sur ldap

629352
srp	principles
the biggest problem seems to be design breaking at least srp single responsibility principles

629375
filtering	grouping
it is just obvious that having to fetch filtering sort and grouping large amounts of data is slower than doing the same with small amounts

629378
width	height
an iframe will not resize to it s content you have to specify a fixed width and height

629382
rss	feed
i have rss feed that i want to modify on fly all i need is the text and linefeeds so everything else must be removed all images styles links

629411
ienumerable	iqueryable
or is the author just jumping on a hype trying to get more downloads for his ienumerable extension library and i was right in expecting iqueryable and expressions when seeing linq in the name of the library

629411
ienumerable	iqueryable
i think linq provider libraries may choose if they expose iqueryable or ienumerable in their results - linq extensions do not have that choice

629444
wordpress	joomla	joomla	smarty
it has also drupal joomla wordpress and smarty plug-ins

getter	setter
this looks extremely cumbersome to me and i feel like every class is bloated by extra three getter setter that all almost all the classes would use

629707
profiling	debugging
look to off-the-shelf profiling tools that may detect this leak even debugging mode in vc has an option of tracing leaked allocations

629719
post	get
i thought it was my class so i tried to use a different method from this blog post however i still get the same issues

629736
versioning	upgrade
having multiple copies of the library doesn t sound like a good thing but it really is it means you can upgrade one copy to a different versioning without breaking everything else

629774
post	get
use post rather than get

629777
post	get
oh and yes make sure you always pass a confirmation value through post to validate not just a get parameter it s best practice even with authorized users

629795
width	height
use thumbnails of a fixed width height

629795
width	height
the actual images width height as stored in the database would vary

629797
ienumerable	icollection
edit forgot to update the cast from ienumerable to icollection

629996
asterisk	freeswitch
asterisk and probably other softswitches like freeswitch could do that for you

629996
asterisk	voicemail
the asterisk voicemail config file voicemail.conf allows you to specify a command to run whenever a new voicemail is left in a user s mailbox

629996
asterisk	voicemail
asterisk supports voicemail to email by default so there wouldn t be any special configuration provided

629996
asterisk	voicemail
and you could probably also avoid setting up asterisk by finding a voip provider that supports voicemail to email which most of the asterisk based ones do and forwarding the voicemails to your own email alias address

630006
mouseleave	mouseenter
i m using the mouseenter and mouseleave events to trigger an animation on the scaletransform.scalex and scaletransform.scaley so they grow when hovered

630040
disk	ram
it depends on the amount of ram on the server maybe it can keep the whole database in ram disk speed raid array with lots of disk that can work in parallel versus a slow pc with little ram and a single disk

630050
put	get
i ve been working with soap4r and trying to use the soap header simplehandler i m trying to get it to put a custom header on the outgoing message but i can t work out how to get it to include attributes rather than as subelements

630068
vmware	virtualbox
vmware comes with this functionality out of the box but i don t use it anymore after finding virtualbox

630084
getter	setter
getter and setter are called when hibernate creates the entitites and fills in the data from the database

630101

sql server has encryptbykey and decryptbykey functions that make it quite easy to get put encrypted data

630124
textblock	itemscontrol
the container isn t added to the itemscontrol until i scroll down to view it and at that time only the container itself listboxitem is created - its children are not created there should be a few controls added here one of which should be the textblock that will display the text of the item

630144
awt	swing
in swing awt you can check to see if there are more than one monitors

630179

630179
disk	ram
guest windows xp home 1gb ram 8gb virtual disk

630233
vmware	virtualbox
in my experience i ve found that vmware seems to be faster than virtualbox although i don t have any hard data to back it up

630233
vmware	virtualbox
even though vmware has been faster for me i still use virtualbox because it s good enough and is free and im cheap

630251
profiling	instrumentation
if i use instrumentation model as described here to profiling .net application performance it means the profiling tool will change the executable code of the to be profiled executable to insert performance measure code

630301

as the name suggests the viewstate encodes information about the state of the view to try to make a stateless http connection feel stateful to the programmers who created the form

630329
dreamweaver	aptana
for something like that stick with homesite dreamweaver or aptana

630347
accessor	properties
i ve always considered properties to be the equivalent to get set accessor methods

630373
accessor	properties
one thing that you can do is create an accessor properties

630379
width	height
you have to take the width and height properties off of the usercontrol element in your views otherwise they cover each other up

630442
width	height
i ve used the window width and height methods as described above

630442
width	height
note that i m clamping the maximum width and height

630458
implements	extends
they would need to all implements an interface or all derive from a base class which i m assuming you re doing extends control in order to be dealt with without having to handle each individual class differently

630471
post	put
use post to create and put to update

630475
post	put
both put and post can be used for creating

630475
post	put
you do not need to support both put and post

630510
versioning	upgrade
if a user has auto updates set to on for java or if he she decides to upgrade to a higher versioning that will break my other application that only works with java 1.6u11

in my case i don t need to use anything other than safari and firefox so i have not tested this on ie

630563
maven	pom.xml
maven has a section for this - configure your plugins in pluginmanagement but bind them to a phase just when you needed it omit the phase tag in pluginmanagement but specify it under in you inherited pom.xml

630587
cpu	processors
system processors queue length counter will tell you how many threads are waiting for cpu resources

630670
jobs	cron
on windows machines schtasks is a utility similar to cron for scheduling jobs to run on a regular basis

630739
opera	firefox
opera has issues similar to the ones in firefox but the originating element seems to additionally depend on the placement of the mouse cursor

630770
uiview	catransition
the uiview class methods are convenience methods for common animations but are more limited than catransition

630770
uiview	catransition
if you wanted to do a fade in you d have to either dig down to catransition s fade transition or set up an explicit animation of your uiview s alpha

630785
post	put
if you can represent your application as a nested collection of resources then you can just use atompub and not worry about whether to use put or post what http status codes to return and all those details

630907
charindex	substr
i have tried using combinations of substr and charindex but haven t been able to get it quite right each part of the field could be any length so using hardcoded offsets doesn t work

630947
width	height
to draw a circle you need to know the top left coordinate and the width and height of the circle

630966
put	get
another method is to export full but you ll have to flush all writes and put the db into restricted mode so no user can make changes while you export to get a full consistent backup

630979
getter	setter
this could also be a property with a getter and setter and get and set the specific object type

630982
concave	convex
one solution is to split the concave polygon into convex segments then use cobbal s link

631022
ready	each
we want to be sure that the master branch is always ready for release at the end of each sprint even if it potentially means that we might not have increased the value of the master branch after the sprint

631048
maven	cargo
cargo s documentation shows that it is possible to deploy to jetty via maven 2

631085
margin	height
it s not perfect since you need to know the height of each container and apply that height value to the negative top margin of the last element and the bottom margin of the first element

631115
maven	pom.xml
maven has some non-written implicit assumptions like - always inherit submodules from the pom.xml in the parent directory the inheritance tree must match your directory tree otherwise some plugins won t work release plugin or some report plugins

631115
maven	pom.xml
there are a lot of wrong ways in maven therefore one must stick to something that is known to work - like pom.xml hierarchy directory structure

631116
bitconverter	binaryreader
you may want to use binaryreader binarywriter and or bitconverter to help with the tobytearray and frombytearray methods

631149
for-loop	loops	for-loop	arrays
the foreach loops over arrays is equivalent to that standard for-loop over arrays

631154
implements	extends
i guess you know a instanceof b returns true if the a is inherited from b or some of the interfaces a implements or classes a extends are instanceof b

631198
pascal	delphi
remember pascal delphi

631202
for-loop	arrays
would it be better to use a much smaller number of regular expressions up to about 10 to select many more entries into an arrays and then use a for-loop and some simple if statements to filter out the data i m not interested in

631291
width	height
make sure your swf is inside a div and set to 100 of the div s height and width

631299
public	protected
however the standard makes no guarantees about the layout of structs -- even pod structs -- other than that the address of a later member will be greater than the address of an earlier member provided there are no access specifiers private protected or public between them

631343
qsort	bsearch
in a sense you can think of the comparison function passed to the qsort or bsearch functions as a callback

631355
vim	emacs
there are various ides if that s your poison available on unix starting with the ubiquitous eclipse to things like sunstudio if you re on sun and of course all the integration tools that allow you to use the more powerful unix editors like emacs or vim

631360
width	height
try setting the width and height of the grid element to a percentage value

631360
width	height
i m using a grid on one of my main applications and i ve set the width height to 100 and it resizes just fine

631360
width	height
you ll likely need to set the width and height of the rows and items gridrow and griditem as well depending on how you want the rows columns to resize

631387
multiplying	add
take a guess of how many hours you think it will take you add 20 and then multiplying this by some reasonable hourly rate

631407
outputstream	inputstream
i am working on a mobile communicator and after establishing connection to the server using following method to illustrate that i am using streamconnection inputstream and outputstream i distribute inputstream and outputstream between two separate threads lets call them sender and receiver

631407
outputstream	inputstream
whenever one thread calls available or read on inputthread object while the other thread calls write on the outputstream object the inputstream finishes

631411
gridview	objectdatasource
if you use an objectdatasource control as the datasourceid of the gridview then it works pretty seamlessly

631427
touchesbegan	touchesmoved
essentially the touchesbegan and touchesmoved should be passed on to the main view when touching the uibuttons but also should send the button press action

631427
touchesmoved	touchesended
however at this point the touchesmoved and touchesended are obviously not being called because the touches originated on the uibutton

631431
vmware	esx
also vmware esx implements cdp

631486
hide	show
at the gwt level the javascript is changing the style.display attribute to hide and show the contents of the tabs

631496
profiling	benchmarking
if speed is an issue you may want to benchmarking the various methods but i suspect they would all have quite similar performance profiling

631510
photoshop	fireworks
photoshop illustrator fireworks expression design skills

631532
int	chars
they are only the same when you are dealing with primitives int chars etc.

631568
folder	directory
the output folder can be changed by going into project properties but by default they are bin debug and bin release under the project root directory containing the .csproj or .vbproj file

631569
int	chars
int main int argc chars argv

631589
width	height
what i want to do next is to save this new image much smaller so i used the bitmap constructor that takes a source image object and a height and width then saved that

631629
g++	gcc
but actually looking in math.h it isn t there and gcc cannot compile the following test program while g++ can

631629
g++	gcc
what does g++ pull in that gcc doesn t

631629
g++	gcc
so g++ must be grabbing different headers than gcc but which ones

631632
int	double
the problem boils down to the following simplification i have an image only 1d were the pixel values may be int float or double

631657
int	double
to use void as a container for int float double you must allocate it array is genericarray of your old type - with void storage

631706
opera	firefox
it is specific to firefox and opera 9.0+

631729
int	chars
would allow me to add the first three chars of the string test to an int attribute assuming that it would be added to sphinx as an int even though it is a string in mysql

631730
put	get
go and put this in a .html file on your pc and open it in a browser if its ie7 you ll get security warning just allow it this won t happen when launched from a url

631770
min	max
also could you invent more classic and shorter name like max min pair

631773
installation	upgrade
i m running intellij idea 8.0.1 and would like to upgrade my grails installation to grails 1.1 which was released today march 10 2009

631818
webclient	networkcredentials
i don t know how you re doing your downloading or what type of authentication they re using on their end but you can use the networkcredentials class with webclient if it s basic http like twitter for example

631820
put	get
i d like to be able to get all of the files in the group at once and put them in a directory

631827
g++	gcc
according to my tests g++ does include libm automatically but gcc doesn t

631914
public	protected
they are a sleight of hand of making static methods look like they are defined within a class -- as long as they don t access private protected stuff they only can access public methods like any other method you can get away with them

631920
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
you can actually see the image works fine in safari firefox google-chrome and opera

631941
client-side	server-side
ensure both enable client-side debugging and enable server-side debugging are set to false

631972
folder	directory
from the directory containing the two new folder i ran

631975
folder	directory
i d look up a little higher in the directory structure the one that the solution is in and see if your debug release folder with the dll are there

631975
folder	directory
i think the default is to put the actual dlls in folder in the solution directory not the project directory i think the assumption is that you want all the dlls that you build for a solution to go to the same place

631990
post	get
to solve this problem i considered the following switch the buttons to links and when filtering and searching use get instead of post requests

632037
public	protected
public protected

632075
websphere	ibm
is this an ibm websphere page

632151
folder	directory
as above and noldrin says the default directory is the bin directory under the project folder but it can also be set by right clicking on the project in the vs explorer selecting properties and then when the project properties panel appears under compile you should have bin release which defaults to the bin directory under the project saved directory you can change it to c bin and the output will be stored in the bin directory in the root

632213
hash	salt
trim truncate change case salt hash whatever - just do it consistently

632235
pop-up	dialog
the compiler seems to just crash and windows pop-up its un helpful this program has stopped working dialog

632240
gif	png	tiff	png	png	tga
well the bufferedimage doesn t know that it s being written as a jpeg - as far as it s concerned it could be png or gif or tga or tiff or bmp.

632271
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
we tested the site fairly rigorously in ie6 7 8 firefox safari opera and google-chrome

632336
versioning	upgrade
you may well have to upgrade vs versioning

632369
int	double
defining the inputs and outputs as double lets you take advantage of type promotion so this function will also work for int

632414
des	aes
agreed -- des is largely outdated so unless there is a good reason to use it go with aes

632421
ienumerable	ilist
while in the case of ilist and ienumerable things would work out ok the compiler has no way of really knowing that when you see it as collection and collection

632436
globalization	localization
if you want to research msdn has some good articles on globalization localization

632445
width	height
specifically i d like to determine the display height of each string given uniform formatting same font size weight etc. and the maximum width the string may occupy

632471
firefox	safari
ie and firefox safari seem to deal differently with base href and javascript window.location type requests

632473
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
generally speaking i target the top 4 browsers ie-7 ie-8 firefox google-chrome safari

632481
getter	setter
a good parallel would be having a public variable instead of setter getter

632481
getter	setter
the setter getter allows you to change your underlying implementation without effecting the outside world

632574
post	get
basically it has no ui but still processes get post requests just like an aspx page does

632577
urllib	cookielib
i m importing cookielib to handle cookies poster to encode the pdf and urllib and urllib2 to build the request and send it to the url

632583
getter	setter
so the question is should you use getter setter or directly send the object as an argument to the method - in order for the method to work properly

632613
post	get
i m at home now but when i get to work i ll post my hack of this code to make it work up to 3.5 sp1

632616
ienumerable	ilist
i face exactly the same situation in some bits of protocol buffers and i ve found that casting to ienumerable or ilist to access it like a list works very well

632657
firefox	safari
ie and firefox safari seem to deal differently with base href and javascript window.location type requests

632700
hash	md5
take all params of the call a timestamp + - 5 min wiggle a shared secret and hash it using sha-1 or md5 sha-1 better

632708
width	height
my guess is a dodgy filter that doesn t support odd values for width height and is removing it but i m not sure of an easy way to check this

632769
margin	height
edit 2 also worth noting that after jquery gathers the height it adds allowances for padding margin and border sizes so you may need to as well

632781
put	get
on my content pages i use different usercontrols that require the use of many of the functions within the validation.js file however if i dont put the tag and the javascript functions within a contentholder on the contentpage the usercontrols do not see these functions and i get errors like onnamevalidation is not defined

632831
getter	setter
however don t these simple getter setter always get in-lined by the jit

632831
inline	inlining
edit 2 so i created another struct that used explicit getx methods o how i don t miss my java days at all and that performed the same whether i disabled inlining on it through or not so conclusion non-static methods are apparently never inline not even on structs

632831
getter	setter
i also could ve sworn that i ve read plenty of times that simple getter setter properties will get in-lined despite being callvirt in the il

632838
width	height
you can use the desiredsize property on a rendered textbox to get the height and width

632838
width	height
if you have a large number of strings it may be quicker to first pre-calualte the height and width of every indiviudal letter and symbol in a given font and then do a calculation based on the string chars

632854
getter	setter
using automatic fields allows you to get the typically getter setter behavior but builds in the ability to change this without a subsequent need for the changes to propagate to other parts of the code

632876
uiview	uiwindow
since in uikit the uiwindow is a uiview unlike nswindow vs

632906
next	except
well except to save the data to a temporary file then automatically restoring them the next time the program is run

632945
prng	random	mouse	keyboard
although it should be noted that computers can gather entropy from the environment connected to it like keyboard and mouse actions what aids in generating random numbers either directly or by seeding a prng

632979
uitouch	uibutton
your uibutton has a responder controller that receives the uitouch events my guess is that once it has preformed its interpretation of the message it returns - the touch has been handled and disposed of

633010
udp	tcp
if not you can use cfnetwork framework to use sockets tcp udp to allow your app and server to communicate

633056
put	get
trying to get the user to put 3 numbers in 3 text boxes and get the average

633057
abstract-class	superclass
in procedural programming a unit may be an individual program function procedure etc. while in object-oriented programming the smallest unit is a method which may belong to a base superclass abstract-class or derived child class

633067
int	double
try changing the type of average from int to double

634123
margin	font-size
every browser has potentially different margin padding font-size defaults

634127

because union removes duplicates it does a distinct sort

634271
width	height
1 - create your own component with vars for the original x y z and width and height

634271

as pointed out you do not need to move the calls into separate function but you will need to use the above so that you can get at the original width height x y providing your not hard coding all the values

634275
updatepanel	scriptmanager
try using scriptmanager this should provide better support esp for scripts added in an updatepanel

634290
for-loop	arrays
usually you won t have large number of functions in class rather than using map you can create simple struct arrays and use a for-loop

634299

ubuntu	debian
for debian systems ubuntu included the correct way is to make an init script in etc init.d based on the skeleton file in that directory

634536
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
if you had said you could checkout but not commit add modify delete and verified that authorization is ok then i d say check your working copy url server name there is a tricky issue with path-based authorization where checkout is case-insensitive for server name but commit is case-sensitive

634579
post	get
once you ask for and are granted offline access the session key you get in the http post parameters from facebook fb_sig_session_key will have no expiry

according to the linked wikipedia page it s only implemented in firefox 1.5+ and safari 3.x +

634728
decimal	ieee
and the other bit of information compared with drjokepu s answer is that because it is ieee 754 double precision you can get about 16 some will claim 17 decimal digits

634745
portrait	landscape
while it might be useful to know that the device is flat this doesn t tell us whether it s flat displaying an interface oriented in portrait or landscape mode

634745
width	height	portrait	landscape
i suppose i could track orientation change events to remember the last portrait landscape orientation or check the main uiview s bounds height and width but that seems kludgey

634754
implements	extends
this is a clear disadvantage we encounter we ve slightly changed the way we code to make it interact smoother with autowiring a customer repository no longer implements the generic interface but we make an interface customerrepository that extends

634797
ubuntu	debian
in debian or ubuntu copy etc init.d skeleton an example script for starting stopping daemons and edit it to your liking and make it executable

the pointunitconversions calls do the obvious math to take a decimal degrees and convert to corresponding int or double values for the component parts

634824
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
development of this skin was primarily done using safari and as expected it all renders fine using firefox and opera

634835
portrait	landscape
at this point any orientation checks i ve seen return an invalid orientation of 5 so it s not directly possible to determine if a landscape or portrait layout should be used

634837
equals	gethashcode
the dictionary will call gethashcode to calculate a hash bucket for each value and equals to compare whether two foo s are identical

634837
equals	gethashcode
you might want to start with the equals-method and then in gethashcode xor the hash code of every member you compare in equals

634841
equals	gethashcode
by default the two important methods are gethashcode and equals

634867

635195
post	get
the only thing i can think of to get the build number without executing some code within the assembly or checking the file properties is to make some sort of post build event that checks the properties of the assembly and pops up a message box displaying it or better yet write a comment to the top of the assemblyinfo.cs file with the build number

635198
floor	exp
not sure but the identity n m exp10 m log10 n exp q m log n q where q log 10 comes to mind along with the fact that the first k digits of exp10 x the first k digits of exp10 frac x where frac x the fractional part of x x - floor x

in addition to the fine answers about using xargs or find you can also get rid of an extra process by eliminating zcat and piping to zgrep or grep -z instead

635552
client-side	server-side
for example you want to add client-side validation in addition to server-side

635574
post	get

635710
getter	setter
then you have a getter setter for each value that converts xml- whatever and whatever- xml

635710
getter	setter
you still have to write the getter setter though but you can have a macro snippit handle that work for you

636245
width	height
if i specify a height and width on the contained grid stackpanel etc it works fine

636245
width	height
i set a few breakpoints in the code and it seems that the sizechanged event is getting called a lot during rendering and each time the height width increments by 10

636245
width	height
i m assuming that setting a default height width causes it to skip this incrementing of the number but i have no idea why this error is happening

636691
postgresql	mysql
if you were to use data both from a mysql postgresql source with no way of converting one db to the other application constraints lack of time lack of knowledge .

636727
entity-relationship	diagram
i don t have a handy entity-relationship diagram to share at the moment but this is just a very basic starting point for a set of tables anyway

636728
pop-up	dialog
perhaps use a pop-up - you can make these act as a modal dialog by covering the entire app in a grid and forcing keyboard navigation to cycle within the pop-up

636769
folder	directory
in iis there s no hard and fast way to find out which asp.net version is used by a website or virtual directory website application folder - the one that has cogs as an icon

636810
folder	directory
i have the target installation directory set to the correct folder with skip installation unchecked but no luck

int	double
there can be many different ways basic data types such as int float and double are represented internally and there is even more ways to represent strings

636884
pascal	delphi
context or editpad pro both offer syntax highlighting for delphi code as do many other programmers editors they sometimes call it pascal though

636919

you should really be in the habit of filtering all input but you might like to check out which distributes a hardening patch and suhosin which is in many binary distributions by default opensuse mandriva and debian ubuntu

636940
rebol	smalltalk
btw i dont use ruby now as i currently use smalltalk rebol but i would not use

636976
move	drag
i would like to create a video where i can drag the bottom left corner to resize the player maintaining aspect ratio or at least eliminate the possibility of doing so i could move on to other methods

for the parsing i used a std stringstream so that i would easily be able to convert the std string i was handed into a valid float or int double

637197
int	double	atoi	atof
atoi converts to an int you want atof which converts to a double

637283

say i have ini json to store config setting of my desktop application will it be ok to have a static object with all property loaded at startup when ever it is required or is there any other better alternative

637506
width	height
just configure the number of rows and columns of the table layout panel set width and height maximum and minimum size restrictions on the dimensions that make sense to your form dock and anchor styles for the controls that need it and set new sizes for the touchscreen mode of your controls

637512
config	ini
if the config settings is going to be modified by the user to determine the way the application is going to run then it might be better to keep it in some ini file

637549
cpython	ironpython
firstly to my knowledge only cpython has raii - you have to close your own resources in jython ironpython etc

637571
installation	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
i recently had to struggle with one installation project which uses most popular product for creating installation installshield to make it work for product upgrade migrating from one versioning to another

637675
affinity	processors
if you want to set processors affinity you need to explicitly configure this.

637676
affinity	processors
processors affinity is switched off in iis6 which means the load will be distributed across all available cpus

637676
affinity	processors
if you want to restrict it you can use processors affinity to stop this default behaviour

637679
affinity	processors
any multi-threaded program will be distributed over all available cores by the windows scheduler by default though processors affinity can be tuned in the task manager for example

637715
boost	allocator
check out boost multiarray it does exactly what you want except more efficiently by only doing a single heap allocator

637742
free	malloc
the char will be reallocated for every iteration yes but it will also be free before the next iteration so at least this won t cause a memory leak unless you use malloc without a free in that loop

637753
bash	subshell

g++	gcc
using gcc instead of g++ and adding -fno-exception compiler option did the trick

637827
stdout	stderr
i want to redirect both stdout and stderr of a process to a single file

637830
post	get
by default iis will limit verbs to asp.net pages to get head post and debug

637834
stdout	stderr
this is going to redirect stderr to stdout and stdout to some_file and print it to stdout

637837
stdout	stderr
1 file.log instructs the shell to send stdout to the file file.log and tells it to redirect stderr file descriptor 2 to stdout file descriptor 1

637838
stdout	stderr
you can redirect stderr to stdout and the stdout into a file

637839
stdout	stderr
redirects both stdout and stderr to filename

637843
width	height
how to get the width and height of a window

637883

637905
redhat	fedora
must be something similar under redhat fedora

637933
serializable	deserialization
one suggested approach was to ignore the timespan for serializable and instead serializable the result of timespan.ticks and use new timespan ticks for deserialization

637937
plot	heatmap
this is also called thematic mapping or contour plot or heatmap or 2.5d plot in other gis packages

637948
daemons	systemd
is it possible to obtain a service systemd daemons in linux like behavior

637951
children	parent
i can define it any way i want and it must behave like a balanced binary tree though values of parent and children dont matter

637965
getter	setter
you could do the same as in your example but using timespan.tostring in the getter and timespan.parse value in the setter

637992
ubuntu	debian
change the configuration etc network interfaces in ubuntu and debian to assign static ip address to the interface

638016
serializable	deserialization
you use the xml serializable deserialization to export import data to xml

638031
put	get
and if you put a hashtable in there to cache the functions for each encountered codesnippet you could get close to your original example

638050
range	median
or if they re continuous values you could distribute them into bins - that wouldn t tell you the exact median but it would give you a range and if you need to know more precisely you could iterate over the list again examining only the elements in the central bin

638074
folder	directory
smart client software factory â april 2008 - this creates the folder scsf-apr2008 with a lib directory that has lots of microsoft.practices.enterpriselibrary

638284
jstl	taglib
jetty includes their own jstl library and there is no need to include jakrta taglib s standard and core jars

638292
put	get
if so the only way i could think of to do this would be to put your first build in the tasks and the others in the publishers section yes you can do this this is the only way to ensure the following tasks get exectued no matter if the main build pases or fails

638306
icmp	udp
on an unconnected udp socket the kernel doesn t know what application to deliver icmp errors to and so they just get discarded

638341
bytearrayoutputstream	inputstream
you could read the inputstream into a bytearrayoutputstream using one of the read methods and extract the from there

638444
redmine	trac
trac and redmine in particular are very good at this

638446
udp	tcp
in some applications tcp is faster better throughput than udp

638446
udp	mtu	udp	tcp
for example i read an experiment in which a stream of 300 byte packets was being sent over ethernet 1500 byte mtu and tcp was 50 faster than udp

638446
udp	tcp
especially since you can give tcp the same sort of latency as udp by disabling the nagle algorithm for example if you re transmitting real-time sensor data and you re not worried about congesting the network with lot s of small packets

638455
cruisecontrol	teamcity
given that you could get both teamcity and hudson up and running in a few hours it might be worth grabbing both and running them side-by-side along with any others such as cruisecontrol that you can think of

638484
implements	extends
exactly which class you re getting back depends on your configuration but they all implements the principal interface by way of spring s own org.springframework.security.authentication interface which extends it

638503
put	get
to get more complicated than that you could put a hidden one time use key in each form and once the form with that key has been submitted display an error when they try to submit a form with the same key

638523
haskell	agda
epigram and agda do a bit of this and haskell does to some extent though i disagree that monoid is correct mzero and mappend okay mconcat bad

638702
button	checkbox
i have a more general answer for you and anyone else having the problem and ending up reading this not just for checkbox button but for all controls

638708
valgrind	callgrind
i ll put in another answer for valgrind especially the callgrind portion with the ui

638709
post	get
to state the obvious i have not seen it here yet... never use get to post data always use post that way the user at least gets a warning if he or she tries to refresh re-post the page at least in firefox but i suppose in other browsers as well

638713
min	max
find min and max of the list containing n items through linear search and name them as highvalue and lowvalue

638728
google-chrome	safari
webkit safari google-chrome picks it up

the only feature which does automatically create folder would be the create any intermediate folder that are missing checkbox to branch tag dialog to make any missing and required parent directory as part of the transaction during a mkdir move copy commands

638734
put	get
2 in my office there s a lot of lack of line spacing because you get to see more of the code on one page that way. they also put multiple statements on one line and over imho use

638965
vb.net	vb6
i have started reworking one of my company s apps written in vb6 to vb.net

638981
accessor	properties
i m pretty sure that the problem is that when you do this you re effectively making the person.name properties get accessor change the value and act like a set accessor as far as the ui is concerned

638989
cvs	svn
i realise it s not a very descriptive comment in the first place but that sort of thing in svn cvs etc

638994
vb.net	vb6
apparently the tool converts your vb6 to a dsl and then to vb.net winforms c# wpf java.

638997
median	percentile
the algorithm also allows you to query any percentile not just median since you have a complete distribution estimate

639074
jboss	glassfish
application server platforms like jboss and glassfish are free and fairly easy to learn

639102
x86	64bit
in addition you need to create separate assemblies in c++ cli for x86 and x64 targets if you re going to be targetting 64bit systems

639242
svg	vml
whilst you could conceivably write some shapes to a canvas svg or vml elementâ â â or even on non-ie browsers create an image with a â data â url created from pixel valuesâ â â there is no point

639265
google-chrome	firefox
ie7 firefox and i think google-chrome use these

639265
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome s implementation integrates with the address box whereas firefox and ie have a specific search dialogue in the top corner

639273
sorting	filtering
do you require filtering sorting by userid + smalldatetime

639279
width	height
you need to pass the context to this method or better yet rather than pass in width and height pass in the size object itself

639288
affinity	processors
so maybe processors affinity can only be queried on processes

639409
django	turbogears
a long-running process using tools such as django or turbogears for python

639412
getattr	setattr
also the way it tries to replicate the java behaviour of making outer class variables available on the inner class with getattr setattr is very dodgy and unnecessary really since the more pythonic way would be to call i.__outer__.attr explicitly

639452
ubuntu	debian
the problem you will face as an ubuntu user is that there s always been a slight tension between debian packagers users and the main exim user base because debian chose to heavily customize their configuration

639452
ubuntu	debian
unfortunately this ends up causing you a problem because ubuntu adopted all these packages from debian but doesn t support them in the same way as debian does and debian packagers seem to feel put upon to be asked to support these ubuntu users

639452
ubuntu	debian
now to answer your original question there are a ton of ways to do what you ask and probably the best way for you is going to be specific to the debian ubuntu configurations

639489
memcached	apc
with apc data store or memcached you can have persistent objects in ram instead of for example always creating them all anew by fetching data from db

639493

639616
maven	pom.xml
each of the webapps refers to the parent pom.xml and they both currently have a jetty maven plugin that works

639621
implements	extends
also as you mention you can only extends one class at a time but you can implements as many interfaces as you wish

639633
subclass	abstract-class
6.deriving from an abstract-class uses up a subclass s one and only base class option

639650
django	turbogears	pylons	turbogears
ruby gets more attention than python simply because ruby has one clear favourite when it comes to web apps while python has traditionally had a very splintered approach zope plone django pylons turbogears

639682
getter	setter
when you need to extend the getter setter behavior of a class it is useful have encapsulated fields getter setter instead of direct member access

639682
inherited	subclassing
yet in inherited it is conceptualy interesting to preserve the inners of your class if its subclassing shouldn t be aware of its private stuff

639689
move	drag
the drag copy move cursors aren t part of the standard library - your application will need it s own

639696
spweb	spsite
spsite and spweb objects from spcontext are automatically disposed when the http request has completed

639714
groupbox	panel
1 perhaps the easiest is to place both your picture and groupbox within a panel you set the panel s backgroundimage property

639714
groupbox	panel
then the groupbox and panel aren t technically overlapping but the gruopbox is a child to the panel

639725
width	height
use a binding expression on the height and width properties of the image and enclose it inside the scrollviewer

639731
implements	extends
an existing class that already extends something can implements the interface assuming you have control over the code for the existing class

639747
implements	extends
so someone can extends an existing class to implements an interface without affecting the previously existing behavior of that class

639798
globalization	localization
second jquery being a great javascript library does not allow any integration with and does not leverage server side asp.net functionality as opposed to asp.net ajax framework that comes standard with the asp.net 3.5+ and fully utilizes asp.net features such as server side mark-up scriptmanager control server-side script combining localization and globalization etc

639827
portrait	landscape
i need the page to be landscape instead of portrait

640187
profiling	debugging
by that i mean you can start and stop tomcat deploy profiling and debugging your app running in tomcat from the ide

640190
width	height
what s the correct semantic way to specify image height and width

640190
width	height
on the other hand few would argue that image src should not be specified as an attribute and the height width seem as tied to the binary image data as the src is

640197
mp3	wav
frankly i don t know why you d want to work with mp3 internally as opposed to wav files

640209
submit	submission
you need to submit post data with data that mimics the submission of a form then captrue the session cookie set in the response ans use that cookie for future requests

640219
mvp	presenter
additionally consider using mvp architecture pattern with dependency injection to organize your classes and make your presenter and other components more test friendly

640225
firefox	safari
i tested my page with ie6 ie7 ie8 firefox safari opera.

640273
testdriven.net	xunit.net
i have lots of tests that all run fine on development boxes with testdriven.net and on the server with the xunit.net gui app

640302
put	get
the only way i can think of to get my test is to put a try catch block in the helper and assert true when i catch my dataaccessexception

640303
google-chrome	firefox
using the same data google-chrome does in less than 5 seconds what took ie and firefox 10 to 15 seconds to accomplish

640338
cpu	processors
if you lower your priority and there are other cpu hungry processes you may give up more processors time than you want

640346
firefox	safari
everything usually works fine in firefox safari ie6 or ie7

640346
firefox	safari
in that scenario it still works great in firefox and safari but in ie 6 and 7 there are a few annoying quirks

640362
put	get
i don t put set spell in my .vimrc because when i m coding there are just too many variable names in my comments that get flagged

then you can write a method to calculate the min and max latitude and longitudes based on a radius and query for all cities between those min and max

640456
mouseup	mousedown
then capture user actions with the mousedown and mouseup events

640463

boost	stl
is there anything in stl boost that already does something like this

640651
invalidoperationexception	argumentnullexception	invalidoperationexception	argumentexception	argumentnullexception	argumentexception
we have a few custom exceptions and are throwing some exceptions whose classes are defined in the .net framework s standard class libraries argumentexception invalidoperationexception argumentnullexception etc.

640651
invalidoperationexception	argumentexception
today our team lead decided that he didn t want us to use the latter since the .net framework would throw those types of exceptions and in order to facilitate filtering with the application block s policies we should use only custom exceptions going so far as to practically duplicate .net standard class library exceptions with custom versions as in custom argumentexception custom invalidoperationexception etc

640684
int	double
int double and so on

640685
equals	gethashcode
the equals and gethashcode methods should be overriden for better performance

640703
put	get
the tooling is getting better and better and if you can get a true designer on your team there are very few things that you canâ t put together

640721
boost	stl
but i am wondering how people use stl no fancy boost .

640745
opera	firefox
this all works fine in ie firefox and opera

640784
int	double
the data termed as a map essentially consists of int double floats and a single enum

implements	modifiers
edit looking at the code for gdiplus image getwidth in gdiplusbitmap.h it would have been easy for ms to implements many of the functions with the const modifiers

640804
fseek	fread
this way you are not using fseek fread instead you are using pointer arithmetic

640815
children	parent
the problem is that it adds them to the bottom of the parent node s list of children

dictionary	map
the link you are referring to spells out one of my favorite approaches - populating a dictionary and using it as a map from your xml attributes to the values you re setting etc

640964
mako	genshi
tg2 takes pylons and changes some defaults - object dispatching instead of routes and genshi instead of mako

640964
django	turbogears
tg2 and django both distinguish between websites and components so you ll eventually see reusable building blocks for turbogears too

640972
mbunit	mstest
i am not sure that this feature is possible in mstest out of box like in other test frameworks mbunit

641020
procmail	qmail
then your mta such as postfix or qmail will deliver mail to that address to procmail instead of an actual mailbox

641022
cfstring	nsstring
i ll add that not only can you go from cfstring to nsstring with only a type-cast but it works the other way as well

641033
turbogears	toscawidgets
turbogears now uses toscawidgets which can use jquery extjs dojo etc

641033
django	turbogears
this strikes me as a pro for turbogears if you don t have any javascript experience and a pro for django if you are writing a lot of specialized javascript

inherited	properties
determining whether an iiswebdirectory or an iiswebvirtualdir iis admin object is configured to be an application using system.directoryservices alone can sometimes be a non-obvious business because of metabase properties inherited

641330

personally and i know this probably won t be popular but i tend to use excel and something like textpad or notepad++ or even vanilla notepad for once-off database inserts and table creations like this

641631
getter	setter
properties are more maintainable than fields you can encapsulate logic in your setter getter allowing you to hide the implementation

641633
getter	setter
seems like the getter setter will be defined twice

641644
getter	setter
seen examples on this and seems straighforward enough although somewhat duplicated in terms of writing setter getter

641658
min	max	min	median	median	max
name median mean stddev min max samples

641720
min	max
if we number the vectors from 0 to 2n-2 element k of vector n will be at row max n-1-n+k k and column max n+k-n+1 k or in reverse the matrix element at row i column j will be element min i j of vector n-1+j-i

641794
emacs	textmate
i would like to do something like this textmate tip so that trailing whitespace are always highlighted in some way when i code something in python - it makes it easier to correct it immediately and other editors such as emacs can do it

641813
vb.net	vb6
i agree with franci - vb6 is no longer sold or supported so vb.net would be the way to go for compiled code

641842
cassini	iis
i can also add that everything works as expected on cassini but we need to get it up on iis to prove that it s worth investing time in doing the switch

641874
firefox	safari
jquery may do some work to ensure that the resize event gets fired consistently in all browsers but i m not sure if any of the browsers differ but i d encourage you to test in firefox safari and ie

641900
getter	setter
for .net framework from 2.0 up you can set the accessor for the getter setter

641900
getter	setter	public	protected
say you only want the user to only have read access to the field then you make the getter public but the setter private or protected

641947
ubuntu	debian
jsvc is bundled with at least debian and ubuntu

641965
fossil	git	perforce	cvs
i have only tried fossil and git though but i have used perforce cvs and subversion and it looks like dvcs all have really cheap branching and tagging

642008
autofac	castle-windsor
or alternatively try any of the ioc containers like castle-windsor autofac unity etc

642147
cvs	svn
if you can use svn or cvs for maintaining your code

post	get
it took a while but with the help of the post that andy white sent i was able to get it up and running just the way i wanted

642160
webkit	gecko
gecko and webkit support setting rgba as a border-color property so you could potentially set

642160
width	height
to accomplish the bleeding however you ll probably need to overlay a transparent div on the image and give it a width and height equal to the width and height of the image minus the width of the border

642160
width	height
so if the image is 200x200 and you want a 2px border you ll probably have to make the div 196x196 since the box model dictates that the border width is added to the width height dimensions

642201
width	height
on the other hand there s no real need to specify width or height in either html or css though it might help your page render faster

642229
typedef	typename
but i ve never understood why gcc requires typedef typename within templates while vs and i guess icc don t

642229
typedef	typename
is the typedef typename thing a bug or an overstrict standard or something that is left up to the compiler writers

java.util.calendar	java.util.date
had a java.util.date a java.util.calendar or a java.lang.string dd.mm.yyyy in the args-array which holds the arguments replacing the

post	get
how can i get category.title for each of my post right from view

642377
lisp	scheme
lucky in scheme code and data looks the same but thats about it you can never accidentally mix code with data as is very possible in lisp with unhygienic macros

642524
jar	war
we also take a copy of the deployable jar or war and place it in the version directory under binaries along with any dependencies and config files

if the latter if you just want to backup some data you may use a utility like rsync available on most linux distributions like debian

642686
bazaar	git
sourceforge.net just added mercurial bazaar and git support

642703
superclass	subclassing
if you want a superclass to call a specific set of methods defined in a subclassing you can do a few things

642726
unix	solaris
use windows services for unix to create an nfs share on the windows xp system which you mount as normal on the solaris system

642749
post	get
you can use an nsurlrequest to post the image data and use nsxmlparser to get the resulting url

client-side	server-side
i have made groups work server-side with page.validate group but i wasn t aware this could be done client-side

642925
hide	show
the jfilechooser component already handles the esc key by itself when the file chooser is show embedded in my dialog and i press esc the file chooser hide itself

642925

firefox	safari
i just read codes of a web product that is supposed to support multiple modern browser including firefox 3.x safari 3.x and ie7+ but not including ie6-

643018
loops	if-statement
in an if-statement there is only a forward jump to the point after the if-body if the condition evaluates to false remember the cpu anyways assumes to not take a branch jump but in a loops there is maybe a forward branch to the position after loops not to be taken and a backward branch upon repetetion to be taken

643064
gprof	shark
it can be used to visualize several different formats this is a python script to convert the output from prof gprof oprofile shark aqtime and python profilers into a dot graph. this is what the output look like

643077
exslt	libxslt
if you are using an xslt 1.0 processor which supports the exslt date functions i ve just tested this with libxslt in php you can use date add and date duration

643078
getter	setter
i understand the difference between class and interface thankyou my point is that my marking it with the interface i shouldn t have to have this property inside every implementing class unless i want to change the default behaviour of the getter or setter

643101
gridview	rowdatabound
you can also do this in the rowdatabound event of the gridview

643110
getter	setter
lack of separate getter setter access for properties

643115
mouse	keyboard
it is very fast to provide useful control names...very little keyboard mouse jockeying to do this...so high productivity with intuitive results

643161
inherited	subclassing
i have 7 subclassing that inherited the super base class

643161
superclass	subclassing
i would like to populate the common values for the superclass and then use those for each of the subclassing but i can t come up with a good way to do this

643230
filtering	grouping
please note when using the memberof in an ldap filtering the search value must be a complete string to a grouping and so you can t use a wildcard such as memberof cn students grouping

643230
post	get
i did see this post which says what your trying to do is possible without having to do anything extra by matching components of distinguished names but i have never seen this before and i could not get it to work

643274
gridview	repeater
i have a gridview nested within a repeater and i m trying to enable paging on the gridview without much success

643355
hash	md5
so we re intending to pass a token like a 40 characters combination of letters and digit or a md5 hash in the url and to use ssl

643393
wordpress	joomla
this also means projects like drupal joomla wordpress etc

643405
gridview	repeater
your sample has the gridview directly within the repeater

643434
cvs	svn
use text-based version control cvs svn etc.

643435
uniq	grep
using only uniq and grep

643471
hash	salt
it is hard if the guids are set up sensibly using salt secure hash and you have plenty of bits

643476
children	parent
inside the parent class i can access but that returns a resultset of children and i d have to iterate over them to get each one s grandchildren

643563
width	height
if you know either the height or width you can set only that

643598
emacs	jedit
jedit is fairly light-weight and so is emacs and i know they both have java modes

643598
ant	maven
for builds just use ant or maybe maven building in the ide is nice but overrated

643627
sorting	grouping
at a more mature stage where user deliverables are a priority use traditional tools where you don t have to spend dev time writing sorting grouping or pagination logic

643713
int	chars
its most correct use imo is as a coded chars set - a set of chars and a mapping between the chars and int code points representing them

643762
overlapping	insets
the itemscontrol is bound to data that is displayed as an insets on a map for various cities so the goal is to keep the insets as close to their cities without overlapping any other insets

643762
width	height
1. the first issue i ran into is that despite msdn saying that measureoverride should return a height and width of positive infinity if it wants to take up the full space available i get an error when i try to do so

643762
overlapping	insets
2. i tried using visualtreehelper.findelementinhostcoordinates using the canvas.left and canvas.top properties of each itemscontrol a few levels underneath the contentpresenter of each insets to find other overlapping items within the overlappanel subtree

643762
width	height
3. since i m using the overlappanel as an itemspanel for an itemscontrol i have to drill down into the visual tree a couple levels to get an actual left top value and width height to calculate positioning but this wouldn t allow the panel to be used as a generic panel

643795
superclass	subclassing
but a scenario where the subclassing is instantiating the superclass in a method other than it s constructor may still want the current behaviour

643808
unicode	ucs
unicode is just a standard that defines a character set ucs and encodings utf to encode this character set

643810
multibyte	substr
multibyte encodings i should say multi-unit after the above explanation have the advantage that they are relatively space-efficient but the downside that operations such as finding substr comparisons etc

643810
unicode	ucs
both the ucs standards and the utf standards encode the code points as defined in unicode

643836
ubuntu	linux
it s not supported for ubuntu but there are linux editions available here

643869
bazaar	git
but distributed version control systems like git mercurial and bazaar are much better suited for your type of environment than subversion

643901
inline	inlining
making a property or method private can enhance execution speed because the compiler may be more likely to inline the code but i don t know of any instances where this reduces the memory footprint inlining may actually increase footprint at the benefit of speed

643932
postgresql	mysql
for a database i generally use mysql though postgresql might be more suitable if you do lots of really complex queries

643936
int	chars
chars for example has int integral type but is not the int type obviously

643936
int	chars
so if it wants an int and you pass a chars it automatically promotes the chars to the int

643995
width	height
all shapes in the drawing are rectangles with same width and height

filtering	grouping
put your objects in a container and filtering grouping so each one only appears once

644069
free	malloc
you snipped out the code that actually uses buf but if you use malloc or similar to make a buffer it won t be free unless you also free it

644083
int	chars
currently i m seeing when the defaultmodelbinder errors because the input is invalid for the type chars in int invalid date etc. i get ui default error summary â œsomething has gone wrongâ â but no specific error message regarding the specific property that failed conversion

644177
internationalization	translation
also remember that internationalization and translation are two very different things manage them separately

currentculture	uiculture
windows has settings for currentculture uiculture and invariantculture

644275
filtering	grouping
to filtering the grouping by domain and user try

644306
width	height
it is not obvious from how you pose the question whether it is the dimensions of the picture or the size of the png file which you want to optimize as picture histograms do not affect their dimensions width and height

644315
rss	feed
example say if was a doing a rss feed to contains weather temperature info i might have several item tags with one for each city

644323
rss	feed
if you want an example of weather rss feed you should definitely take a look at the rss feed that are produced by the weather channel at

644323
rss	feed
we would parse out the rss feed to get the temperature and cloud coverage of our specific zip code s weather

644332
post	get
apple s key signing is hard enough to get working with the real thing it took me a couple of hours and i m not alone - there s a great many post out there on development forums from people having difficulties managing it

644334
width	height
the problem you ve discovered is that plain uicomponent does not report a width or height value to its parent because it simply doesn t know what that value should be

644358
hide	show
what i have is some javascript jquery adding a click event to a link that will show or hide a div

644378

x86	64bit
- if you didn t specify a specific model then your app will run as a 32-bit on x86 and a 64bit on x64

644461
int	chars
i would think that since c chars x is private only the c float ctor is visible from outside and that should be called by converting int to float

644490
viewdidload	viewwillappear
instead of viewdidload try putting that code in viewwillappear which gets called every time the view will show on the screen

644498
put	get
you might get better results if you put your custom stuff in a separate view or layer and let the os deal with compositing the result over the background

644526
width	height
313x240 pixels which if i could positiont the ruler perfectly would probably be equal to the width and height that the imagesource is reporting.

644543
gif	png
png and gif are the two file formats that support transparency

644543
width	height
one last note i create the bitmap object with width and height only i don t specify the pixel format or whatever that s called bitmap new bitmap width height

644625

644735
x86	64bit
64bit shifts cannot be done in one instruction on x86

644741
cpu	processors
this is because some compilers or processors will use more bits of precision in a cpu register than in memory msvc has 3 different floating-point behavior options for example

644742

folder	directory
the question has already been answered so i m just gonna make a brief remark in your question you use the terms folder and directory interchangeably

644791
folder	directory
remember unix has directory not folder

644791
folder	directory
that s why i believe the folder metaphor for unix directory is wrong and even dangerous

wav	ogg
it may seem quite basic but once you start sacrificing small children to the unholy gods of sdl stuff like sdl_image perfect for reading numerous image file formats - to the extent i sometimes use sdl solely to read jpeg or sdl_mixer sole solution you need for reading and playing basic audio - ogg wav ...

in vs2008 i have a setup project which installs the primary output of one app to the application folder and the primary output of class library project into a subfolder of the application directory

645897
profiling	debugging
when i debugging i usually just copy the sql from the profiling and paste it into management studio and run it

645902
webclient	httpwebrequest
why is that httpwebrequest works and webclient doesn t

645908
hide	show
any information that you can toggle to show hide these can be cached and even preloaded

645908
hide	show
that way you just transpose them to the dom and simply show and hide that element when needed

645985
serializable	deserialization
the ability to perform actions before after serializable deserialization is provided with attributes

645985
serializable	deserialization
if you need to completely override one of serializable or deserialization and thus implement ixmlserializable then you have to do both yourself

646005
filtering	grouping
you should be able to use that to filtering the grouping choices

646078
versioning	upgrade
but if you want a compile time error while building your app you might as well upgrade your schema to the latest versioning as part of your build process avoiding the possibility of schema changes in the first place

646086
rsa	aes
from what i could gather so far people either recommend aes or rsa for this

646193
rsa	aes
yes rsa and aes are two very different things

646260
chown	sudo	chown	chmod
for instance i ll often chmod chown dev devices serial ports etc under sudo root so i can use them from my software without being root

646288
put	get
as you can above i put a system.out.print statement in and every time i click on something in the list i get two ouputs for that item eg

646340
interbase	firebird
as far as i can tell you will not be able to do this neither against ms sql server nor against interbase firebird

646356
integer	unsigned
when the right hand side is evaluated all arguments are promoted to the highest type of the operands of the expression which if phnumrow is unsigned will be unsigned integer

646381
ubuntu	linux
and also download another installation and install on my ubuntu to run my apps on linux

646381
ubuntu	linux
or could i just install on ubuntu and compile my applications to run on both windows and linux

646388
disk	ram
disk io is the weakest link with vmware server and nothing is worse than paging virtualized ram to a virtualized disk file

646388
vmware	virtualbox
i ve found that better disk io performance gives me a better overall experience so i traded the better cpu performance and overall stability unfortunately of vmware server for the better io performance of virtualbox

646395
tcplistener	tcpclient	tcplistener	sslstream	tcpclient	sslstream
i ve got a simple client-server application based on tcpclient tcplistener and sslstream

646395
x509certificate	sslstream
clients can authenticate themselves to the server using a x509certificate or by sending a user name and password after the sslstream has been established

646438
vim	emacs
i keep hearing i should learn vim or emacs but the thing is there is absolutely no way i ll need to use them in work so i feel a bit guilty pouring time into mastering one of them

646438
vim	emacs
worse than that i m wondering if learning vim or emacs could make me slower with visual studio as i d confusing short cut keys

646438
notepad++	scite
currently i m doing my editing in linux using scite i think this became notepad++ on windows

646438
vim	emacs
for someone who works in a purely ms product environment is there any real reason for me to learn emacs vim

646452
folder	directory
you add the mime types to the httpd.conf like the link jaredpar provided and you set the publishing folder to the directory of the webfolder and then the installation folder to it s equivalent uri

646458
vim	emacs
vim and emacs are great if you re willing to learn the keyboard shortcuts

646461
vim	emacs
i d recommend vim if you are going to learn one or the other but i know emacs users will strongly disagree

646536
hash	md5
you make a 128-bit md5 hash of this information

646536
hash	md5
the client software converts it back to a 128-bit number 16 bytes decrypts that using the public key of your ec crypto and compares the result to an md5 hash of the user s personal information which must match what was used for registration

646610
trac	mantis
i d recommend mantis or trac

646643
shim	polyfills
you ll want to use a shim polyfills to add it on browsers that don t support it

646660
int	chars
text is initialized outside of the for-loop as a string and i get the same error when i make temp 1 into a chars or an int

646686
putty	winscp
putty and winscp are all you need

646691
put	get
it could be said that perhaps you should have spent more time designing but a key element in an agile process is that coding is part of the design process and in most cases having put some reasonable effort into design it s better to just get on with it

646717
hex	binary
a less detailed and simpler approach would be to open .ppt file in hex editor and look for information you are interesed in you should be able to see text within the binary data and what surrounds it

646743
maven	pom.xml
if you are using the maven tomcat plugin you can specify a context.xml by adding a plugin configuration block to the pom.xml

646772
width	height
set the width and height for the image

646779
inline	inlining
limit on the jit for inlining but will it inline properties or just pure method calls

646780
inline	inlining
it s up to the jit the c# compiler doesn t do any inlining as far as i m aware but i believe the jit will inline trivial properties in most cases

646818
accessor	properties
so why not create a class with a very simple accessor properties run it in release mode set a breakpoint and see what the disassembly says

646828
post	get
i get the same set for line 50 but didn t post it for the sake of brevity

646830
serializable	deserialization
serializing usernamesecuritytoken s and x509securitytoken s works like a charm haven t tried deserialization but windowssecuritytoken s are apparently not supported by the serializable

646832
filesystems	fat
this is because fat directories are as on many unix filesystems simply a packed array of fixed-size directory entry structs along with an ugly hack to fit long file names written in unicode into a directory structure designed for 8.3 names written in ascii

646832
folder	dir
on a fat32 volume dir shows the files in a different order than it will if that same folder is copied to an ntfs volume

646833
decoder	encoder
i implemented this behavior in my amf3 encoder decoder i developed in erlang but being not very experienced with flash api i can hardly find how can i easily force flash to use these reference tables when serializing objects to amf3

646874
stdout	stderr
on nix type os if you are process is outputting to stdout or stderr you can obviously use pipes

646934
daemon	cron
i would be inclined to perform this task with a cron job rather than polling the database in a daemon

646937
daemons	systemd
you might want to consider making a mysql trigger that executes a systemd command ffmpeg instead of a daemons

646979
hash	salt
you really should have a unique random salt for each hash

646990
implements	extends
neither class implements runnable or extends thread so maybe that s the problem

647017
subclass	abstract-class
now in the subclass i call the run method of the abstract-class because this should be common to all clients

647020
hash	salt
also there is no need to append the bytes of the salt to the string before calling update simply call update twice with the salt in the first call and the password to be hash in the second

647039
equals	gethashcode
i am seeing in some domain object models that an abstract base class is created that implement equals and gethashcode for all domain entity objects to inherit from to gain their identity

647059
hash	salt
note however that once your user table is compromised if the attacker knows the salt and hash scheme what you re hashing and the hash alg itself then he can get passwords by starting with popular passwords and comparing the hash salt version against each user record

647139
addition	twos-complement
i like bit operations because the code says chopping off the extra bits rather than relying on the effect of addition on numbers expressed in twos-complement notation

647144
move	drag
when you hold down the mouse button on something you don t start a drag operation until the mouse move outside a small region around the mouse-down location

647180
jobs	cron
how would you distinguish between idling a forgotten shell hanging in tmp overnight long-running scripts nightly cron jobs and actual activity

647203
gridview	objectdatasource
try moving the objectdatasource outside of the gridview

647213
public	protected
if you declare a method public protected then it can be overridden by children outside of the package

647213
public	protected
i use package because there is no keyword for it so in the absence of public protected private you get package access

647240
rss	feed
twitter s rss feed displays names as

647240
rss	feed
other details i m parsing an rss feed into a page using simplepie

647256
rss	feed
i would suggest parsing the rss feed as usual then getting the value of the element from your parsed structure finding the index of the opening parenthesis and trimming off everything from the previous index the space onwards

647365
redmine	trac
i use or have used trac mediawiki and redmine

647365
redmine	trac
trac and redmine are more than just wiki s

647366
nsstring	nsobject
cocoa is a framework that includes things like nsobject and nsstring

647420
tcpclient	networkstream
we create a wrapper around stream a superclass of networkstream which is a superclass of tcpclient or whatever

647437
icmp	udp
what i mean by using winpcap is the you could capture icmp traffic and then see if the captured packet is about your udp packet being undeliverable or not

647443
min	max
i currently have code that calls matplotlib.pylab.plot multiple times to display multiple sets of data on the same screen and matplotlib scales each to the global min and max considering all plots

647443
min	max
is there a way to ask it to scale each plot independently to the min and max of that particular plot

647446
super	abstract
however using interfaces all this innards that are hanging out when looking at the abstract super class or the concrete class are safely tucked away

647450
hide	show
that method should just check to see if the dialogue is visible and if so hide it and maybe show an error message

647456
post	get
if it works for the application you could switch to use post instead the problem form is surely using get if not take a look at jon s answer

647479
post	get
as stated in previous post this is a very different list to the one you get by right click and selecting properties

647519
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
the uiviewcontroller has been designed to work hand in hand with uinavigationcontroller

647519
uinavigationcontroller	uinavigationitem
when pushing a new view a uinavigationcontroller will inject references to itself and to a uinavigationitem containing metadata about the navigation back button with the title of the view behind it etc...

647557
folder	directory
if your application files are not in a subfolder of wwwroot you can create a virtual directory pointing to your project folder

647558
consistency	acid
rdbms are much easier to use for consistency of data acid

647604
mouse	keyboard
i ll assume it s not a keyboard mouse or windows event since that s what gui frameworks are for

647642
jruby	mri
i have heard that mri only supports green threads and jruby supports native threads via jvm

647642
jruby	mri
is it portable between jruby and mri or do i have to hack in jvm specific code to take advantage of the jvm native threads properly

647651
hash	salt
you should store passwords hash and properly salt

647669
getter	setter
in general all your data should be private and accessed via getter and setter

647692
post	get
edit you edited your post to get resource for inner workings of server components

haskell	scheme	lisp	scheme
if you want more experience in another language and have not tried it yet i would recommend to learn a functional programming language such as scheme lisp or haskell

647731
posix	getcwd
as others have already pointed out getcwd is not included in iso c++ but is part of posix ieee std 1003.1

647737
put	get
while you can read about things like memory management data structures and their implementations algorithms etc. you won t really get it until you ve had a chance to put it in to practice

647762
integer	fractions
when we convert a float to integer in visual basic 6.0 how does it round off the fractions part

647777
daemons	systemd
i m just about to put live a systemd i ve built based on the queueing daemons beanstalkd

647779
serializable	deserialization
now i ve previously written custom serializable and deserialization externalizable for various reasons in years past

647783
vxworks	rtos
this has been tested on the exact same hardware running vxworks this logic also works nicely in nucleus rtos and os20 on different platforms fwiw

647822
spaces	linefeed
all characters except whitespace characters spaces tab carriage return linefeed vertical tab and formfeed that is

647840
serializable	deserialization
i haven t seen many benchmarks for serializable deserialization but few support less that 200 micro-seconds for serializable deserialization

647849
int	double
map money to decimal or double as you wish map bool to bit or equivalent map datetime to datetime map byte to binary map long to number x 0 and map int to int

647979
firefox	safari
and here s what firefox and safari 4 beta report on my macbook pro

648013
strcpy	strncpy
if you want to copy a string into a buffer then use strcpy or strncpy

648089
aggregate-functions	sum
when using an aggregate-functions sum count .

648097
strdup	malloc
there#s a function strdup to make a copy of a string...it makes sure you don t forget the +1 in your malloc

648112
post	get
if i get around to making a patch to expose this functionality on menuitemfont assuming it s not already in the pre-.7.1 sources i ll update my post

648159
disk	ram
is there any reason you can t just make a small ram disk partition and use it only for your application

648159
disk	ram
i apologize for the newb question but i found your question interesting and am curious if ram disk could be used in such a way

648206
width	height
width 90 height 4000 frameborder 0 scrolling no

648255
hide	show
is there any way in winforms to prevent the user from launching actions or changing data in the application while letting through a few select things resize show hide and family and the user closing the window

648280
hide	show
then everything is pretty standard you are doing pushviewcontroller and popviewcontrolleranimated to show and hide details controller

648321
margin	height
the vertical centering is done by placing the top of the div 50 down the page then use a negative top margin that is half the height of the div to move it up to the center

648321
opera	firefox
the code is tested in firefox 3 ie 7 ie 8 beta and opera 9

648330
disk	ram
buffer is temporary placeholder variables in many programming languages in memory ram disk on which data can be dumped and then processing can be done

648363
post	get
it s slightly different as the schema i m using was simplified for the above post but you get the idea

648403
hash	salt
the hash password doesn t stay the same because it is being salt on each time it is used it s ok because the hash contains the salt where it can be found later to compare

648403
hash	salt
salt are just random characters numbers symbols to add more variance to the hash to make it difficult to crack

648412
inline-functions	inlining
the speed benefits in using inlining decrease significantly as the size of the inline-functions increases

648492
hide	show
slide the other items up or down to show the new item or hide the deleted item

648545

648624
ironruby	ironpython
this is goes for ruby ironruby python ironpython and dynamic vb

648660
salt	md5
what you could do is use a unique salt keyword and generate against md5 sha-1 or sha-2 if you are really concerned with security

648678
int	chars
foo should add 10 bytes 2 int + 2 chars

648711
rss	feed
maybe have a look at yahoo pipes - it can be used to modify rss feed into a post-processed rss feed that can do anything including regex search replace

648735
post	get
this post should get your started or here

648743
integer	unsigned
these should work fine on java which does not support unsigned integer primitives

648767
accessor	properties
is required in the properties accessor

648767
accessor	properties
since you have additional logic in you accessor the use of auto-implemented properties is not appropriate in your scenario

648780
ironruby	ironpython
this may mean embedding ironruby or ironpython in your .net application

648783
sharepoint	splist
if you need to get the list of available fields for a sharepoint list check the parent splist object s fields property which is a collection of the fields in this list

648821
short	base
are costing the business a lot more in the medium and possibly even short term than it would to launch a whole hearted effort to re-write refactor replace the whole thing the code base is about 300k lines

648831
folder	dir
any even better solution in so far as using the latest binaries for openssl is to rename both libeay32.dll and ssleay32.dll in both the ruby bin folder and also the posgresql lib folder and install the latest openssl from at the time of writing it was win32 openssl v0.9.8j light put the dir in the path and away you go it worked for me

648856
rational-numbers	fractions
the best thing to do is to implement a fractions class or rational-numbers class

648880
mbunit	nunit	mbunit	mstest	nunit	mstest
how do you in any of the common .net testing frameworks mstest nunit mbunit or xunit.net get the command line test runner to output a simple yes no or true false or 1 0 on whether all the tests passed or failed

648885
firefox	safari
i am developing lamp but oriented to a windows base majority so i really must run windows native and test heavy for ie all projects work smooth on firefox and safari ie s really the bottleneck

vim	emacs
or do vim or emacs have auto-completion as good as xcode

649022
vim	emacs
what you are missing is that emacs and vim are actually ides

649024
vim	emacs
well before the days of xcode there was vim and emacs

649024
vim	emacs
many people got accustomed to vim emacs and thus continue to use it

649024
vim	emacs
vim has incredible regex engine emacs does as well and is very handy because vi comes with pretty much every unix os and works fantastically if you don t have arrow keys yeah yeah real old school

649024
vim	emacs
the same is true with emacs as well but for me i find cursor motion much easier on vim

649024
vim	emacs
personally i use emacs to code vim to manipulate text and firefox to look at lolcats

649045
vim	emacs
some people like to work with lightweight texteditors like g vim emacs pico etc

649097
google-chrome	firefox
the above code works in google-chrome browser perfectly and updates filedomain div.but in ie and firefox it opens a new window and displays the content.and it is not updating filedomain div.how to make this work on ie and mozilla.do i need to add doctype tag in gsp page

649105
vim	emacs
but it s good to mention that you could also figure that out by yourself by reading these kinda posts a lot of users uses vim emacs .

649111
atof	strtod	strtol	strtod	strtol	atof
you are not clear if you mean floating point literal as part of the source code for the compiler to parse into architecture-dependent binary representation or scanned by library functions such as scanf atof strtol strtod and strtold at run-time to convert to in-memory float double or long double value

649192
des	aes	tripledes	aes
rijndael is what became aes the general replacement to des so it s definitely preferred over des and tripledes unless you need to be compatible with some old des-based system

649218
svg	vml
i believe svg is a successor to vml

649268
des	aes	3des	aes
weakest fastest rc2 des 3des aes rijndael strongest slowest

649277
des	aes
aes is the successor of des as standard symmetric encryption algorithm for us federal organizations and as standard for pretty much everybody else too

649277
3des	aes
using a block cipher properly is not easy and it is more important than selecting between aes or 3des

649288

649410
try-catch	exception-handling
to control what happens during an exception-handling you use a try-catch block

649421
vim	emacs
vim and emacs both have great communities where people are willing to code up features for just about any language

649421
vim	emacs
so many ides also feature emacs and vim compatibilty modes or extensions

649421
vim	emacs
sooner or later you will choose which suits you vim emacs ide and then stick to improving your skills with it

649462

post	get
can you post some of your code so we can get a better idea of what you re doing

649605
folder	directory
depending on your folder structure and where the css is located relative to the images it is using you will have to go up to the root level of the image directory and access it from there so you could maybe try something like

649707
post	get
and if you get in trouble may be post another question about mmaping

649726
typedef	struct
you cannot use a templated typedef but you can use a convenience class struct with an inner type

649736
vim	emacs
i have only used emacs briefly and while i prefer vim i am jealous of some of its features

649736
vim	emacs
but i ultimately went with vim because i find the chord-input model that emacs uses to put unnecessary strain on my fingers

examples tested in safari + firefox

650034
inherited	properties
i like to use it when assigning to inherited properties

650036
metaphone	soundex
as far as approximations go though for single terms you could use a modification of an algorithm like soundex or metaphone to pick a color

650036
metaphone	soundex
for multiple terms you could for example apply soundex or metaphone to each word individually then sum them up with overflow

650045
put	get
having dynamic css across the site will cause you issues as the style sheet will get cached so it s better to put all of the style into the file and allow local caching to speed up the page than try to make lots of small css files

one header that i see running a quick test is transfer-encoding chunked and i also see that they re not sending content-length

650208
int	chars
you can t use string in switch case.only int chars are allowed

650217
int	chars
you can only use switch on primitive such as int chars and enum

650243
g++	gcc
dmitry is correct you should use -lstdc++ if you use gcc but even better is to use g++ instead

650252
mouse	keyboard
i did find that subscribing to the windows keypressevent did give me keyboard events but not mouse click events

650299
integer	unsigned
c++ ulong is a 32-bit unsigned integer type

650299
integer	unsigned
in this case your constants don t need to be unsigned so just use int in c# or integer in vb.net

650319
disk	ram
on the assumption that you don t have 2.4 pb of disk space to hold 3 off 10 8 square non-sparse matrices of doubles let alone that much ram for an in-memory database - blue gene q only has 1.6 pb .

650391
chunked	transfer-encoding
you can use chunked transfer-encoding

650391
chunked	transfer-encoding
basically you send a transfer-encoding chunked header and then the data is sent in chunked mode meaning that you send the length of a chunk followed by the chunk

realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
and no it won t get free when it goes out of scope - when you use malloc or realloc it s all up to you

650717
free	realloc
after realloc ptr might be pointing to an entirely different place in memory and continuing to use the original value of ptr could leave you using memory that s been free and which isn t as big as you think it is

650721
realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
yes you need to free everything you allocate with malloc and realloc and the other related c style memory allocation functions

650723
realloc	malloc
realloc should only be used to reallocate memory allocated by malloc what you are doing works only by accident and will eventually crash horribly

650741
realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc	calloc	malloc
realloc is illegal here the address has to be null or an address returned by an earlier call to realloc malloc or calloc

650752
free	realloc
trying to free or realloc a stack variable can lead to undefined behaviour including but not limited to corrupted stack leading to unpredictable flow of control corrupted heap service structures corrupted user memory

650756
realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc	calloc	malloc
therefore you provide either a null pointer or a pointer to something allocated by malloc or realloc or calloc and store the pointer returned

650826
globalization	localization
globalization and localization in .net

650827
hide	show
i think the best way to accomplish it however is to create the item normally as part of the page and just hide it using a css style until you want to show it via javascript rather than creating it from scratch dynamically

650837
folder	directory
otherwise ghost should be able to just pick some folder and files and not only complete os s so that might be a better choice not sure if you can deploy the software in other directory than the one on the master machine though

650846
client-side	server-side
keep in mind that asp.net ajax is comprised of both the client-side javascript library microsoftajax.js and the server-side components in system.web.extensions

650862
realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc	free	realloc	free	malloc	free	calloc	calloc	malloc
mystring is not allocated with malloc or calloc so it can t be reallocated with realloc or free with free

650864
post	get	puts	gets
gets puts do as well but when i try to do a post to an action in my service i get the following error returned

650869
udp	tcp
these restrictions are somewhat less strict for udp sockets than for tcp sockets so you may still be able to do whatever you are trying to do

650889
hide	show
in qt if i right-click on a toolbar the menu will be show that allows me to hide the toolbar

650896

verilog	vhdl
for a pay class on perl for verilog vhdl consider this from doulos

651037
children	parent
is there a way that i can save the parent and associate the child ids to it without loading up the child objects and then adding them to the children collection

651038
folder	directory
executing the command git clone git github.com whatever creates a directory in my current folder named whatever and drops the contents of the git repository into that folder

651069
gridview	rowdatabound
i suppose that you can did this calculation listing for the rowdatabound event of the ms gridview however more straight-forward means i use during my development is to take advantage of the calculated column of the telerik web grid

651076
actionscript	haxe
you might also want to try haxe a relatively new language with similar syntax with actionscript ecmascript that can output to several different formats such as swf javascript php and c++

651097
irix	linux	unix	aix
i did some work about 5 years ago porting code to many flavours of unix aix irix hpux linux

651179
ant	cruisecontrol
although the a compile task works directly from ant when run from cruisecontrol it seems to be trying to find it s own internal libraries based on paths from the b jar settings

651200
rapidsvn	tortoisesvn
with a gui interface along with a command line one subversion has tortoisesvn rapidsvn which is more of a traditional ui or ankhsvn for visual studio integration

651262
onmouseover	onclick
however it probably would be possible to use javascript + html + css to make your own select list using just div and span elements and that correct onclick and onmouseover javascript

651268
ant	cruisecontrol
in your cruisecontrol configuration you can specify the anthome or antscript attributes so that you use your version of ant so you should be able to get the same behavior from cc that you get at the command-line

651273
wsdl.exe	svcutil.exe
similar to what svcutil.exe does for wcf services or what wsdl.exe did for web services but for wcf rest services

651278
rss	feed
just grab your rss feed and put it here

651293
gridview	objectdatasource
i m using an objectdatasource with a gridview with an onobjectcreated handler on the code-behind

651321
post	get	post	put	put	get
all rest services can use http verbs like get post put delete

651336
width	margin
in some contexts you can leverage margin settings to effectively specify 100 width minus n pixels

651370
nsxmlparser	nsurlconnection
before this project i just built reused a couple of classes to handle the nsurlconnection and nsxmlparser work but instead of type introspection i used the delegation pattern

651413
hide	show
you can then show or hide the sets depending on what is currently showing on the map you can find the boundary of the map using gmap2.getbounds

651429
profiling	debugging
though simics is non-free i highly recommend it and its built in debugging profiling tools while making your kernel

651449
sorting	filtering
searching sorting filtering which all implies the internal upercassing engine of tdxmemdataset it s a repeated action

651449
sorting	filtering
otoh users are very demanding with the speed of data retreival operations searching sorting filtering etc.

651543
folder	directory
visual studio save the reference location as relative paths so put in the a folder in your project and make sure the it proprieties copy local is true it will make the vs to copy the file to the output directory

651562
cvs	svn
i have been coding since a long time but i have never ever used the code management systems like cvs or svn

651619
prepare	execute
what is the advantage of that method can i use one try catch block instead of several nested if else blocks to handle all errors for the different steps connect prepare execute etc.

651632
try-catch	exception-handling
in general try-catch blocks are great because they will break move to the catch statement whenever the exception-handling occurs

651636
hex	binary
in computer engineering it s easier to deal with hexadecimal addresses than decimal numbers since addresses and data inside the computer s memory is binary and can be directly represented as a hex number

651637
innodb	myisam
all the tables support it innodb tables support it but myisam tables don t

651664
many-to-many	many-to-one
so i m stuck with left joins for many-to-one relationships and n r+1 queries due to the many-to-many relationships

651677
filesystems	xfs
could someone provide or point me to a list of all the illegal characters in the xfs filesystems

651683
hide	show
the goal is to let the user to hide show move resize columns to save this layout and to be able to restore it when the app re-starts

651698
int	chars
int length chars data

651700
gif	png
i would like to have jquery limit a file upload field to only jpg jpeg png and gif

651708
mouse	keyboard
these machines all currently run windows xp and we have a windows service that is used to lock a machine by blocking any keyboard or mouse input

651708
mouse	keyboard
ctrl+alt+del is blocked via a keyboard filter driver and the rest of the keys and mouse are currently blocked using the blockinput function from user32.dll

651746
int	chars
int length chars data

651761
filesystems	xfs
according to wikipedia any character except nul is legal in an xfs filesystems file name

651774
children	parent
so inside the filter we get all the children of the tr get the 2nd and return whether or not its text is equal to open - if it is it would return true and we could keep the parent in the selector

651788
filesystems	xfs
posix filesystems including xfs allow every character in file names with the exception of nul 0x00 and forward-slash

651843
folder	directory
i know the user i m authenticating with has a backup folder in his directory

651855
sorting	grouping
i am attempting to export a query from ms access into ms excel in a way that does not carry over the sorting and grouping

651876
required	placeholder
but wouldn t changing .required to .wasreq as a placeholder to differentiate this from one which maybe wouldn t be required on checking the box do the same thing

651888
children	parent
if the parent is associated with the children then there should be a parent property in every child which i don t see and you ll have to update the children anyway so you ll have to load all the children from the database

651888
children	parent
otherwise how is the relationship between the parent and the children persisted

651888
children	parent
if it s not just save the parent with the name property and don t even bother with the children

651913
realloc	malloc
i hope this example makes it clear - the variables are the same size and the amount of additional memory allocated by malloc realloc is the same as well

651934
subclass	abstract-class
it still makes sense in a code-organizational context to put public int getcalories in abstract-class food as it d be silly for the person eating it the code using a subclass of food to define how many calories it has

651947
spaces	delimiter
in keeping with my complete lack of efficiency i was planning just to do a string.replace on the html tags after i broke them up and then just finding the index of the opening brackets and grabbing the spaces delimiter strings that are remaining

651971
postgresql	mysql
for example gis extensions for mysql and for postgresql both follow opengis simple features specification for sql standard

652004
webkit	gecko
edit the fop faq suggests that the correct syntax is fill url grad.svg#purpletowhite but that doesn t work in gecko or webkit

652006
accessor	properties	public	protected
if you can t change the schema you might want to make the designer generated accessor private protected and create a public accessor to front-end the properties in a partial class implementation

652077
accessor	properties
if they are being assigned to the properties probably from the example change the set accessor so that it does the trim there

652164
mouseleave	mouseenter
i think it is impossible to do without handling the mouseenter and mouseleave events of all the children but you do not have to wire them manually

652165
free	malloc
hello world is a constant string literal you need to allocate memory using malloc in c or new in c++ if you want memory you are free to modify

652193
typedef	struct

652197
public	protected
i m about to sub-class accordion just to make protected function get contentheight number a public function

652232
getter	setter
as an example map nhib onto private fields or private property setter and only expose property getter publicly

652265
width	height
mywindow window.open mp3 mp3player.html mp3player width 130 height 120 left 0 left 100 top 100 location no

652286
firefox	safari
take a look at either in safari or firefox then in ie7 and you ll see what i mean

652286

i m currently using the built-in effect fadeto for fading the content but i ve also tried creating custom effects as well as using both show hide animate and fadeup fadedown

652300
hash	md5
i need to hash a string using the md5 technique in cocoa

652311
sortedmap	sortedset
i need to iterate through sortedmap s entry set which is a sortedset backwards

652314
ssid	wlan
the available wlan network ssid s

652317
hash	md5
but if you just want to hash something using md5 on an iphone this should give you the information you need

652324
mbunit	nunit
in the .net world you would run these small bits of code using something like nunit or mbunit or even the built in testing tools in visual studio

652325
ostream	istream
thus any oarchive can use any ostream and any iarchive can use any istream

652329
hash	md5
md5 is not encryption it is a cryptographic hash function

652329
hash	md5
the fact that it is cryptographic means that it is a computationally hard problem that given an md5 hash output compute a string whose md5 is that value

652390
post	get
the double post will get solved

652433
width	height
your user control has width and height predefined and your grid is stretching to fill that without regard to the object tag size

652436
width	height
you will suffer to get the iframe full width and full height especially in ie

652440
inherited	properties
also make sure that the inherited properties in that global.asax is pointing to your custom class namespace and all in your global.asax.cs file

652475
hide	show
in response to your comment i have put a number of the show hide sections on this example and all appears to work fine for me in ie6 and firefox 3

652503
children	parent
i acknowledge that the parent program can wait for the children to complete using one of the wait functions or using the select function

652511
children	parent
just earlier today someone told me that they always use a pipe by which the children can send notification to the parent process that all is going well

652511
stdout	stderr
this seems a decent solution and is especially useful in places where you would want to print an error but no longer have access to stdout stderr etc

652512
getter	setter
the insert magic refers to handling each call to the generic property getter or setter that has a different type for the type parameter

652512
getter	setter
i would envisage that for each type t if the getter is called before the setter is called then default t is returned

652512
getter	setter
when the setter is called the value is stored per type t so that when the getter is subsequently called the previous value that was set for that type is returned

652564
inherited	subclassing
if a class inherited from another the memory used by the subclassing is packed by hind the memory of the parent class but a flexible array needs to be at the end the structure class

652617
multiplying	subtract
this creates 4 buttons one for adding subtract dividing and multiplying

652617
multiplying	subtract
multiplying and adding works perfectly no problems at all but when the user tries to subtract it always returns 0

652645
addition	multiplication
i m surprised your addition and multiplication are working.

652669
getter	setter
but many developers tend to put computationally intensive or relatively long-running code in the getter and setter where they would be much more appropriate as methods

652704
median	percentile
median and percentile estimation are more difficult but possible

652706
inherited	properties
extension properties are available today via inherited

652719
put	get
to get a count of the number of calls to date you can use the file size environment variable modifier as in the following script i expect this will be done less often than running the script so it s better to put the grunt work here in fact it s not a lot of grunt work since it s not counting the characters rather it gets the information directly from the directory entry

652792
dlsym	dlopen
i ve used the older-style dll-functions but if you re at a high-enough level there are also the newer dlopen dlsym c helper functions

652792
put	get
this page seems to offer up another option where you can put the dll program into the same load module as the calling program and use static calls to get to it

652804
ienumerable	ilist
for example i had never realized how often i was exposing ilist instead of ienumerable when it wasn t absolutely necessary until i started using linq to objects frequently

652804
ienumerable	ilist
when i d have methods that took ilist passing through the ienumerable results from a linq query requires .tolist or a reworking of the method s api

652817
sctp	tcp
i am considering using sctp instead of tcp for a p2p app written in c

652817
sctp	tcp
also how does the speed of sctp compare to the speed of tcp

652817
sctp	udp
i found that sctp can be tunneled over udp with the only problem being tunneled sctp is not interoperable with untunneled sctp

652890

pem	pkcs#12
instead of converting the keystore directly into pem i tried to create a pkcs#12 file first and then convert into relevant pem file and keystore

652937
ssl	https
i know the ssl is working because the https call displays a ton of ssl variables

653018
post	get
usually a design idea change is presented on a post it note i usually start with out with an estimate of about year and the more refined the post it notes get i get the better my estimate gets

653064
hash	md5
the key could basically represent an md5 hash or sha-1 or sha-2 if you really concerned with high security of the installed machine mac address the first and last name so and so forth

653084
rss	feed
i would like to avoid relying on an rss feed but it may come down to that

653090
post	get
i was thinking i could get the browser to post back to the server with the data but this isn t what it s meant to do

653147
range	max	range	min	min	max
each link then gets generated using something like where min and max specify the range of page links to create .

653197
jdom	dom4j
dom4j i think was forked from the earlier jdom

653210
min	max
what about levenshtein distance divided by the length of the first string or alternatively divided my min max avg length of both strings

653218
hide	show
i ve successfully made the show hide fadeto fadeup and fadedown all work in ie6 and above

653235
loki	header-only
you may also want to have a look at smart pointers from loki libraries again header-only implementation

653258
union	distinct
this looks like a union of two distinct queries to me

653259
punctuation	words
i m writing a python function to split text into words ignoring specified punctuation

653308
integer	unsigned
a right shift of an unsigned integer shifts a 0 into the high bit and is usually known as a logical shift

653308
integer	unsigned
in those rare use cases where bcd is the right answer then storing them in an unsigned long 8 digits ten s complement or an unsigned 64-bit integer room for 16 digits ten s complement or 15 digits plus sign and flags and using a carefully crafted arithmetic library to manipulate them makes sense

653334
rar	zip
you can use a compression algorithm like zip or rar to compress the protected files and assign a password that is required in order to uncompress them

653338
x86	mips
however in practice every single x86 ppc and mips compiler i have ever worked with has followed this rule for shifting right

653338
integer	unsigned
an unsigned integer the vacant bit

653367
post	get
just make sure you read up on how to pass a session to flash using get post parameters

653384
rtl	verilog
i am assigned with the task of verifying some verilog based rtl code

653384
rtl	verilog
now coding the rtl testbench using verilog seems to be very difficult for me

653407
16-bit	64bit
it can be saved via notepad for example in a file with the extension .com and it can be run on msdos most clones of msdos and even in the msdos compatibility mode of the windows command prompt including on vista but not on any 64bit windows since they decided that compatibility with 16-bit real mode was no longer a priority.

you cannot inherited properties well you can - see comments so your call

653457
bids	ssis
debugging ssis packages within the bids environment is not the same ball game as working with visual studio

653457
bids	ssis
you are not able to debug the internal .net code that makes up any of the other built in ssis components the ftp task within bids so i doubt a custom component will be any different

653495
folder	directory
you can even ignore a folder content git update-index --assume-unchanged on directory

653514
put	get
the correct number of shoppingbasketitem s also get put into however both the itemid and itemquantity of each are zero

653531
post	get
the most cross-browser way to do this would be to simply fetch the image url as the response of the post request and then make a get call to the image using img src ...

653536
getter	setter
i will not use validation code in the getter setter

653542
getter	setter
in the second instance you ve just defined a variable in the first there is a getter setter around the variable

653546
accessor	properties
a properties can have accessor keywords

653567

you can make a properties read-only or write-only by making it s accessor private

653668
filtering	grouping
just grab the data from the database and according to the user provided parameters filtering it grouping it and send as a collection of beans to the jasper report which will do the rendering

653685
getter	setter
properties can have different accessibility for the getter and setter

653686
min	max
msvc has macros in minmax.h called max and min which cause a compiler error every time i intend to use the standard function

653697
free	malloc
my idea is to pass two function pointers - for common allocation and deallocation functions - to every dll in some initialization initialize malloc free and then do all memory management using these common and thus always compatible functions

653762
free	malloc
when developing using win32 is there a reason you want to use function pointers to malloc free

653762
free	malloc
why are you not simply using malloc free directly

653765
put	get
from mysql query i get data which i put into a dictionary d

653799
getter	setter
properties support different accessibility for getter setter - fields do not but fields can be made readonly

653802
skydrive	rapidshare
so far i have tried rapidshare and skydrive and have been unable to get either working at all

653877
for-loop	arrays

653937
loops	while-loop
i have created a while-loop in which temporary strings are created string is updated everytime that loops performs

653985
swt	swing
i ve used both swing and swt although never in the same application project before

653985
swt	swing
however trying to mix swt and swing within a single window would likely never work or at the very least cause lots of problems since both widget sets rely on completely different means of drawing layout - swing s components are all handled directly within java and are completely separated from the underlying os while swt explicitly relies on the underlying os to do all or most of the gui rendering

653985
swt	swing
swing and swt have two completely different philosophies and underlying architectures

653985
swt	swing
in fact swt was born from the fact that ibm oti did not like the approach that was taken with swing and so chose to implement their own widgets

654035
inline	inlining
but it can t simply inline g without inlining f because f might be called from other places as well where it is passed a different function pointer

654049
int	double
my reason for that is that this call does not explicitly contain the type of the argument so if later on you decide to change it from int to double there is no need to modify this call

654072
int	double
my reason for that is that this call explicitly contains the type of the argument so if later on you decide to change it from int to double it is clear that this call has changed

654099
httpresponse	request

int	chars
nothing worse then tracing a bunch of super classes for an int or chars

654666
put	get
i m no fan at all of absolute positioning but i have seen web developers use it to get better search result because they can easily put the most important text part at the start of the html and use absolute positioning to position it where it actually belongs

folder	directory
be sure to check that the plugins directory is correct -- in drupal the plugins folder is different than a default fck install

654754
free	malloc
in some obvious cases like when malloc is called inside a loop or part of a thread execution it s very important to free so there are no memory leaks

654754
free	malloc
for this kind of program it doesn t make sense to ever free after calling malloc because these variables must be present at all times during the program s execution and there s no good way that i can see to implement this with statically allocated space

654773
free	malloc
malloc allocates the memory from the memory area called the heap and the complete heap of a process is free when the process exits

654782

you could start programming fpgas in vhdl verilog system c .

654783
free	malloc
if you re writing anything else though -- a server long-running application or a library to be used by someone else you should expect to call free on everything you malloc

654783
free	malloc
ignoring the pragmatic side for a second it s much safer to follow the stricter approach and force yourself to free everything you malloc

654799
postgresql	mysql
weblocks can use cl-sql as a backend store which can connect to many different rdbms mysql postgresql oracle odbc sqlite

654837
google-chrome	firefox
rendering on both google-chrome and firefox

654848
hide	show
php tags hide the whole tag-enclosed php source output in the browser but view source show them

654862
ienumerable	ienumerator
it definitely doesn t seem as straight forward as say c# where you just implement ienumerable and ienumerator or just using the generic collection

654872
cpu	affinity
we limited the cpu affinity so we can actually use the server when the high load hits

654883
listboxitem	textbox
it s not a simple property but you can handle the gotfocus event on your textbox then use visualtreehelper to find the listboxitem and select it

654927
versioning	upgrade
to manually run the sql portion of the upgrade you ll need to run each upgrade script between your versioning and 4.9.2

654947
post	put
besides what i have said before that do not add to what others already answered i wanted to put some focus on other types of functions that you comment in your post as comparison operators and the like

654947
serializable	deserialization
the same goes for transformations to from network serializable and deserialization

654968
codeigniter	cakephp	codeigniter	yii	cakephp	yii
as for the server side php part i would certainly try to taylor it to my needs but if i had to choose a framework i would go for yii codeigniter or cakephp depending of your scalability needs

655051
tiff	png
jpdfimages is a 100 java library that can convert pdf to images in tiff jpeg or png formats and maybe jbig

655137
hash	salt
to clarify i can t store hash of the password or salt them or anything

655149
jobs	cron
i know how to set up cron jobs i just don t know how to make scripting conditional like that

655176
filtering	grouping
i can t think of a slick way to do this but you could index on branch_id add an fkinternalcalc boolean field to your dataset then initialize that field to true on the first row of each branch using grouping state or manually and then filtering the clone on the value of the field

655300
subtract	add
the kewl part of two s complement is that the machine language add and subtract instructions can ignore all that and just do binary arithmetic and it just works.

655316
singleton	facade
now i get xml string from domain via facade domain entities implement ixmlserializable loading and caching a static collection of xslcompiledtransforms from disc as a singleton and a controller as a httphandler who rules the logic of request processing and has an access to the previous classes and cached pages

655338
int	double
you can convert a double to a long so if you converted your double values to long int in a separate program and output the constant values you could then use them in your program

655341
spyware	antivirus
setup - advanced firewall setup - antivirus anti spyware - web access protection - http - webbrowsers

655375
accessor	properties
the accessor are designed so that you can add properties specific logic

655375
getter	setter
so you would always want to access that field through the getter and setter and that way you can always be certain that the value will never get greater than 360

655423
int	chars
casting to int will make it print as an int value instead of as a chars

655427
children	parent
a parent node can have many children

655494
table-per-subclass	fluent
is it possible to mix table-per-class-hierarchy with table-per-subclass using fluent nhibernate

655516
children	parent
the second is to make it a parent class and implement the different lines in a method of your children

655526
ubuntu	debian
there is a tiny program called wmctrl available at least in debian ubuntu it is in standard distribution which is able to perform many operations on windows and desktops and handles plenty of window managers

655537
division	multiplication
should i use multiplication or division

655562
firefox	safari
when there is a textfield that is focused whenever the page loads or refreshes safari tries to keep the textfield inside the display area unlike firefox or ie

655564
multiplying	multiplication
if you re dividing or multiplying by a variable then it s likely that multiplication is slightly faster because the logic is generally more simple

655572
post	get
see an example here this one uses get so you can use either get or post just make sure you pass in your parameters

655581
division	multiplication
division algorithms are slower than multiplication algorithms in most cases

655581
cpu	processors
the reason for that is that a multiplication can be blindly converted to shift and add operations on the processors which are the most optimized operations on a cpu

655581
multiplying	division
you d get a substantial non-negligible improvement if you compute all your inverses in advance and use them to multiplying in a division intensive program

655584
division	multiplication
which one is faster is indeed a cpu-specific issue or at least how much faster is cpu specific yes division is typically seen as slower than multiplication

655590
put	get
and i know the xsl basically works because if i intentionally put an invalid attribute in i get a parser error

655596
free	malloc
1 use std vector instead of malloc free and new delete

655610
range	minimum
for that you will probably want to store either just the minimum or the maximum item depending on how your range works

655610
division	modulo
you may also need to write a function to reduce any given integer to it s corresponding stored key value hint use integer division or the modulo

655621
mvp	presenter
i don t usually do it like this since i use mvp and this view would only have code to get the user info in the controls with a class defined elsewhere and forward of the events to the presenter

655798
stdout	stderr
here is a script that saves redirects and restores stdout and stderr using various methods

655811
disk	ram
this however doesn t seem to be straightforward in the case of flightgear the flightgear hardware recommendations read opengl-based hardware acceleration 256 mb dedicated graphics memory 1-2 ghz cpu 512-1024 mb ram 400-500 mb disk space

655811
joystick	keyboard	mouse	keyboard	mouse	joystick
in addition just being able to technically compile and run with acceptable performance framerates the code would still not be enough from a usability point of view flightgear is a flight simulator designed for use on personal computers with certain peripherals present - in other words it basically relies on a keyboard and mouse as well as other input hardware joystick pedals

655811
playstation	wii
in fact most of the re-engineering required would not be specific to just one device but would generally be useful for all efforts related to porting flightgear to non-pc platforms no matter if it s nintendo wii sony playstation apple iphone .

655831
profiling	debugging
the debugging consists of turning on sql profiling and running the application

655943
gridview	sqldatasource
the gridview does this in conjunction with data source controls like the sqldatasource control

655958
post	get
3 imho using method get would be more restful for a method called getclientjson than method post

655986
cvs	svn
structure should not interfere with normal usage of cvs svn and other version

655994
textview	imageview
in the mean-time i ve worked around this by dropping the imageview inside another linearlayout and dropping an empty textview to its right that takes up the rest of the horizontal space

656001
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
much easier to use flash as it works with all modern browsers safari ie firefox and opera

656028
getter	setter
all you need to do is once you have the type is to create little stacks for the getter and setter of properties and those you can collect via walking the property tree of the type and its properties breadth first limiting the depths to a specified number of levels and removing circular references depending on your data structures

656036
satellite	altitude
similarly you can t launch an object into orbit from the surface you have to have something like a last rocket burn once the satellite reaches the desired altitude

656040
postgresql	mysql
ms sql server mysql oracle postgresql

656055
x86	mips
i know x86 assembly and have worked with fpga etc never wrote for a risc i have the opportunity to take a course in mips

656060
vmware	esx
i have an older server retired database box in fact that doesn t fit the requirements for vmware esx esxi or microsoft s hyper-v but runs vmware server 2 just fine

656063
cos	sin
this probably won t affect you since you re just taking the sin cos of the resulting angle

656063
cos	sin
times when the result is the same very time and taking 4 sin s and 4 cos s

656093
hex	binary
do you need to use hex binary

656118
hide	show
it s very easy to use javascript to detect when the form was submitted and then hide the elements you need to hide and show the success message

656137
post	get
person clicks submit and form data gets sent server side via get or post

656137
submit	submission
person clicks submit and javascript submit form data to server side via ajax and removes the form elements to then add thanks for submission

656155
next	except
what can you do with next iterator that you can t do with iterator.next and an except clause to handle the stopiteration

656214
mouse	keyboard
when recording you can t use your mouse to select anything so you have to use you keyboard to select the picture and then use the menu options to manipulate it

656279
mouse	keyboard
if you minimize a window which was in the background and in full screen then you can see the contour of our ghost app - you can move it around it will respond to keyboard mouse input just fine

656281
x86	mips
however if it is just mips programming and you already have a handle on x86 assembly and the concepts of low level programming i would say pass on the class

656315
put	get
if you made method.m a subfunction in the larger code calling it or if it s possible to put it in a private directory where it can be called by every function that needs to call it then it may get called instead of the java method when you use the method object ... syntax

656377
entity-relationship	diagram
it s the only conceptual modeling tool available for relational data the others - erwin and its ilk - being at best logical modeling tools with nothing much better than entity-relationship diagram and ddl synchrnoization which are also provided by object role modeling tools

656393
mockups	prototyping
you can use paper to do this or more sophisticated mockups using xhtml css and javascript or a dedicated prototyping program

656463
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
firefox google-chrome opera etc

656501
getter	setter
jython automagically translates getter setter into public properties so that

656510
button	checkbox	checkbox	dropdownlistfor
make sure you include validation capabilities for non-textbox related fields such as dropdownlistfor radio button checkbox etc

656518
stdout	fflush
use fflush stdout

656524
post	get
where is a good location to get useful feedback without being persecuted for the post being unrelated to the site s purpose

656559
keystore	jks
command summary - to create jks keystore

656559
keystore	jks	pem	pkcs#12
command summary - to convert jks keystore into pkcs#12 keystore then into pem file

656559
keystore	jks
if you have more than one certificate in your jks keystore and you want to only export the certificate and key associated with one of the aliases you can use the following variation

656559
keystore	jks
command summary - to compare jks keystore to pem file

656586
distance	altitude
maybe i m wrong about this but if i remember my physics right and if the distance between the two points is relatively small compared to the earth s radius aside from altitude the path will just follow a great circle

656586
projectile	angle
where gamma the angle along the great circle arc followed by the projectile

656597
inherited	properties
and classes which implement that interface will inherited its properties without having to re-declare them

656597
getter	setter
the interface simply says implementor will have a string name with getter and setter

656602
postgresql	mysql
if you are thinking of some sort of web app i d say either mysql or postgresql as these will provide better performance and be able to handle a large data set more naturally

656616
public	protected
you couldn t declare scope constraints on interfaces public private protected internal as that is an implementation detail

656616
inherited	properties
first problem that we need to tackle is the fact that interfaces don t allow access delimiters in its implementation what would happen is that the properties would inherited the default access delimiter which is private

656616
getter	setter
in an interface the property definition will indicate that the method signatures for the getter and or setter methods will be available for all classes implementing that interface

656620
put	get
so far my experience has been similar to the resume effect if someone doesn t put the effort into spell checking their resume they probably won t get the job.

656631
bitblt	gdi
the lowlevel bitblt gdi calls are likely to be way more efficient that anything you can do

656706
range	minimum
because this can potentially be run on a wide range of computers with varying levels of patches and updates i m steering well clear of .net and anything that isn t native - the tool should just run without the user having to install anything extra well i will say windows xp no service packs is the bare minimum required version of windows

656712
nsapplication	nsrunloop
you need to invoke - nsapplication run instead of - nsrunloop currentrunloop run

656716
min	max	minimum	max
if the user enters a maximum and a minimum for example don t just check the two values independently against their legal max and min but also check them against each other to ensure that the values entered are logically consistent

656745
for-loop	loops
is this correct for a for-loop with a while loops inside

656882
unix	aix
i will be using this on an aix unix box

656883
hide	show
the vs dsls have bad visual performance large diagrams you need fold the model elements away hide show

656914
exploratory	metrics
the reason for this is that the exploratory nature of drill-down across etc can lead to users not understanding how a metrics can change when they have merely asked for more information on it

656919
hide	show
has a navigation that works fine on the main page but due to me making a mistake does not work on the sub pages as it relies on images being loaded and then switching their hide show properties

656933
werkzeug	pyro
i think i ll look at both pyro and the web.py werkzeug approaches since twisted is a little more than i want to bite off at this point

656945
switching	screens
have you considered the simple expedient of creating a custom terminfo or termcap entry lacking a sequence to clear the screens and then switching your terminal setting to that right before running your program

656983
multiplying	multiplication
there are lots of well-known ways to parallelise matrix multiplication essentially multiplying various-sized sub-matrices and then combining the results and shift layout so that the access patterns have reasonable cache locality by organizing the data around space-filling curves instead of row column arrangements

656987
sproutcore	cappuccino
cappuccino or sproutcore

657007
innodb	myisam
berkeley db is going away very soon in mysql so if you re using it i d recommend you shift to innodb or at the very least myisam

657010
integer	fractions
start by splitting the number into an integer and fractions part

657010
integer	fractions
for the fractions part repeatedly multiply by 60 and take the integer part to get the result digits

657026
lisp	smalltalk
hip counts when you want to get future colleagues excited about what you ve done when they haven t done it. i d venture that it s at least as eye-opening as something based on lisp or smalltalk or haskell but probably more practical because you may actually end up using it at a job or for contract work

657064
gridview	detailsview
i am using gridview and detailsview for insert update edit a truckmaster table

657070
bids	ssis
but when i run the ssis package in bids it executed successfully..

folder	directory
my code directory at work is organized in folder and subfolders and subsubfolders all of which at least in theory contain scripts or programs i want to run on a regular basis

657150
versioning	upgrade
to try a new versioning we upgrade our own versioning of a module before doing that upgrade on the production server

657211
post	get
as for the cleanup code i will post that when i get to work tomorrow i don t have the code with me but it s very boilerplate

657211
post	get
i will post an example when i get back from my meeting.

657215
range	max
you have a constraint on the max value of y and a general idea of what you want the curve to look like somewhat bell-shaped y 0 at the edges of the x range y 5 when x 5

657221
folder	directory
if i correctly understand your question the only working setup that i could imagine is to take the approach you mention host headers to point but c inetpub wwwroot myapp mysubapp without using a redirect and include the main app s dlls in your sub folder s bin directory

657232
postgresql	mysql
currently i think a lot of providers are available for ado.net entity framework provider for postgresql mysql esql oracle and many other check

657352
tapestry	wicket	tapestry	stripes	wicket	stripes
wicket and apache tapestry are both component oriented web framework s - contrary to action based frameworks like stripes - by the apache foundation

657358
int	chars
the way you have written the chars is totally wrong you are writing the chars representation of the int

657400
width	height
i have set this up so the side columns are fixed width the header footer are fixed height

657479
yacc	bison
lex and yacc or rather flex and bison are powerful tools that will help you generate parsers for regular languages with ease

657497
superclass	subclassing
subclassing person twice once for receiver and once for sender and only put the xmlrootelement on these subclassses leaving the superclass person without an xmlrootelement

657502
spaces	delimiter
so lets take rm and the example rm -rf - the shell is going to turn into a spaces delimiter list of files which in turn becomes the arguments to rm

657513
yacc	bison
lex yacc or flex bison

657517
keydown	keyup
each game on the stack has the same methods handleuserevent keydown keyup mousepressed mousereleased mousemotion update internal calculations before rendering draw rendering prepare optimize rendering by caching something in a texture that s just stamped on the target surface in draw

657541
getter	setter
1 where do we call a bean in struts what is the exact line through which we call the bean and from which file and how the getter and setter methods are called

657574
post	get	post	put	put	get
http over tcp has the verbs get put post amongst others

657574
post	put
only two actually write something put post

657574
post	put
and the above are only recommendations for how put post are implemented

657600
rss	feed
i have successfully created a simple rss feed but entries keep coming back as unread and updated and entries deleted from the client reappear everytime i ask mail to update the feed

657600
rss	feed
i use this simple function to create an rss feed

657643
rss	feed
i am creating a rss feed file for my application in which i want to remove html tags which is done by strip_tags

657672
mouse	keyboard
i want to select or highlight a block in emacs without mouse but from the keyboard

657702
post	get
your client simply uses urllib2 to make post or get requests to localhost someport

657792
internationalization	localization
i realize that the method to do these conversions is quite simple however when you factor in internationalization and localization support this becomes less trivial

657815
google-chrome	firefox
here is the bug report for google-chrome which has the same problem as firefox

657834
post	get
make a head rather than get or post request to just get the response headers this should include the content-length header with the information you need

657923
put	get
you can put garbage inside to see if the default execution get executed and if it does make one of the executions a default

657955
rtp	rtsp
jmf 2.1.1 provides rtp rtsp

657966
opera	safari	hide	show
in ie safari opera on a windows machine the images on this page are only loaded once monitored with freemeter when the show and hide buttons are toggled

657966
hide	show
looking into about cache most of the images loaded appear to be listed there although inspecting the cache between hide show clicks there appears to be missing images

657987
inherited	subclassing
however joshua bloch in his famous book effective java gives the following advice design and document for inherited or else prohibit it and encourages programmers to use the final modifier to prohibit subclassing

657991
hide	show
instead of building the html string over and over again and completely removing these img elements from the dom why not just build it once with an outer container div and show hide the div

657997
tabcontrol	tabitem
so the behavior is sort of like the tabcontrol but without the tabstrip the chrome and the tabitem instances

657999
width	height
i know that in xaml wpf i can set the window size using the width and height properties but suppose i want to set the window size such that the client area minus the windows borders decorations will be a certain fixed size what is the easiest way to do that

658020
button	checkbox
in swing you have ridiculous inheritance where iirc button extends checkbox or the other way around giving one of them behaviour that isn t used i think it s its the setdisabled call on checkbox

658034
mouse	keyboard
you could hook the changed event and set the value back to your desired value if different -- this way you ll cover any cause for change via mouse or keyboard

658059
width	height
it may or may not be related to the width and height i have a very very large width and height defined something like 5000 by 2500

658094
disk	ram
if one computer has more ram than another that can make a huge difference in speed because it won t have to swap to disk as often

658170
accessor	properties
the properties flagthingy.ismodified cannot be set because it does not have an accessible set accessor

658177
tapestry	wicket
wicket forces markup code separation tapestry 5 just give you this ability

658177
tapestry	wicket
wicket s core is easier to debug user components are based on inheritance while tapestry 5 user components are based on annotations

658177
tapestry	wicket
from the other side that could make transitions to the future versions easier for tapestry then for wicket

658182
hash	md5
tip if you are going to store the hash in the database a md5 hash is always 16 bytes so can be saved in a uniqueidentifier column and system.guid in .net

658234
many-to-many	one-to-many
has_many through on the other hand is meant for indirect one-to-many relationships or many-to-many relationships with properties

658252
put	get
i think it s easy to get heated about something like this but when you put emotion aside i don t believe it is a complicated issue

658322
put	get
get another server of identical specs 1x quadcore 4gig and put the new vms on there

658347
vmware	esx
that said it may be worth your time to upgrade from vmware server to vmware esx or the more competitively priced vmware esxi free

658350
uielement	adorner
but i ve been reading about uielement classes and adorner and want to make sure i m doing things the right way

658361
inherited	properties
is it possible to only expose the serviceobject with inherited properties from enterpriseobject in the serialization

658384
put	get
perhaps this has improved since sql server 2000 and someone with more familiarity with the newer versions can tell you whether it is now safe to get in the water but until i had confirmation of this and had checked it out myself with a test i wouldn t put it on my production system

658388
inherited	properties
if i understand correctly you want to expose serviceobject to clients including all its properties that are marked as a datamember including properties inherited from enterpriseobject

658425
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
fails for me in firefox 3 opera and safari

658530

doc	rtf
we use help manual - its a wonderful tool outputting almost any format of stuff you could want doc rtf html pdf - all from the same source

658571
int	chars
edit employee number should be stored at the very least as varchar 10 assuming that it can accept non numeric chars or as an int if it is an actual number as it is assumed to be

658630
scons	qmake
there are better build systems out there - cmake scons for c c++ qmake for qt ant for java nant and msbuild for .net and so on

658631
trie	dawg
a dawg has roughly the same performance as a trie but will be more space efficient

658654
udp	tcp
why does the udp protocol not support streams like tcp protocol does

658672
udp	tcp
many applications end up re-implementing parts of tcp on udp to get the particular mixture of latency order independence error handling and bandwidth that they need

658684
vb.net	vb6
copy and paste and fix the compiler errors works fairly well between vb6 and vb.net

658702
mouse	keyboard
so this is a cryptographically secure random source based on unpredictable input from such things as the arbitrary timings of ethernet packets keyboard and mouse input etc

658773
ant	maven
ivy for example has an ant task that will import artifacts from a maven repository and publish them to you own ivy repository

658803
udp	tcp
making udp work as a stream would mean adding almost every feature that tcp has

658804
javassist	cglib
1 of either javassist or cglib jars

658821
system.data.oracleclient	odp.net
there are different data providers for combining .net and oracle odp.net devart s provider and a provider from microsoft system.data.oracleclient

658950
put	get
take off as much work in the priority order the business pm has put them in as you think you can for sure get done

658952
xargs	zcat
this says to find files that end in .gz and write their names with a nul terminator the 0 in -print0 pipe that output through xargs which will pick the list apart based on nul chacracters the -0 arg and run zcat on the files

659028
pop-up	dialog
now i thought i could kinda stream this contents to the user first by opening a standard dialog box the box that pop-up when you attempt download something from internet with options like open save cancel and then asking the user to save it somewhere

659064
for-loop	arrays
i can print the contents using a for-loop and using an arrays

659103
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
the pages look fine in firefox opera safari and ie 8 but my client who is using ie7 is complaining of layout problems in ie 7

659141
icmp	udp
since you are using udp which uses ports it is possible the network stack is routing the icmp message back to the original socket

659141
icmp	udp
i imagine udp eats the icmp message

659141
icmp	udp
if i am correct one solution to this is to open a raw socket and manually create your udp packets listen for the anything coming back and handle udp and icmp messages as appropriate

659158
post	get
if i m reading the mvp s post correctly on a 32-bit system you re limited to 1.5gb heap size no matter what of which you get all as soon as the process starts

659248
udp	tcp	icmp	tcp	icmp	udp
take a look at this app that uses windows ipfiltdrv.sys to trap packets icmp tcp udp etc and read play with them with managed code c#

659252
pop-up	dialog
a dialog pop-up that will allow you to convert paths to relative and specify that newly added files always use relative paths

659266
put	get
i know cout and printf have buffer today and it is said that the buffer is some like a stack and get the output of cout and printf from right to left then put them out to the console or file from top to bottem

659266
g++	gcc
under g++ gcc 3.4.2 mingw-special the output is

659270
free	malloc
why would it be different from malloc and free

659276
restructuredtext	textile
i know of three main languages used commonly in the greater programming and tech community textile markdown and restructuredtext

659278

int	chars
type such as chars or int can be

659281

google-chrome	firefox
in mozilla firefox and google-chrome it looks all right

659382
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome look

659400
pop-up	dialog
if they do i think windows pop-up a low disk space dialog that gives them the option to clear their temp directory which would solve the problem

659473
int	chars
there was a desire that for built-in types chars int float etc the following would be valid for c++

659473
free	malloc
the reason malloc free do not have this problem is that they simply deal with blocks of memory and do not have to worry about calling constructors destructors

659482
vbscript	jscript
how to debug windows script host vbscript and jscript files

659657

659888
children	parent
in this case you have a parent with multiple children

659888
children	parent
parent forks a number of children

659888
children	parent
the parent has a little bit of fancy footwork in spawning all the children and retaining the pipes properly but it s not too bad

659889
free	malloc
allocate a buffer with malloc and remember to free it afterward in the caller

659897

valgrind	gprof
gdb valgrind gprof

659937
junit	mockito
junit and mockito are probably used most in my daily work though not limited to debugging

659938
free	malloc
malloc is an option but forcing the caller to free the memory that a callee allocated can leave open issues of ownership and removes the possibility of using anything but heap memory for the buffer

659950
post	get
i ve found some other post and blogs out there with people who feel the same way i do but the developers of zend made this choice for a reason and other people seem to use it without issue so i wanted to get some feedback from the community here

659953

660044
16-bit	64bit
there is enough address space that you can create up to 2 40 unique unicast ranges each with 16-bit of subnet and 64bit of host id

udp	tcp	sctp	tcp	sctp	udp
protocols such as udp tcp and sctp already work on top of it

660080
hash	salt	hash	md5	salt	md5
but none of this is relevant to validate the data for database insertion because you aren t going to store plain-text passwords - you re going to store a hash of them in some way md5 md5 + salt whatever

660080
hash	md5
instead you might make sure that you have a 32 character hexadecimal string so that it is very likely to be a properly created md5 hash

660131
freebsd	linux
i imagine that a tool like this must exist for linux or freebsd too

660134
vim	emacs
perhaps someone has already done this for the hyper-programmable editors like vim and emacs

660167
httpwebrequest	ftpwebrequest
here request is of type ftpwebrequest but it s confusing because it looks like it was created from an httpwebrequest a sibling class even though the create method is actually defined on webrequest the base class

660174

in my page_load event i would check the ispostback property to make sure that it is actually a post and not get

660284
filtering	grouping
most operations that you call on u.group will affect the entire grouping table with the possibility that it first filtering down to objects related to u

660285
int	chars
you could just as well say foo 0 98 but you re using an int when you really mean a chars

660304
photoshop	paint.net
any code that can run on windows c# vb.net preferably even help how to use scriptable programs like paint.net or photoshop would be accepted

660317
public	protected
my best guess is that you have to map your subclasses to the data they need and make public protected setter s on your baseclass to map these too

660329
post	get
i have an application that supplies long list of parameters to a web page so i have to use post instead of get

660358
erd	diagram
is there any way to take an exisiting codebase and create object relationship diagram or entity relationship diagram erd s

regerding your question you could try to override dependency checking by downloading rpm of the required package an doing rpm -i --force file.rpm since yum does not have any option for forced installations

660464
next	except
i am fairly new at this stuff but i seem to be having a problem googling a solution - i could use the except function but the records for the individuals members are not necessarily the same from one table to next - just the memberid may be the same

660566
equals	gethashcode
why is it important to override gethashcode when equals method is overridden

660566
equals	gethashcode
in c# what specifically can go wrong if one fails to override gethashcode when overriding equals

660584
equals	gethashcode
the reason being is that the implementation uses both gethashcode and equals to properly find a value in the table

660584
equals	gethashcode
failing to keep gethashcode and equals in sync will completely break this algorithm and numerous others

660587
equals	gethashcode
as it is documented that gethashcode must return the same value if two instances are equals then it is the prerogative of any code which wishes to test them for equality to use gethashcode as a first pass to group objects which may be equals as it knows that objects with different hash codes cannot be equals

660587
equals	gethashcode
if your gethashcode method returns different values for equals objects then they may get into different groups in the first pass and never be compared using their equals method

660587
equals	gethashcode
in short always override gethashcode when you override equals and ensure their implementations are consistent

660591
equals	gethashcode
if you always put things in the bucket corresponding to their gethashcode then you only have to search one bucket using equals to see if something is there

660591
equals	gethashcode
so the rule is if equals says two objects are equals they must have the same gethashcode

660596
put	get
if we would put everything into one clause that clear semantic could be broken - not to mention that when we put the definition into the class again all of a sudden the template would get its own clause

660613
glut	sdl
i would like to use the built in libraries in order to do this and not something like sdl sdl_showcursor 0 or glut glutsetcursor glut_cursor_none

661104
opera	safari
my specific browser requirements are ff3+ ie7+ safari 3+ and opera 9+

661115
folder	directory
a .class file in the appropriate folder depending on its package under the bin directory should do it

661143
folder	directory
therefore if you wish to have the compiler access com.stackoverflow.example.class present in the classes directory under project a but not in the build path of project a then you should add classes as a class folder and not classes com stackoverflow as a class folder

661145
for-loop	loops
however i have noticed that the results being written to the table seem to overlap or get mixed up i.e say i call the api at loops counter 10 the result for-loop counter 10 may appear in the table beside the value for-loop counter 15

661155

661226
pthreads	fork
i have come across so much code lately that uses threads which really should not its obvious that someone just wanted to profess their undying love of pthreads when a single yes just one fork would have done the job

661254
min	max
the simple way to do this is to compute the heuristic value for each leaf and then sweep up and compute the min max

661254
min	max
my first â œsolutionâ to that was to push the min max up after each leaf is computed

661288
folder	directory
i am doing a file transfer application so as soon as a new file folder is added to the monitored directory i will execute my c# code to other some other operations

661289
int	chars
the method that i thought was to convert the string to int using parsing and splitting each chars using modulus or something and performing operations on them

661298
int	chars
try converting the string to a chars array and then subtract 0 from the chars values to retrieve an int value

661382

661568
lisp	scheme
emacs lisp uses dynamic binding and languages like scheme and common lisp are using lexical binding

661591
getter	setter
the preferred thing to do is often to add methods called getter and setter to the class owning the array or make it available by some other more structural means which depend on the exact semantics and usage of the array

661652
ssl	https
you mentioned using https http over ssl - that prevents others from being able to read information in transit or impersonate the server so it s very handy for preventing plain text transmission of the password or other important information

661656
x86	64bit
i got the same error when trying to run a 64bit dll with nunit that was set to work as an x86 assembly using corflags

textarea	textbox
i think textarea is only displayed after it gets a textbox there to append.

661874
accessor	properties	getter	setter
the login controller s properties should have at least a getter and setter which you can synthesize but you can implement more specific accessor methods for efficiency

661904
ienumerable	ilist

662280
rss	feed
my main concern here is that i want to create an rss feed to use with the live bookmarks feature in many browsers but be able to maintain the directory feel

662295
dmz	was
so you would have the child company calling functions on an appropriately configured web service see above which was in the dmz for your core domain

the function getpagedimensions of cam pdf returns same values for both portrait and landscape pages

662605
children	parent
this said funfx doesn t appear to contain functions which allow users to access children via their parent objects or parent.children for iteration

662605
children	parent
i see methods which return the number of children beneath a parent but i don t see any iteration functionality which would allow me to parse the hierarchical structure

662639
pull	push
i don t necessarily need to do any form of validation on the messages themselves i just need to pull push data

kerberos	ntlm
i wonder if this is the double-hop issue and that your code is trying to access the resource as the impersonated user but that fails because ntlm will not impersonate to another server kerberos would

663025
width	height
is it possible to get the image height and width from my vb.net code inside my asp.net

663038
width	height
sounds like you want 2 more fields in your database height and width

663045
xslt	xquery
if storing your data in xml format is important for you since you work with xml maybe it has more sense to use a xml native database such as exist which lets you access and transform your xml data in a xml-friendly way xslt xquery xpath

663046
width	height
i would save the height and width of the image in separate columns when you save the image to the database intially

663046
width	height
then when you do your select statement to read the image out of the database you can also access the height and width fields from the database

663046
width	height
alternatively you can access the height and width information when you load the image out of the database and then set the height and width properties before assigning the image to the picture box

663054
stdout	stderr
close_fds is supported on windows search for close_fds after that link starting with python 2.6 if stdin stdout stderr are not redirected

663054
stdout	stderr
redirect the standard handles by setting stdin stdout or stderr

663054
stdout	stderr
so you can either subprocess.call with and not setting stdin stdout or stderr the default or setting them to none

663062
free	malloc
i think that using a separate thread is probably not the best safest or fastest way -- my guess is you d be better off using a type of incremental copying allocator where on each malloc or free you compact copy forwards or backwards in memory some number of allocated blocks with the number of bytes that you copy depleting a budget that is periodically reset to its initial value on each screen refresh

663062
free	malloc
if there s enough time in the budget a call to malloc or free will completely defragment memory otherwise it will defragment it as much as possible in the given the time constraints

663062
free	malloc
the important thing is to avoid oscillations the same block being moved forwards then backwards on successive calls to malloc or free

663086
width	height
you can get the height and width but you are going to have to load the whole image into memory using the system.drawing.image library each time you need that info

663125
listview	gridview
the previous data option only works with a listview and only if you don t have a gridview associated with it

mouseleave	mouseenter
try to call stoppropagation on your events or use an alternative event that stops propagation by default like mouseenter mouseleave or hover over out

663344
mouseover	mouseout
finally just for simplicity use hover rather than mouseover mouseout

pop-up	dialog
if the user s membership is going to expire within 30 days and the button is clicked i want the jquery dialog to pop-up

663743
pop-up	dialog
what should happen is that when the user clicks the sign-in button it should pop-up up the dialog only if the days they have left to expire is 30 and if they do they have the option of clicking the link in the dialog and going to a renew page where i want to pass it a session variable with a profile but that is not being called so i guess i would like to know is how can i add the event handler of the button to the dialog and is there a way to set it so that it only comes up once for example adding a cookie to the users browser and only showing it if they don t have a cookie set

both queries use a temporary table to store results but the difference is that union applies distinct to the result set which incurs an additional un-indexed sort

664485

you can hack this using the cross join statement or some slef joins but it will get slow with any large data sets so probably best done in a post query processor

have the timer pop-up a dialog indicating that the session is about to expire and let the user have the opportunity to renew it send back an ajax request to refresh the session timer

668156
g++	gcc
gcc supports so there is a good bet that g++ will as well

668173
quicksort	heapsort
if you re worried about performance you could use one of the sorting algorithms that works well with data that s almost already sorted not quicksort - merge or heapsort come to mind

668252
nsmutablestring	nsstring
nsstring objects are immutable they can t be changed but there is a mutable subclass nsmutablestring that gives you several methods for replacing characters within a string

668295
pascal	delphi
in c it will be a #pragma and in delphi pascal it s o- o+ around the code in question

668295
cpu	hyperthreading
cases where it does are generally where one is compiling against some old legacy code that was built before a later development in cpu technology - hyperthreading being a classic case in point

668311
nsurlcache	nsurlconnection
for anyone interested in seeing an example of this the apple sample application nsurlcache implements a simple delegate around an nsurlconnection in nsurlcacheconnection.m

668380

does anyone know how to natively get the max allowed file size for a given drive folder directory

668433
filesystems	fat	filesystems	ntfs
how about using system.info.driveinfo.driveformat to retrieve the drive s filesystems ntfs fat ect.

668497
nsstring	nsdata
my best guess is that you re accidentally passing in the raw nsdata instead of an nsstring â but failing that the above code should either work correctly or show exactly where things are breaking down

668510
ffmpeg	libavformat
i ve done some work with ffmpeg though it was limited to libavformat the codec part is called libavcodec

668543
rss	feed
i have a function to build a rss feed with php

668553
innodb	myisam
this may not be such a hardship since fulltext only works on myisam tables and you don t typically want your canonical data in myisam tables you can keep the definitive copy of your data in properly normalised innodb tables with an additional myisam table containing only stripped and stemmed search-bait

668572
g++	gcc
edit from your recent edits to your question you appear to be trying to link the sun compiler s f77 with the gcc g++

668576
ubuntu	linux
i m a kid on a linux pc ubuntu in case your wondering

668576
g++	gcc
so my question is using the gcc g++ compiler is objective-c garbage collected

668588
implements	extends
i believe you can extends the simplexml class and implements the arrayaccess in that

668639
public	protected
if the error you get is saying that the onstructor is not visible then it s talking about visibility in java public provate protected and package

668658
int	boolean
the bitwise version is deterministic and as a bonus can do 32 times as much work in a 32-bit int than the boolean version

668720
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
in firefox google-chrome safari trying to use the input element s setselectionrange sets the cursor in the right position but the text is not shifted so that i see its end but instead the beginning

668777
submit	submission
basically i create a submission form that allows users to submit vehicle information

668788
put	get
i usually get around this by taking the source of the library and adding it to my project but i am trying to put the gdata client library

668802
width	height
num bytes width height bytes per pixel overhead fudge factor

668817
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
a lot of browsers ie firefox safari maybe google-chrome will handle it just fine

668820
rss	feed
i think the code below is a pretty good approach for aggregating xml documents aggregate sitemaps in this case - although this can easily be adapted for atom or rss feed

668851
rss	feed
i m creating an rss and or atom feed for my website

668851
rss	feed
use the same templating system i use to generate the html clearsilver if anyone s wondering basically just treating the rss feed like any other web page that happens to be in rss+xml instead of xhtml

668851
rss	feed
use an xml library or an rss library specifically in my programming language of choice python to create the feed programmatically and then write it out

668851
rss	feed
but in this particular case all the values for the fields of the rss feed are already formatted as well-formed properly escaped xhtml.

668865
post	get
you could get a post install script for pretty much any package manager to run the click-through program if needed but i think it s better to run it as a per-user thing

668916
ftp	telnet
i m not sure i understand your comment on using ftp to log in and monitor log files - surely you d be logging in with telnet and its brethren rather than using ftp for that purpose

668920
post	get
i already know how to do this with post and get using javascript buttons but how do i get the same effect when i m working with html links

668936
hide	show
the submit button btnexpand has then an event-handler on the control which hide show the panel pnlcontent

668947
post	get

put	get
i m thinking of getting each candidate to put together a short pitch based on our ideas so i know they get what we re trying to acheive

668990
expression-blend	silverlight
you can perform the steps suggested above but be ready to get vs crashes after you will install silverlight 2.0 tools for visual studio or sometimes expression-blend

669000
nsurl	nsdata
imagedata nsdata alloc initwithcontentsofurl nsurl urlwithstring srcaddres

669049

but now i am getting errors as i can not add reference to data.sqlclient in global.asax and i need references to sqlconnection sqlcommand sqldatareader etc

669070
postgresql	mysql
however i d then still prefer a solid acid compliant database so i d go for any real database before going for mysql if you want to use free db s postgresql is a good alternative to mysql

669081
getter	setter
to increase readability i have introduced a data class named costcountingdata with readable getter and setter to all this properties

669156

php use when you might switch vendors i had instances when the development was done in apache and the live system was running lighttpd

669231
erd	diagram
erd diagram

669260
hide	show
there is no minimize - use hide and show

669265
google-chrome	firefox
this works perfectly in firefox 2 3 and google-chrome

669298
post	get
w3c http standard says that get is idempotent the same url get executed multiple times should always result in same response and consequently can be cached along the way while post is not and must reach the url target

669349
width	height
if i don t specify width height on the usercontrol it will be displayed as intended at runtime

669363
width	height
you can set the designwidth and designheight properties on the usercontrol to adjust the height and width of the control in the design view

669374
memcached	apc
i d go with option 6 only store userid and session specific stuff search criteria in his session and put the rest into apc xcache memcached if you re using multiple servers

669381
udp	tcp
despite client protocol name of tcp ip mssql uses udp for bitbanging

669382
tunnel	vpn
this is probably blocked either by the vpn tunnel or by a firewall on the server

669405
vb6	vba
jeremy i tried your code and it works fine although i used excel vba since i do not have vb6 installed

669512
jms	jta
this way you may find yourself rejecting technologies such as jsf jsp web services jms ejb jta osgi mda

669565
switching	screens
honestly i would ditch the sprite rendering object and switching to screens space quads

669691
width	height
however each sprite here has its own graphics object presumably with height and width relevant to the sprite

669717
cvs	svn
i just ran cvs co or svn co to get a copy of the tree in my working directory

669776
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
how to calculate the x and y element offset for the absolute relative positioned div for browsers ie6-ie8 firefox opera safari each of the browser has different model for this particular case

669802
cvs	svn
version control software like cvs or svn which use delta coding for storing the changes made to files use variants of the string edit distance algorithms to calculate the deltas

669843
hide	show
i would probably modify the current form and add div tags that show or hide through javascript based on a click somewhere

669857
textarea	textbox
a textbox control is rendered either as an an or a textarea depending on the textmode property

669873
put	get
you will avoid issues when someone put text in differ language than expected and you get

669875
min	max
you can restrict the number of times a pattern matches with min max

669878
unicode	ucs
i use the ucs unicode support

669879
salt	md5
password_hash md5 password + salt + user_name

669888
hash	salt
salt causes the same password to yield different hash and thwarts dictionary attacks where a hacker has pre-computed hash values for common passwords and built a reverse-lookup index so that they can quickly discover a password for a given hash

669888
des	aes
an initialization vector is used with block ciphers like des and aes in a feedback mode like cbc

669899

maven	m2e
you can effectively run any maven command including ones with profiles through the m2e plugin

669924
jquery	scriptaculous
it has noconflict method that allows you to easy migrate having both prototype scriptaculous and jquery library included

669924
jquery	scriptaculous
jquery is light weight especially in compare with scriptaculous

670068
addition	multiplication
one possible implementation of f would be similar to that given in the last example under the addition section any constant number of bit shifts left followed by a multiplication by a prime - you could even use successive primes on each iteration at no extra cost since they only need be generated once

670186
pull	push
publish your pu feature_name either ask people to pull or just push to a public server like github.

670190
twitter	myspace
it could be used to enable data access against hundreds of oauth-enabled data apis all over the web including those of google myspace twitter yahoo flickr etc

670193
queue	fifo
a real-world example would be a fifo queue

670250
put	get
i have been trying to figure out how to get redirect_to to use a put request but to no success

670278
versioning	upgrade
upgrade your framework versioning to .net 3.5 sp1

670304
post	get
you know how to use post and get aka html forms to pass data between pages

670304
post	get
now the thing to understand is that post get are ways to send data around between webpages -- between the browser and the server

670333
post	get
note the web service is all xml over http though i expect to have to use http get post and head eventually

670412
int	chars
use something chars int etc with same size as bool instead bool

670433
width	height
webkit browsers set the height and width property after the image is loaded

670450
postgresql	mysql
is there an application to reverse engineer an existing database in mysql and or postgresql

670472
postgresql	mysql
for both mysql and postgresql try toad data modeler

670472
postgresql	mysql
if you use the open-source diagram app dia there are several tools to generate dia diagrams from sql databases including mysql and postgresql

670477
jtextpane	jeditorpane
note jtextpane inherits its settext method from jeditorpane and its setcaretposition method from jtextcomponent which explains the links in the previous paragraph not going to the jtextpane javadoc page

670484
post	get
one of the answers there pointed to a blog post which describes how to get code like this

670511
rss	feed
craigslist has an rss feed and i wish to convert the feed to json format so that i can parse it

670528
installation	upgrade
installation directory or upgrade

670584
hide	show
although if you are doing the hide show with client side scripting they will not be persisted through the viewstate anyways

670599
int	chars
all the way down int and chars are objects and all the way up classes methods the browsers the ide itself are all objects

670663
wmv	asf
i have tried to play wmv asf file in html page but always windows media player is embedded in browser but flash media player is not embedded

670663
wmv	asf
i suspect it is because flash media player does not support wmv asf format so even if i explicitly assign application x-shockwave-flash value flash media player is not displayed

670663
wmv	asf
does flash media player support wmv asf file

670692
ruby-gnome2	shoes
i heard that ruby-gnome2 and shoes are the top most used desktop libraries for ruby

670713
translation	localization
so to answer your question generate the meta tags .resx files using visual studio and do the translation using some localization tool

670716
wmv	asf
it s not so much that flash doesn t support wmv asf

670716
wmv	asf
it s more the fact that wmv asf is not a flash movie so you can t pretend that it s one by putting it in the src attribute when you re using the application x-shockwave-flash type

670721
wmv	flv
flash doesn t accept wmv but uses flv mpeg-4

670727
squeak	visualworks
i m a smalltalk newbie and i m using cincom s visualworks at the moment but i d like to give squeak a try

670733
int	chars	int	boolean
this is i believe the main reason that boolean are implemented using int instead of chars

670738
put	get
there is a lot of discussion on this topic related to microsoft silverlight but as i understand it voice and camera inputs from the client side are not supported as of silverlight 2 though it may get put into silverlight 3

670770
apache	lighttpd
also running services like web servers apache lighttpd or mail servers exim sendmail ... could end up in different needs

670784
stdout	stderr
is it possible to redirect stdout and stderr to both the terminal output and to a program

670802
stdout	stderr
is it possible to redirect stdout and stderr to both the terminal output and to a program

670802
stdout	stderr
i m not sure how useful it is to combine stdout and stderr on the input to an editor but does omething like this do what you need

670897
pthreads	fork
under linux or pthreads type os using fork will cause the forked child to have copies of all the parent s file descriptors

670943
stdout	stderr
i suspect you would want to send the stdout stderr to a file and edit it there in which case you need

670943
stdout	stderr
the redirects stderr file handle 2 to go to the same place as stdout file handle 1 so that both of them end up in a single stream

670973
post	get
when i want to print all users with associated post count i get no surprise here a n+1 select problem as for each line it will create a select to get the post for the users

670975
boost	stl
more common usage would be binding std pair first and second when using in stl algorithms and boost on a map

670986
awt	swing
my language of preference for gui graphics programming is java so i tried making a prototype with awt because it s synchronous unlike swing

670988
lift	wicket
wicket s designer-friendly templating style see lift view

670993
getter	setter
the whole reason to have accessors getter and modifiers setter is to provide yourself with an extra level of indirection

670993
getter	setter
the extra level of indirection for getter setter also allow you to be able to change the data member that they encapsulate

670993
getter	setter
this is not the reason to use them but a nice side effect of using getter and setter is that you can set a breakpoint inside your modifier for example to see exactly when it is changed

670993
getter	setter
you could even provide getter setter for an object for the whole struct at once

671031
post	get
if you post the two plans or email em to me you ll get better answers about what s going on

671045
voip	rtp
voip protocols are good for streaming applications rtp and h.323

671062
g++	gcc
once i realised i was using sun rather than gcc i switched to compiling with cc gcc cc g++ and f95 f77

671078
pull	push
you would need to run a sql server database on the web server and then push the data from access to sql server or pull it from sql server

671119
google-chrome	firefox
also two browsers google-chrome ie firefox etc might work well too

671129
put	get
i would rather not put it in the application_start method since it does not always get called when debugging

671132
post	get
the two verbs in mainstream usage are get and post which i think everyone will recognize

671132
post	get	post	put	put	get
notice that we are using different http verbs get put post delete etc. to manipulate these resources and that the only knowledge we presume on the clients part is our media definition

671136
nstextview	nsbutton
maybe my best alternative is to have an nsbutton followed by an nstextview with the mousedown delegate function on it triggering the nsbutton state

671142
folder	directory
immediately i observed that a random directory was generated inside that folder

671144
folder	directory
your binary files will be on project folder build there you will have one directory for each of the possible options release debug and iphoneos iphonesimulator

671159
put	get
rest is using the various http methods mainly get put delete to manipulate data

671187
notepad	textpad
you could use the logging information to help debug using something like textpad to view the log file s while debugging since textpad unlike notepad detects and allows you to view the contents of any updates done while the file is open

671188
960.gs	fluid
emastic is only 4kb fixed and fluid columns and em based malo is very very small 8 lines of code and the golden grid is 1kb is similar to blueprint or 960.gs

671223
mouseleave	mouseenter
to do so i handle the mouseenter and mouseleave events of the usercontrol hiding and displaying the picturebox

671250
post	get
so it really uses only get and post and on server it reads this hidden field and reacts on it

671260
folder	directory
so my question is what are some tips or best practice methods in creating folder for these static files or if i shouldn t go the virtual directory route at all

671268
post	get
the html 4.01 specification describes only get and post as valid values for the method attribute

671284
put	get
the best way to learn about this and also get put and delete is to use a rest client to make your http requests and see the responses

671301
post	get
c moran is right if you want to be truly restful a browser isn t an ideal client due in part to the lack http methods beyond get and post

671322
nsstring	nsobject
when adding items to nsmutabledictionary using the setvalue forkey method i suppose this generalizes to any nsobject does the dictionary retain the second parameter the nsstring

671372
lxml	beautifulsoup
another alternative to beautifulsoup is lxml

671378
put	get
now to get the files from section1 to extend section1 base.html you just have to put at the top of them

671446
post	put
so i was able to fake a put request by making a post request using redirect_post and then assigning put to a _method param

671446
post	put
if you look at a normal put request all it is a post from a form with a _method param

671451
config	ini
config options could be stored in the registry ini file or anyother storage option

671508
post	get	post	put	put	get
resources being manipulated using a common set of verbs http methods are the commonly seen case - the venerable create retrieve update delete becomes post get put and delete

671512
post	get
let s say i m writing a grails web-app where user input is taken from form fields reading post get params and database tables using gorm

671512
post	get
let s assume that an attacker controls both what s sent as post get requests to the server and what s in the database

671512
client-side	server-side
update #1 to keep the discussion focused please disregard any html-xss problems in the code since this question is about code-execution on the server-side not on the client-side

671552
gridview	objectdatasource
say we data bind gridview to an objectdatasource control and then perform a query

671552
gridview	objectdatasource	gridview	sqldatasource	sqldatasource	objectdatasource
which control will perform the conversion gridview or objectdatasource sqldatasource control

671552
gridview	objectdatasource
b regardless of whether gridview or objectdatasource performs a conversion how is that conversion performed

671599
jedit	textpad
for non-unicode editing on windows i m a textpad user--my staff and i have probably spent about 200 000 hours in textpad with only occasional forays into notepad2 madedit jedit xml copy editor and epcedit

671612
rsa	aes
the code basically uses aes for encryption of binary data and then rsa encrypts the key and the iv using an x509certificate

671615
vim	emacs
the lisp community in particular has tried to reproduce emacs slime an interactive lisp prompt in vim

671623
uipickerviewdelegate	uipickerviewdatasource
interface myviewcontroller uiviewcontroller uipickerviewdelegate uipickerviewdatasource uiaccelerometerdelegate

671640
sorting	filtering
collectionview encapsulates sorting and filtering

671691
post	get
even though the none turns off the key value pairs presumably a get is simply still counted as different to a post

671710
implements	extends
if you design and implements the protocol with these principles in mind it will make your life a lot easier when you have to support and extends

671731
clang	llvm
so you may have to run clang llvm with scan-build xcodebuild -configuration debug

671747
width	height
jquery has two function that should be of use to you width and height

671767
post	get
this blog post explains a possible solution for this type of problem the author uses his own version of irepository but you use the same ideas in your repository or check out his ncommon project to get some inspiration

671770
post	get
i just tried and played with it a little and it seems marc s hunch is right the cache is dependent on the method get post

671838
cvs	svn	perforce	cvs	perforce	svn
xcode has built-in support for svn cvs and perforce

671849
wxpython	pythoncard
boa constructor apparently has a wxpython gui builder in it and there is also pythoncard though development on these two projects seems to have stalled

671851
opera	firefox
i actually know how the browsers tend to render the following examples results based on opera 9.5 and firefox 3.0 but i don t understand the reason behind them

671852
udp	tcp
sql doesn t listen on tcp 1434 it listens on udp 1434

671881
int	double
int double and so on

671892
inherited	properties
while color is an inherited properties the inner selector targets the span itself so it takes precedence

671895
vb.net	vb6
some years ago i used to program in vb6 i really liked it because it was very simply and fast when vb.net came out i abandoned it because they changed a lot of things

671895
vb.net	vb6
well i must admit that i didn t try vb.net too much i was a little disappointed because i would had to learn a lot of new things and i ve had learned vb6 not so long before in that moment

671901
vb.net	vb6
vb.net is the natural progression of vb6 and has a lot of free tools and resources online to get started

671952
pascal	delphi
my first language was pascal and i think it s also one of the easiest languages and with delphi getting popular again i think it s a very good alternative to vb6

671953
width	height
the height and width are huge and in addition there are funny and large values for the compression flags and a few others

671988
inherited	properties
color is an inherited properties so we need to look at the span s parent elements for the most specific rule

672003
hide	show
first in your viewwillappear subscribe to the keyboard notifications so you know when the keyboard will show and hide and the system will tell you the size of the keyboard but dont forget to unregister in your viewwilldisappear

672049
apache	nginx
if it were at all possible i would recommend that they setup apache on a nonstandard port accessible only from the nginx box and have nginx proxy to apache

672068
width	height
middle column store a huge articles however when left and right column is fixed width it set the height of the whole page

672074
width	height
it seems odd that you re creating a bitmap of the same width and height as your input yet the generated bmp is much larger

672087
listbox	icollectionview
if you are not binding to a datagrid icollectionview will not give you much because it is not used by the basic controls such as listbox as far as i can tell since it is defined in the data controls assembly and not in the core

672149
put	get
i always get a classnotfoundexception for the domain classes regardless in which package i put them in

672171
width	height
inspecting the generated 24bpp file with a hex editor and comparing against the 8bpp file shows no difference in height and width in the two files

672177
put	get
you put values you want into tempdata immediately redirect and get them out

672241
int	chars
i m lead to believe that write can only send data buffers of byte signed chars so how do i send an array of long int using the c write function in the sys socket.h library

672257
awt	swing
this also explains why awt was pretty limited compared to swing

672257
awt	swing	swt	swing
take a look at this page from ibm for an in-depth comparison of awt swing and swt

672309
daemons	launchd
you need to launchd your own thread and make it a daemons thread

672319
bonjour	avahi
you might like using zeroconf aka bonjour rendevous or sometimes avahi

672358
nant	cruisecontrol
i work for a team of asp.net mvc and they are using cruisecontrol nunit and nant for the automated testing and build

672367
width	height
please see the code below and tell me where should i define properties to tag like width height bgcolor etc

672441
udp	tcp
for basic client server application with tcp udp winsock should be sufficient

672456
multiplying	add
other functions to add or multiplying should be written to assume the input is already valid since it will have been created by one of the functions in this library

672487
min	max
if a b and c are all set at max value or to the min value they each get 1 3

672579
inherited	subclassing
make all testcase subclassing for your package inherited from a phony subclassing so that you can say on gst-sunit s command line when you add more tests

672608
.nettiers	codesmith
looking at the architecture that is used i recommended to introduce a code generator like codesmith in combination with .nettiers

672648
ienumerable	iqueryable
basically most of the linq extension methods are defined only for not ienumerable iqueryable

672704
vcard	vcf
i need a java library to read vcard files vcf

672733
singleton	facade
i do believe that some things should not be used in the name such as singleton however flyweight factory or facade are examples of design names i think fit well in the name of a class that implements those patterns

stdout	stderr
if you start eclipse through eclipse.app from the desktop its console stdout stderr will be redirected to the syslog so any output by eclipse itself or plugins using printf will end up there

672770

vim	emacs
if you are going to be doing serious work on linux you need to learn one of vim or emacs

672803
vim	emacs
vim and emacs on the other hand have been present for much longer

672814
vim	emacs
with vim or emacs you can do it remotely and fill ok

672883
vim	emacs
lots of developers use emacs and vim because they re excellent and powerful editing tools that once learned can make everyday editing tasks much simpler

672883
vim	emacs
emacs and vim are just editors but because of their usefulness and their longevity they ve accumulated a number of plugins and extensions to simulate many of the tasks of an ide

672883
vim	emacs
if you just want an ide that lets you jump right in you re probably not looking for emacs and vim but if you want a very powerful editor that while taking a while to learn will make your life easier in the end go for emacs or vim

rss	feed
im looking at writing a application for a web 2.0 start up site which will essential monitor specific rss feed

672914
sorting	filtering
you can then use this view to perform your queries there could be a performance hit for filtering and sorting based on the age and if you regularly sort filtering based upon the age field then you may want to create an indexed view

672916

is there any other way besides using imageio.read to get image height and width

672917
post	get
you can get almost anything you like without using allowtrasparency take a look at this post for examples

what currently happens is windows pop-up a dialog telling me that the program has crashed and only once i ve dismissed that manually does the process exit

673046
folder	directory	folder	dir
i d recommend folder directory or even dir

673053

fgetc	fread
using fgetc will show you that the file actually does contain what you think it does and that your problems are not due to the somewhat uncommon use of fread for a single byte

673142
vb.net	vb6
today for new projects i feel that everything that made vb6 so easy to use is available with vb.net plus you get new language constructs and the .net framework

673142
vb.net	vb6
if you have to maintain or transfer an older project then the differences between vb6 and vb.net are much more serious

673521
activemq	rabbitmq
having an mom instance whether activemq rabbitmq or any other mom broker on a one-per-consumer case doesn t really make sense conceptually

673547
integer	unsigned
in your system you have many units error is amps the command is volts which turns into amps then the current use is amps which is reported as volts which gets turned into either a signed or unsigned integer which has to be scaled back into amperes to make the error proper

673625
try-catch	exception-handling
your try-catch blocks should only be around pieces of code that are capable of throwing exception-handling anything involving user-input anything involving an external datasource

673639
getter	setter
i have seen this in framework or macro generated getter and setter before

673654
folder	directory
this application installs a default user-config file to it s home directory and the first time each user starts the application it copies this file to that user s application data folder

673809
stdout	stderr
you might also want to use ipc run and it s callbacks for data on stdout stderr

673823
shadowing	named
this is called shadowing when we have a method with the same named but a different behavior when called from the base class

673833

sorting	grouping
set sorting in the grouping and sorting properties to sort by this expression

674037
hash	salt
hashid salt hash password

674037
hash	salt
as others have mentioned you want to be careful with your hash since it s easy to do something that s not really secure h salt password is far weaker than h password salt but at the same time you want to balance the effort put into this with the value of the site content

674110
debian	linux
and i already disabled all time consuming stuff i anyways don t use frequently like code completion that is on my debian gnu linux installation

674110
notepad++	scite
to get a glimpse on it look at notepad++ win or scite linux

674114
portrait	landscape
i understand you can specify a landscape for the entire application but what if its partially in landscape and partially in portrait

674114
portrait	landscape
just to clarify i do not need auto rotation functionality the way that it is being implemented now is captures all the functionality i want to include in the app but i just wanted to know if there is a less cumbersome way of handling landscape portrait views within the same application

674121
many-to-many	one-to-many
from your code i think it s not an one-to-many but a many-to-many relationship

674147
vb.net	vb6
this is in vb6 may also apply to vb.net

674151
disk	ram
pretty similar to ram hard disk

674158
actionscript	mxml
i want to do this inside my mxml not actionscript

674180
actionscript	mxml
you can write it like actionscript but include it inside the mxml file with the script tag

674214
profiler	visualvm
the visualvm profiler that now comes with the jdk can be attached to running processes and may at least give an initial overview of the performance

674252
disk	ram
the only way to get that much memory is with a 64 bit jvm on a machine with at least 8 gb of ram or use some disk backed cache

674314
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
these styles work in ff3 google-chrome safari and i think opera 9

674342
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome don t have this problem so that s an additional symptom

674355
firefox	safari
everything works find in firefox but in safari i noticed immediately that when i click on an html button the annotation button the current user text selection goes away as if clicking on the button repositioned the text caret

674355
firefox	safari
this google docs solution works for both firefox and safari the two browsers that i m interested in

674390
width	margin
first we add a margin to the parent element of the size â sum wc â the total width of all child elements

674390
width	margin	children	parent
set that as the parent margin then the children can have one-third of that width as padding between them

674401
des	aes
i have experience in cryptography as i have taken several courses and written my own implementation of some algorithms des aes schnorr but i have never used any complete library for it

674408
getter	setter
is there any point to creating a unit test for pojos if all they consist of is getter and setter

674408
getter	setter
is there a java unit-test framework that auto-tests getter and setter

674414
mouse	keyboard
so you will need a client application that runs in the user s desktop and hooks into the keyboard and mouse activity

674414
mouse	keyboard
you would do that via two calls to the windows api setwindowshookex for low level keyboard and mouse hooks using jni

674414
mouse	keyboard
to monitor activity the application would then need to process the keyboard and mouse hooks for messages

674423
equals	compareto
pojos may also contain other functions such as equals hashcode compareto and various other functions

674425
getter	setter
i don t think there s a point to testing simple property getter and setter

674425
getter	setter
however as soon as you add a conditional null-check or other non-trivial behavior to your getter and setter or other methods i think it s appropriate to add unit tests

674437
getter	setter
my answer is that trivial getter and setter do not merit their own tests

674437
getter	setter
of course this is all boilerplate so you could easily write a script that generates unit tests for your getter and setter if you think there s any value there

674440
getter	setter
in my experience creating unit tests for pojos with only getter and setter is just overkill

674440
getter	setter
there are some exceptions of course if there is additional logic in the getter setter like checking for null and doing something special than i would create a unit test for that

674456
atoi	atof
i have a c++ application where i m replacing a number of sscanf functions with atoi atof etc.

674476
getter	setter
my main concern with classes containing lots of setter getter however is what is the class doing

674476
getter	setter
if these are data entity objects then the setter getter pattern may be correct

674478
yacc	bison
the standard tools are bison or yacc for the grammar and flex for the syntax

674481
yacc	bison
if you can stretch to other languages then lex yacc or flex bison is the standard for c although i wouldn t particularly recommend either of those combinations steep learning curve showing their age a little now

674493
yacc	sablecc
javacc yacc are sablecc are more traditional lexer parser generators and you ll find that they re a little more primitive and have steeper learning curves

674526
yacc	bison
bison c lr gnu version of the venerable yacc

674550
portrait	landscape
if i understand correctly what you are saying your app is essentially always in one single orientation however you are just drawing your various views differently to make it seem like certain parts of the app are in portrait landscape mode

674568
int	double
the only other thing i could think of would be that you re multiplying distance an int by the result of math.sin double but that shouldn t really be an issue

674643
google-chrome	firefox
however this doesn t work in firefox or google-chrome

674717
implements	modifiers
there is standard functionality for shortcuts which are modifiers + key which is quite easy to implements but is there a way to easely using standard libraries implements shortcuts like ctrl + k c holding ctrl press k and then c

674769
for-loop	loops
you can re-write the for-loop as a while loops to get some idea of what it is doing

674812
srt	subtitle
is it possible to have the subtitle played along with the flv file without integrating them into the video images so keeping them in srt format

674848
free	malloc
you also need to make it clear if the caller or the library is responsible for calling malloc and free

674849
lxml	html5lib	lxml	beautifulsoup	html5lib	beautifulsoup
i strongly recommend using html5lib + lxml instead of beautifulsoup

674897
spaces	delimiter
input a given text file containing email addresses delimiter by a spaces tab

674904
hash	salt
to explain we all hopefully know by now that we should salt a password before we hash it for storage in the database edit so you can avoid things like what happened to jeff atwood recently

674921
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
it looks as if it works fine in firefox safari opera and ie 6 and 7 but not in 8

674923
hash	salt
the hash will be no more easily guessable wherever you put the salt

674946
listview	gridview	itemscontrol	gridviewcolumn
i would suggest maybe a listview gridview with a gridviewcolumn with a custom celltemplate containing an itemscontrol with its own datatemplate...simple really

674955
daemons	launchd
here s a bare-bones example of an init script for launchd an rsync daemons

674964
min	max
i used min in the example below but you could just as easily use max

674976
post	get
check out my post which contains instructions and sample code on how to get started

674980
dictionary	map
assuming you have to have support for unicode the hash map dictionary lookup is probably your best bet as a 64k entry array in each node won t really work very well

674980
trie	tree
about the only hack up i could think of on this is to store entire strings suffixes or possibly in-fixes on branches that do not yet split depending on how sparse the tree er trie is

675003
put	get
you may need to clear out your session store to get rid of the token that you already put in there

675005
qpushbutton	qobject
when i am writing code intellisense seems to die - it does not show any methods or data members in qt objects such as qpushbutton does not see the qobject connect static method etc

675034
gridview	objectdatasource
i have a multiview in the module that i m developing and in one of the views have a gridview that is bound to an objectdatasource

675061
submit	submission
when accessing the login.action the menu is rendered fine but if i enter data in the form the submit the form and submission has validation errors i return to the page the form is rendered ok but the menu is missing

675070
innodb	myisam
if you have enough memory allocated for mysql s use - in the innodb buffer pool or for use by myisam you can read the database into memory just a select from tablename and if there s no reason to remove it it stays there

675098
bellman-ford	dijkstra
dijkstra s and bellman-ford reduces to a breadth-first search when the weights are 1 so this isn t too useful

675102
bellman-ford	dijkstra
there are lots of solutions including dijkstra s algorithm and bellman-ford

675128
folder	directory
i am trying to first list all the iis websites and the folder virtual web directory in each in a tree view

675128
folder	directory
i can create a virtual web directory if i know the path i plan to use but i cannot get a list of the folder virtual web directory in a website i can get the website list

675144
vmware	virtualbox
personally and i have no hard data to back this up virtualbox seems to be faster and a lot more responsive to me than vmware workstation

675175
accessor	properties
it is possible to create field get set accessor methods in pretty much any language which simulate properties

675192
inherited	properties
i don t know what type your service1 object inherited so i can t say what properties or methods you have associated with it but whenever i know you can make calls to you web service with using

675193
free	strdup
the macros strdup and free are error-checking versions of strdup and free declared in emalloc.h and implemented in emalloc.c and estrdup.c

675197
getter	setter
delphi has a property pattern with setter and getter methods which also can be used in interfaces

675197
getter	setter
or without setter getter

675203
hash	salt
storing the per-user salt in your database is not a security issue using a site-wide hash is

675233
postgis	ltree
i am using ltree and postgis a lot in my current project and i can t think of any other way to run unit tests for the model logic that depends on the db other than to include it in my tests

675248
int	chars
i said this was an but let me access it as if it were a pointing to sizeof int chars s or i said this data was read-only and now i need to pass it to a function that won t modify it but doesn t take the parameter as a const reference.

675257
getter	setter
will make a getter and a setter for length_inches

675257
getter	setter
if you later on want to put some logic in the getter setter you can simply manually implement the same methods

675293
for-loop	loops
the generalized format of a for-loop not a for-in loops is

675294
hide	show
it works in firefox too - except - when we toggle ie show hide from one div to the other the page moves in firefox

675318
haskell	ocaml
many languages like ocaml python haskell f# and so on have a special concise syntax for defining tuples

675327
pop-up	dialog
once that dialog pop-up it s difficult to dismiss which can be irritating

675337
folder	directory
use 7-zip to extract it to a folder directory outside your windows python installation folder

675385
hide	show
in the end what worked was that i would hide show the datagridview control after i inserted a row

675461
portrait	landscape
my current application is primarily landscape but has a few portrait views

675472
firefox	safari
i have tested my code in firefox 3.0.7 and in safari 3.2.1

675477
google-chrome	firefox
this is true for all browsers i ve tried it in ie firefox google-chrome

675478
int	chars
if fubar is a chars field but contains only numbers then you can cast the field to int and still use the between clause

675568
atoi	atof
if the data you want to convert is guaranteed to be only in the ascii charset you can always transform it to ascii and cat atof atol atoi friends

675614
stdout	fflush
it indeed seems to be blocking at connect forgot to fflush stdout

675635
getter	setter
of course the setter and getter are often methods themselves

675636
imagemagick	magick++
you could duplicate the functionality of imagemagick s import command using magickwand c api or magick++ c++ api but calling import directly via system as suggested by justinhj is likely the simplest approach if you don t mind distributing import with your software

675644
accessor	properties
this is a read-only properties a get but no set accessor

675644
public	protected
public values should always be accessed as properties rather than variables in classes a private protected backing variable to a property but that is slightly unrelated to your question

675656
httphandler	pagemethods
the way you worded your question i believe you re considering the difference between an asmx scriptservice an ashx httphandler and an asp.net ajax pagemethods not an actual aspx page

675708
hash	salt
it could then be cheaper to brute-force a password file entry with postfix salt than prefix salt for each dictionary word in turn you would load the state add the salt bytes into the hash and then finalise it

675708
hash	salt
but a cryptographically secure hash function is deliberately designed to have multiple rounds each of which uses all the bits of the input string so that computing the internal state just prior to the addition of the salt is not meaningful after the first round

675708
pbkdf2	hash
moreover password hashing algorithms like pbkdf compose their hash function multiple times it is recommended to iterate pbkdf2 a minimum of 1000 times each iteration applying sha-1 twice making this attack doubly impractical

675719
width	height
width or height you can drop two div s ie

675719
width	height	gif	png
with either technique you can optimise your image by creating a gif or png with enough transparency between the segments to exceed the maximum bounds of width and height your button will experience

675741
spaces	delimiter
i manually extracted them by the or spaces delimiter

675772
children	parent
i have a one to many relationship parent to children for sake of this question and for some reason l2s was wanting to create a new parent instead of using the one is already had

675887
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i have a uitabbarcontroller where the default view controller is a uinavigationcontroller

675887
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i want to be able to hide the uitabbar of the uitabbarcontroller when i push a certain view in the uinavigationcontroller

675912
children	parent
the orm sqlmetal or via a dbml models a parent object and you ll also notice a collection of children on the parent entity also

675920
post	get
to get started with wcf it might be easiest to just use the default soap format and http post rather than get for the web-service bindings

675920
post	get
wcf can be a little picky when inter-operating with non-wcf clients so you ll have to mess with the post headers a little to get it to work

675920
post	get
once you get this running you can then start to investigate security for the login might need to use a different binding to get better security or possibly using wcf rest to allow for logins with a get rather than soap post

676008
integer	unsigned
unsigned integers declared unsigned shall obey the laws of arithmetic modulo 2 n where n is the number of bits in the value representation of that particular size of integer

676008
integer	unsigned
2 if the destination type is unsigned the resulting value is the least unsigned integer congruent to the source integer modulo 2 n where n is the number of bits used to represent the unsigned type

676023
smallcheck	quickcheck
a good way to debug haskell code is to write and test algebraic laws using quickcheck and smallcheck

676055
udp	tcp
from the old version of our engine to our new one we switched from udp to tcp

676123
serializable	deserialization
would it be considered thick because of the serializable deserialization of the soap envelope and the message

676153
put	get
that means among other things that it does not take advantage of certain aspects of http mostly restful usage of urls and methods put customers 1234 or get customers 1234

676159
gif	png
i d like to create a graphic image on the fly based on user input and then present that image as a png file or jpg or gif if necessary but png is preferred

676164
imagemagick	graphicsmagick
look at ruby-gd2 or an imagemagick or graphicsmagick binding

676170
jar	war
not about jar or war files

676282
int	double	min	max
i am doing this generating values for functional testing i am actually passing this values to nunit partner max amd min are applicable to int float double etc. these values are test data

676282
int	double
initially i generated for basic data types like int float double string etc

676346
user-controls	tabcontrol
the problem was when i bind a user-controls to a tabcontrol itâ s only the contentpaneâ s datacontext that is set to the user-controls and the datacontext for the headerpane is still null

676351
width	height
the table height is 955px width is 701px

676357
width	height
use height and width in percentage instead of px

676384
int	double	min	max
i am generating these values for functional testing i am actually passing these values to nunit partner max and min are applicable to int float double etc

676384
int	double
initially i generated them for basic data types like int float double string etc

676401
width	height
you can specify width height and if you want it to look like a part of the original page include

676408
folder	directory
most probably the swf is not at the right path or is not getting copied to an assets folder in the debug-build release-build directory

676415
move	drag
now i want to remove some items from this sort list and move them back to the drag list

676415
move	drag
suppose the user move some 5 items to sort list and decides he she wants only 4 items and decides to just drag the unwanted item from the sortlist to the drag list

676417
formview	detailsview
in this case i would suggest a formview instead of a detailsview which will allow you greater control over the details display since it requires user defined templates instead of preconfigured row based display

676436
sorting	filtering
now you want some kind of filtering aggregation sorting operation so that you don t have to use the db to do all that how will you do it

676437
sorting	filtering
i think in general if you have a database it s always best to do as much filtering and sorting in the db as possible and use linq to objects sparingly especially on large collections of data

676437
sorting	filtering
linq-to-objects is useful for doing database-like sorting and filtering on in-memory collections

676459
git-stage	git-add
also git-stage is an alias for git-add

676475
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
ie even the brand new version 8 is years behind the other 3 firefox safari opera ..

676500
ilist	iqueryable
ilist t to iqueryable t

676534
int	double
casting down big type - smaller type like double - float - int - byte will cut off information which can t be represented so double- float will lose precision - int will lose all decimal places + no rounding

676551
gif	png	tiff	png
not ony will it render your pdf to a variety of formats eg jpeg gif png tiff jpeg 2000

676596
free	malloc
as a result there are now two classes that believe they own the memory from the original malloc call and when the second is deleted it will try to free memory deleted by the first

676601
button	checkbox
is it really painting all the button edit boxes combo-boxes checkbox tabs etc on its own using qpainter or is it somehow using the native widgets

676602
free	malloc
apart from the fixes given you should avoid using malloc free in c++

676650
switching	screens
if i switching to 800 by 600 pixels i want my html windows changed automatically to fix the screens

676659
google-chrome	firefox
i have verified in both google-chrome and firefox firebug that the actual contents of the div are nowhere near 633 pixels high

if you view it in firefox or ie7 the browser s default rss feed styling is used

676698
rss	feed
i tried to do something similar myself with this rss feed

676698
rss	feed
however once i put it live onto our production server the ie6 stylesheet is appearing when you view the rss feed in firefox

676700
width	height
also note that the width and height properties don t take any note of where toolbars sit so the window could disappear behind there

676750
amr	aac
i just cannot figure out how to tweak the sample code to be used with for example aac mp3 or amr instead

676767
int	chars
a couple notes to the best of my knowledge the int type is always 4 bytes also any of the var types are by definition not fixed length and only store up to their max length if a nvarchar 10 holds a 2 chars string it only stores 2 chars

676773
trojan	virus
jeez not even my virus trojan scanner will complain when i start a python program which hooks into the keyboard events.

676779
int	chars
you are trying to assign a chars array index_buff to an unsigned int data_t.un32index

676790
integer	unsigned
i agree with the previous answers but i thought i d share code that actually converts a hex string to an unsigned integer just to show how it s done

676791
spweb	spsite
so you need to first create the lookup column inside the root spweb of the spsite

676817
free	malloc
if you can free it why are you malloc ing it in a loop in the first place

676821
post	get
so initially i started to make the services return a result the result would be uniquely identifiable so the caller would know if the comment was indeed made and additionally i would return the comment entity in the result the results would also identify things like could not post as user is not authenticated or could not post as specified cool-down period has not been respected i don t actually return strings but you get the idea

676825
rss	feed
when i changed this to the full url for your feed the default firefox rss feed styling was applied as you expected to see

676910
width	height
if this is the case you ll need to relook at the assumptions you ve made with your hard coded values for width height and pixel format

676961
ienumerable	ilist
note that it has to be an extension on ilist instead of ienumerable so we can perform the updates which makes it less widely applicable

676991
gif	png
seriously though the two main lossless formats are gif and png both in browser and out of and the biggest by far lossy format is jpg

676991
gif	png
png tends to be better compression ratios than gif

677015
gridview	repeater
i have a repeater inside the templatefield for a gridview

677015
gridview	repeater
gridview is bound to datasource1 and the repeater to datasource2

677032
cos	sin
sin cos tan functions allow you to convert from triangle edge ratio to degrees

677043
gridview	rowdatabound
the gridview exposes the rowdatabound event which you can handle in the same way

677066
autoresetevent	manualresetevent
this could be events in windows in c# i don t know in python the manualresetevent autoresetevent or a mutex if you want to sacrifice a waiter-thread in each process or signals in linux

677076
inherited	subclassing
it is not inherited by subclassing

677157
inherited	subclassing
personally i would look at allowing extensibility through inherited allowing third parties to subclassing your code without giving them the source and very carefully specified access modifiers

677230
folder	directory
recreate folder and copy all the files from original directory to the new one

677257
submit	submission
for example when trying to submit a files original path without submission the file itself when trying to do it for multiple dynamicly created components

677259
kate	scite
personally i use a variety of editors from good old vi to scite kate eclipse and even just the python console for testing snippets quickly

677274
stdio	fflush
there is basic_ostream fflush however i suspect that this does not in fact call fsync -- i expect that like fflush in stdio it only makes sure that the user-space runtime library buffers are fflush meaning that the os could still be buffering the data

677292
implements	extends
it was a cms for a university completely implements by extends django admin

677324
width	height
flash to 100 width and 100 height

677328
hash	salt
as sam152 said the passwords are likely sha1 hash so if the passwords are not stored with salt you can build a rainbow table to find the original password

677393
versioning	upgrade
that i now want to upgrade my versioning in trunk to v1.3

677420
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
not in safari firefox opera google-chrome have i left any out

677437
google-chrome	firefox
i ve tested this solution in google-chrome build 1.0.154.53 firefox 3.0.7 and internext explorer 8.0.6001

677447
gif	png
i prefer png for any internet image work i m doing as gif has a limited palette and jpg doesn t handle transparency

677459
config	ini
ini is really a much simpler format than xml if you have less than fifty config options and they are not nested

677463
updatepanel	formview
it s a simple aspx page with a table formview to show data all within an updatepanel

677523
hide	show
on a number of pages i use a multiview to show and hide the content based on different view modes view edit add

677557
easyhook	detours
apart from detours library you might also take a look at easyhook library

677561
capitalize	uppercase
what i needed this method for was to capitalize names of hotels that sometimes came in all uppercase

677561
capitalize	uppercase
i only wanted to capitalize them if they were all lower or uppercase

677602
put	get
you can use bit shift to put together a 64 bit random number from 31 bit random numbers but you have to use three 31 bit numbers to get enough bits

677603
nullpointerexception	runtimeexception
otherwise you run the risk of catching any runtimeexception including nullpointerexception arrayindexoutofboundsexception etc. which your client code probably can t handle

677613
integer	unsigned
this would work the same for integer long and their unsigned relatives

677633
int	chars
for each chars convert it to an int and add it to your total until you reach the end of the number

677648
disk	ram
also the amount of ram and the speed of your disk will make a big difference what are you running on

677715
free	malloc
nsapi supplies a malloc macro that gets memory from a pool that will be free for you when the request ends but it doesn t say what happens if you call this malloc function in an initialization function when there is no request

677737
fflush	gets
the readline gets stuck because you forgot to fflush the output stream of the sender the other process

677746
gridview	repeater	gridview	sqldatasource
in the asp.net page i use a repeater to loop over the sqldatasource stored procedure that returns a course s prerequisite sets and a gridview inside that repeater that reads the individual prerequisite information from a second sqldatasource stored procedure

677795
puts	gets
after this little client gets a result or callback then it puts the server into an accessible by the outside world state

677801
iprincipal	iidentity
my mockidentity and mockprincipal classes are mocks conforming to iidentity and iprincipal respectively

677801
getter	setter
i understand that the httpcontextbase has a getter and setter that aren t implemented but i thought that rhino would handle this when mocking

677839
int	chars
second int simply take up less room than almost any chars key except chars 1 assuming the use of unicode

677839
int	chars
however if you have a choice between int and chars and both are essentially arbitrary go with the int over the chars

677872
addition	modulo	addition	multiplication	multiplication	modulo
calculating the product of 2 8 32 64 128 256 512 using repeated squaring 2 8 2 2 2 2 which requires more space and a multiplication method but is far fewer operations - is closer to normal big integer use so you may find it more useful in later problems if you try to calculate the last ten digits of 28433ã 2 7830457 +1 using the digit-per int method and repeated addition it may take some time though in that case you could use modulo arthimetic rather than adding strings of millions of digits

677950
put	get
the documentation i ve found says to get a devmode structure change a couple of fields and put it back in

677951
children	parent
i tried to map the children as a collection by using many-to-one and get the number of children from the collection size but then hibernate has to load all child entities for each parent separately

677958
ubuntu	debian
they are packaged with the easy name smstools in ubuntu debian and other distros

677968
pull	push
the command-line is git s primary interface and if you aren t comfortable with the different concepts such as index push pull rebase etc. then using git from eclipse will probably confuse you even more

678002
versioning	upgrade
for the case where the user has already installed an older versioning of our application we do a major upgrade with the majorupgrade xml element

678002
versioning	upgrade
this is all working as desired if an older versioning is installed it is upgrade transparently

678013
mersenne-twister	prng	integer	unsigned
i am looking for a hashing algorithm that produces a 31 32 bit signed unsigned integer as a digest for a utf8 string with the purpose of using the output for seeding a prng such as a park-miller-carta lcg or a mersenne-twister

678055
put	get
i set the console app as startup project and put a break point in the workflow designer for the workflow being invoked this way but i get the dreaded breakpoint won t be hit symbol and indeed it s not hit

678061
cvs	svn
i have seen hundreds of developers use cvs for hundreds of projects so svn should do it fine

678063
width	height
if you don t specify a width or height of the ellipse the default values will be auto

678063
width	height
combined with the default horizontalalignment verticalaligment values of stretch this should cause the ellipse to stretch to the width and height of its container with constant stroke thickness

678063
width	height	actualheight	actualwidth
i suggest you bind the width and height properties of the ellipse to a multibinding of the parent container s actualwidth and actualheight properties

678079
filesystems	fat
since perl runs just fine on multiple platforms let me warn you that fat and fat32 etc filesystems will ignore renames that only change the case of the file name

678079
filesystems	fat
this is true under windows and linux and is probably true for other platforms that support the fat filesystems

678079
filesystems	ntfs
if you will only rename files on ntfs filesystems or only on ext2 3 4 filesystems or other unix linux filesystems then you probably don t need to worry about this

678081
min	max
where min and max are the min and max sizes and a log maxcount -b

678157
cvs	svn
just add it to svn cvs or whatever you are using

678216
hash	md5
i presume cryptographic strength is not an actual requirement so that flawed but widely used hash schemes like md5 would be adequate - and readily available in many libraries

678218
rss	feed
we developed simple python cgi-scripts to manage users permissions and svn-hook scripts for email notifications and rss feed

678223
internationalization	localization
check out the localization internationalization samples here

678238
post	get
here is a post that shows it s not too difficult to get a simple workflow engine going

678239
internationalization	localization
the process of making a program ready for new languages is normally called internationalization or i18n and the process of taking that and actually making it run is localization or l10n

678289
serializable	deserialization
i m building a distributed c++ application that needs to do lots of serializable and deserialization of data stored in std containers

678309
dlsym	dlopen
i didn t try but a solution may be with dlopen dlsym and dlclose which allow you to programmatically handle dynamic libraries

678315
post	get
then when the delegate methods get called you would post notifications to the nsnotificationcenter

678326
dlsym	dlopen
i ve never used dlsym dlopen dlerror dlclose dlvsym etc. but i m looking at the man page and it gives an example of opening libm.so and extracting the cos function

678414
nsdata	nsoutputstream
you can do something similar with an nsoutputstream writing to an nsdata

678416
verilog	vhdl
i m surprised no one s mentioned register transfer language or any of the hardware description languages such as verilog or vhdl

678416
verilog	vhdl
vhdl and verilog are most commonly used for programmable logic which i think qualifies as talking straight to the hardware

678543
decoder	encoder
assuming you have a image editor you will want to be sure that people don t exploit buffer overruns due to bugs in the image encoder decoder libraries

678565
queue	fifo
consider a system where jobs are queue and processed in fifo order

678588
cvs	svn
if you used to cvs some workflows in svn are very different for example vendor branches which are non-existent in cvs because you just deleted all files in the vendor folder and copy the new version inside

678589
.htaccess	httpd.conf
in apache i can do that in httpd.conf or in .htaccess using mod_env

678664
cpu	processors
though i have high capacity servers since squid is able to use only processors core the cpu usage seems to be really high

678682
gif	png	gif	bmp	bmp	png	tiff	png	tiff	bmp
built in encoders on my machine vista ultimate x64 are bmp jpeg gif tiff and png. if i save an image using the imageformat.exif property i simply get the default png format

678734
queue	fifo
a fifo buffer queue

678734
queue	fifo
first of all you should have an instance of a thread-safe queue a fifo buffer for each instance of your class

678734
queue	fifo
fifo queue would enable you to simultaneously process the data in the worker thread while filling it from the communication thread

678760
rss	feed
it is a real challenge to know these blogs indivdually and i usually grab the rss feed the first time i visit and then susbcribe from within outlook

678784
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
while probably unrelated to the issue at hand note that uinavigationcontroller doesn t support pushing a uitabbarcontroller

678829
int	chars
i understand this is done to convert a chars into an int however i don t understand the logic behind it

678869
icomparable	gethashcode
ok yeah i know we have here different reference this class doesn t implement icomparable and even gethashcode is returning the different results

678870
int	chars
you had a typo here notice the s around the 3 this assigns the ascii value of the chars 3 to the chars variable then the next line takes 3 - 0 and assigns it to x because of the way ascii values work x will then be equal to 3 int value

678881
int	chars
so this will turn a digit chars code into the int value of the digit

678884
int	chars
1 a chars is really just a 8-bit int

678886
width	height
given that you re using javascript you could get the width and height of the form input you re removing create a new div with those dimensions inject it after the form element then hide the form element

678886
width	height
surround your input with a div in your html and give it an explicit width and or height in your css

678891
typemock	nmock
other mocking frameworks for .net include typemock rhinomocks nmock .etc

678909
idictionary	iequalitycomparer
if this is for use in something like an idictionary then you ll need to just create a concrete class that implements the iequalitycomparer interface

678920
int	chars
i undertand this is done to convert a chars into an int however i don t understand the logic behind it

678923
jaxp	stax
note that many java xml solutions including jaxb 2.0 stax and jdom iirc integrate nicely with jaxp and can easily be passed to and from jaxp processors

678927
post	get
so if my blog started in september 2007 but there were no post in april 2008 i could get something like this

678931
jdom	xom
also try xom which is a modern alternative to jdom

679009
put	get
this would get triggered every time i do a build because i d put it into the msbuild file for the vs.net solution

679017
skip-lists	tree
depending on the implementation array list binary tree skip-lists of the child node collection you might be able to identify the required child node with as few as 5 search steps assuming case insensitive latin letters only

679020
put	get	implements	extends
then you can simply extends cookiehandler implements put get and make it work pretty much automatically

679042
post	get
you should also ensure that once you have accepted the data from the post request instead of returning a new page in response to that request you should redirect the user to a page accessed by a get request

679044
post	get
have a read at architecture of the world wide web volume one and uris addressability and the use of http get and post by w3c

679048
post	get
if you re going to link to a get for deletion you should return a confirmation page with that get that actually does a post upon confirmation

679100
children	parent
coming from a desktop client background with no real data-driven web design experience i am studying asp.net ui design to determine the best ui pattern for parent children data

679100
children	parent
thinking i should use asp.net 2.0 i am studying the various ways of architecting a ui form which contains a master list of parent records and then showing the related children records in a second grid on the page when you click on a parent

679100
children	parent
eventually even the child records are parent to other children so i ll need to deal with that also

679100
children	parent
some of techniques i ve seen simply creates a plain old-shcool table of href links for the parent with some method call to query the children based on the selected parent while some techniques i ve seen use the asp.net 2.0 data controls to work all this out

679109
queue	fifo
they don t have to actually use a queue or other fifo structure

679196
width	height
you would have to make sure the outer div was the same width height as the inner input though perhaps by floating it left to activate the â shrink-to-fitâ behaviour that comes with floats

679206
public	protected
it is also a compile-time error if any method declared in an annotation type has a signature that is override-equivalent to that of any public or protected method declared in class object or in the interface annotation.annotation

679226
comparator	icomparer
once you ve figured that out you can go about writing your comparison in hashcode or comparator icomparer equals equatable and so on

679243
pop-up	dialog
but tree-like control flow is very useful in such cases like confirmation dialog or for pop-up like those very frequent on facebook these days

679246
put	get
when i put it outside i get the following warning

679339
width	height
however you still need to specify the width and height to opengl in glteximage2d call

679349
lisp	smalltalk	algol	smalltalk
for example on the burroughs b5000 the cpu was programmed in a variant of algol on the lisp machine the cpu executed lisp code directly on the early smalltalk workstations the cpu executed smalltalk bytecode directly

679378
jquery	scriptaculous
a very nice canvas api for programatically generating html jquery scriptaculous

679389
width	height
when measureoverride gets called the availablesize-struct is initialized with the bounds of the control but in my application it comes with inf for both width and height

679395
post	put
if you have integer ratings you put them back into the post ratings table

679395
post	get
if you associate a rating with a user and allow only one rating for a given post per user you get a natural primary key again

679396
width	height
if you are loading the image from a file you get the height and width out with the rest of the data how else could you use the file

679406
accessor	properties
you can use guid.tobytearray to get the values as bytes but there are no accessor methods properties for the grouped bytes

679408
onchange	onblur
some browsers let you focus and select readonly fields and some even let you paste into a readonly field though they revert to the original value onblur and onchange

679485
gif	png
funny thing they re now all png images instead of gif

679491
children	parent
as for getting the number of children for each parent separately try to remove any lob fields in the child model as they will bottleneck your application speed

679511
uninstall	upgrade
if it won t uninstall properly it won t upgrade properly

679701
post	put
so how can i put the post data used to generate page 2 into the post data for page 3

679768
scheme	prolog
i only caught that because i created a prolog color scheme for notepad++ if anyone is interested i can post it online

679792
postgresql	mysql
they have created an open system for others to plug-in providers - postgresql and sqlite have it - mysql is just laggin.

679818
set	bag
instead of the set mapping you can use the bag mapping to give you an ilist

679820
inherited	properties
additionally includes properties inherited via an object s prototype chain

679853
yacc	bison
programming language grammars are commonly represented in bnf form which can be used by tools like yacc or bison to parse source code

679859
vim	emacs
although you use emacs instead of vim so i guess you re into overkill.

679864
rss	feed
you will need to release a file to your _layouts directory coding it to spit an rss feed to the user

679864
rss	feed
maybe use a query string to decide which rss feed to read from

679875
post	get
malicious users can still create links that contain javascript to do the post and cause the same cross-site scripting problems as with get

679875
post	get
that said all the other reasons for using post over get apply crawlers and the like

679888
realloc	malloc
it is very tedious to realloc malloc the array and insert strings

679894
boost	stl
sounds like you want to use something like an stl list or boost array of char

679956
getter	setter
using inotifypropertychanged will give you the ability to have getter setter logic if you need to

679963
postgresql	mysql
any orm like sqlalchemy sqlobject or the django orm are implemented on top of db-api and i recommend using any of these over direct db-api because it can give gramps the flexibility to run sqlite in embedded mode for local desktop users and then also share sometime down the road a postgresql mysql database connection with a web based version of gramps

680003
rss	feed
is there a way to view rss feed as formatted xml that doesn t involve messing with my browser s installation or writing my own tool

680022
range	max
for n in range 1 max

680030
spaces	delimiter
the following should do the necessary but it s inefficient doing two full table selects and it also relies on your exact match being delimiter by spaces

680034
versioning	upgrade
we ve recently jumped from vc++ 6 to visual studio 2005 and have since upgrade to 2008 for the latest versioning of the project that we re working on

680081
sorting	grouping
it looks like you re doing unnecessary casts for grouping and sorting

680131
int	chars
so a note to all developers using the dicom image format you need to convert the int array to a chars array before passing it to glteximage2d or just set the 7th argument to gl_rgba the later is probably not recommended

680146
rss	feed
if you view the feed in firefox it ll read like an rss reader but if you view the source code you ve got it in xml format

680183
vmware	virtualbox	virtualbox	parallels
besides wine you can get virtualbox free parallels or vmware

680185
min	max
it had a really useful feature where variables had three values a min max and current

680207
cpython	ironpython
how can i tell whether it is cpython or ironpython or jython

680254
button	checkbox
of course if you have checkbox radio button you ll need to modify this to include them as well and set

680289
post	get	post	put	put	get
rest and roi treats the urls as series of nouns and it uses http methods like get post put and delete as the verbs

680293
post	get
any future get or post will look at the new state but not the message that created it

680305
post	get
to get around this limitation some sharp coders created a library called multipartposthandler which creates an openerdirector you can use with urllib2 to mostly automatically post with multipart form-data

680335
integer	fractions
you don t need the fractions part of the real number so we can convert straight to integer using only bitwise operations

680335
exponent	addition
in addition to the restriction of no negative numbers this version might have problems when the exponent goes over 19 but this should keep you good until the year 3335

680367
cpython	ironpython
the script console in that qt application doubtlessly uses plain ol cpython instead of ironpython

680382
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
i ve checked the site on two machines vista with firefox ie6 ie7 ie8 safari win opera win

680473
implements	extends
you can extends distutils with your own cmd_class es which can implements new features

680526
profiling	benchmarking
i wouldn t think about doing something like this unless you ve got benchmarking profiling runs showing that there s a problem

680597
entity-relationship	diagram
proposed entity-relationship diagram

680612
post	put
you put asp.net in the question title this blog post is a good summary of the problems when using the threadstatic keyword in asp.net

680613
quicksort	mergesort
quicksort is also more complicated than mergesort especially if you want to write a really solid implementation and so if you re aiming for simplicity and maintainability merge sort becomes a promising alternative with very little performance loss

680700
cpu	hyperthreading
hyperthreading keeps track of two contexts at once in a single core exposing more parallelism to the out-of-order cpu core

680706
processors	hyperthreading
in hyperthreading multiple threads can run on the same processors that is the context-switch time between these multiple threads is very small

680706
processors	hyperthreading
server processors nowadays implement hyperthreading along with multi-processors

680709
put	get
but once i put it on a server and in production mode i get this error

680713
ant	maven
run tests from command line can be integrated into ant maven

680713
mocha	qunit	jasmine	mocha	jasmine	qunit
extend it to wrap other test-frameworks jasmine mocha qunit built-in

680713
ant	maven
run tests from command line can be integrated into ant maven

680713
emacs	textmate
textmate and emacs integration

680713
hudson	bamboo
it does however output xunit xml reports so it should be easy to integrate with hudson bamboo or other ci servers

680717
mapserver	mapxtreme
we have done mapserver php-mapscript postgis projects but we are moving towards dotnet solutions using mapxtreme mapinfo ms sql 2008

680718
cpu	hyperthreading
you can find some interesting articles about dual cpu multi-core and hyperthreading on intel s website or in a short article from yale university

680760
tstringlist	tlist
a list object looks like tlist tstringlist is good enough

680766
put	get
since experienced programmers tend to get a gut feel for a project s size even if they wouldn t put it in writing i thought i d pose the question to so

680773
getter	setter
the getter setter is calling itself

680774
pull	push
it is possible to use filemaker s instant web publishing as a web service that your app can then push and pull data through

680776
getter	setter
the setter is calling itself when it should be setting some private field - by the looks of it the getter will do the same since your example doesn t contain any fields

680828
multicastdelegate	delegation
they are not part of the delegation or multicastdelegate type definition

680846
installation	upgrade	versioning	upgrade

681336
mouse	keyboard
as i recall there were also issues with getting mouse and keyboard events in a timely manner

681336
mouse	keyboard
we used direct keyboard and mouse access rather than depending on the message loop because the message loop was often too slow and sometimes would cause us to lose information

681362
fink	macports
maybe in fink macports

681364
jobs	cron
i don t remember all the details but i do recall reading people who used cron jobs to keep at least one process alive to avoid this lag that can occur with passenger needed to reload the environment

681425
folder	directory
- allow physical access to the folder structure of the reportserver virtual directory to everyone

681461
integer	fractions
note that allowing fractions values will give you a higher objective value than only allowing 0 or 100 so no integer solution will do any better than 14.25 or 14 for that matter since the objective value has to be an integer

681461
subtract	add
note that when you create the subproblem where you must pick an item just subtract its price from the budget and add the value to the profit now you have a smaller problem to solve

681503
firefox	safari
many people including myself would argue having even a moderately decent browser ie7 onwards firefox or safari is would be a worthwhile thing for any business

681504
firefox	safari
we actually have a bunch of legacy applications on our intranet some written in house others that we quite a lot of money for which don t work well on ie7 or ie8 or firefox or safari or ...

2 all those web.config files can get tough to maintain if you re not careful about what values you put in each

681684
width	height
ie6 and ie7 don t scale images nicely in web pages when the images are scaled with css width height or attribute width height

681754
post	get
consider wrapping each row in it s own ajaxform or using jquery to do the update via ajax then passing the data required for the action via the route values or form values in the ajax get post

681760

681836
happy	alex
it s a python parser implemented in haskell using the happy parser generator and alex lexer generator

681853
cpython	ironpython
both of these seem to have downsides in that python for .net is not under active development as far as i can tell and you lose some features available in cpython if you use ironpython

681865
cpython	ironpython
there is a project called ironclad that is helping to open access to cpython extensions from ironpython it may be helpful

681872
autoresetevent	manualresetevent
furthermore all thread synchronization locks monitor readerwriterlock mutex semaphone autoresetevent manualresetevent etc. call interlocked methods internally

681875
ironruby	ironpython
ironpython is currently one of the .net 5 being developed by the language team c# vb.net f# ironpython and ironruby so i doubt that there s another open source .net python project that s gone anywhere near as far

681944
merb	ruby-on-rails
ruby had ruby-on-rails merb

681984
ienumerable	ilist
usually for me the choice between ienumerable or ilist usually ends up being whichever is easier to implement in the standard case

682018
ienumerable	ilist
you can still use linq to query against an ilist or ienumerable

682018
ienumerable	iqueryable
if lazy loading is a requirement then go with ienumerable or iqueryable

682033
rss	feed
it uses parsexml to load the rss feed

682033
rss	feed
for the following rss feed example i am having trouble getting it to load the feed

682083
bazaar	git	bazaar	svn
when a command that takes 30 seconds or 4 minutes in svn instead takes 1 or 2 seconds in git or mercurial or bazaar it is a huge difference to a developer

682088
floor	sqrt
a simple modification also lets you quickly calculate floor sqrt x instead of the closest integer

682131
stateless	stateful
you must implement your ejb stateless in that it doesn t hold any instance variable which itself holds a stateful value like persistence context

682170
mp3	ogg
would relatively simple compression like jpeg and mp3 ogg do the trick

682177
ienumerable	ilist
ilist t implements ienumerable t so all of the linq-related use cases still work but you lose the lazy evaluation

682215
queue	fifo
it appears that what you have here is a fifo queue implemented in a file and you re depending on the consumer s ability to process data faster than the producer can create it

682216
mvp	presenter
presenter first is a software development approach that combines the ideas of the model view presenter mvp design pattern and test-driven development

682251

according to the swf documentation from adobe you should be able to read the individual bytes of a swf to calculate the files size file dimensions width and height version and file type swf or swc

682256
mp3	m3u
if all else fails you could create m3u files mp3 playlists from your song sources and start winamp via process.start passing the newly created playlist

682257
hide	show
you ll have to control the tooltip yourself using the show and hide methods if you want any control over how and where it is positioned using the 2.0 framework unless you want to get into window s api calls

682257
hide	show
and the msdn documentation on using the tooltip s show and hide methods is actually fairly decent

682274
ssl	https
i have a wss 3.0 system using ssl where every page is supposed to be served as https

682274
put	get
in those cases i have to put the s in by hand to get the page to load

put	get
when you both get and put

682344
prepare	execute
basically i use a prepare statement and create and execute some dynamic sql in this search sp

682351
equals	gethashcode
to circumvent this override equals and gethashcode in your mixed in type

682416
filesystems	fat	filesystems	ntfs
keep in mind that on case-remembering filesystems fat ntfs you ll need to rename the file to something else first then to the case change

682443
hash	salt
on the other hand i m not really sure why you would want to restrict the length of passwords unless there s a hard database limit which there shouldn t be since you shouldn t be storing passwords in plain text in the database but instead hashing them down to something fixed size using a secure hash algorithm with a salt

682458
ienumerable	ienumerator
i can reach both ienumerable and ienumerator interfaces in delphi 6

682468
ubuntu	linux
on linux ubuntu operating system controls the maximum size

682484
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
it works fine in all browsers that i ve checked it in google-chrome firefox safari but ie8 adds a bunch of extra white space after the image which causes a horizontal scroll bar

682493
allocator	stl
note that the vector performs heap allocator to hold the actual data so it is likely to only contain a few pointers or a pointer and couple of lengths but it may contain whatever your compiler s stl implementation needs it to

682508
post	get
assuming you re using the net http library you can do a postback by just replacing your get with a post my_http.post my_url instead of my_http.get my_url

682568
width	height
two questions to start how are you creating imagesaver and are you sure your width and height are correct are you trying to save a 1024 x 1024 image

682572
hash	md5
hash is an md5 hash that is static for each rule

682591
hide	show
it s faster and more readable if you just do this again after you show hide the inner table

682602
hide	show
why don t you just always include the review comment form and use client side code to show or hide it

682611
dictionary	map
i have written a erlang code to find the timings for inserting fetching date into various data structures like list dictionary queue set and parallel map of the data structures

682617
hash	salt
but for a real world int32 hash rather than a mapping of pairs of integers to integers you re probably better off with a bit manipulation such as bob jenkin s mix and calling that with x y and a salt

682621
hide	show
the easiest way to do this i think is to create a simple html file and use javascript to show hide different bits of it

682641
rss	feed
treat php as a templating engine and have all the main pages pull the html marked up or xml articles from an rss feed from one site

682691
puts	gets
obviously git gets confused and puts invalid from linux s perspective filenames

682739
apache	lighttpd
finally comparing apache to other popular open-source servers such as lighttpd would show you what tasks are approached in a similar way by different programs and where there are trade-offs speed vs

682783
stdout	stderr
how can a process intercept stdout and stderr of another process on linux

682799
folder	directory
i tried changing the directory with os.chdir to reduce the folder trail lengths but when i try using os.system with .. folder filename it apparently can t handle relative path names

682801
autoresetevent	manualresetevent
further interlocked methods force cache coherency and all of the synchronization concepts monitor readerwriterlock mutex semaphore autoresetevent manualresetevent etc. call interlocked methods internally and thus ensure cache coherency

682816
trie	tree
if you are trying to optimize looking up a list of strings with a given prefix you might want to take a look at implementing a trie not to be mistaken with a regular tree data structure in c#

682829
gtk	cairo	gtk	gdk	gdk	cairo
the simplest combination would be cairo + pango + gdk the windowing part of gtk

682863
nofollow	noindex
currently i use the html meta tag robots - noindex nofollow to solve the problem

682863
nofollow	noindex
is there a robots.txt solution that works at least for some search bots or do i need to continue with noindex nofollow and live with the additional traffic

682878
udp	tcp
that function reinitializes all the sub-modules tcp udp smtp etc.

682878
udp	tcp
it will also clobber all of the tcp and udp socket you have open so you will have to re-open the sockets you want to use

682933
post	get
i still don t get the viewstate saved across post backs - thinking it s a bug in asp.net

682938
ant	maven
the build process is based on ant scripts and not maven

682959
gridview	objectdatasource
i use a gridview to bind using a objectdatasource using the datasource property

683028
joomla	typo3
i didn t work with these applications yet but afaik typo3 and ezpublish both php are considered much more professional than joomla

683045
hide	show
just remember that cells are reused if you call tableview dequeuereusablecellwithidentifier which you should do so you ll have to explicitly show hide control whose visibility may have been changed

683061
profiler	vtune
i believe this is what vtune a phenomenal profiler for this level uses

683081
for-loop	loops
another thing i d like to point out in c# you can delcare your int variable use in a for-loop right inside loops

683084
ant	cruisecontrol
describes a setup for integrating qtp with ant and cruisecontrol

683095
versioning	upgrade
this file contains one or more xsl transformations that upgrade documents targeting earlier schema versioning

683150
public	protected
well now foo can t be protected so it s public

683158
autoresetevent	manualresetevent
autoresetevent manualresetevent

683162
folder	directory
if this doesn t work you have to install iis and set a virtual directory directly on your development folder

683164
accessor	properties
i don t have any definitive answers creating a method properties accessor that isn t mapped and that returns a default null-object if the actual address is null

683204
stringbuilder	stringwriter
if you really want to write into memory pass in a stringwriter or a stringbuilder like this

683215
versioning	upgrade
how do you upgrade the default for an up-to-date versioning

683294
margin	text-align
wrap it all in a div with margin auto and make body have text-align center

683362
getter	setter
setter and getter are forbidden

683397
width	height
if you re using an embedded asset the width height properties are available immediately on the source object

683440
hide	show
setting the class to twocolumn hide the middle column and setting the class to threecolumn show the middle column

683444
inherited	properties
i would say that the standard approach here is to wrap the class you want to inherited as a protected instance variable and then emulate all the non-private members method properties events etc. of the wrapped class in your container class

683485
children	parent
also i would really rather the object s parent be bound before the children are constructed

683507
width	height
modifying this string you can get to print on any paper size and any orientation switching height and width for landscape but the report itself must be configured in the same page layout

683524
treemap	linkedhashmap
i suggest a linkedhashmap or a treemap

683524
comparator	comparable	treemap	linkedhashmap
a linkedhashmap keeps the keys in the order they were inserted while a treemap is kept sorted via a comparator or the natural comparable ordering of the elements

683524
put	get	treemap	linkedhashmap
treemap has o log n performance for containskey get put and remove according to the javadocs while linkedhashmap is o 1 for each

683582
stdout	stderr
you are accumulating open file handles see ulimit -n setrlimit rlimit_nofile rlimit_ofile and you ultimately hit a 2048 open file descriptors limit 2045 + stdin + stdout + stderr .

683610
stdout	stderr
this will increase the number of files each process can have open to 10003 remember that you always start with three open stdin stdout and stderr

683642
wxpython	pyqt
check pyqt gtk or wxpython libraries

683642
notepad++	gedit	kate	gedit
notepad++ idle kate gedit ..

683642
post	get
urllib and urllib2 httpâ scripting like downloading post get resquests etc

683693
inherited	properties
another option is to use an inherited attached properties

683711
move	drag
example user resizes it to a smaller chunk by mouse weal then move it by using drag n drop

683723
range	max	range	min	min	max
use a double slider with a min and max display range

683740
stdout	stderr
also the allocconsole attachconsole methods are funny in that if you run your program from the command line or a batch file and try to redirect the output stdout and or stderr to a file it wil not work - it will not go to the file

683854
realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
c implementations discussed in the context of character arrays as c dynamic string length used malloc realloc and free but these should be avoided in c++ code

683866
put	get
- when the user click on the bookmarklet it will send to my server the url then my server will get back to the client page with the scrapping javascript files which will load with the iframe load the java script will scrap the data on the current page and put on the iframe

683867
for-loop	loops
you can use msdn as a reference on how to use a for-loop or a for each loops if you haven t learned for loops yet you can also use a do loops

683908
required	placeholder
the .net built-in serialization is an option but it does required you to add placeholder on the specific pieces that you want to extend in the future

683909
client-side	server-side
bottom line is it s a measure of your client-side server-side skills against the bandwidth and server load considerations

683921
classname	inherited
first of all you can write everything including c# code in a single .ascx file and inherited from whatever class you want to that ultimately inherited from usercontrol by specifying inherited attribute or you might want to omit it and without a classname attribute

683923
hide	show
anyhow you probably don t want to do a show hide widget like this

683930
free	realloc
if the address of a local variable is passed to realloc it may attempt to free its memory and allocate it elsewhere

683944
int	double
i created a subroutine one using a double float it returns 2 int values

683966
inherited	properties
even if you don t use code behind class you can still inherited properties from base control

683970
put	get
if you put the point on the first line and hit m-q you get this

684011
inherited	properties
you can create a class that inherited from system.windows.forms.nativewindow which provides basic message loop capability and reference the handle properties in its constructor to create its handle and hook it into the message loop

684088
width	height
i got this idea from php image where the construct either receives one argument a path or 2 arguments a width and height

684115
webkit	gecko
the only practical difference to browsers between strict and transitional is that strict triggers standards mode and transitional triggers almost standards mode in gecko presto webkit etc

684168
width	height
i d suggest you use smaller width and height values

684170
maven	pom.xml
but to use any super pom.xml you need to have your flex maven project declare the super pom.xml as the parent with a block similar to this

684202
getter	setter
you can automate the generation of javadoc comments for getter setter from eclipse via the code templates to save on the amount of documentation you have to write

684220
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
tested on safari firefox and opera osx

684331
awt	swing
jfc swing architecture is different from awt architecture

684331
awt	swing	swt	swing
there are several differences but the most significant is awt uses native code to render widgets so does swt while swing is light weight because all the is painted using java

684333
width	height
the control is of a particular width and will be up to 2 lines in height

684342
accessor	properties
if you picked this up from the msdn docs on the function take another look - the text properties example that they give is retrieving the text value from one of its child controls which means that the properties accessor needs to make sure the child controls exist

684378
min	max
it will probably work strangely if your min max values are not the same as your min max values for the slider i would suggest just using min values 0 max values values.length - 1 as your min max options on the slider then you should always be safe

684425
put	get
the problem is that the list doesn t get ordered and the distance method doesn t get fired i put a breakpoint in there but doesn t get hit

684456
vim	emacs
i was using vim so there may be other dependencies gotchas that are emacs specific but i m pretty sure a terminal that supports 256 colours is important

684474
disk	ram
writing solaris device drivers in java covers a a ram disk device written in java

684483
g++	gcc
gcc g++ is indeed the compiler of choice

684497
button	checkbox
if the user clicks the button i must recolect the checkbox selected inside the checklistbox and do some processing

684518
rss	feed
.net has a class to parse atom and rss feed

684537
put	get
put the grid and a get string rowname string colname method in a class if you want a cleaner api

684544
awt	swing
i suggest looking at swingtimer set a swing timer to notify you every few ms and that notification will come in on the awt thread so that you can use it to click your button then just exit and wait for the next timer event

684625
pull	push
i added logging into the functions used for push pull operations during transfer - they are not ever called for any of the calls that fail this way

684656
hex	binary
it is actually stored as 0x000f in hex which is the same as 0000 0000 0000 1111 in binary

684687
floyd-warshall	dijkstra
as j _ random _ hacker mentions floyd-warshall is o n 3 time and o n 2 storage no matter if you are only calculating transitive closure or not and using dijkstra s algorithm requires an o nlog n calculation for each query

684694
freebsd	linux
get your code to compile on linux on freebsd and on windows

684735
hash	md5
in other words there is a technique for constructing multiple byte sequences with the same md5 hash without having to use the brute force method of trial and error where on average you d expect to have to try about 2 64 or 16 billion billion files before hitting on a collision

684735
hash	md5
if you re not concerned about the case where somebody might deliberately try to fool your duplicate identification and you re just worried about the chances of a duplicate hash by chance then md5 is absolutely fine

684760
pull	push
ssh+ease of pull push in windows

684816
unix	bsd
also the bsd platform is not easiest of the unix family to begin from zero

684838
int	chars
the first parameter is of type chars for the data to be written and the second is of type int asking for the size of data to be written to the binary file

684923
cpu	processors
in some processors the hardware team might only have connected a chip select from the cpu to a device and leave it up to you to decide what address triggers that select pin

684923
hex	binary
but you still need a raw binary image often in a hex format suitable for a prom programmer of some form so you will need to use the objcopy utility from binutil to transform the linker output to a suitable format

684932
versioning	upgrade
artinsoft wrote the built in vb.net upgrade wizard this is their improved versioning

684932
vb.net	vb6

685066
width	height
viewport sizes width and height of buffer image texture etc.

685078
ironruby	ironpython
for example there are silverlight applications using ironpython ironruby

685140
jar	war
make sure you program project is divided into modules under a common umbrella module so that each module produces a single binary artifact jar war ... possibly accompanied by the javadoc of the source code behind that artifact a zip with the source code etc

685140
maven	pom.xml
now you can create the parent maven module pom.xml with artifact type pom.xml consisting of one of the modules below

685158
ready	each
for each frame i check its ready state

685195
profiling	debugging
user memory profiling to debugging and optimize your web application

if you re trying to do normal c++ development put as little as you can get away with in the header as it means client code doesn t depend on too many implementation details

685253
children	parent
children in the hierarchy need to have just one parent

685271
websphere	ibm

hide	show
i m using simple jquery show and hide and the first content is set to show as default

685442
int	boolean
in c# like in java i think boolean and numbers are two different things you can only use boolean in if statements there is not implicit conversion if you use an int it won t compile

685526
inline	inlining
but if draw_line et al are defined in a header file rather than in a source cpp file you may have methods which are supposedly declared as inline in the header file which aren t actually properly inlining

685591
datarow	dataview
use dataview and .select wherever you find yourself looping through datarow objects

685596
curb	libcurl
- curb libcurl for ruby

685598
komodo	scite
if you still need a ruby editor on windows use komodo edit or scite

685601
free	malloc
does stack allocation call malloc free functions implicitly

685614
free	malloc
no stack allocation does not call malloc free

685616
free	malloc
stack allocation doesn t use anything like malloc free

685624
free	alloca
a well-done alloca will only require a scant few instructions and there is no cost or even a need to free it when you re done

685633
aptana	radrails
but it is actively developed as part of aptana radrails though

685653
free	malloc
so stack allocation doesn t malloc free

685658
stdout	stderr
likely that you just need to read the stdout and stderr of the process or it will hang since its output buffer is full

685658
stdout	stderr
this is easiest if you redirect stderr to stdout just to be safe

685680
getter	setter
keywords are in english naming conventions like for example getter setter are also english same for standard names for design patterns

685798
switching	screens
it applies only when applications go to full screens and then switching back to window or terminate

685798
switching	screens
so it does not seem to be related to resolution switching because i ve seen application games that even when they are not in the same resolution as desktop when they switching back windows on desktop are restored as they once were before the full screens application was run

685800
free	malloc
and it would make sense for those whole-stack blocks to be allocated using the same heap management as is exposed through malloc free

685800
free	malloc
a whole stack is malloc -ed all in one go when a thread starts up and then it gets suballocated from and then it gets free -d in one go

685801
google-chrome	safari
in google-chrome safari if your stylesheet link is busted all of your links might end up red

685850
ora-00911	oracle
when i try to execute them against oracle it gives me this error ora-00911 invalid character

685862
rss	feed
what is the best way to develop a widget from a rss feed

685926
hash	md5
one way hash with md5 or sha1 are a way of adding a layer of security at the db level

685934
free	malloc
i would think it would be difficult for .net to free considering in c++ you need to know if it was allocated with new malloc mm_malloc before you can correctly free it

685980
sqldatasource	objectdatasource
whether it is options i can add onto the sqldatasource things i can do to the sql query or use an alternative such as an objectdatasource

685990
put	get
it is only going to work with the data that you get from it meaning you should optimize your sql or the data put into it before sending it off to sql meaning you should optimize your application code

685997
rss	feed
there s tons of free libraries for php that consume rss feed

685997
rss	feed
1 i m wishing to aggregate some top items from up to 3 different rss feed into one stream for consumption

686003
tcplistener	tcpclient
the use of tcpclient and tcplistener just means a few less lines of code

686015
width	margin
the resulting margin width is the maximum of the adjoining margin widths

686053
google-chrome	firefox
i ve searched and found methods to focus and position my caret at the end of the updated input content and google-chrome and ie behave themselves and auto scroll to show the cursor in the visible area of the input box but when the text input is full and overflows firefox 3.0.7 leaves the correctly positioned caret out of view to the right though if you press right arrow on keyboard you can get to it without disturbing the position

686073
ssl	https
how do i ensure that my users can not physically type in http to bypass my ssl and ensure that every page is https

686093
public	protected
if it s protected or public both work

686138
innodb	myisam
for instance myisam is widely held to be faster at selects than innodb

686138
innodb	myisam
it s better on writes than myisam and also innodb never needs to be repaired.

686213
pop-up	dialog
i have an application which has an asynchronous operation built into it that loops over a large number of items and performs lengthy calculations on each item as this occurs certain conditions will cause the application to pop-up a modal dialog for user input

686257
button	checkbox
alternatively you would have to create a button or checkbox that the user selects

686273
fileinputstream	filechannel
using filereader or fileinputstream won t work - you ll have to use either filechannel or randomaccessfile to loop through the file backwards from the end

686290
inherited	properties
now borrowing constructor is only another pattern to make a sort of inherited so i could not use prototype and so all the chain superclass properties are

686296
integer	unsigned
for example it looks for an unsigned byte that denotes a type of message being sent followed by an unsigned integer that denotes the length of message then another unsigned byte which is really a bit field with some flags set or unset and etc.

686296
integer	unsigned
i m just wondering how to reliably generate this data and make sure i m sending it correctly that i m really sending an unsigned byte rather than say a signed integer or worse a string

686303
int	chars
you couldn t even have a pointer to it because i recently got told some platforms use pointers of different size for chars than for int or long

686332
folder	directory
to make it accessible on the network all you have to do is go to iisâ create new virtual directoryâ point to the above folder and remove anonymous access from directory settings page

686371
mouseup	mousedown
mouseup will fire when the button is released but is there a better way than to have some sort of timer that triggers periodically between mousedown and mouseup

686379
inherited	properties
by calling .call you don t inherited in the classical sense of the word instead you tell child to apply parents prototype onto itself and thus child.prototype has cloned properties and methods from parent

686410
hash	md5
just take the first 8 digits of the md5 hash

686410
hash	md5
this works because md5 is uniformly distributed over its hash address space

686410
hash	md5
this means that any consecutive sequence of md5 hash digits will itself be a uniformly distributed hash

686421
superclass	subclassing
do i subclassing the domain classes with composite keys adapting them so that nh can use a surrogate key but my domain is none-the-wiser seeing only the superclass

686454
floating-point	fractions
a binary floating-point number is actually represented by three integers a sign bit s a significand or coefficient fractions b and an exponent e

686458
ubuntu	debian
debian and ubuntu fix this by defining the normal actions the average user would expect in the global etc zsh zshrc file

686458
ubuntu	debian
following the relevant code it is the same on debian and ubuntu

686458
ubuntu	debian
so if you are connecting to a debian or ubuntu box you don t have to do anything

686458
ubuntu	debian
the solution is of course to add the lines from the debian ubuntu zshrc to your own .zshrc

686458
freebsd	linux
i can set my terminal type to linux in putty and connect to freebsd servers without problems

686482
public	protected
i have succeeded in accessing all private fields excluding those which are inherited as well as all of the public and protected inherited fields

686510
allocator	stl
use stl if leads to performance problems exchange with homebrew container or allocator didn t come to it yet but i m not doing a high-end 3d game

686550
inherited	properties
i haven t tried it but you should be able to access the base type private members through the type.basetype properties and recursively accumulate all the private fields through the inherited hierarchy

686559
web.py	cherrypy
if you want something more light-weight might i suggest cherrypy or web.py

686560
actualheight	actualwidth
try using the actualheight and actualwidth properties

686622
button	checkbox
i m designing a website for the high end mobile phones and i want to know how the different ui elements button checkbox list boxes textfields etc look like on different mobile browsers eg safari webkit ie etc on different devices nokia iphone etc

686667
switching	screens
when switching back to desktop resolution i would enumwindows again but with a different callback which sets each of the running application windows position and size with setwindowpos using the list of rects i ve saved before switching to full screens

686695
allocator	stl
you can also swap the allocator in stl containers for a custom one

686717
rss	feed
i am parsing rss feed with the format as specified here

686793
gtk	motif
this also explains why swing needs all those ui components that do the actual painting to mimic a specific look and feel windows gtk motif etc.

686882
width	height
i want to set the height width of only that frame and i do not want to try and pixelify its children

686882
width	height
i want both of them to take 100 height and let the tree take 30 and textarea take 70 width if the tree is expanded to 10 levels then i am ok with scrollpane

686882
width	height
just say height 100 and width to be 30 etc and we are done

686894
width	height
clearly the div s marked v.div must expand to fill variable height and width

686906
filtering	grouping
according the analysis in the article even if you separate out an interface by which you can communicate with gpl d software on the command line you should do that as a clean room implementation with one grouping that works with the gpl d code one grouping that implements the other software and all specs passing between them being filtering by lawyers

686908
folder	directory
so i am pretty sure this is happening because i put the files into a folder on my server instead of just on my server but i would like to keep my files organized so if anyone knows how to make it work from inside a directory

686982
width	height
the padding on the #variablesize would have to be equal to or greater than the width height of the images

686997
listview	gridview
return that list to the gridview or listview to display

686997
listview	gridview
this way your listview or gridview won t be tightly coupled to the method that you are retrieving your data

687007
mvp	presenter
consider implementing mvp model view presenter pattern

687007
getter	setter
your codebehind of aspx page is then just connector of events and getter setter of properties

687015
width	height
have you tried logging your view s width and height

687102
put	get
if i could put them in a temp table i could use the results effectively but i can t figure out how to get them in a temp table

687110
accessor	properties
it would be better to make a properties or accessor to retrieve it than directly provide public access to the by default private button field member

687154
jqmodal	thickbox
also check out jqmodal for a little newer plugin with some features thickbox lacks like callbacks

687183
fancybox	simplemodal
we ve used both simplemodal and fancybox and had good results

687212
wxruby	wxformbuilder
then wxwidgets wxruby has the wxformbuilder

687300
width	height
animate height and width to auto

687323
udp	tcp
quartz composer however supports opensoundcontrol which allows you to send named parameters floats ints and strings over a udp or tcp connection

687344
getter	setter
automatic getter and setter

687349
accessor	properties
in c# 3.0 and later auto-implemented properties make property-declaration more concise when no additional logic is required in the properties accessor

687349
accessor	properties
they also enable client code to create objects when you declare a properties as shown in the following example the compiler creates a private anonymous backing field that can only be accessed through the properties s get and set accessor

687354
pop-up	dialog
excel 2007 will pop-up a dialog informing you that the file extension does not match the file content

687507
post	get
if you post an example of your code i think you ll get a better answer

687548
google-chrome	firefox
this works perfect on ie and google-chrome from the web server and when debugging locally but firefox just works when debugging locally and not from the web server in the web server clat and clong return nan

687576
rss	feed
if you have a small enough team using adequately svn commit comments and exploit them a tool that generates an rss feed like trac for instance can be an easy and efficient way to promote communication

687576
rss	feed
- ensure everybody actually reads better even keeps posted to through an rss reader the feed

687602
mouseover	mouseout
on my website each menu button has it s corners rounded using the dd_roundies library and has mouseover mouseout and onclick handlers assigned via jquery

687602
mouseover	mouseout
the most obvious problem is that the background that is applied on mouseover is square not round and on some occasions the background doesn t disappear after you click on on a menu item and then mouseout

687604
rss	feed
it is very good at reading rss feed

687613
x86	mips
will some arbitrary c code ran on a mips workstation complete quicker than when ran on a x86 workstation

687633
hide	show
i m working with course management system moodle and in the admin the folder tree which uses folder icons displays for about a second the alt attribute given in this case open folder then it hide and show the image when the image is ready

687675
pop-up	dialog
i know how to open a webpage in a new window and add javascript so the print dialog pop-up

687676
hash	md5
another option would be to compute a fixed-length hash from the file path using an inexpensive hash function such as md5 though md5 is not strong enough to use for passwords it s strong enough to ensure uniqueness given the input data in this case

687696
pascal	delphi
i compile and test most of my delphi components and libraries also with free pascal

687704
hide	show
i think you may need to call a dialog show and hide to get it to appear and disappear

687766
viewdidload	viewwillappear
when i add the viewcontroller from the nib the viewdidload gets hit the images load from the nib but then the controller code stops there no viewwillappear etc

687767
google-chrome	firefox
i have tried in google-chrome and firefox

687785
children	parent
one of my csla object let s say parent has many children let s call them children - a list of child

687785
children	parent
parent is a editable root businessbase and children is an editable child list businesslistbase and child is editable child

687786
ironruby	ironpython
the dlr is not script specific so over time more script languages will be built on top of it but at the moment the ones i know about are ironruby ironpython and jscript

687788
udp	tcp
it is mostly tcp but it does include a section on how to alter the code to use udp instead

687790
rdfstore	allegrograph
allegrograph rdfstore

687813
g++	gcc
i use gcc g++

687831
subtraction	addition
it looks like combinations of addition subtraction and testing at least are possible on the hardware

687879
vbscript	jscript
the way to do this used to be the windows script host which permitted you to host either jscript or vbscript

687881
folder	directory
you could launch the packages each with a different configuration or configurations pointing to different working directory input folder etc

687883
viewdidload	viewwillappear
ok seems a little off but i added viewwillappear to viewdidload and that worked but this doesn t seem the right way to do it correct

687895
hide	show
if you want a lazier answer you could use javascript and hide the div when you click on the map and show it when you close the map

687902
ia-32	x86
at present both should both work for ia-32 x86 x86-32 and x86-64 amd64 environments correctly

687918
min	max
also orderby.first is the same as min and orderbydescending.first is the same as max

687948
terminate	timeout
will terminate at the earlier of the two tlrbsf program termination or timeout elapsed

687948
stdout	stderr
and for bonus points runs the tlrbsf command in the foreground and any sleep or extra process in the background such that the stdin stdout stderr of the tlrbsf command can be redirected same as if it had been run directly

687953
equals	gethashcode
if you want to use a custom key type then you should consider implementing iequatable and overriding equals object and gethashcode unless the default reference or struct equality is sufficient for determining equality of keys

687992
google-chrome	firefox
it works perfectly in firefox and google-chrome but fails miserably in ie6

687995
post	get
if i do a left join to get the parent post on all rows and then sort by that date first all the original post group together as they d have a value of null

687995
post	get
if two people create a post at the same time comments on the two post would get munged together as they d have the same timestamp

opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
mozilla extension tutorial for firefox safari and opera

688032
getelementsbytagname	getelementbyid
see getelementbyid getelementsbytagname for targeting

688038
aptana	radrails
aptana ide with the radrails plugin would have to be the best choice

688045
put	get
how much memory can i put into my machine until i get to the point where the os hits its limit

688053
boost	stl
can i put stl and boost headers there even though they have templates

688091
boost	stl
the quick answer the stl and boost headers do indeed belong in the precompiled header file even though these header files define template classes

688091
boost	stl
the reason is this - the generation of the precompiled header can take a long time because the boost stl and windows libraries are very large

688127
subtract	add
of course you ll have to add subtract one --- or just put undefined as the first element

688135
disk	ram
+1 trick you should use a ram disk download to accelerate i o

688135
disk	ram
vs.net makes tons of i o calls and ram disk are much faster than real disk

688135
disk	ram
if you turn off your computer ram disk disappers

688136
rss	feed
the hashtags are in the content title nodes within the rss feed

688136
rss	feed
if you look at the rss feed and then view the html source my struggle might be clearer

688232
cassini	iis
have you tried using iis for debugging rather than the built-in web server cassini

688249
addclass	removeclass
your best bet would be to addclass and removeclass on the row

688265
switching	screens
note if you only see half a screens worth you re character encoding is not unicode unicode characters cover several screens type set encoding utf-8 to switching to utf-8

688274
apache-poi	docx4j	docx	.doc
you could use docx4j or indeed just apache-poi to read the docx and apache-poi to write it out as a .doc

688302
vim	emacs
i have gotten to know my way around a few programming languages and i d like to try my hand at making a command-line text editor -- something that runs in the terminal like vim emacs nano but is pure text no guis please

688333
apache-poi	docx4j
if you must work with .doc docx4j has rudimentary conversion using apache-poi hwpf

688343
daemons	systemd
on unix operating systemd it is common practice to â œlockâ a program often a daemons by use of a special lock file the pid file

688348
urwid	ncurses
i would recommend the excellent urwid toolkit - it s much easier to use than straight ncurses

688359
user-controls	tabcontrol
i am trying to get zindexing working on a custom user-controls but it clips the bottom of the control when it pops up inside a tabcontrol as shown

688368
apache-poi	docx4j
docx4j or apache-poi both of which are asl v2

688387
post	get
the situation is that you have to work with an image api and you have to make a post request to get an image stream that you want to display in the rest of your web page

688391
itext	docx4j	doc	rtf
if you can go from doc to docx then you could use docx4j to generate rtf using itext or fop i haven t tested the rtf output of either itext or fop so i m not sure how they ll handle tables

688391
apache-poi	docx4j
as to going from doc to docx docx4j has a basic proof of concept of this using apache-poi s hwpf

688393
udp	tcp
if that s the case and you need synchronous communication you can definitely use tcp sockets or just udp

688409
int	chars
the extracts can be obtained in cpu-endianness-independent way by using the right shift operation against the int values and casting the result by the byte type such as unsigned chars

688421
post	get
you ll need something else like what vrish88 suggests so that you can make a get request to the destroy action to get a form then post that form to actually delete the phone number

688448
stdout	stderr
redirect the standard streams stdin stdout stderr since a daemon process no longer has a controlling terminal

688507
int	chars
the data array is an array of unsigned chars not unsigned int

688509
free	malloc
if you never add a constructor destructor assignment operators or virtual functions to your structure using malloc free for allocation is safe

688509
free	malloc
unfortunately c++ does not provide a good mechanism to do this so you often end up with such malloc free hacks in real world applications

688510
disk	ram
while i didn t do this for compiling i did do it for similar processes and i ended up using a ram disk with scripts that automated the synchronization

688510
disk	ram
to start development start the ram disk and pull the current base line

688516
vb.net	vb6
or you could go with vb.net vb6 or what have you

688522
int	chars
i was bored enough to try doing it with a chars array and using convert.touint32 string int to convert to a uint from base 2

688567
disk	ram
you might want to investigate more than creating ram disk

688567
disk	ram
something which looks like it will have very little gain since the os is doing disk caching with ram

688567
disk	ram
if you chew up ram for ram disk the os has less working ram to cache data and to run your code - you ll end up with more swapping and worse disk performance than otherwise note you should profile this option before completely discarding it

688624
bazaar	git
you can use a distribute version control system like bazaar git mercurial

688630
free	malloc
instead of malloc and free you could use and operator delete p since struct packet is a pod type and does not currently benefit from having its default constructor and its destructor called

688636
disk	ram
i ve moved my temp to a ram disk and that gives me minor speedups in general

688636
disk	ram
get a ram disk that supports automatically loading saving disk images so you don t have to use boot scripts to do this

688636
disk	ram
place your often-used large header files on the ram disk and override your compiler standard paths to use the ram drive copies

688636
disk	ram
keep your source files on your harddrive and sync to the ram disk - not the other way around

688720
explode	substr
given that i know the exact format of my input would perhaps using some form of string manipulation substr or explode combined with mktime be better

688762
post	get
to answer how do you get a form to post to different actions depending on the button that is clicked you could change the action attribute of the form using javascript depending on the link button clicked

688769
codeblocks	anjuta
codeblocks and anjuta are pretty fair enough as pointed out by brian campbell

688779
setinterval	settimeout
here is some reading comparing setinterval and settimeout

688787
switching	screens
you can switching between screens windows with

688804
rsa	aes
for many reasons you should normally only use rsa to encrypt a key and then use aes or a similar symmetric cipher algorithm to encrypt your actual text

688824
internationalization	localization
you also gain the advantage of much easier localization internationalization of your resources

688865
button	checkbox
the checkbox are exactly the same as the radio button with the exception that they are not a group

688865
put	get
when i put an alert in the js code above i do get the alert so i know i m good there but because i don t know js i m not able to troubleshoot this any further

688887
nunit	mstest
unlike nunit testdriven.net etc - mstest copied things around into a different folder for each test

688913
rss	feed
and then send it to an rss feed

688918
rss	feed
to put the image into your rss feed you would save it to a file and put the url into your feed

688926
gif	png
i want to make sure that during file upload time only the file of the format jpeg png and gif are allowed

688926
gif	png
so the file of type below in the screenshot must show jpeg png and gif

689004
rss	feed
i really suggest adding eclipsezone to your rss feed reading list

689015
puts	gets
your forgot something in the update.php every in place editor does an ajax request to the update file and then puts in the edited element the things it gets in the update.php with that request

689025
put	get
does anyone know where i can get a standalone installer to put these files on my build server

689042
getter	setter
i need to know which is the language used in the template code used for generating getter setter methods in myeclipse

689042
getter	setter
1 i want to use my static utility method in the getter setter method template code of myeclipse

689106
put	get
none of the complicated solutions which i know i can get to work if i put some effort in it talks how to detect this particular file just pias for word excel and then some

689204
feedback	review
write some python code and post it on so for review and feedback whether it is pythonic

689213
ubuntu	linux
both of the answers from devsolar work tested on linux ubuntu but the xargs version is preferable if there may be many files since it will avoid running into command line length limits

689214
unix	bsd
the person should also be comfortable with using linux or bsd on the desktop since that means they have to interact with the unix system on two different levels both the server side and the desktop side

689268
stdout	stderr
can you wrap it in some shell script that captures the log files stdout stderr and the exit code which should give some indication as to how it died

689274
x86	64bit
each subkey contains information on the core including the identifier which contains either x86 or some 64bit in text including processor family and model

689292
websphere	ibm
it already exists if you want to try it ibm websphere application server 6.1 componentization overview

689344
freebsd	linux
from freebsd to amd64 linux

689353
integer	fractions
since a year is always 52 and a fractions weeks long just rounding up to the next full integer will always give you enough elements

689552
post	get
use post ignore get

689564
free	malloc
1 malloc the memory in the driver free it in the app

689564
free	malloc
if you have access to malloc free and there are no real time concerns or memory fragmentation issues your heap is large enough then this is a fairly easy approach

689576
google-chrome	safari
and also i assumed that since it didnt work in google-chrome that safari would be the same but you know what they say about assuming it works in safari but not google-chrome

689591
int	boolean
an int zero a float zero boolean false or datetime.minvalue

subtract	add
i mean every example i see illustrates how to add or subtract to parameters

689705
implements	extends
i m extends the class microsoft.mappoint.plugin.plugin and it has two abstract methods that the tutorial doesn t talk about which i have implements

689724
jquery	scriptaculous
i have been using jquery and i need to use scriptaculous and protoype

689724
jquery	scriptaculous
is there a procedure that prototype and scriptaculous has that should not conflict with jquery

689853
profiling	debugging
do you need to have your projects built in debugging or release to profiling them

689853
profiling	debugging
so i go back to debugging mode and i try to run it and it tells me that half of my projects need to be recompiled with the profiling switch on

689857
getter	setter
not allowing properties to be declared in an interface would only force developers to create getter and setter manually

689871
sorting	filtering
event1 and event2 fire and basically will change things about the serverside controls rendering sorting filtering etc so when they fire i need to call populatecontrols for sure

689893
prng	random
math random auto is a cpan module implementing the well-known mersenne twister prng

689894
profiling	debugging
if you re finding it difficult to use there s a really great .net profiling called nprof and if you re debugging non-clr projects amd has a really spectacular statistical profiling called code analyst

689949
min	max
edit sorry change max to min

689955
sorting	filtering
covers domain services connecting server data to silverlight client the data grid paging sorting filtering the data form control validation and more

689964
equals	gethashcode
i would suggest that you create a small custom class exposing the bool and int properties and override its gethashcode and equals methods then use this as the key

689987
equals	gethashcode
also consider overriding gethashcode and equals methods

689991
width	height
i have an image inside a span tag the span has a set width and height and is set to overflow hidden

689998
equals	gethashcode
to make this more robust encapsulate the composite key as a type a class that contains the two fields ensuring you override the equals and gethashcode methods correctly

690002
stdout	stderr
then the java process has to read handle the process stdout stderr usually you do this in a thread per stream to prevent blocking - if you have 2 000 processes using this mechanism then you re looking at 4000 threads

690005
min	max
dbname is the catagory field min dbstart and max dbend fields are the high low values for the series.the values are always for one day only

690035
width	height
if the width and height of the image varies i think the only way to do this is with javascript

690045
macbook	isight
i use opencv under mac os x and it works very well with the built-in isight of my macbook and i believe it works equally well under the other platforms

i would convert your while loops into a for-loop like so

690108
debian	linux
im working on linux environment debian

690125
postgresql	mysql
since you get pretty much the same quality and advanced technology with free database servers like mysql or postgresql and since i use python django and .net they integrate pretty well

690125
postgresql	mysql
both have advantages and both are cool we ve reach the point that it doesn t matter which dbms you pick the 4 big ones mysql postgresql mssql or oracle

690133
pull	push
xmltextreader parses xml using pull parsing the java equivalent of this is stax which is basically the inverse of sax push parsing

690160
vbscript	vba
i ve done mild vba but not a vbscript master

690196
ant	maven
edit3 in java you would define a java model with all your favoured documentation then run java2wsdl preferably as an ant maven task to create your wsdl however i have found you need to hand-reorder the fields in it

690220
width	height
when the document is fully loaded take the first input element with type text and apply it s height and width to all input elements with type password

690308
gridview	radgrid
i don t know about radgrid but you can bind that datareader to the built-in grid controls like gridview

690327
aptana	radrails
i am currently using aptana radrails for ruby on rails development on my local system

690380
firebird	dbisam
something like textolution s proprietary add-on for firebird looks like it could accommodate constructing single complex nested query that would apply both regular and fulltext criteria but dbisam does it more elegantly

690400
profiling	instrumentation
a tracing profiling adds code to your program a process known as instrumentation to essentially log what is going on

690400
profiling	instrumentation
tracing profiling are slower but more accurate they also require that the program be changed the instrumentation process which could potentially introduce bugs not that i have heard of it happening.

690412
width	height
here s what i m trying to accomplish there is a div with a fixed width and height and inside it there is a gridview

690412
width	height
if the gridview s width or height exceeds the fixed size of the div i d like the scroll bars to appear on the div

690419
cvs	svn
there are quite a number of tools available and ant the build system we re using has a task that will maintain a build number but it s not clear how to manage this with multiple concurrent developers using cvs svn or similar

690419
ant	maven
ant and maven and hudson and cruise control provide easy means for getting build numbers into a .properties file or into a .txt .html file

690419
cvs	svn
i ll mark as the answer anyone who can give a soup-to-nuts description for this particular case including cvs tagging scheme relevant ci config items and release procedure that folds the build number into the release such that it s programmatically accessible. if you want to ask answer for another particular configuration say svn maven cruise control i ll link to the question from here

690457
gmail	hotmail
mail hotmail or gmail

690473
cassini	iis
due to security aspects that i have to write cassini can t serve as a test server anymore - i have to use iis we have security card readers here

690473
sqlconnection	sqltransaction
i looked at impersonation but i get the impression it s not compatible with our system - the business rules make a call to a common routine to create a sqlconnection object and open it maybe even a sqltransaction object to go with it and this object is used for the rest of the business rules and data-access layer until it s done

690491
sudo	passwd
that works everywhere but does not cache the passwd and asks for the root and not the user passwd as sudo does

690499
kde	gnome
now in kde based distros you ll have kdesu while in gnome based it ll be gksu and gksudo

690524
postgresql	mysql	interbase	firebird
in case you need other db engine support zeosdb is the answer again it supports mysql postgresql interbase firebird ms sql sybase oracle and sqlite

690587
httprequest	httpresponse
how would i do it using httpresponse and httprequest

690628
webclient	webrequest
what you could do is derive a class from the webclient class and then override the getwebrequest and the getwebresponse methods to alter the webrequest webresponse instances that the base implementation returns

690632
postgresql	mysql
the sql must run unmodified on sqlite postgresql and mysql if possible

690643
postgresql	mysql
most of my experience is with mysql but i ve also used oracle which is case-sensitive like postgresql

690651
width	height
the map displays with a width of 800px and a height around 480px on a computer screen

690764
tabcontrol	tabitem
i have a tabcontrol who s tabitem are supplied by an observablecollection - i can design the observablecollection items anyway that i choose

690771
filesystems	ntfs
vss requires that all users have nearly full control at the filesystems level ntfs permissions of the files that make up the repository

690802
jar	war
as an alternative since you are only using the ear to wrap the war and not actually sharing the jar file

690802
jar	war
put the jar in the lib directory of the war

690806
cvs	svn
if the other developers haven t used svn or cvs then it could be costly although all you need is one person who really gets to know the system and then coach the rest

690809
slideup	slidedown
i want to slideup some divs then slidedown 1 div

690824
hide	show
if you want to momentarily show the hidden one and then slideup it you can just switch my original answer from hide to show and then do the slideup

690860
jar	war
the ant build script puts the build number in the manifest file of jar war files that are created during the build

690860
jar	war
for a dev version of a jar war the developer can find the svn revision from the jar war and look up the corresponding code in svn

690865
client-side	server-side
see xhost xhost.c for the client-side and xserver os access.c for the server-side

690876
implements	sealed
several years ago as a school project i implements in c a write-once read-many mapping and other collections which took an existing collection and then sealed it by creating a much more memory and cache-efficient representation a graph was stored as an optimized array

690944
width	height
so you move the rectangle left and up half of the change in width and height

i am migrating c# code from using a networkstream to sslstream however where i use stream.dataavailable i get the error

691111
post	put
handling post and put methods with lullaby

691125
peer	p2p
you re p2p so every peer must have at least one socket open to every other peer

691125
peer	p2p
however on a normal p2p network of any size you will almost never have multiple files being transferred concurrently between two peer

691157
bash	zsh
this should work in bash 4.0 available now on most major distros though not on os x unless you install it yourself ksh and zsh

691182
hide	show
displays for about a second the alt attribute given in this case open folder then it hide and show the image when the image is ready

691231
django	turbogears	pylons	turbogears
the growth in popularity of django turbogears and pylons is driving demand for better deployment solutions

691299
throttling	throttle
if i throttle the maxconcurrentcalls down to 20 15 10 or anything lower the instances performance counter show that wcf is respecting the throttling

691317
client-side	server-side
therefore server-side code is relatively expensive compared to client-side code on any site big enough to need to run more than one server

691325
min	max
what you have is that you have tags whose counts are from min to max

691325
min	max
after this you just apply for any count x between min and max

691343
submit	submission
you should add an onclick event to the submit button which calls a javascript function that tests for your condition and uses a javascript alert to let the user know that they need to enter something worthy of submission

691373
geshi	mediawiki
also you ll probably need an extension for mediawiki to show code something like syntaxhighlight geshi

691383
serializable	deserialization
if your unit test covers serializaiton deserialization for example by making sure failure to add members to the serializable function would fail during unit testing

691450
profiling	debugging
1.do you need to have your projects built in debugging or release to profiling them

691470
textblock	itemscontrol
that container an instance of contentpresenter for a plain old itemscontrol wraps the textblock and is a direct child of the grid

691515
tar	gunzip
or you can read the man page for tar 1 since it probably has the ability to gunzip and extract together.

691618
hbase	hypertable
if you want something like bigtable you can t go past hbase or hypertable - they re both open-source bigtable clones

691633
config	ini
those i put in a config file ini format for simple stuff xml if it gets more complex

691642
post	get
i need to post some data to 3dgate and get the returned result from it

if you have ever used sql reporting services there are some dropdownlistfor that pop down with a checkbox list in it

691737
postgresql	mysql
i have just started working on a project and i am using zend framework and postgresql normally use mysql however i am hitting a problem when i am trying to get the last inserted id when using the zend_db insert command

691739
put	get
adding this to the system.web in web.config will enable http get and put

691752
codeigniter	cakephp
if you like to go and strip off pieces of code from different sources you might also want to try to import some of the modules from other frameworks like codeigniter or cakephp into zend framework and that probably would be a fun and useful thing for you and if you d like to share maybe for all the community based around zf

691778
int	double
i think bytes int and decimals will be fairly straightforward but i m a little unsure on the best way to handle singles and double since they can be very small or large and would appreciate any suggestions from those more clever than i

691801
rss	feed
i stumbled across this today from one of my rss feed

691819
hide	show
what i m finding is that with the show hide code sat in the appdelegate i have to create a reference of the appdelegate in the loaded controller in order to target the hide code

691828
gridview	objectdatasource
i have a gridview that s tied to an objectdatasource

691828
gridview	objectdatasource
how do i feed the datatable to the objectdatasource so that the gridview is updated in code

691837
hide	show
show hide code sat in the appdelegate

691895
ienumerable	ilist
obviously your iec object does not implement ilist and only implements ienumerable so it is impossible to do a random read without of course an extension method or something which uses the enumerator to reach the random index

691900
post	get
eval is more dangerous than get post because the submitted content can run functions like include which can access any file apache has read privileges for or shell_exec which can do anything in the shell the apache user can do etc

691900
post	get
get post variables don t automatically have access to this functionality which is what makes them more secure

691960
persistent	transient
for example database access in php using mysql mysqli pdo etc is transient persistent connections notwithstanding whereas .net java will nearly always use persistent connection pools and build on top of this to create orm frameworks and the like the caches for which are beyond any particular request

691989
classname	inherited
if not how difficult would it be to write an app that at bare minimum builds a self-referencing classname table so i could at least throw it into a database treeview component to easily view inherited ancestry etc

692000
stdout	stderr
update stdout and stderr should still both be printed to the screen regardless

692001
post	get
change method get to method post

692009
stdout	stderr
to redirect stderr to a file display stdout to screen and also save stdout to a file

692009
stdout	stderr
edit to display both stderr and stdout to screen and also save both to a file you can use bash s i o redirection

692026
accessor	properties
because you can construct your properties editor in the same thread as the binding it will be threadsafe if you simply override the properties editor default behavior - you need to find the hook it uses to do binding and override it - do the same properties editor registration you re doing now except in the same method so that you can keep the reference to your editor and then at the end of the binding you can register errors by retrieving the list from your editor if you provide a public accessor

692062
pull	push
i got a permission denied error which led me to chown the entire repo recursively to the user i expected it to be and i could then commit push pull with no problem

692068
apache	lighttpd
apache vs lighttpd etc

692083
x86	mips
in different assembly languages mul x86 mult mips refer to multiplication

692083
bit-fiddling	xor
lets say i have two 16-bit values in my registers and i am the cpu so i have to implement mul using the other bit-fiddling instructions i have and or xor not shl shr etc

692182
free	malloc
register it when you malloc it de-register it when you free it

692195
inherited	subclassing
this makes sure that inherited acts as expected and will call .foo in the right subclassing instead of the base class

692207
post	get
i have found a blog post on the windows desktop sharing api but i m uncertain how to even get started with it

692223

rss	feed
my application needs to keep track of rss atom feed and save the new entries in a database

692271
inherited	properties
if you have a dependency properties such as list pages where page inherited from usercontrol and has a string title you can use

692276
post	get
from your other post i guess you want to learn a new language to get new skills

692300
put	get
consider your services to be exchanges of documents in which you put in everything you need to get things done

692310
hex	binary
it s very useful in the computer world as a single hex digit represents four bits binary digits

692310
octal	binary
base 8 is used almost exclusively in unix file permissions so that each octal digit represents a 3-tuple of binary permissions read write execute

692334
width	height
i ve tried manually setting the height and width attributes of the image adjusting margins and padding adjusting stretch and renderoptions

692358
implements	extends
then you can define an explicit interface for the intersection an interface that extends both the interface corresponding to myclass and myinterface and letting the appropriate superclasses implements it instead of myinterface

692379
symfony	kohana
the same configuration problems occured in symfony and admin generator and in kohana i was forced to duplicate the same code over all my forms

692391
packets	pcap
it displays various indications about a pcap file including the number of packets it contain

692407
stdout	stderr
i m assuming you want to still see stderr and stdout on the terminal

692407
stdout	stderr
only instead of just using it for your stdout have a tee for stdout and one for stderr

692407
stdout	stderr
tee outputs its input back on stdout but since its input is our stderr we want to redirect tee s stdout to our stderr again

692476
outputstream	inputstream
second question the adc s reference tells us that the method getstreamstohost port inputstream outputstream returns the object representing an output stream to the remote host

692523

wxpython	pyqt
wxpython has many warts and the code you write in pyqt is often much cleaner

692609
portrait	landscape
i ve set my director to landscape but when i was looking at the coordinates of the touch event it was still picking them up as though the screen was portrait

692611
int	chars
i suggest you print out the unicode value of each chars use charat to get each chars then convert it to an int and compare them to the unicode code charts

692639
factors	mean
it could mean updating the balance factors but not balancing

692667
put	get
just put in front of a local variable and you now have the key that allows any other part of the program to get at the storage for that variable and use it just as effectively as if they could see the variable name itself

692669
ubuntu	linux
i have a couple of linux ubuntu servers that work together every night to do some heavy processing

692734
cpu	processors
given pipelining out of order processing microcode multi-core processors etc there s no guarantee that a particular section of assembly code will take exactly x cpu cycles clock cycle whatever cycles

692763
git-rebase	undo
however the reset git-rebase and merge all save your original head pointer into orig_head so if you ve done any of those commands since the git-rebase you re trying to undo then you ll have to use the reflog

692804
ia-32	x86
see also intelâ 64 and ia-32 architectures optimization reference manual and instruction latencies and throughput for amd and intel x86 processors from can berk gã¼der s now-deleted link-only answer

692823
rss	feed
here they re binding to xml that s being pulled from an rss feed

692857
disk	ram
the number of files in each subdirectory can get quite large so i think a big performance penalty comes from a context switch to where it can t keep all the different file arrays in ram at the same time such that it s going to disk nearly every time

692893
debian-based	linux	debian	linux
i m not tied to a linux distro so this can be for anything although debian or a debian-based distro would be nice

692893
hide	show
surely you can make a program which hide the boot messages and show a custom program

692967
codeblocks	kdevelop
once you have the cmake script which is straightforward you can generate from it project files for the ide of your choice - eclipse kdevelop visual studio codeblocks etc

693052
domxpath	domdocument
i use it with classes like domdocument and domxpath to grind the content to a usable form

693067
vb6	vba
for vb6 vba dynamic sql i always find it more readable to create an sql template and then use the replace function to add in the dynamic parts

693068
button	checkbox	int	double
it s funier to manipulate windows button checkbox than int float double and not so much difficult

693099
width	height
alternatively we could specify padding 1 but then we must manually set height 21 and width 22 to ensure the button isn t resized to fit the image

693099
width	height
on the image tab the height and width are needed to ensure that the image isn t stretched

693165
codeblocks	kdevelop
if you like to just test your project with eclipse or kdevelop or codeblocks just run cmake to generate the corresponding project files

693182

for the initialization you have to look around the systemd used debian uses a sysv init style initialization ubuntu uses upstart

693326
hash	salt
when a user needs to log in compute the hash of their input password combined with the salt value on record for their account

693345
equals	gethashcode
i think you should implement iequatable t to provide your own equals and gethashcode methods

693345
equals	gethashcode
and provide gethashcode and equals

693357
versioning	upgrade
you want to upgrade to a more recent versioning of phpunit have a look at

rss	feed
several websites such as pinch use this data to provide rss feed of different application categories and their associated information

693523
folder	directory
i then transformed this webapplication1 folder into virtual directory this virtual directory is also configured as web application

693541
width	height
i use setsize width height when initializing them but i know that users constantly resize them for their taste

693544
hide	show
i have all of the code working except i can t figure out how to get inside the .toggle function to find out which effect hide or show is going to be applied

693567
width	height
the width and height settings can be saved via putint and retrieved via getint

693610
putty	winscp
from a windows machine you can connect to an instance using tools like putty or winscp - you probably know about these if you are able to create a new image

693669
int	double
print_r prints only the keys and values of the array opposed to var_dump whichs also prints the types of the data in the array string int double and so on

693690
ninject	linfu
i m starting a new winforms app and i intend to use an ioc di framework probably ninject but i m also thinking about structuremap and linfu

693762
clientaccesspolicy.xml	crossdomain.xml
1 clientaccesspolicy.xml crossdomain.xml isn t around on the server you are calling

693766
put	get
it might turn out that the programmer is actually just you trying to debug something or put a quick hack in to get the app running temporarily

693777
opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	firefox
the tests are 5 12ms locally for opera 10 57 88ms for firefox 3 14 36ms for google-chrome and 125 118ms

694000
stdout	stderr
my goal is to launch a child process wait for it to finish and then use its stdout in my parent process by referring to p.stdout while letting stderr just print to wherever it would otherwise

694029
getter	setter
since the main differences in java and c# are object definitions i would get those by reflecting the c# dlls and then reconstruct the constructs then it would be easy to have an interpreter run through and implement the function bodies and convert properties to getter setter already knowing the structure of the files

694032
vim	emacs
i keep hearing about how many people use emacs vim on a daily basis

694032
vim	emacs
i know how to use vim and emacs but for day-to-day programming i just use an ide as i find myself being more productive

694032
vim	emacs
this is not a vim vs emacs question so please don t argue one against the other please instead argue graphical ide against console ide

694032
vim	emacs
as i m already familiar with graphical ides am i likely to gain any productive advantage by using emacs vim instead

694032
vim	emacs
however to someone who uses a standard gui text editor i d probably say that they should use emacs vim

694041
vim	emacs
i know people who swear by vim and people who swear by emacs

694045
vim	emacs
using emacs after knowing vim will make that task somewhat annoying

694085
libjpeg	libpng
for jpeg it s libjpeg for png it s libpng

694086
libjpeg	libpng
for jpeg there is already a library called libjpeg and there is libpng for png

694114
required	placeholder
one way is put a content placeholder at the bottom of your master page then the specific slave page that needs the javascript can specify the placeholder contents as the required javascript

694116
vmware	virtualbox
download a copy of either vmware s vmware server or sun s virtualbox and install a few operating systems

694147
hash	salt
this said i understand the practice and necessity of salting storing a salt password hash in a database as a blob as opposed to the password encrypted or no

694147
hash	salt
i m using salt hash and am storing that in the db -- thanks scotty for pointing this out

694151
hash	salt
you should use a salt hash

694152
hash	salt
salt your password hash

694160
hash	salt	hash	md5	salt	md5
most people encrypt their passwords using a one-way hash function of some sort md5 and sha256 are popular along with a salt

694160
hash	salt
the salt is a secret that only your application knows sort of like an encryption key which is added to whatever you are encrypting before it is run through the one-way hash

694164
vim	emacs
since vi vim and emacs are pretty close in terms of what they can or cannot do productivity with these two editors comes from experience in using it

694168
min	max
you can also comment out min only and leave max with 10 0 1 .

694175
ant	maven
just because some people tend to think that ant and maven are in opposition they are not

694195
hash	salt
if you salt hash the username you d leave yourself with a bit of a chicken egg problem

694195
hash	salt
if you salt hash the username how would you find it in the database

694195
hash	salt
you d need to look up the user s record to find the salt you used to hash the username.

694220
required	placeholder
the closest method would be using placeholder and printf but that required an explicit call to a function not an implicit substitution

694232
min	max
as max is 2147483647 and min is -2147483648 for 32 bit signed integer

694263
cassini	iis
as jimmie r houts suggested use iis rather than cassini for a start

694265
disk	ram
monitor the system for performance disk ram http and db requests

694288
.htaccess	httpd.conf
another option is using apache s mod_alias to do a permanent redirect in either .htaccess or httpd.conf

694304
hash	salt
a simple solution here is to salt the hash string add the same secret string to every value that is hash

694314
firefox	safari
validating your javascript with a good parts + browser on jslint.com makes it less likely to have javascripts behaving differently in firefox safari etc

694344
post	get
my current solution always stops on the first quote after the get post actually i only need all the values including the size transferred

694365
xen	openvz
the virtualbox support is bleeding-edge not in any release may not even be in source control yet but is available as a set of patches on the mailing list -- but this single api available for c python and several other languages lets you control virtual machines and images running in qemu kvm xen lxc linux containers uml user-mode linux openvz and others

694374
persistent	transient
rich domain objects require references to many components but these objects get persistent or serialized so any references they hold to outside components spring beans in this case services repositories anything are transient and get wiped out

694374
persistent	transient
when object is loaded from repository or other responsible entity since the component references are transient and obviously don t get persistent

694377
width	height
binding the actual height and width properties to calculate the offsets

694418
set	bag
if you want to use ilist use first rule i.e change your hbm.xml to use bag instead of set also your phonenumbers class should inherit from ilist not list if you want to use list you will need to change your mapping file to use list instead of set

i am using the linux flex builder with eclipse 3.3 on my ubuntu 8.04 machine for the very first time and i need to modify a preexisting flex project

694561
postgresql	mysql
if on the other hand you need to access the data from multiple programs or computers at the same time than again sqlite is not an optimal choice and you need a real database server ms sql oracle mysql postgresql ...

694578
radeditor	radtreeview	radeditor	radchart	radchart	radtreeview
radeditor radchart radtreeview and

694632
outputstream	inputstream
you re already assigning sendstream with the getstreamstohost port inputstream outputstream message

694641
spaces	delimiter
setting the delimiter to nothing is required to capture input lines with spaces otherwise you just get the first word

694688
pyexcelerator	xlrd
fwiw i m the author of xlrd and the maintainer of xlwt a fork of pyexcelerator

694688
pyexcelerator	xlrd
xlrd can read any file that pyexcelerator can and read them better mdash

694710
g++	gcc
compiles with both g++ and gcc

694711
accessor	properties
if you define a properties it is best to offer both get and set accessor methods

694713
put	get
i know i can put the other assemblies in my project and set them to embedded resource but how do you get them back out again meaning how do you get it to a place where i can instantiate classes defined in that embedded assembly

694721
getter	setter
in particular having seen java code with several getter and setter being called in the same statement i know that the equivalent c# code would be a lot simpler to read

694745
firefox	safari
this mechanism works fine in firefox and safari but does not work in ie7

694746
getter	setter
there s no time-consuming operation going on inside the property getter setter

694751
width	height
the columns are fixed width in the first gridview - meaning that the row height is variable depending on the amount of text

694758
getter	setter
when using and writing them i just think of properties as setter and getter which a much nicer syntax

694808
getter	setter
most of the protestations could be said for java s getter and setter too --and we had them for quite a while without such problems in practice

694874
cobertura	emma
i prefer cobertura over emma

694876
put	get
you can put your product id in a hidden field and get its value in page_init using

694886
redhat	fedora
you could also install a fedora rpm package for php in redhat enterprise

694888
migrate	upgrade
i migrate an 1.1 app to 1.2 and i had nothing to do except running the automatic upgrade script

694906
folder	directory
my 2nd problem was because of the crazy directory structure i had to ftp to about 3 folder at the same time for trivial changes

694950
mouse	keyboard
i ved developed a c# application that captures screens using bitblt and sends keyboard and mouse events using calls to keybd_event and mouse_event

694950
mouse	keyboard
i have done all of these to get the application to run under elevated priviledges under vista but when uac dialogs appear it does not capture those screens and the keyboard and mouse events do not reach the uac dialog

694974
children	parent
the plain old link-to-parent representation just having parent_id and no left_pos or right_pos is of course faster for insert update-heavy workloads but the only queries it can answer efficiently are find the parent of x and find the children of x. most workloads involve much more reading than writing so usually mptt is faster overall -- but perhaps in your case you need to consider moving back to link-to-parent

695012
awt	swing
it s a iteration of swing awt

695018
config	ini
in general it is faster than most config files and more reliable individual operations on the registry are transacted so if your app crashes during a write the registry isn t corrupted - in general that isn t the case with ini files

695081
modifiers	sealed
static classes are implicitly sealed they re compiled to il which describes an sealed class but you can t add the sealed modifiers yourself

695108
jobs	cron
the best part about cron jobs is that you are not limited to the small subset of functionality available in say stored procedures

695144
put	get
and for large number of strings you can put them in an array and use implode to get a string out of them

695199
pop-up	dialog
i am using ui dialog that pop-up on clicking a link with the same class

695220
winpe	dos
the main problem will be restoring a system volume where you will need another os to boot to like winpe or dos or something else

695220
filesystems	fat	filesystems	ntfs
even if you are doing simple file backups it helps to understand filesystems ntfs fat etc so that you know what you can should backup and restore

695316
rss	feed
i m trying to parse the data from a craigslist rss feed

695326
onclick	onmousedown
the fix appears to be using the onmousedown event instead of onclick

695340
iprincipal	iidentity
looking at asp.net mvc this seems easy enough using the built in authorization filters and the iprincipal and iidentity interfaces i haven t used them yet just reading so i may be using these terms incorrectly

695377
disk	ram
your best bet actually is to buy some extra ram and compile inside a ram disk

695380
boost	stl
i m looking for a library for c that gives me at least some of the things i really miss from c++ and the stl boost

695382
udp	tcp
because tcp is connection oriented and udp is not and there are different apis for udp sockets

695400
boost	allocator
if you want to allocate memory upfront have a look at the boost pool allocator

695524
firefox	safari
however all the versions of firefox that i ve tested work just fine and my main browser is safari on a mac

695630
apache	nginx
i m doing some researching on switching from apache to nginx as a reverse proxy in front of a grails application on the backend

695654
jam	nmake
already make gnumake nmake jam and

695677
dynamic-languages	first-class
however you could later move some of the logic of your application into lua for the improved clarity of expression and other benefits of coding in a dynamic-languages with functions as first-class

695704
cpython	ironpython
output cpython ironpython

695708
sorting	grouping
for example grouping or sorting

695764
innodb	myisam
is mysql using the innodb or myisam backend

695764
innodb	myisam
if you were using innodb before and now myisam there is no transaction support in myisam

695838
post	put
a create and update is usually a put or post

695856
mp4	h.264
flash can only play flvs and h.264 encoded videos mp4 f4v

695856
mp3	flv
sample command-line that should convert inputfile.avi to an flv with an audio bitrate of 48kbps and a video bitrate of 224kbps might need to substitute libmp3lame for mp3 depending on version of ffmpeg

695860
facade	memento
you can use fancy design patterns to describe this such as facade and memento

695879
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
however if the webpage uses https as the protocol the top navigation works fine in all browsers ie6 ie7 firefox google-chrome safari except ie8

695890
post	get
... due to browser limitations custom http request headers are only supported for post requests not for get requests

695914
post	get	post	put	put	get
in theory you url describes a resource and the only operations available are carried out through get read post create put create or update delete delete

695953
hash	md5
you can tell if two files are different by running a hash on them like md5 but that won t tell you the degree of similarity between them

695970
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
this seems to work in opera firefox and safari but not in ie

695974
put	get
as someone who is primarily an it pro i would say that 3rd party applications that we get that run as console apps instead of windows services we put a lot of effort into keeping from being purchased

696014
ienumerable	iqueryable
both of the previous answers work but it reads better if you use asenumerable to cast the iqueryable to ienumerable

696049
interbase	firebird
i have searched the question related with this subject and only find this finding a legacy firebird interbase database password

696049
postgresql	mysql
or should i use other database like mysql or postgresql

696092
tostring	icomparable
this is assuming that attribute class implement icomparable or has a nice tostring function i hope

696104
jboss	glassfish
can someone please tell me how this pieces come together strut javascript glassfish jboss apache etc and ofcourse spring to produce an application

696246
post	get
pages about_the_company edit get will display the edit page while post will perform an update

696247
ubuntu	linux
i ve both checked rhel5 and ubuntu distribution so i think it s generic for linux

jboss	glassfish
can someone please tell me how this pieces come together strut javascript glassfish jboss apache etc and of course spring to produce an application

696286
post	get	post	put	put	get
rest is not about having clean uris it is about having the correct semantic attached to http methods get post put and delete

696286
post	get	post	put	put	get
get should only be for safe idempotent operations post should be for creation or processing put should be for updating an existing resource and delete to hmm delete a resource

696296
haskell	ocaml
i ve been quite impressed by bnfc which is able to generate parsers in java as well as in c c++ c# f# haskell and ocaml

696357
folder	directory
i prefer the following code snippet as it creates a folder inheriting default rights - which seems the right thing to do - other software the user might have setup specific inheritable rights on a directory for a legitimate reason - then adds a full control explicit access entry for the built in users group

696414
subtract	add	multiplying	add	multiplying	subtract
add subtract multiplying logical operations to calculate values

696471
awt	swing
on linux awt swing on java etc.

696496
tunnel	packets
tunnel is when instead of sending a packets directly through the network you send in inside another often encrypted connection by means of encapsulation

696496
tunnel	packets
in case of ssh tunnel tcp ip packets are sent inside an ssh connection to another host which then decides how to treat those packets usually forward to internal network

696545
exponent	modulo
the public key consists of the modulo n and the public or encryption exponent e

696545
exponent	modulo
private key consists of the modulo n and the private or decryption exponent d which

696548
subtraction	addition
with that you can perform addition subtraction and many other operations on your two binary inputs

696559
pull	push
another approach is to adopt a push model rather than a pull model

696632
jboss	glassfish
can someone please tell me how this pieces come together strut javascript glassfish jboss apache etc and ofcourse spring to produce an application

696632
jboss	glassfish	jboss	weblogic	glassfish	weblogic
glassfish jboss weblogic websphere tomcat spring dm are all app server choices for deploying your spring app

696650
gmail	hotmail
so if you obtain a database of usernames and unsalted passwords chances are good they might work elsewhere like hotmail gmail etc

696652
accessor	properties
id is accessed with the token accessor i think that s what it s called as it is not a native properties of the movieclip class i m guessing videobutton is made out of a movieclip

696666
hash	salt
this means that any readily available dictionary is useless since the likelyhood of it containing the hash for that text is a lot less than the likelihood of it containing the hash for dog this likelihood becomes even lower if the salt is a random alphanumeric string

696704
temp	tmp
if 10 requests come to the pdf_controller the number of the temp files in the tmp directory will double and it will eat up the space

696712
hash	md5
it s simply more expensive to compute a sha-512 hash than to compute a md5 hash

696718
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
it works in ie firefox apple safari google-chrome - i don t have any others available right now

696740
jboss	glassfish
j2ee containers such as jboss glassfish embed a servlet container such as tomcat and provide a j2ee container and sometimes other tools to deploy java enterprise applications

696740
django	turbogears
for example why are you using django instead of turbogears

696740
django	turbogears
some people will tell you that django sucks while turbogears rocks etc

696776
versioning	upgrade
so essentially any action on the checkout using tortoisesvn upgrade the internal structure of the checkout and thus it can t be used on server side anymore since the client versioning is too old

696806
umask	sudo
to achieve that you would need to write wrapper scripts for the svn commands that set the proper umask or give all involved users the ability to act as one specific user through sudo

696879
opera	firefox	opera	safari	firefox	safari
one that works in ie8 safari opera firefox

696912
ssl	https
i am writing a web service in perl that will run under ssl https with client certificates

696916
folder	directory
how can i point both directory so that 200+ folder will appear in

696937
mouse	keyboard
also douglas engelbart the inventor thought people would use both mouse and a short form of keyboard at the same time

696943
hide	show
i conditionally hide show panels in a detailsview..

696943
hide	show
i want to also hide show the detailsview row field that the panel is contained in

696966
accessor	properties
i m not sure if you just picked a bad example for your struct name since nullable is a framework struct but if not the error is due to the fact that you have no set accessor in your properties

696982
mouse	keyboard
vis is the idea of an ui which actually adapts to the needs of the particular user or his environment including vision impairment tactile preferences mouse or keyboard preferred language to better suit right-to-left languages preferred visual presentation button order mac-style or windows-style better use of available space corporate identity etc

696997
range	minimum
for example if you have a value in the range 1.0 2.0 and subtract from it a value in the range 0.0 1.0 then the result must lie in the range below 0.0 above 2.0 as the minimum result is 1.0-1.0 and the maximum is 2.0-0.0

697024
getter	setter
do funny things with your apart getter and setter

697053
getter	setter
for an automatic property you always need both a getter and setter

697063
width	height
wx asks how big is your min width height and portions out the screen qt has option to say how wide do you want how high do you need to be if your x wide

697064
init.d	pid
etc init.d foo start start foo write foo s pid to var run foo.pid

697146
hmac	md5
you have to use the hmac module together with md5 or sha

697153
cvs	svn
then in order to put changes in production you could make php script on production site that accesses the online service and downloads the newest version via http http should be generally available with cvs and svn uses it natively rather than using specific vcs protocols

697182
gridview	datalist	gridview	repeater	datalist	repeater
you can always use asp.net s data controls such as repeater gridview datalist to display collections of item

697203
firefox	safari	google-chrome	firefox	google-chrome	safari
it works in firefox and the webkit-based browsers notably safari and google-chrome

697220
put	get
what you could do is get a virtual machine appliance for source code control and issue management like vmtrac and either run it directly or pick it apart and figure out how it was put together

697266
int	double	int	chars
convert.tostring expands on that and provides some specific overloads for primitive types chars byte int double etc. that allow for some more type-specific functionality like base conversion for example

697351
ienumerable	icollection
extension methods -- i would use very sparingly but they are very useful for extending the .net types with convenience methods especially ienumerable icollection and string

697388
stdout	stdio
well you could start a new cmd.exe process and use stdio and stdout to send and recieve data

697401
hash	md5
if the md5 implementation is dependent on machine word size i haven t checked the code this can cause the hash to be different

697433
inherited	properties
my question is if i have a list of objects of different type but which all inherited from the same class how i can bind all the properties to the grid

697437
post	get
for every page request post get create a new random value

697544
crossover	mutation
the problem is that every variable i have is a matrix and the crossover fitness and mutation codes get pretty complicated

697557
width	height
you should just be able to simply set the height and the width parameters - since these are both valid attributes of the iframe dom element

697559
width	height
after rotation your newrow and newcolumn may be larger than the original width height of the image

697575
db4o	starcounter
linq to sql is just one of many linq providers out there there is linq to db4o linq to starcounter linq to objects linq to ado and many many more

697583
rss	feed
let s say i have 500 rss feed that need updating very constantly but do not want to check all 500 every minute

697593
post	get
i asked the following question on the subsonic forum but only seemed to get one response so i thought i d post up here as well to see if anyone could shed some more light on the problem.

697617
put	get
for example if you put non-numeric characters in a number field you can get a parsing error

697617
put	get
if you put a zero in where it isn t anticipated you can get a divide by zero error

697617
put	get
if you put a much larger value in than is expected or a negative when not expected or any number of other things you can get an error of some sort

697618
integer	unsigned
uint8_t - 8 bit unsigned integer

697618
integer	unsigned
uint16_t - 16 bit unsigned integer

697618
integer	unsigned
uint32_t - 32 bit unsigned integer

697618
16-bit	64bit
for instance one might declare a variable using int_fast16_t but it would actually be implemented as an int32_t on a 32 bit processor or int64_t on a 64bit processor as those would be the fastest types of at least 16-bit on those platforms

697638
inline	inlining
inlining the whole thing is not really neccesary you can inline the dynamic part and leave the other part hardcoded

697647
opera	firefox
this works like a charm in firefox 3.0.x ie7 and opera 9.6.x

697668
pop-up	dialog
i m not really sure i totally understand your problem but what i think you are trying to say is that when you drag a portlet it s supposed to be binding a click event listener to the setup wrench button on your portlet so that when it s clicked a dialog pop-up

697668
pop-up	dialog
and you are saying that when you click on that wrench a dialog pop-up for all your portlets and not just the one you clicked the button inside of

697694
hide	show
after i do the .post thing i want to hide the first div with a left slide then show the second with a right slide

697719
realloc	calloc
there could be other ways of storing this for instance as you are using double you could use calloc and realloc to maintain one piece of memory the right size

697726
int	chars
the ord function converts a single byte to its int value 0 â i â 255 and not just the 128 chars of the ascii chars set

697733
pull	push
your laptop will have the whole history so you only need to touch the server if you want to push or pull not just to do a diff or check the history

697753
serializable	deserialization
i would say that if you want to have a full control over the format you should use custom serializable and if you want responding the deserialization flow the attributes is the best option

697756
width	height
maybe you need to add height 2 and width 2 to your row and column values before you plug them in

697769
subtract	addition	subtract	add	multiplying	add	multiplying	subtract	multiplying	addition
i would say that if you can add you can then use it to subtract multiplying and divide using addition

697799
width	height
as far as i know using percentage for width height should work fine

697809
getter	setter
the updaterecordcommand should be defined with the following fields and setter getter

697819
des	aes
des is slow and now considered obsolete aes is the replacement for it

697836
width	height
i m guessing that there is a way to do this with css using width height or javascript

697852
margin	height
the idea is to have the 30px on an element other than the height 100 element since the margin and the 100 add together to create the final element height and 100 + 30px 100

697862
awt	swing
you can embed a browser in a swing awt gui using the jdic api

width	height
with the width and height lost

697895
margin	height
as joel said margin + height add together so you should use a container

pascal	delphi
is a typical method of concatinating strings and has been used in pascal delphi for the past few decades without any significant problems

697966
spaces	delimiter
if you want to split the input you can use string.split using comma as a delimiter or even better for taking into account the spaces after comma

698012
vsto	add-in
one to go for shared add-in com based and other to build vsto based add-in

698021
int	chars
for a int as small as an unsigned chars you get best performance using a small lookup-table

698024
int	chars
an unsigned chars is a number in just the same way that a 32-bit float or int is a number what the compiler deems them to represent is what changes

698027
button	checkbox
they re usually used with checkbox and radio button and when the user clicks on the label it toggles the button

698028
width	height
the container s scrollbars appear when its height width is too small for all the combined height width of all its children

698048
post	get
an initial get request to a page usually costs less than subsequent post anyway so there s not much reason to avoid it

698066
min	max
see for min and max

698067
gtk	fltk
using lgpl you have many other options including gtk qt as of 4.5 fltk etc

698076
folder	directory
i ve found using the findfirstflashcard findnextflashcard apis to be more reliable than enumerating directory and checking the temporary flag which will return bluetooth shared folder for example

698079
mouse	keyboard
that way it won t be able to access stage mouse and keyboard events and certain others and there won t be any class definition conflicts

698119
fortran	ada
i haven t come across use of java in real-time systems but i haven t been looking at the sorts of systems where i d expect to find it i work in aerospace simulation where it s c++ fortran and occasionally ada for real-time in-the-loop systems

698312
int	chars
what is the relation between word length chars size int size and byte in c++

698356
int	chars
the standard requires that certain types have minimum sizes short is at least 16 bits int is at least 16 bits etc and that some groups of type are ordered sizeof int sizeof short sizeof chars

698372
rss	feed
select a probabilistic model for the rss feed for example that the time between updates follows a continuous probability distribution for example the exponential distribution

698372
rss	feed
for every rss feed use the maximum likelihood method for estimating the parameters of the individual distributions based on the history of updates on that feed

698372
rss	feed
now you have a probabilistic model which you can use the calculate the probability that any particular rss feed has an update available at any specific time

698460
int	chars
also wchar_t is used to store chars that can have any size determined by the implementation - but must use one of the int types as its underlying type

698460
int	chars
all of bool chars short int long and their unsinged counterparts are int

698460
int	chars
for signed chars the range is from -127 - 127 for short and int it is the same and is -2 15+1 - 2 15-1 and for long it is -2 31+1 - 2 31-1

698460
int	chars
for chars that is 8 for short int that is 16 and for long that is 32

698465
int	chars
sizeof int sizeof chars

698509
min	max
when i use the sql query above with the min and max functions nothing prints out for min and max

698509
min	max
what is different about the max and min in the query that it can t extract the values

698509
min	max
also i tested the problem query string in an sqlite database browser on the same database and it works displaying the two - min and max values

698562
subscript	superscript
disable subscript superscript raise lower

698604
accessor	properties
also i wouldn t recommend setting the private member directly - it would be a good idea to have a single object inside of the returned class instance used just for locking and use some form of accessor method or properties that locks on that synchronization object and then sets the field

698619
munin	cacti
you should have some sort of monitoring solution in place like cacti or munin giving you visibility into what s going on on your server s

698619
nginx	lighttpd
you should be using a lighter-weight reverse proxy like squid or webserver lighttpd or nginx to serve static content and to take over the job of spoon-feeding bytes to slow clients

698682
memcached	apc
1 st level cache in memory kv-store apc store or memcached

any guid generator or even md5 concat salt current_timestamp is sufficient where salt is something on the user record like timestamp account was created

698807
innodb	myisam
i m renaming tables changing indexes and generally altering most of the table in some way part of that is that i m changing from myisam to innodb tables

698810
ftpwebresponse	ftpwebrequest
just use the built-in ftpwebrequest and ftpwebresponse classes

698812
ftpwebresponse	ftpwebrequest
take a look at ftpwebrequest and ftpwebresponse classes

698887
put	get
if you put these two lines together as in the first example you still get a temporary constructed on the stack followed by an assignment

698909
getter	setter
this is most probably because you annotated the id field and not the setter or getter

698957
accessor	properties
now i have no problem defining a cpvect inside my object but when i try to make the accessor using properties synthesize i keep getting errors so

698968

submit	submission
don t know if it will help but you can try simulating a submit button click instead of directly submission the form

699126
ant	maven
in maven the definitive guide i wrote about the differences between maven and ant in the introduction the section title is the differences between ant and maven

699126
ant	maven
contrast the previous ant example with a maven example

699126
maven	pom.xml
in maven to create a jar file from some java source all you need to do is create a simple pom.xml place your source code in basedir src main java and then run mvn install from the command line

699126
maven	pom.xml
the example maven pom.xml that achieves the same results

699126
maven	pom.xml
if we wanted to start customizing the behavior our pom.xml is going to grow in size and in the largest of projects you can see collections of very complex maven poms which contain a great deal of plugin customization and dependency declarations

699126
ant	pom.xml
but even when your project s pom.xml files become more substantial they hold an entirely different kind of information from the build file of a similarly sized project using ant

699126
ant	maven
where ant had to be explicit about the process there was something built-in to maven that just knew where the source code was and how it should be processed

699126
ant	maven
the differences between ant and maven in this example

699126
ant	maven
even though i m very much convinced that maven makes sense i d happily use ant + ivy with a project team that had a very sharp build engineer

699214
gridview	detailsview
i use a detailsview to insert data into the database and the gridview to edit and delete the data

699227
colorbox	thickbox
colorbox is one that i found recently and seems similar in capability to thickbox

699239
entity-relationship	diagram
this entity-relationship diagram illustrates this

699250
boost	stl
ofcourse i m understend that when stl was designed boost does not exists but designers could be create something similar on boost function

699253
spaces	delimiter
after the file has been uploaded i want to determine whether the file is either spaces or tab delimiter and all the values are integers

699253
int	chars
i was thinking of reading every chars of the file and checking if it s an int

699258
spaces	delimiter
sounds like it doesn t matter wether it s delimiter by spaces or tabs

699301
int	chars
the final bit-pattern is given type int and is therefore signed regardless of whether single chars are signed or not a slight change from versions 3.1 and earlier of gcc

699301
int	chars
if there are more chars in the constant than would fit in the target int the compiler issues a warning and the excess leading chars are ignored

699301
int	chars
for example ab for a target with an 8-bit chars would be interpreted as int unsigned chars 234 256 + unsigned chars a

699319
min	max
however looking at the java character class its min value is u0000 and its max value is uffff

699332
coalesce	isnull
alternatively if you don t have coalesce available but you do have an isnull function available you can chain isnulls

699334
spaces	delimiter
how can i get it with no mid spaces or delimiter with native tools

699342
stdout	stderr
as the os.system docs mention use the subprocess module and if you like set stdout open os.devnull w and perhaps the same for stderr when you open the subprocess

699357
int	chars
an int chars constant has type int

699357
int	chars
the value of an int chars constant

699357
int	chars
numerical value of the representation of the mapped chars interpreted as an int

699357
int	chars
the value of an int chars constant containing more than one chars

699357
int	chars
if an int chars constant contains

699400
spaces	delimiter
i got an answer to my question here how do i know if a file is tab or spaces delimiter in perl

699408
spaces	delimiter
spaces or tab delimiter and all the

699408
int	chars	spaces	delimiter
if it matches - it will mean that you will have set of int delimiter by spaces or tabs it s not really relevant which chars was used to delimit the int

699436
versioning	upgrade
by contrast with informix esql c an upgrade to the current versioning informix clientsdk 3.50 containing esql c 3.50 which is more recent than the esql c 6.00 which you currently use should be painless unless you ve gone out of your way to write bad code

699438
post	get
the problem could be that by default ajax requests are usually post requests not get

699484
cpu	processors
cpu usage cannot be directly measured because unlike an x86 the arm processors doesn t have a register for it

699497
super	implements
you can always implements file uploads yourself it s really not that super difficult if the .net utility has some limit coded in to it though it really shouldn t

699528
typedef	struct
one other good reason to always typedef enums and struct results from this problem

699528
typedef	struct
i would advocate always typedef ing struct and enumerations

699551
disk	ram
if you have a tree that s 4 high then to reach any random node requires loading 4 index pages in to ram and that s 4 disk hits

699567
erlang	lisp
you might want to look at distel an integration of emacs with erlang s message system and slime an interface between emacs and common lisp

699593
hide	show
or do you perform checks in a single view and hide show blocks within it similar to what you would have done in regular asp.net

699630
gridview	radgrid
i am new to jquery trying to populate a gridview or telerik radgrid using jquery

699652
rss	feed
are there rss feed or apis i can use to import this kind of data

699653
firefox	safari
the text on my web page looks fine in firefox safari but in ie7 certain portions are cut off

699755
floating-point	integer
in sml arithmetic operators are overloaded to apply to both floating-point and integer data

699766
direct3d	directx
i ve seriously tried almost ten different methods and even my search results in google for directx direct3d c# desktop hooks and others have brought me to no avail

699766
direct3d	gdi
direct3d dx gdi or otherwise

699801
margin	text-indent	margin	text-align	text-align	text-indent
i have set padding to 0 margin to 0 though it shouldn t be this as clearly the border goes around the element containing the gap text-indent to 0 and text-align left

699807
octal	decimal
a leading zero makes the constant octal rather than decimal

699829
spaces	delimiter
accepts either tabs or spaces as a delimiter allowing them to be mixed freely

699881
hide	show
the way i currently tackle this is that i hide the listbox if the result set count 0 and show a label with the no results found message

699915
ssd	sata
i have not enough money to buy a ssd and have 2 sata drivers

699931
icmp	udp
when we send a packet from a udp port we receive an exception if the network returns an icmp host unreachable

699931
icmp	udp
no problem we ll just listen for icmp and that will give us the info we need while ignoring the exception on the udp port

699942
post	put
and also assuming that you have put has_many post in user.rb

699961
post	get
i found a blog post with some code written in java that will do exactly what i need and my very basic knowledge let me compile it but i get errors every time

699977
octal	decimal	octal	hex
only decimal hex and octal numbers are supported with format specifiers
