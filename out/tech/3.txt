sqldatareader	sqlconnection
if you are querying a sql server database version 7 and up you should replace the oledb classes with corresponding classes in the system.data.sqlclient namespace sqlconnection sqlcommand and sqldatareader as those classes have been optimized to work with sql server

20114
button	checkbox
click the validation button and uncheck the checkbox for checking validity

20126
idictionary	ilist
the xaml serializer and deserializer handles generics without a problem collections of base classes and interfaces as well as long as the collections themselves implement ilist or idictionary

20148
innodb	myisam
i ve read a bunch of stuff on the web about the differences between myisam and innodb and myisam seems like the obvious choice to me for the particular database tables that i ll be using for this task

20192
cassini	iis
there are lots of good reasons to prefer iis over the cassini server articles by dominick baier

20195
postgresql	mysql
mysql quietly truncates varchars that exceed max length whereas postgresql complains - quick workaround is to have these columns as text instead of varchar and use triggers to truncate long lines

20195
int	boolean
boolean fields are compared using is and is not operators however mysql-compatible int 1 with and is still possible

20263
profiling	debugging
i find using sql server profiling extremely useful during development testing and when i am debugging database application problems

20483
implements	extends
however apply that interface to the extends class and the method only needs implements in the extends class

20533
emacs	aquamacs
aquamacs and closer to the original emacs

20568
emacs	aquamacs
aquamacs - emacs for os x emacs in a shell window is also an option

20607
getdate	strtotime
strtotime and getdate are two functions that can be used to get dates from strings and timestamps

20631
getter	setter
alt + s r to generate getter and setter

20641
hash	md5
a cryptographic hash such as sh1 or md5 allows you to verify that file you have has been downloaded correctly and has not been tampered with

20642
hash	md5
sha1 and md5 hash are used to verify the integrity of files you ve downloaded

20654
hash	md5
with a has md5 sha-1 one input matches only with one output and then if you down load the file and calculate the hash again should obtain the same output

20666
hash	md5
to go along with what everyone here is saying i use hashtab when i need to generate compare md5 and sha1 hash on windows

20713
rss	feed
as there are quite a few deprecated versions of rss you might conceivably have to support rss feed that vary quite a bit in their formatting details

20752
waitpid	fork
of course shells do more than that like piping input and output but you should be able to accomplish the basics using fork execve and waitpid

20762
rss	feed
i need to consume an xml-based data source that conforms to a specific format think atom or rss feed but want to be able to consume data sources that have been published which contain invalid hexadecimal characters per the xml specification

20795
emacs	aquamacs
if you ever plan on making a serious effort at learning emacs immediately forget about aquamacs

20795
emacs	textmate
that might sound well and all but once you realize that it completely breaks nearly every standard keybinding and behavior of emacs you begin to wonder why you aren t just using textedit or textmate

20850
timemachine	hfs+
one is an hfs+ volume which i use for timemachine backups

20859
symlink	realpath
you may try using realpath to get what the symlink points to then trying to determine if it s a valid file using is file

20861
mbunit	nunit
i would like to do some integration testing of a web service from within nunit or mbunit

20866
int	boolean
a bitset is usually implemented as an array of int the boolean are packed into those int

20866
int	boolean
so the first 32 boolean bits in your bitset will only take up a single 32bit int but to read each value you have to do some bitwise operations first to mask out all the values you don t want

20866
int	chars
so if speed is an issue you ll be better off using a vector of chars or even int or even just use an old school bool array

20873
put	get
having a tags table and a map table makes it pretty trivial to generate tag clouds such since you can easily put together sql to get a list of tags with counts of how often each tag is used

20948
getter	setter
the worst thing you can do is add comments to obvious methods like getter and setter when they don t do more than what they should - get or set the named field

20966
put	get
on the other hand most people would love to get 5-10 pages of simple class diagrams with some basic descriptions of how the system is put together

20999
entity-relationship	diagram
i d definitely recommend gliffy.com for simple entity-relationship diagram it s an online flash based tool so cross platform

21137
mbunit	nunit
i would have thought that templates be readily available for nunit xunit mbunit et

21143
mbunit	nunit
mbunit and later versions of nunit also contain project templates for unit tests

21149
ironruby	ironpython
the ironruby guys have got some internal builds of mvc to work with ironruby and ironpython 2 and ironruby have a lot of code in common with the dlr

21149
ironruby	ironpython
i m not sure if they ll support ironpython ironruby when mvc is released but it s definitely worth keeping your eye on anyway - the old asp.net forms-based development model is old busted and the sooner it goes away the better

21464
post	get
this is my first post here and i wanted to get some input from people doing iphone development

21636
children	parent
you need some form of identifier to see the structure of the tree and grab all of a nodes children and a list of the parent path to a leaf to update

21644
memcached	apc
you can avoid stating the same file repeatedly by caching the results via memcached apc or some other in-memory caching system

21668
emacs	aquamacs
in much the way that aquamacs makes an os x-friendly version of emacs the emacsw32 project makes emacs out-of-the-box work just like a windows text editor

21697
mvp	presenter
so with mvp the presenter handles events raised by the view

21773
int	chars
int main int chars

22015
wordpress	elgg
anyway have anyone tried to implement his own openid solution within the context of an intranet where there are many different applications wordpress elgg media wiki ..

22074
nullpointerexception	illegalargumentexception
in my mind illegalargumentexception seems more specific than using a nullpointerexception since it s telling me that the problem was with an argument i passed to the method and not with a value that may have been generated while performing the method

22096
client-side	server-side
that way you can combine server-side og client-side scripting and still dont have to hardcode _id ct100_nav _

22169
rss	feed
for example if you wanted to dynamically create an rss feed you could write an http handler that handles all requests for .rss files creates the output and sends it back to the user

22177
post	get
handlers are usually done for specific extensions and http request types post get

22185
pop-up	dialog
if that is cleared then your web application users will see a pop-up ntlm dialog

22219
jython	pypy
of course if i run jython or ironpython or possibly pypy then the garbage collector won t necessarily run until much later

22259
gif	png
i want to allow users to upload avatar-type images in a variety of formats gif jpeg and png at least but to save them all as png database blobs

22271
gif	png
it uses imagecreatefrom jpeg gif png and resize and converts the image and then outputs to the browser

22376
versioning	upgrade
implementing the forced upgrade to ensure users have the latest versioning when running is so much easier in clickonce and a main reason for my usage of it

22429
firefox	safari
is it possible to embed an inline search box into a web page which provides similar functionality to the ie7pro inline search or similar plugins for firefox safari

22443
cvs	svn
get familiar with coding standards patch types unified diff and checkout a copy of their cvs or svn if they allow anonymous access

22459
memset	malloc
as you can see i m not trying to use memset with a size larger that what s originally allocated with malloc

22658
folder	directory
one of the things about subversion that irks me is that it puts its own folder in each directory of a project whereas git only puts one in the root directory

22730
hide	show
for example as i am typing this answer i like the way it show a real-time preview of the answer with an option to hide preview - i would definitely want to use similar type of interaction while building a user forum interface

22792
versioning	upgrade
we need a db compare tool to generate diff scripts to be able to upgrade a db from one versioning to another

22829
put	get
allowing multi-tag search such that the user can put subversion svn or subversion svn well from programmers to programmers in the search box and get both

22873
lisp	scheme
lisp scheme

22880
ssl	https
is the best answer to use ssl https encryption for the entire web site and you have the best guarantee that no man in the middle attacks will be able to sniff an existing client session cookie

22892
innodb	myisam
switching between myisam and innodb is trivial so load some test data and fire jmeter against your site and see what happens

22912
free	malloc
we ve had pretty good luck by writing our own malloc and free functions

22912
free	malloc
in production they just call the standard malloc and free but in debug they can do whatever you want

22912
realloc	malloc	free	realloc	free	malloc
if you have a ton of code it may be a big job to replace calls to malloc and free to the new malloc and free don t forget realloc

22912
free	memset
memset the memory with a marker on allocation to find usage of uninitialized memory and on free to find usage of free d memory

22912
printf	strncpy	printf	strcpy	strcpy	strncpy
another good idea is to never use things like strcpy strcat or printf -- always use strncpy strncat and printf

22931
lisp	scheme
if you want to learn lisp scheme read sicp

22966
httphandler	httpmodule
you will need to learn the asp.net http pipeline and how to implement the ihttpmodule and the ihttphandler interfaces to create your own httpmodule or httphandler class to handle your routing

22988
textarea	textbox
the main difference between this textbox and the others is that this is a multi-line box for inputting notes which i believe is rendered as an html textarea tag instead of an input tag in asp.net

23048
easymock	jmock
when i tried learning about jmock and easymock i found the learning curve to be a bit steep though maybe that s just me

23137
post	get
a better way would be to retrieve the post read by the current user and then use activerecord calculations to get a count without retrieving all the post in the database

23193
haskell	ocaml
i posted a bunch of links to haskell and ocaml references that are books with examples et cetera that seem right up your alley

23203
haskell	scheme	lisp	scheme
i really like thompsonâ s â œhaskell the craft of functional programmingâ because itâ s well written and haskell allows an easier start than other functional languages while being completely pure unlike lisp or scheme

23219
mouse	keyboard
sounds like maybe if it s a keyboard or mouse windows grabs it exclusively

23220
post	get	post	put	put	get
for each of those urls try running a get post put or delete http methods with different parameters so that you can ensure that you re only giving access to what you want to give access to

23227
client-side	server-side
first off i think you need to be clearer in your question - what technology are you using and where is this process that is timing out - server-side or client-side

23232
perl	tcl
for my own future reference i ll offer the regexp syntax summary page which contrasts the syntax for grep egrep emacs perl python and tcl

23241
int	double	int	chars
i think that what makes pointers tricky to learn is that until pointers you re comfortable with the idea that at this memory location is a set of bits that represent an int a double a chars whatever

23244
rss	feed
for instance this one sends you to google reader to view the rss feed for a page

23273
haskell	ocaml
it loses points for being about standard ml when ocaml f# and haskell are seemingly more popular

23322
cvs	svn
i think that using cvs with tortoisecvs and eclipse s would be nice as well though i prefer the way svn handles revisioning

23335
erlang	lisp
in functional school we would have nearly functional some considered them to be impure lisp family and ml family and many purely functional haskell erlang etc

23376
rar	zip
we tried zip in the past but once the database files crossed the 4gb boundary we had to use rar zip is 32-bit only

23392
jobs	cron
under linux you can use cron jobs to schedule tasks

23457
lisp	prolog
try prolog or lisp and see what you can do with those

23511
hash	md5
i understand that it uses a function referred to as md5crypt but i can t seem to find a description of the algorithm beyond that at some point it uses md5 to create a hash

23557
hash	salt
we can safely store the salt value with the hash password since even knowing the salt value won t help to decode the hash

23592
mp3	ogg	mp3	wav	wav	ogg
for example let us assume that i have about 200 podcasts downloaded to my pc in the form of mp3 wav and ogg files

23658
vim	notepad++
a fast loading text editor for when your ide is too much vim notepad++

23703

23726
centos	linux
what is the simplest way to install memcached on centos for someone new to the world of linux

23737
disk	ram
my machine has 2 gb of ram dual core processor and a 7200 rpm hard disk

23737
disk	ram
i know more ram and a faster hard disk could improve performance but do you have any tips to improve resharper visual studio performance

23804
versioning	upgrade
thus you may want to upgrade your mysql 3 server to 4 - this compatibility mode allows for the export your database or individual tables to create a sql file that can import into a mysql 4 versioning server should work in 5 also

23819
clang	llvm
for c and objective-c you can also use the llvm clang static analyzer

23835
for-loop	loops
for-loop and while loops are entry condition loops

23939
vim	textmate
for python stuff a good text editor textmate on os x g vim on linux programmers notepad on windows vcs i m mainly using git currently

23963
post	get
is this actually important can i live happily ever after with just get and post

23966
post	get
if you just use get and post it s still restful

23966
post	get
your web service may only do things which only required get or post so that s fine

24035
integer	unsigned
in fact your going to get a value bigger than an integer can hold 4 billion unsigned 2 billion signed before the stack is going to over flow fibbonaci 46

24046
firefox	safari
in ie and firefox you see the alert box again in safari you do not

24053
firefox	safari
i think it is because firefox and ie when going back are retrieving the page from the server again and safari is not

24065
put	get
people seem to get the concept better you put it in those terms

24103
post	get
i m no expert but from what i learned so far the golden rule is not to trust any user data get post cookie

24119
valgrind	gprof
once thatâ s done the shell is your command interface to interact with the various tools â debuggers gdb profilers gprof valgrind etc

24142
client-side	server-side
for instance if you have a form field that will only ever accept integers make sure you re implementing something at both the client-side and the server-side to sanitise the data

24142
onmouseover	onload
likewise if you re going to display any user-inputted information onto a webpage make sure you ve stripped any script tags or anything else that might result in javascript execution such as onload onmouseover etc

24148
getter	setter
your application isn t going to take any real-world performance hit either way but using a class lets you use getter and setter methods and is generally going to be better for code encapsulation and code reuse

24150
min	max
most min max macros will include the parameters multiple times and may not do what you expect

24156
g++	gcc
you should however know all the important parameters for g++ and ld the gcc linker tool that s invoked automatically except when explicitly prevented

24174
anjuta	gnome
i hear anjuta is pretty slick for gnome users

24270
lsp	principles

24414
keydown	keyup
anyone know of a way to capture keyboard events keyup keydown in portable ie under window mobile

24455
goto	break
in perl use of a label to goto from a loop - using a last statement which is similar to break

24476
goto	break
if you re in a nested loop and need to break out of all loops a goto can make this much cleaner and simpler than break statements and if-checks

24495
getter	setter
i have a struts + velocity structure like for example a person class whose one property is a car object with its own getter setter methods and it is mapped to a velocity form that submits to an action using modeldriven and getmodel structure

24513
goto	break
sometimes it s clearer to use a flag variable of some kind to effect a kind of pseudo-multi-level break but it s not always superior to the goto at least a goto allows one to easily determine where control goes to unlike a flag variable and sometimes you simply don t want to pay the performance price of flags other contortions to avoid the goto

24516
haskell	ocaml
i m trying to parse a grammar in ocamlyacc pretty much the same as regular yacc which supports function application with no operators like in ocaml or haskell and the normal assortment of binary and unary operators

24549
firefox	safari
it s supposedly being ported to firefox and safari but that s been happening for a while now

24595
vim	emacs
i have really tried to use emacs and vim but i don t have the time to learn them

24602
screens	tablet
to some extent it really depends if you want only a tablet no video feedback on the device or a screens having video feedback which i find nice but is also a bit pricey...

24613
kate	kde
kate kde syntax-highlighing

24638
firefox	safari
there is currently no way to programmatically disable the safari spellchecker as there is in firefox and ie7+ so most rich text editors choose to let safari do its own thing by leaving the browser in control of the context menu

24641
inherited	subclassing
inherited - subclassing - tends to

24645
implements	extends
i exposed a minimal interface to interact with the client api and it would have been awesome to extends the client api class and then just add an implements clause with my new interface

24661
implements	extends
i exposed a minimal interface to interact with the client api and it would have been awesome to extends the client api class and then just add an implements clause with my new interface

24682
minix	linux
as a side note if you ve read just for fun linus actually was playing with minix before he wrote linux but it just wasn t enough for his purposes

24707
jsf	tapestry	jsf	wicket	tapestry	wicket
i ve used tapestry 3 wicket echo and jsf fairly extensively

24707
jsf	tapestry	jsf	wicket	tapestry	wicket
in the end i d recommend just taking a look at tapestry wicket and jsf and just picking the one that feels the best to you

24732
vmware	virtualbox
aside from the good books already mentioned opeating system design implementation is particularly good get a hold of a 1.x release linux kernel load it into vmware or virtualbox and start playing around from there

24734
rss	feed
i m trying to add support for stackoverflow feed in my rss reader but selectnodes and selectsinglenode have no effect

24841
cifs	smb
winfuse which is kind of a barebones cifs smb server that can host your own filesystem

24908
free	malloc
to fix you need to call free for everything that is obtained with malloc after you finish using it

24910
int	double
for primitive types int double ... the operators are built in so the compiler will probably be able to optimize your code

24941
phpunit	simpletest
tips on gui s for phpunit would also be appreciated but my main focus is simpletest for this project

24943
cvs	svn
oh yeah don t forget support for source control directly from inside the tool svn cvs tfs scc

24969
getter	setter
if it is completely trivial getter setter etc do not test it unless you don t have confidence in the code for some reason

25008
lsp	principles
also due to lsp liskov substitution principles one can use derived class where base class is expected and this is actually imposes the greatest impact from use of inheritance code using base class may be given an inherited class and it still has to work as expected

25011
memcached	apc
i ve heard great things about memcached through irc but have never heard of apc - what are your opinions on them

25035
vb.net	vb6
were they in vb6 i think i would consider upgrading them to vb.net just for maintainability

25049
width	height
you can only change the height and width of a span element when it is set to display block

25056
memcached	apc
memcached is nice if you have clustered servers and youtube-like load but i d try out apc first too

25077
hash	md5
but i am confused as to how both files came out to the same md5 hash

25079
memcached	apc
i ve heard great things about memcached through irc but have never heard of apc - what are your opinions on them

25079
memcached	apc
actually many do use apc and memcached together .

25105
unix	bsd
unix and bsd courses courses and videos

25105
unix	bsd
not quite related but i ll also recommend the video history of the berkeley software distributions as it gives a nice introduction to the bsd parts of the unix history and culture as well as plenty of hilarious anectodes from back when

25110
width	height
you can set any element to display inline-block to allow it to receive a height or width

25158
hide	show
use one form and hide and show controls

25170
hide	show
the method i often use is actually to pre-setup all my controls on individual panel controls and then show and hide these panels as i need them

25170
hide	show
and if you show or hide the panel the controls on it do the same

25171
post	get
tamper data this can be helpful for debugging get post requests

25171
opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari
i also install safari and opera but mostly just use them for testing and benchmarking since their dev tools aren t as robust as firefox and they aren t as buggy as ie

25196
actionscript	mxml
flashdevelop hooks up nicely with the flex compiler which is available for free it compiles both mxml the language flex applications are written in and actionscript 3

25238
range	minimum
what s the best way to make an element of 100 minimum height across a wide range of browsers

25241
httpcontext	httpmodule
how do you unit test a httpmodule in asp.net given that httpapplication and httpcontext do no implement an interface

25256
httpcontext	httpmodule
essentially you need to remove the httpmodule s reliance on httpapplication and httpcontext replacing them with an interface

25303
vb.net	vb6
if what you are trying to do is allow searches for a tag say vb also find things tagged as vb6 visual basic visualbasic and vb.net wouldn t those values be set as synonyms in the db s thesaurus rather than query parameters

25343
mouse	keyboard
does one exist or are all products based on recording mouse and keyboard presses

25469
hide	show
show and hide these panels as i need

25511
jobs	cron
it sounds like you need to put some scheduled jobs in place with cron or windows equiv

25581
firefox	safari
if you learn css to the point where you can code most things without having to look up the reference if you re still looking up reference regularly you don t really know it and can t claim to complain i think and then develop for firefox safari it s a pretty nice place to be in

25581
firefox	safari
leave the pain and suffering of ie compatibilit to the end after it works in firefox safari so your mind will attribute the blame to ie where it damn well belongs rather than css in general

25614
jdom	xom	jdom	dom4j	dom4j	xom
i ve used jdom in the past and have looked briefly at xom and dom4j

25646
width	height
the width and height are correct and 800x600 buffer and m_pixelbuffer is correctly filled with 0xaa00aa00

25701
jdom	xom
i ve worked with jdom as well and there s absolutely nothing wrong with it although i do prefer xom

25784
getter	setter
they become part of the method signature available from the runtime which do can look at to determine how to best serialize a transaction. there are also the attributes within property declarations copy retain assign readonly readwrite nonatomic getter and setter

25815
super	implements
c.__bases__ is an array of the super classes so you could implements your hypothetical function like so

25855
udp	mtu
for linux according to the udp man page the kernel will use mtu discovery it will check what the maximum udp packet size is between here and the destination and pick that or if mtu discovery is off it ll set the maximum size to the interface mtu and fragment anything larger

25892
int	boolean
several new data types including long long int optional extended int types an explicit boolean data type and a complex type to represent complex numbers

25983
jdom	xerces
if you want to benefit from an xsl transformation engine like xalan or an xpath engine like jaxen or saxon i would recommend sticking to the more popular framework available like xerces jdom

25983
xslt	xquery
of course if you need blinding speed and do not care about xpath xquery or xslt you can surely find yourself something that is much faster and or resource-hungry

26015
hash	salt
the way i ve been doing it is a rather conventional approach of sending the score and player name in plain text and then a hash of the two properly salt

26025
apache	nginx
i have heard of mod_wsgi and mod_python on apache nginx and lighty

26068
apache	lighttpd

26080
postgresql	mysql
edit i should mention that i ve only used this syntax with access sql 2000 2005 express mysql and postgresql so those should be covered

int	chars
if you need to index simple chars or int values then the normal b-tree index is the best

26423
mvp	presenter
the issue i find with the mvp framework that the p p lib offers is that forms and controls own presenter instead of presenter controllers owning forms who didn t read it s just a view pragmatic programmer

26468
persistent	transient
this is basically the catch-all method as it converts a transient object into a persistent one save updates the object if it is existing update or even handles if the entity is a copy of an already existing object copy

26602
hide	show
which code decides to show hide the button that leads to the action is irrelevant

26602
hide	show
that leaves us with only one drawback of doing show hide logic in javascript - the html sent to user is bigger than necessary

26602
hide	show
having show hide logic in php does have a minus though

26602
hide	show
so if you already have a script that runs when your document load for other reasons i would seriously consider having show hide logic there

26668
vtune	shark
vtune and shark are both excellent as well

26682
profiling	instrumentation
it has several types of profiling built in performance memory windows handles exception tracing static analysis etc. and instrumentation the code to get the results

26845
bazaar	git
what are you using mercurial darcs git bazaar

26851
perforce	svn
we used perforce for well over a year before switching to svn recently

26851
perforce	svn
if anything i find working with svn easier and more intuitive than perforce

26851
perforce	svn
contrary to perforce visualsvn does not work with the ms scc interface but rather directly with the svn client which i personally see as an advantage

26851
perforce	svn
perforce does have support for many other oses but our non-windows devs feel more comfortable with svn too

26863
folder	directory
deleting the visual studio 9.0 folder in my application settings directory

26873
mvp	presenter
i think another benefit of using the mvc pattern is that it opens up the doors to other approaches to the design such as mvp presenter first and the many other mv patterns

26879
opera	firefox
however when the content gets larger opera and firefox show a scrollbar at the left so you can scroll to the content not on the screen

26912
hide	show
i have ran into issues using the ajaxcontroltoolkit on repeated fields and usually side with using a lighter weight client-side option up to and including rolling your own show hide method that can be reused just by passing in an dom understood id

26920
struts	wicket
i had successfully developed an online banking application with struts when i discovered wicket and saw how easy web application development can be

26929
perforce	cvs
perhaps after years of using a centralized model in one format or another perforce subversion cvs i just found distributed source control difficult to use

26942
swt	swing
don t know if it works with swt as well because i used only swing in my apps

26965
boost	stl
if you look into stl boost mfc atl and many open source projects you can see there are so many assertion statements and that makes project going further more safely

26969
cvs	svn
and cherry-picking merges while not trivial is not terribly difficult and far more advanced than anything svn or cvs can do

26973
client-side	server-side
because merges are performed client-side they are much faster and less error-prone than initiating a server-side merge

27000
nullpointerexception	indexoutofboundsexception
on the other hand nullpointerexception s and indexoutofboundsexception s might actually often be appropriate

27032
min	max
rather than just dropping controls on the form you ll have to play a bit with panels padding min max sizing and docking

27035
opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari
this is supported in opera and firefox and i recon in safari but haven t tested

27132
put	get
last in first out lifo means that the last thing you put in is always the first thing you get back out - if you push 2 items on the stack a and then b then the first thing you pop off the stack will be b and the next thing is a

27132
cpu	processors
don t break your programs up too far into smaller and smaller functions - even without counting local variables each function call consumes as much as 64 bytes on the stack 32 bit processors saving half the cpu registers flags etc

27140
put	get
do you put the contents first so that the user has to listen to them every time or do you put them at the end so that they can get to the content first

27148
rss	feed
i want to merge multiple rss feed into a single feed removing any duplicates

27160
csv	tsv
from my experience even just excel makes a pretty good tool for quickly whipping up graphs of perfmon if you relog the data to csv or tsv

27162
rss	feed
here is an article on merge multiple rss feed into one with yahoo

27244
rss	feed
simplepie is a php library that supports merging rss feed into one combined feed

27254
extjs	mootools
it could be that prototype or mootools or extjs are as good as jquery

27256
jquery	scriptaculous
to put some names out there prototype scriptaculous jquery dojo yui ...those all seem to have active users and contributers so they are probably worth reading up on to see if they meet your needs

27292
folder	directory
unfortunately svn places .svn hidden directory everywhere which cause problems especially when other developers make folder structure changes or copy move website directory

27340
post	get
considering the callback is buried in the client code it would take someone with equal determination to get either the querystring or the post request

27391
width	height
and why expect a certain minimum width or height

27393
rss	feed
in the latest podcast jeff and joel talked about the rss feed for tags and joel noted that there is only the current ability to do and on tags not or

27418
avr	microcontroller

27430
jboss	resin	jboss	weblogic	weblogic	resin
it support many servers not only weblogic including tomcat jboss resin jetty and websphere

27435
postgresql	mysql
i am working on a web application using python django and would like to know whether mysql or postgresql would be more suitable when deploying for production

27439
postgresql	mysql
from how i understand it postgresql is a more correct database implementation while mysql is less correct less compliant but faster

27440
postgresql	mysql
better performance can be bought with more ram and cpu and more appropriate database design and clever stored procedure tricks and so on - and all of that is cheaper and easier for random-website-x than agonizing over which to pick mysql or postgresql and specialist tuning from expensive dbas

27443
postgresql	mysql
if you are writing an application which may get distributed quite a bit on different servers mysql carries a lot of weight over postgresql because of the portability

27443
postgresql	mysql
in most regards postgresql is slower than mysql especially when it comes to fine tuning in the end

27445
postgresql	mysql
i haven t used django but i have used both mysql and postgresql

27445
postgresql	mysql
postgresql is a little more scalable it doesn t hit the brick wall as fast as mysql as data size client count increases

27450
accessor	properties
in addition you can serve out additional server-side objects from the myserverobject instance if you include public accessor for them in iremoteserver interface so accessing those objects become the simple matter of method calls or properties accesses on your main server object so you don t have to use activator for every single thing

27463
ssl	https
443 when used for https relies on ssl not ssh for its encryption

27481
multiplying	multiplication
multiplying by 3 can be done by simple shifts adds if no multiplying instruction exists or if multiplication only works with 8 bit operands

27483
avr	microcontroller
on my platform avr 8-bit microcontroller running gcc

27503
put	get
you should be able to take this and do some mild pruning of it to put in your username password dbname to get it up and working for you

27508
folder	directory
red gate s sql compare product not only allows you to do object-level comparisons and generate change scripts from that but it also allows you to export your database objects into a folder hierarchy organized by object type with one objectname .sql creation script per object in these directory

27529
postgresql	mysql
hard to compare mysql and postgresql

27587
x86	64bit
both 32 and 64bit x86 and 64bit ppc

27598
websphere	ibm
ibm websphere 6.1 it s supossed to support jsr 160 javatm management extensions jmx remote api

27630
public	protected
public dispose calls protected dispose true - deals with both managed and unmanaged resources

27642
boost	stl
so no stl or boost

27674
firefox	safari
in our project sharpwired we re trying to create a download component similar to the download windows in firefox or safari

27687
disk	ram
it is limited to 4gb of disk space 1gb of ram and will only use 1 processor

27711
gridview	linqdatasource
i m having a problem obtaining the total row count for items displayed in a gridview using paging and with a linqdatasource as the source of data

27786
easymock	jmock
i started using mocks through jmock but eventually transitioned to use easymock

27905
disk	ram
wcm - actually to nit pick the table variable isn t ram only - it can be partially stored on disk

27993
redhat	fedora
just happened across this article which point out shortcomings in redhat centos fedora implementations of perl which affect uri profoundly

27993
redhat	fedora
i realized that anyone running perl code with the distribution perl interpretter on redhat 5.2 centos 5.2 or fedora 9 is likely a victim

28059
svnkit	subclipse
i used the update url and i installed the javahl adapter the subclipse project itself and the svnkit adapter beta

28115
int	boolean
if you re converting anything other than simple types like int or boolean you d need to write your own function method for the type that you re trying to convert otherwise php will just print the type such as array googlesniffer or bidet

28132
range	min	range	max	min	max
the real power of arrayformula comes when you take the result from one of those computations and wrap it inside a formula that does take array or range arguments sum max min concatenate

28172
post	get
if you plan on doing it from the command line that is the impression i get from your post then you should probably define a strict set of allowable inputs only single letter variables no whitespace and only certain mathematical symbols +- etc.

28196
post	get
how can i join the tables to get all post with tags nuclear and deals that also belong to the category category1

28256
yacc	bison
it s simple enough that i don t see the need for yacc or bison

28272
yacc	bison
note that using a grammar does not at all imply using a specific tool a la yacc bison ...

28286
cos	sin
if you want it to be really really general such as be able to parse mathematical functions as well like sin 4+5 cos 7 3 you will probably need a parse tree

28317
mouse	keyboard
i also made sure that some of the mac os keyboard and mouse shortcuts were not registered in vmware fusion to stop strange things happening

28470
getter	setter
i would advise using setter getter instead

28541
aptana	radrails
i started out with radrails then moved to aptana when they took it over wasn t too bad

28551
submit	submission
in a day or two i ll be ready to submit my iphone app to the appstore and i m curious whether people who have gone through this process have any tips suggestions for a smooth submission process

28758
datamapper	activerecord
in his book on patterns martin fowler points out that activerecord tends to break down under conditions where your model is fairly complex and suggests a datamapper as the alternative

28758
datamapper	activerecord
whether your datamapper classes contain raw custom sql or calls to a data abstraction layer api or even access an activerecord pattern themselves doesn t really matter to the controller code that is receiving a nice populated user object

28769
ilist	icollection
there s also ilist or icollection if you want to use a construct that is still somewhat flexible but also has the feature you require

28820
vbscript	jscript
i d like this to be a little more friendly for the admins who are familiar with scripting in vbscript jscript etc

28827
expression-blend	silverlight
expression-blend code-named sparkle - visual user interface builder for windows presentation foundation and silverlight applications

28838
vbscript	jscript
there is definitely not a vbscript engine i ve ever heard of nor jscript

28849
tolower	toupper
what steve says is right but i guess that if your code had to support several languages you could have a factory method that encapsulates a set of methods that do the relevant toupper or tolower based on that language

28874
post	get
i am reluctant to post a chunk of ms framework code here but you could use either reflector or this to get the source code for the relevant bits of the framework so that you could try implementing various bits to see where it fails

28878
domxpath	domdocument
in php i m using domdocument and domxpath which closely corresponds to c# xmldocument

28885
solaris	aix
however having done a lot of development on ancient versions of solaris aix and hp-ux just recently - yes these platforms are still alive in the fortune 50 i can tell you that if you really care about portability you should use templates as little as possible

28919
ilist	icollection
if possible you might want to consider changing to use an icollection or ilist icollection being more widely scoped than ilist which has a count property on it

29046
postgresql	mysql
if you want to build a web site you really need a database server engine like ms sql postgresql mysql oracle or their brethren

29053
firefox	safari
the extra comma in the array is being ignored by safari and firefox while ie treats it as another object in the array

29053
firefox	safari
most people say that ie is correct but then safari is also doing the same thing as firefox

29124
cos	sin
my only warning against skipping the parsing tools or just using the shunting yard algorithm or a hand rolled recursive decent parser is that little toy languages 1 may someday turn into big actual languages with functions sin cos log and variables conditions and for loops

29124
multiplication	exponent
3 snippet of a haskell parser using parsec a four function calculator extended with exponent parentheses whitespace for multiplication and constants like pi and e

29144
perforce	svn
edit to clarify i know both perforce svn allow locking merging but svn encourages a liberal edit merge method whereas as i understand it perforce encourages a checkout-checkin method

29174
jquery	simplemodal
i m using jquery and simplemodal in an asp.net project to make some nice dialogs for a web app

29177
mousemove	mouseleave
i have found a blog post describing one mechanism but it involves a good deal of manual bookkeeping including status flags mousemove events manual mouseleave checking etc

29235
superclass	subclassing
if you don t declare your own constructor in the subclassing trying to instantiate it will throw a fatal error because it tries to call the superclass constructor

29238
perforce	svn
perforce supports merging and in fact had better merge support than svn until svn 1.5 where named merges were added as well as change lists which perforce has always had and i mis very much moving to a shop that used svn but we won t upgrade until 1.5 has been a bit more time tested.

29238
perforce	svn
it s worth noting that svn and perforce both allow you to do a locked checkout so you can do the unmerged model if you want but aside perhaps from managing binaries with version control i don t see much use for this

29242
stdout	stderr
edit clarification i am looking for code that i can easily drop in to my own programs to write to stderr stdout log files or other such output streams

29274
getter	setter
they are all emulated by using getter and setter

29277
daemon	cron
i think your best bet would be a ping daemon cron job that checks the status of each box periodically and sends an email if one doesn t respond

29319
put	get
if you put .tostring to a var query variable you get the sql

29358
ati	nvidia
for something that s not crazy expensive go with either a nvidia geforce 8000 series card or an ati 3000 series card

29422
decoder	encoder
running it through an encoder of some kind this is so so useful as it can just be run through the decoder

29521
int	chars
or you can convert the int to its chars value

29524
put	get
on the other hand it s possible to log arbitrary exceptions and if they get put in the stream as well my point stands.

29532
integer	unsigned
typically you should maintain the two-element buffer but handle a machine word 32 64 bit unsigned integer at a time

29545
put	get
once you get the count to 0 via the attribute you then put in a rule that new checkins may not introduce fxcop violations

29557
mbunit	nunit	mbunit	mstest	nunit	mstest
i ve read time and time again that tdd test first is more difficult with mstest than it is with other testing frameworks such as nunit mbunit etc.

29562
ubuntu	debian
my main goal is to create a .deb package for debian ubuntu users but i don t understand make configure files

29563
nunit	mstest
we are in fact moving away from nunit to mstest

29622
put	get
you also have to get your game rated by the esrb which will put you back another 2500

29640
swt	swing
it allows you to design user interfaces for swing swt and even the google web toolkit gwt

29680
pop-up	dialog
whenever the user provides invalid credentials the ntlm dialog box pop-up in internet explorer

29694
integer	unsigned
i keep mysql s auto_increment as unsigned integer fields of various sizes in order to make use of the full range as i know there will never be negative values

29694
integer	unsigned
ms sql does not support the unsigned attribute on all integer types so i have to choose between ditching half the value range or creating some workaround

29705
put	get
basically you get data from somewhere your outgoing articles do something to it aggregate and put it somewhere else your aggregates table data warehouse etc

29726
opera	firefox
someone has done it in ie6 but it does not work in firefox or opera afaik

29752
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
you can use either a sortedlist or sorteddictionary both sort by the key or a dataview

29754
post	get
to get around that you could implement a processing page like rob suggests that post back until the response is ready

29760
installation	upgrade
installation upgrade runs.

29770
vim	emacs
the first is rope a python refactoring library that comes with a vim and emacs plug-in

29770
vim	emacs
also plugs into vim and emacs

29792
postgresql	mysql
i have worked with oracle ms sql server mysql postgresql sqlite and sybase that i can think of

29831
profiling	benchmarking
and if after all this your profiling and benchmarking reveals that the lexical_casts are an unacceptable bottleneck that s when you should consider doing some macro horror

29836
igraph	networkx
as already mentioned networkx is very good with another option being igraph

29837
cvs	svn
maybe keep the doc s under cvs or svn and set it up so that emails are generated to whoever has checked out a copy when updates for the same doc

29862
min	max
the basic way of handling this is to group by your fixed fields and select a max or min for some unqiue value a datetime usually works well

29923
bazaar	git	bazaar	svn
at the place where i work we decided to move from svn to bazaar after evaluating git and mercurial

29923
bazaar	git
bazaar was easy to start off with simple commands not like the 140 commands that git has

29923
bazaar	git
in git you can do the same with playing around in the index staging area but bazaar has a better ui for it

29934
opera	firefox
the firefox model opera uses the handy variables input .selectionstart and selectionend

29972
teamcity	nant
i use teamcity with an nant build script

29972
teamcity	nant
teamcity makes it easy to setup the ci server part and nant build script makes it easy to do a number of tasks as far as report generation is concerned
