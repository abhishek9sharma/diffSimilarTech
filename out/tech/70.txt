background-image	background-color	background-image	background-position
also since outlook 2007 and probably 2010 is using word as a rendering engine it will ignore certain styles such as background-image background-position too it will however accept bgcolor and background-color

10308510
filtering	grouping
from here on it s simple grouping by the post fields you need only grouping by the ones you output in the query and filtering using having so that you return only posts multiplied by all categories

10308519

10308563
innodb	myisam
oracle for that matter so i am debating between innodb or myisam engine for mysql

10308578
innodb	myisam
if you choose mysql then i would suggest you use innodb over myisam because of database transaction support with is important for financial transaction

10308597
webclient	httpwebrequest
here s a translation to httpwebrequest needed rather than webclient in order to set the referrer

10308610
16-bit	64bit
the first issue is that compilers add padding for alignment so what you think is a structure containing 16-bit limit and 64bit address is probably 16-bit limit 48-bits of padding that the cpu isn t expecting and 64bit address

10308650
width	height
as a side suggestion why not pass in larger objects and structs rather than separate image names x y width and height arguments

10308655
innodb	myisam
innodb is newer while myisam is older

10308655
innodb	myisam
innodb is more complex while myisam is simpler

10308655
innodb	myisam
innodb is more strict in data integrity while myisam is not as

10308655
innodb	myisam
innodb has transactions while myisam does not

10308655
innodb	myisam
innodb has foreign keys and relationship contraints while myisam does

10308655
innodb	myisam
innodb has better crash recovery while myisam is poor at recovering data integrity at system crashes

10308655
innodb	myisam
myisam has full-text search index while innodb has not

10308655
innodb	myisam
the most important feature you need from innodb that myisam does not have is transactions

10308670

10311252
free	malloc
both answers explain the interaction and working of malloc and free in good detail without using very esoteric terms

10311252
free	malloc
to understand the difference between memory-management tools used by kernel brk mmap and those used by the c-compiler malloc free this is a must read

10311274
stdout	stderr
if you want to change the buffering behavior you must do so immediately after the fopen or before any i o for the standard filehandles stdin stdout stderr

10311326
free	malloc
of course the free library function either often makes the free memory zone reusable by further future calls to malloc or occasionally for large memory zones release some big memory chunk to the kernel using munmap 2 system call

10311326
free	malloc
the detailed behavior of free and malloc is implementation dependent

10311326
free	malloc
you should view malloc as a way to get heap memory and free as a way to say that a previously malloc -ed zone is useless and the system standard c library + kernel can do whatever it wants with it

10311342
mouseup	mousedown
the mouseup and mousedown events seem to work ok as the animation for a pressed button is working on middle click

that is when you call strncpy with final set to 1 strncpy copies one character and does not append the terminating nul-character which will then cause atoi to fail

10328381
int	chars
if this is really huffman-coding you shouldn t be using atoi and int at all but just binary or chars strings

10328409
int	double
if not explicitly defined the compiler will quietly provide memberwise copy for object assignment which is ok for simple primitives like int and double but not necessarily for dynamically allocated objects

10328415
children	parent
when i delete the parent i d like to do some operations for each one of the children objects before it starts to delete all of them

10328415

int	chars
this is caused by trying to use lpszcontentlength which is a in this case a string of chars presumably representing a number as a size_t usually a long int

10328527
strtol	atoi
note that atoi doesn t detect errors - so once you re done with the tutorial it would be a good learning exercise to change to strtol with appropriate error checking

10328527
int	chars
these are both caused by lpszcontentlength being a string of chars when it needs to be an int type

10328559

rspec	minitest
it s up to you obviously but i d recommend using -- the thinking here being if minitest spec is modeled after rspec in syntax then you might as well put the tests in the same place that rspec puts them so people won t be put off guard

10329165
hash	md5
you would have to compute the same deterministic hash function in php and in your mobile app preferably a very complex one mixing your own dark encrypting algorithms with md5 sha1 synchronized threads etc

10329167
width	height
of course you can set its width and height properties to parent component but then it will overlap this parent component

10329229
hash	md5
even though the unique value generated by uniqueid function is really pretty unique there is considerable probability of collision when using md5 hash algorithm different values will result in the same hash value

if the grid needs to be able to grow just use the same trick arraylist uses keep track of current width height and if you need more just multiply available space by a suitable value for a 2d array doubling might be a bit much but it depends on the type of growth that is possible

if we have used a properties without an ivar how can we release our outlet give that we are not supposed to use any accessor in an init or dealloc

10330103
accessor	properties	accessor	ivar
it seems to me that the only pattern which would allow us to release our outlet without an accessor is using a properties backed with an ivar so we can manually release our ivar in dealloc without using its accessor however this is the one option which apple s code-generation doesn t support

10331393
client-side	server-side
the issue is that drive initiates a server-side oauth 2.0 flow then the javascript client library initiates a client-side oauth 2.0 flow

10331393

subtraction	addition
my original point at least as well as i remember it was that population counting is about equivalent to many other operations like addition and subtraction that we normally assume are o 1

10344042
subtraction	addition
even using fairly unlikely worst-case assumptions separate storage for each of those tables this would still be easy to implement in a modern cpu -- in fact it s probably at least somewhat simpler than the single-cycle addition or subtraction mentioned above 1

10344042
subtraction	addition
obviously enough the same is going to be true with the other trivial operations like addition subtraction bit-wise and bit-wise xor and so on

10344042
subtraction	addition
looked at in these terms a popcnt instruction falls about halfway between bit-wise and or xor on one hand and addition subtraction on the other in terms of the difficulty to execute in fixed time

this approach is used in order to separate the dbcontext objectcontext from the generated entities and make it part of your dal which is a much better fit since it deals with your database

10357329
width	height
i m struggling to figure out how to change the width and height of the ext js grid or any ext js widget for that matter

10357329
width	height
they always seem to remain at a fixed height and width

10357365
for-loop	loops
or if you want the for-loop you do not need the .each loops

10357367
implements	extends
you are just shifting your ringtone player and cdt to the background and implements it in another class which extends service

10357386
int	chars
an int can be more than one chars

10357452
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
in other browser such as firefox google-chrome safari and opera redirect works normal

10357456
width	height
first do it pixel by pixel set the width and height of the image and copy each pixels value over one by one

10357468
portrait	landscape
just do this if you what to rotate from landscape to portrait

10357526
post	get
i am trying to return an http status code of 201 created for a restful post operation using asp.net 4 web api but i always get a 200 ok

10357562
switching	screens
since the me userid is your private data you ll need to click on the oauth 2.0 switching in the upper right side of the screens and authorize the api explorer to know who you are on google+ before submitting the query

10357579
min	max
is there a way to calculate the average min max of all numbers without using an array

10357580
folder	directory
when deploying a clickonce application the installation folder url is there a way to make it relative to the web application directory hosting it

10357588
post	get
i m trying to convert an audio file in php using ffmpeg i get the audio file via post as a m4a and i want to turn it into mp3

10357620
fadein	fadeout
maybe check for any other events that might be assigned to your buttons or styles that might be conflicting with the fadein fadeout

10357641
children	parent
this allows you to set up all of the parent controls on your main window and the children won t override them

10357643
min	max
you don t really need to store any numbers in an array to find the average min max as you are iterating through the numbers you do

10357653
stdout	stderr
adding makes sure to redirect stderr to stdout so you can see any error messages

10357670
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox google-chrome and other thats ok

10357674
button	checkbox
someone selects one or more checkbox and hit the delete button then it will delete the files references out of the database and delete the files out of amazon s3

10357744
pop-up	dialog
i have created a jquery event that pop-up a dialog when a visitor is leaving a page

10357744
pop-up	dialog
when the mouse is at y less than 2 the dialog pop-up

10357759
dbcontext	objectcontext
if you need the objectcontext instance backing your dbcontext object you can do the following

10357812
multiplying	add
because 8 is a power of 2 multiplying a float by it will never add or remove precision from the value unless you overflow

10357821
superclass	subclassing
it seems that when i create an instance of this subclassing from a different class the information in the superclass is not getting passed to the subclassing

10357825
versioning	upgrade
if your php versioning does not match the ajaxplorer s requirement you have to obviously upgrade php or abandon ajaxplorer in favour of another solution

10357826
min	max
you could try grouping by the second column and using min or max on the first given that you don t mind which value is chosen for the first

10357858
qtimer	qwidget
if by closed you mean destroyed then you can connect the qwidget s destroyed signal to the qtimer s destroy slot

10357900
width	height
a elements are inline by default and you cannot set the height width of inline elements

10357919
qstyle	qwidget	qapplication	qwidget	qapplication	qstyle
use qstyle to change it to a different native look use qapplication setstyle or qwidget setstyle

10357946
width	height
the default display type for a link is inline which does not respond to height or width

10357967
outputstream	inputstream
this gives me access to the outputstream and inputstream of that system

10357972
google-chrome	firefox
i have a table that the styling is off on ie8 and does not appear at all in ie9 - but looks good in google-chrome and firefox

10358040
hash	salt
a salt + a hash

10358040
salt	md5
i also don t think you need an overly complex hashing algorithm just md5 with a salt is hard enough

10358074
pop-up	dialog
i have a dialog box that pop-up with the tk root

10358076
google-chrome	firefox
inside of ie8.css you can have styles that fix the weirdness you are seeing but that won t effect the layout for google-chrome or firefox

10358083
pull	push
downsides are that you always have to pull push the entire xml blob to do an update and it is difficult to impossible to query on any custom fields

10358179
scala	typesafe
moreover you can use eclipse which has a support from both android by google and scala by typesafe sides

10358206
queue	fifo
achieving true typeahead requires maintaining a so-called typeahead buffer â a fifo queue for instanceâ whose role it is to store a limited amount of keyboard input until it is called for

10358209
hex	binary
from then i know i need to smush these together somehow and then convert from binary to hex

10358266
google-chrome	firefox
there are two ways to get set transform values for svg elements in google-chrome firefox ie or any standards-fearing svg user agent

10358266
inherited	properties
click the show inherited properties methods

10358345
post	get
all get requests work great this way but i cannot figure out how to accomplish authenticated post requests

10358364
screens	hdpi
i also use a differenlty sized 9patch image in ldpi mpdi hdpi xhdpi for each splash screens as well

10358364
mdpi	hdpi
i know mdpi is 1.0 and hdpi x1.5 in relative size and xhdpi is x2 but when i m creating that first mdpi image how do i know how many pixels wide high it should be

10358392
post	get
i suspect this is to get around the problem addressed by j.j.kim s post above

10358394
folder	directory
if you want to catch the uk folder you have to do that at the root directory

10358406
scala	typesafe
the scala tools hosting was never provided or supported by typesafe

10358406
versioning	upgrade
my advice would be to first upgrade to a newer versioning of sbt

10358439
folder	directory
within each of the sub folder are the directory css js and html so i keep my pages and apps separate and my file types separate within them which seems sensible to me

10358485
inherited	properties
declarations once you ve applied it to #nav this properties inherited down to all nested elements unless of course you have an intervening layer with text aligned left or center

10358485
inherited	properties
properties that inherited are listed here

10358540
cpython	pypy
to illustrate a python python comparison i just tested your script on cpython 2.7.3 and pypy 1.8 on the same machine

10358546
post	get
although i m sure in your real program you have that search value coming from a url encoded form through get or post so the encoding on the js file wouldn t matter

10358576
width	height
i am trying to get the image width and height from a image drag and drop html 5 file api

10358576
width	height
what is the proper way to get the image width and height in pixels

10358612
activemq	rabbitmq
the some routing logic box could be an esb or in this very case be implemented in the messaging server for instance activemq with virtual destinations or websphere mq or perhaps rabbitmq among others

10358619
int	chars
a chars is a disguised int

10358619
int	chars
a chars represents a chars by coding it into an int

10358619
int	chars
when you add them together you get an int which is the sum of the code of the chars and the value of the int

10358620
int	chars
instead of int you declare ans as a chars

10358623
chown	chmod
if you have ssh access log in and use chmod and or chown on the command line

10358634
manual	jmp
i read the manual more carefully now especially the pseudocode for the call ret and jmp instructions since they are at liberty to change the rip

10358638
int	chars
chars in java can be promoted to int so if you ask to add an int like 1 to a chars like 1 alias 49 the more narrow type chars is promoted to int getting 49 + 1 50

10358640
uilabel	uibutton
you should probably be using uibutton instead of uilabel

10358643
inherited	subclassing
a uilabel is not a subclassing of uicontrol which gives you the inherited functionality that you want

10358644
typedef	struct
use the struct keyword for structures and only use typedef when you re either a defining an opaque type that might be implemented as anything or b defining an alias for an arithmetic type you might want to change in the future or in different configurations for example if you want to be able to choose float or double

10358652
int	chars
chars is really just a two-byte unsigned int

10358674
istream	getline
std getline istream ... to read one line at a time

10358713
pull	push
for some of them when i create a local tracking branch git push -u origin mybranch or --set-upstream origin mybranch i can pull and push to that branch with git pull git push respectively and it all works fine

10358713
pull	push
but other in other cases other projects when i try the same scenario i can pull git pull but i have to specify origin and the branch when i push - git push origin mybranch

10358713
pull	push
in the one that works p1_branch shows both push pull entries in the remote show output

10358741
put	get
when i directly override the get set methods i see that they are being used by the proxy to put raw data into the model

10358785
for-loop	arrays
i m thinking i need to do a for-loop with an arrays or a jquery.each function but not certain how the best way to approach this is

10358809
activiti	drools
that would include a service container a routing engine camel a messaging layer activemq etc. on top of that just add in nice high level open source components for rules drools and bpm activiti

10358824
children	parent
i need to map some parent children relationship on top of a legacy database the problem is how the tables are structured

10358885
pop-up	dialog
also if you did not supply an owner for the dialog when you created it you should use setlocationrelativeto owner to make it pop-up in the center of the owner

10358886
folder	directory
when working with branches i need to check out all files in branchi right under proj but not in a branchi sub folder in order to keep the above flat directory structure

10358924
equals	compareto
use the instance compareto string anotherstring or equals object method to compare the contents of strings i.e

10358936
children	parent
each object would manage its relationships similar to activerecord and would know how to get children and parent

10358942
int	chars
1 int to represent number of rows max number of chars in middle

10358995
super	self
if you fail to assign self to the result of super s initializer or if you fail to check for nil then you may be holding on to a dangling deallocated pointer exc_bad_access and you may not initialize your ivars properly you would effectively assign them to another region if an exc_bad_access were not encountered

10359000
super	self
when you call super hdonor self and self is actually a child of hdonor super s result will pass function calls to hdonor class not the hbatom as you expected

10359074
udp	tcp
the client only receives packets and server only sends. udp or tcp

10359083
onresume	onpause
nope this actually only called the super class onpause and onresume without doing anything else

10359083
onresume	onpause
so you have to save them onpause and restore them on the onresume to avoid this

10359105
uilabel	uibutton
the easiest way to accomplish this is to put a uibutton over your uilabel and set the type to custom

10359140
ssl	https
there are many many classes and code snippets showing how to do this https get ssl with android and self-signed server certificate but i can t find any that show how to actually use the classes

10359162
libjpeg	libpng
moreover it will use other libraries like libpng or libjpeg for images libalsa for sound etc

10359186
viewdidload	viewdidappear
i just want to call viewdidload or viewdidappear on the current active view controller when applicationdidbecomeactive gets called so i can reset some animations or whatever when the app is started up again from the background

10359189
google-chrome	firefox
i m looking at this in firefox google-chrome on a mac.

10359209
for-loop	loops
in the for-loop they cease to exist as soon as loops makes one iteration if you create the labels before loops they cease to exist at the end of the function

10359221
google-chrome	firefox
works fine in google-chrome but not in firefox 11

10359239
spaces	delimiter
the default delimiter is spaces and tab

10359261
ubuntu	debian
to use them in your program you have to #include the corresponding headers for example to use the gtk libs the headers aren t installed by default in many distros for example in debian and ubuntu you have to download the package with apt-get

10359296
int	chars
if x is only one chars it could even be represented by a single int variable

10359327
stdout	stderr
when executing a batch file with ant s apply or exec tasks on windows i found there are special cases where some of the stdout and stderr is not captured by ant

10359327
stdout	stderr
it seems that the batch file s stdout and stderr is captured however commands called by the batch file are somehow not seen by ant

10359327
stdout	stderr
using the output and error attributes as suggested above doesn t help because only some of the stdout and or stderr is captured

10359343
google-chrome	firefox
i am having a button which point to a actionlink that i render with jqueryui button all i want is the rendering visual of the button and keeping its normal behavior on google-chrome fine the button points to the actionlink but on firefox 11 when i click the button nothing happens

10359343
google-chrome	firefox
this is working on google-chrome but non firefox 11

10359362
ssl	https
if your application is communicating to a https server having ssl certificate you can compare the server certificate received from the server received in above mentioned method with server certificate embedded in your application

10359447
int	double
everything on this line is of type double with the exception of the loop index nn which is of type long unsigned int

10359447
int	double
the cast from long unsigned int to double generates the assembly instruction fxtod which the profiler flagged

10359447
int	double
as a test i removed the reference to nn from the line thus removing the cast from unsigned int to double and the execution time of the loop reduced by almost a half in a loop that performs about a dozen floating point operations on an ultrasparc iv processor

10359447
int	double
is it normal for a cast from int to double to be much more expensive that a cache miss let alone a floating point multiply

10359449
portrait	landscape
i am recording video using mediarecorder.i have surfaceview attached to the recorder for preview.i have different layouts for portrait and landscape.now the preoblem is that when i change the orientation surface is getting created again ofcourse it is so as it is different for landscape n portrait ..in this case inorder to get the preview i have to stop then prepare the recorder with new surface and start recorder again.is it possible to change the preview surface while recording

10359553
queue	fifo
the idea is that you use an auxiliary queue to maintain the items to be processed and rely on the fifo ordering of the queue to process the items in order and in parallel

10359586
google-chrome	firefox
i am running the grid on a ubuntu headless server and my remote controls on one windows 7 machine running ie9 and firefox and a windows vista machine running ie8 and google-chrome

10359597
springsource	grails
i m using grails 2.0.3 from within springsource tool suite 2.9.1 eclipse on windows 7

10359635
ubuntu	linux	folder	directory
i m on ubuntu linux so i have an images folder inside my src directory

10359640
versioning	upgrade
first up upgrade to the latest versioning 2.0.6 there are serious security issues with vm prior to 2.0.6 even 2.0.4 had serious security fixes and would be would be better

10359677
uiview	calayer
alternatively you can also use a generic uiview object and assign your image as the content of the viewâ s calayer object

10359679
versioning	upgrade
it makes no sense to me at all since i have an upgrade versioning of such framework

10359710
rss	feed
but it s not a valid rss feed as it doesn t have the required elements as well as adding in others that do not fall in the rss specifications

10359748
istream	getline
hint 2 getline returns result rtfm if you would use c version or for c++ and corresponding istream methods

10359750
puts	fflush
ios app instead puts it at the end of the file every time you fflush your stream

10359783
post	get
i have few functions that sanitize everything in get and post but this one must be bit more specific i have an array that is producing links like

10359783
post	get
also have a function that is sanitizing get and post but that function would clear everything from this array values so i am left with

10359799
width	height
the css sets the link to be a block element thus occupying the width and height of the div

10359803
post	get
i ll post more once you get this working

10359811
put	get
you now have an application-level usersession object that is specific to that user that you can put get stuff

10359816
spaces	delimiter
words within phrases are delimiter by spaces

10359828
int	chars
followingconcernedoftunbridgew s suggestion if you maintain a two-column table with a primary key int column hr that goes from 0 to 23 and a chars 20 column rng containing the space-prefixed range string for each hour

10359848
textview	imageview
i want to center the textview with the imageview above it

10359851
for-loop	arrays
in your threeofakind method the second for-loop will only get executed once unless the first number stored in your arrays is a 2 it should look more like this

10359874
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
note if you are constantly adding removing items from existingholdings then you could use sorteddictionary which should be faster sortedlist is faster for accessing elements but takes longer adding removing

10359883
fileoutputstream	objectoutputstream
i want to create my own file with icon that inherit from jframe icon that i set it in java and my own file use fileoutputstream and objectoutputstream

10359887
width	height
the reason you are always seeing 500x375 as your width and height is because those are the default values of the mxmlc compiler specifically the -default-size option

10359933
put	get
get the innerhtml of that object and put that innerhtml into the #content item

10359945
width	height
say a tile should always occupy 5 of the screen s width and 6 of the screen s height then the scaling would look like

10359945
width	height
you can get the screen s width and height using graphicsdevice.viewport.width height

10359959
des	rsa
first i will use rsa to send the des key between the two sides client to server

10359959
des	rsa
i sent the rsa public used it and sent the des key encrypted to the server and decrypted

10360054
width	height
add the optional width and height fields as url parameters

10360054
width	height
where width and height are your requested dimension values

10360054
width	height
this will return a profile picture with a minimum size of width x height while trying to preserve the aspect ratio

10360054
width	height
maximum width and height of 50 pixels

10360054
width	height
maximum width of 50 pixels and a maximum height of 150 pixels

10360054
width	height
maximum width of 100 pixels and a maximum height of 300 pixels

10360054
width	height
maximum width of 200 pixels and a maximum height of 600 pixels

10360079
x86	64bit
it s a command line driven tool available in c program files microsoft sdks windows phone v7.1 tools isolatedstorageexplorertool c program files x86 microsoft sdks windows phone v7.1 tools isolatedstorageexplorertool on a 64bit machine

10360122
min	max
this xslt 1.0 solution uses recursive templates to parse a delimited list of values to return the min max value from the list

10360140
outputstream	inputstream
if that s not an attractive option you could still write your information to an outputstream which is then piped to an inputstream elsewhere in your app

10360224
width	height
since you re implementing the callback you should have the surfacechanged surfaceholder holder int format int width int height method somewhere

10360224
width	height
you can use the passed in width and height parameters to calculate the scale and appropriately scale down the bitmap

10360259
int	chars
a possibility would be using lists of chars as length-1 strings or maybe code units as int instead of strings so you can overwrite that list after use but that would require every code that touches it to support this format if even a single one of them creates a string with its contents it s over

10360262
width	height
in onclick event however you get position of item clicked so just design a new layout file with imageview will width and height fill parent and create a activity that show this layout file

10360291
screens	mdpi	screens	hdpi	mdpi	hdpi
in other words use an mdpi device to figure out the relative size on the screens and from there on apply the given scaling ratios to produce resources for the ldpi hdpi and xhdpi buckets

10360291
screens	mdpi
obviously you do not actually have to scale up that mdpi resource - all you need determine is the size for that screens density and then you can use whatever source file to produce images for all buckets

10360291
screens	mdpi
with this information you can easily verify that 1dp on an mdpi device with 160dpi screens is equal to 1px

10360320
public	protected
if i understand correctly with __set you can create class variables on the fly which will be public as well as access private protected properties

10360320
mutators	setter
with individual setter mutators 1 for each protected private property you have individual validation control but you have to write a bunch of setter

10360364
pull	push
they push and pull realtime data through xmpp

10360377
versioning	upgrade
and the fix to your problem is to upgrade your ghc to a versioning adhering to the newer haskell2010 standard

10360380
post	get
its really simple we start by declaring ajax function then we declare the method get or post - just like html form data is used the parameters to be passed through url

10360407
width	height
so what you need to to do is try using the same height and width of the created bitmap while drawing it on the canvas.sometimes it may become right.this piece of code may help you

10360463
hash	md5
i have a md5 hash for example 5d41402abc4b2a76b9719d911017c592 and i want to find another string that has the same hash

10360494
apache	lighttpd	apache	nginx	nginx	lighttpd
you can do url configurations like this in apache lighttpd nginx and i ve seen it done on occasion but to some doing it this way would be a big learning curve

10360523
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
i tested in google-chrome opera firefox ie.

10360531
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
till now i ve been using controller or controllers like uitabbarcontroller or uinavigationcontroller to manage the uiviewcontroller hierarchy

10360538
hash	salt	hash	md5	salt	md5
upon login - you concatenate the session id a salt and the users password hash into a string and then md5 hash it

10360538
hash	salt	hash	md5	salt	md5
now when they request a page you just select from the database where an md5 hash of the users password session id and salt the auth cookie

10360547
hash	md5
of course you could just do a google for md5 hash lookup and just input your existing md5 hash and get the string result

10360617
for-loop	loops
a range-based for-loop is just syntactic sugar for normal loops using iterators so the above applies

10360630
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
try to do that in viewwillappear or viewdidappear instead

10360642
expander	togglebutton
i have an expander that located in a canvas and want to expand it up but it s togglebutton move to down when it opens.whats the problem this is my code

10360712

please refer to uibaritem class reference uitabbaritem is subclass of uibaritem

10360719
octal	decimal	octal	hex
d means print as number in decimal o octal x hex

10360745
put	get
first get yourself a function and put it in mysql.php for the frequent use

10360745
post	get
also note that you shouldn t use get method to delete records - only post

10360746
couchbase	couchdb
i am looking to use erlang chicagoboss webserver to develop webapp with couchbase couchdb as backend

10360776
for-loop	loops
if this is the case then your syntax is messed up in the third section of your for-loop where you set and that is exactly where the exception is being thrown because this part gets executed before the comparison of takes place and breaks you out of loops

10360788
gif	png
here i need to create thumbnail of jpg png and gif images

10360801
width	height
the src_big image has a maximum width or height of 720 pixels if the image was uploaded before march 1 2012

after reading about the many different ways to do it in gwt i decide to use requestfactory because apparently it the most affective way to write maintainable application

10361475
requestfactory	gwt
the problem is that there is no tutorial about requestfactory and eclipse is hard enough to manage when you know if it even harder to manage when i m using a new tool like gwt

your metaclass will almost certainly be a subclassing of type because you probably don t want to make your different kind of class completely different

10362185
getter	setter
you have to keep in mind the reason for the existance of getter setter

10362185
public	protected
setting the constant to public is completely acceptable since it is not a private variable that needs to be protected

10362196
stdout	stderr
below is a modified version of your script you basically need to understand that some applications have thiere standard output towards stderr standard error so when you don t see thier output put in a variable you just need to redirect it to stdout standard outputp

10362203
accessor	properties
you could declare a properties with only a get accessor without even declaring the set accessor not even private

10362217
hide	removeclass
as dfsq said i just had to use removeclass hide instead of toggle

10362226

you should also upgrade xdebug to the latest versioning

10362231
clang	llvm
i d suggest you to have a look at llvm in combination with clang

10362291
int	chars
by the way casting int i to a chars will print out 333 assuming input is 3

10362429
post	get
other way to do this one way is to include nooflikes and noofcomments in post table so in order to get popular post i will have to access only post table but the problem with this approach is whenever a user makes a comment over a post then i will have to increment noofcomments in post table as well as make a entry in comments table problem starts when the increment is successfully made to post table and before making change to the comments table connection is lost

10362457
http	spdy
spdy has a number of advantages that go beyond what http pipelining can offer which are described in the spdy whitepaper

10362457
http	spdy

pthreads	fork
if you want to make it a valid php script it is going to be a lot of work but if you re using pthreads you can use fork which will make it relatively simple

10362660
int	boolean
so far so good expr1 represents the int constant 42 expr2 and expr3 the boolean constants true and false

10362660
int	boolean
the expressions we have seen so far except number 6 all have a value expr1 has the int value 42 the rest are boolean true false true false for expr s 2 through 5

10362660
int	boolean
as you can see the values are either int or boolean and so can be represented as values of type value

10362660
int	boolean
in words the evaluator should return the value of a constant expression and if the expression is a logical and it should return the logical and of the values of constituent expressions which need to be boolean values - you can t take the logical and of an int and a boolean or two int

10362660
int	boolean
the problem boils down to the fact that expr values can either have a boolean or an int value and you can t see that type anymore so it s possible to and two expressions together for which this doesn t make sense

10362660
int	boolean
one way to solve this would be to split expr into two new expression types one having int values and the other with boolean values

10362660
int	boolean
the evaluator would also need two versions one for int expressions and one for boolean expressions

10362660
int	boolean
instead of saying the type of an expression is an int or a boolean but i don t know just yet and running into problems when evaluating expressions we make sure from the beginning that we know the type of the value of an expression and that we don t combine them in ways that don t make sense

10362660
int	boolean	int	chars
simple things to try are making an expression that adds two int values using string or chars constants or making an if-then-else expression which takes three arguments the first of boolean type and the second and third of the same type but that type could be int bool chars or whatever

10362681
16-bit	64bit
addresses can and usually are greater than what 8 bits can hold cl is 8-bit cx is 16-bit ecx is 32-bit rcx is 64bit

10362717

10362800
button	checkbox
in one viewmodel there is a button and a checkbox

10362800
button	checkbox
now if the button was hit then on the other viewmodel should be checked if the checkbox is set too

10362842
versioning	upgrade
perhaps it is because you have hard coded the versioning number 12 into your openhelper and your previous database was also versioning 12 so no upgrade is being performed and the database is being left in its current state

10362852
primefaces	icefaces
i m using icefaces datatable but with primefaces datatable it will be the same

10362886
qgraphicsscene	qgraphicsitem

inherited	subclassing
i have a set of related models in my rails application that i want to store in the same mongodb collection - i have been using mongoid inherited i ve stripped down the models for brevity but have different fields in the different subclassing so i dont want to solve the problem by just having a single class and a phone_type field

10363089
division	multiplication
i have seen that armadillo does have element wise multiplication and division but no indication that a generalized function is available

10363090
scheme	racket
i have noticed that people often act as though scheme and racket are the same thing here on stack overflow and also elsewhere on the web

10363090
scheme	racket
for example questions about scheme often generate solutions in racket

10363090
scheme	racket
if you take a look at the questions tagged scheme you ll see that half of their answers start with #lang racket

10363090
scheme	racket
is racket just an extension of scheme scheme code will always run on a racket interpreter

10363113
put	get
so i need to find the application sandbox of the iphone simulator and get this database to later put it into main bundle later on

10363117
scheme	racket
however the racket implementation can run standard scheme code

10363117
scheme	racket
racket is not a superset or subset of scheme

10363149
put	get
i d rather do from daterangeparser import parse which seems simpler and more pythonic but i can t seem to work out how to get this to work do i need to put something else in __init__.py

10363150
src	attr
the attr src .. should only be called once or every time you want to load the page

10363158
memcached	apc
i have apc and memcached varnish cache and fooman speedster running

10363170
scheme	racket
racket is very close to scheme and in fact until two years ago it was called plt scheme

10363170
scheme	racket
however the default language that is used in racket diverges from scheme in a few places most notably it has immutable pairs

10363170
scheme	racket
it s also not something that is unique to racket the scheme standard s are so minimalistic that the language that they define is impractical which means that all scheme implementations add their own extensions

10363170
r5rs	r6rs
another important point in the racket case is that defining new dialects is very easy -- and racket implements a strict r5rs dialect the fact that it s strict means that it s not very useful and it also implements an r6rs dialect

10363174
folder	directory
i ve put some images in a folder in the same directory as the .cs and .xaml files

10363174

10363416
crypt	hash
you should use php s crypt or hash for hashing passwords rather than sha-1

10363427
put	get
my approach for now is to make it in a qtextedit when the user click the button i get the signal and using the cursor index i put html tag but i don t know if it s a good idea

10363441
width	height
in the function rounded_rectangle left top width and height are the parameters for the bounding rectangle and radius is the radius of the corner arc

10363447

the last major release 4.0 has been in march 2007 although the openlaszlo team considered the 4.2 release to be equal to a major versioning upgrade since it added the actionscript 3 and swf9 support to the platform

10363571
post	get
think of cf and most web servers systems as accepting input url get form post cookie etc and returning output html json text etc

10363584
onchange	onblur
edit you probably only want to validate when the value changes and field loses focus that s why imo the onchange event would be more appropriate than onblur not onblure

10363604
ant	maven
print out the environmental variables when you are running via ant and also under maven and make a comparison to determine the source of the missing library error

10363604

hash	md5
- md5 hash generated second 159380

10364772
prng	random
this way i have a random password which is generated using a suitable-for-cryptography prng not class random see this question for details on why class random is not okay here and which can be represented as a string and sent in an email shown in an interface or typed in or copy-pasted by the user

10364786
hash	salt
the point of the salt hash is to build a verification system whereby you do not have to store their password in the first place but you can still verify that they know their password

10364795
int	boolean
i have an application that reads data from large files and produces objects of various types boolean int string that are categorized in a few less than a dozen groups and then stored in a database

10364815
portrait	landscape
it can force all other apps run in landscape or portrait mode

thin	webrick
if you seriously think webrick is your performance bottleneck you ll probably want to try out thin next

10364850
hide	show
and is it possible at all to hide a scroll view in order to just show a regular screen in the same view

10364850
hide	show
edit ok i know how to hide the scroll view now but when the scroll view is show you can t scroll

10364926
int	chars
fifth getcolumnindexorthrow returns an int not a chars

10364938
post	get
i can send post requests using org.apache.http.clien.httpclient and get the http response

10364938
post	get
so how can i read the cookie of the post request response and send it back using a get request after the post request

10364983
pecl	pear
i understand that i need to install appropriate libraries to use them and everything was fine until i got that it is almost impossible to install pecl or pear to a hosting service i am using godaddy

10365018
subtraction	modulo
not to mention that you re calling an external process every time you re doing subtraction or taking the modulo which can get expensive

10365045
profiler	aqtime
on windows you ll have to search for allocation profiler there s purify and aqtime 7 use _crtdumpmemoryleaks msvc specific may produce false positives or write custom memory manager that overrides global operator new delete and reports memory usage

10365086
g++	gcc
i m wondering if there is a glibc function that i can use from gcc g++ that will retrieve the current executable

10365087
width	height
but i intend to put that under limitations because i can t work on it i don t have enough time i m still getting poor gaze width and gaze height

10365117
width	height
if i remember correctly -- it s been a while -- there is no width or height until there is something in the movieclip

10365154
factors	mean
if you don t mind a small constant factors o n memory cost you could restart every n values eg million - smarter still would be to adapt this value by detecting when precision is too low storing previous mean and stdev and then combine for the final result so your mean is the appropriately weighted value from the recent running total and the old binned values

10365157
free	malloc	free	alloca	alloca	malloc
is there any mature c c++ compiler capable of optimizing malloc free or new delete pairs info alloca

10365157
free	malloc
this optimization may be allowed only for pair of malloc free when both functions are in the same function or even in the same block of and free is called every time when malloc is called

10365157
free	malloc
ps update1 we can limit our discussion only to cases when compiler knows that malloc and free is from libc stdlib

10365161
put	get
as performing a get and then a put

10365166
onkeyup	onkeydown
note it is worth noting that onkeydown will fire multiple times before onkeylongpress does so you may want to trigger on onkeyup instead or other logic to prevent acting upon a series of onkeydown calls when the user is really holding it down

10365193
put	get
i am trying to make python allow private variable so i made this decorator that you put at the begging of a class so that every function will get an additional private parameter that they can modify to be what they want

10365196
google-chrome	firefox
apparently ie9 doesn t report the height of the html tag as other browsers such as firefox and google-chrome do

10365205
free	malloc	free	alloca	alloca	malloc
if a compiler optimized malloc + free into an alloca the observable behavior of the code would change for some inputs it wouldn t crash with malloc + free but it would with alloca because the stack space got exhausted

10365205
free	malloc
the optimization performed by llvm and mentioned in the comments is a different thing it only optimizes out malloc s that are only compared to null and then free d

10365207
getter	setter
it s also worth noting that in python setter getter are pointless

10365208
cytoscape	gephi
in addition to cytoscape you might want to check out gephi

vim	emacs
i ve tried vim but it s modal so i prefer emacs

10365262
for-loop	loops
i m trying to use uialertviews inside a for-loop to sum numbers which shall be input in the alert view s text box but the problem is that the alert shows up as many times as the for-loop runs and i don t know how to make loops wait for a button press on the alert view and then loops again

10365271
post	get
the first one is that your form is being submitted using the get method but you re trying to retrieve your values in php as if it had been submitted with the post method

10365332
button	checkbox
the self.buttonbox self.frametoplevel adds some button and the self.body self.canvas adds a bunch of checkbox for the user to manipulate

10365394
switching	screens
the point is i have to change text size each time i switching from station to standlone laptop because the text size is too big on my double screens but too small on my laptop screens

10365440
viewdidload	viewwillappear
the thing is that calling this segue from viewdidload or viewwillappear takes no effect

10365455
portrait	landscape
at the moment only iphone is supported in portrait or landscape mode

google-chrome	firefox
i m designing an email in dreamweaver with inline css but every test i make with hotmail in firefox and google-chrome always renders header tags as a green font color

10365499
required	placeholder
this would required a lot of extra cleverness on the part of the compiler though and the scala language designers have decided that it s not worth itâ that placeholder syntax only needs to be provided for some fairly simple cases without nested expressions

10365516
getter	setter
so applist is the list of all applications with its own getter setter questionsetprogress is defined by

i noticed the following output from the websphere ibm jdk when i start my server with netty nio code

10365530
websphere	ibm
i am using netty 3.4.0 final with ibm jdk for websphere 6.1

10365530
websphere	ibm
what is a better nio provider mean - is that saying i need a better jvm - not ibm one i have to use for websphere

10365577
for-loop	arrays
why don t you simply cast those values to string within the original for-loop creating a string arrays rather than an int arrays

10365577
for-loop	arrays
assuming that you re gathering your initial integer from a starting point and adding to it on each for-loop iteration the following is a simple methodology to create a string arrays rather than an int arrays

10365577
for-loop	arrays
if you need both int and string arrays with the same values in them create them both in the same for-loop and be done with it

10365610
put	get
but i get a black screen while i have already put some controls in senderplayerviewcontroller

10365625

the parse_input_fragment function compiles fine if i put it in grandiose.cpp but i get error messages when i split it up as described

10365718
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i tried on google-chrome firefox and safari they all honor the flush request

10365728
children	parent
the position is out of bounds which returns null causing your nullpointerexception since the only children of parent are the visible ones instead try a faster simpler approach

10365732
post	get
you ve got two input fields with the same name so only one will be returned on post get

10365756
versioning	upgrade
update instead of upgrading to 11.2 versioning i upgrade to 11.1

10365785
uiview	subviews
but if it were me doing this my first approach would be to get a handle to the uiview i want to copy then recursively iterate all the subviews of it and then copy add them as subviews to the uiview i want to copy the main uiview into

10365839
uiview	subviews
create another instance of the uiview you wish to clone and add it as a subviews to another view

10365840
messagebox	spy++
use spy++ to get insight into the parts that make up the messagebox window

10365892
hash	salt
you should use a salt hash function as an absolute minimum

10365892
hash	salt
secure hash and salt for php passwords

10365957
post	get
yes you should never accept user input from a form post data as part of a url get data or even a cookie without first checking it is what you would expect

10365957
hash	md5
i would also store the password as a md5 hash of what the user entered when they signed up so you get the password at signup check it has a limited range of characters do hass_pw md5 password and store the hash_pw in the d b

10365961
superclass	subclassing
my scenario is this i have an abstract superclass let s call this superclass and some subclassing of this superclass subclass1 2 3

10365961
superclass	subclassing
i have a list of superclass and in this last i added some subclassing

10365979
ssl	https
if you re not using single-sign on sso for authenticating to your website but use plain usernames and passwords in a form transmitting that over an ssl tls connection from your application will be no different from doing so from a browser over https provided that the overall configuration is correct

10366025
rdf	owl
owl is also rdf and you can use jena to load it into tdb

10366059
int	chars
you passing chars from command line anyway just because there is no int on keyboard

10366059
int	chars
so you need to convert this chars arrays which are wrapped into string into int

10366060
decltype	typename
decltype gets the type of an object you need to use the typename defined in a templated class to do this you use the typename keyword

10366062
pop-up	dialog
once you press buttonlogin a login dialog launched by a logindialog class will pop-up asking you for a username and password

10366117
xna	slimdx
popular managed wrappers for such libraries are xna slimdx and sharpdx

10366169
maven	pom.xml
if you try on your parent pom.xml project you will get a release.properties file that shows you the release configuration maven would have used if it had actually performed the prepare goal

10366172
std	ostream
note that i have explicitly used std ostream since ostream is in the std namespace

10366173
post	put
if your workflow is to put each image in a directory with a post finding them starts to require a significant amount of searching and you have to come up with something different for images that don t belong to a specific post

10366180
eigen	lapack
from how does eigen compare to blas lapack

10366186
hide	show
the indicator show properly in cellforrowatindexpath but does not hide and the accessory type doesn t change in the completed method

10366214
mouseleave	mouseenter
if the mouseenter or hover is different from the mouseleave then you ll need to track this using a variable

10366214
mouseleave	mouseenter
on mouseleave you can then reference that variable just remember to clear or reset the value for the next time the mouseenter even is fired

10366224
thin	webrick
i couldn t figure out what was going on so i uninstalled thin and went back to webrick to get some things done

10366252
g++	gcc
not mentioned by op but assuming it is using gcc g++ to build code

10366283
pull	push
in a nutshell while you are learning git stay on the master branch and track the remote master branch and push and pull from the master branch

10366321
apache	nginx	passenger	webrick
let s say you have rails running on one of the several web servers that support it such as webrick mongrel apache and nginx through passenger phusion

10366363
google-chrome	firefox
i see from internet that this is supposed to be default html5 behavior but it doesn t work in my latest copies of google-chrome and firefox browsers under ubuntu 11.10

10366408
gentoo	debian
for example apache-commons-daemon in fedora commons-daemon in debian world and dev-java commons-daemon in gentoo

10366424
puts	gets
i have a python script that gets data from a usb weather station now it puts the data into mysql whenever the data is received from the station

10366441
quicksort	mergesort
in quicksort or mergesort where older tasks equate to larger arrays these tasks will generate more tasks and keep the queue non-empty and reduce the number of overall steals

10366505
cos	sin
x cos deg x - sin deg y y sin deg x + cos deg y

10366511
folder	directory
when i load https localhost kow it loads the correct controller however for some reason its not reconizing that kowmanager is a sub directory of kow with its own application folder and it should be loading the default controller that is set in its routes file

10366534
udp	tcp
3- testing tcp and udp socket servers using c# and .net

10366542
for-loop	loops
loops and recur forms create an iteration - like a for-loop in other languages

10366546
header-files	stdafx.h
all the header-files that i use are included in stdafx.h but that s obviously not the problem here same problem when including the header-files directly

10366554
allocator	stl
all containers in the stl are parameterized with template arguments usually the last argument is called a or allocator and defaults to where .

10366632
versioning	upgrade
however note that your database will be upgrade to the new 11.0 file format which means you won t be able to detach attach or backup restore to an older versioning 2008 2008 r2 etc

10366650
google-chrome	firefox
fwiw i tested on google-chrome and firefox

10366665
for-loop	arrays
is there a way i can do this with numpy to avoid a python for-loop when dealing with large arrays

10366667
pull	push
i can issue commands via . adb shell like ls but not push and pull and when i do . adb devices it shows my device id but when i start an interactive shell adb devices shows nothing

10366667
pull	push
i can still list files in the interactive shell but still no push or pull

10366670
g++	gcc
i wrote this code for matrix multiplication in simd which i was able to compile in visual studio but now i need to compile it in ubuntu using gcc g++

10366691
put	get
i expect to get a list of the distinct 4 letter substring from the file name what i get is nothing or a first i had put the path.get..

10366704
for-loop	loops
a list comprehension is significantly faster than a normal for-loop as it s implemented c-side in python rather than as a python loops

10366713
int	chars
you cannot pass a chars to printf expecting an int

10366834
postgresql	mysql
let say i ve a table in my database like this be it in postgresql or mysql -

10366834
postgresql	mysql
so my question is how to write such sql statement in postgresql mysql to output the overall rating for each video based on comparison between the three columns value

10366897
post	put	post	get	put	get
--it has explicit relationship with http methods namely get post put delete

10366901
post	get
you can get the users who liked a post link image etc using the fql like table but there s nothing about the ordering of the results you get you can check or assume if they are ordered by time

10366911
int	chars
thus x will point to sizeof int bytes in which the lowest is 0x35 the chars 5 the next is 0 and the rest are indeterminate and will lead to undefined behavior when read

10366915
postgresql	mysql
i come from the mysql side but i think the following should also work in postgresql

10366941
submit	submission
so this function is bind to the form submit click event and is run upon submission

10366962
postgresql	mysql
i am not familiar with the details of the syntax for mysql or postgresql but to me it looks like a set of if statements something like

10367003
postgresql	mysql
i use sql server and not mysql or postgresql but i think this ansi sql compliant

10367072
exponent	modulo
i have a file with the public exponent and modulo in it

10367072
exponent	modulo
this isn t a one-time thing either i need to be able to read the public exponent and modulo from files in this format to check the signature

10367078
profiler	vtune
take a look at at intel vtune amplifier xe formerly â intel thread profiler to see if it will meet your needs

10367134
post	get
when facebook post into the iframe with your app url and a signed request there are two options the easy one being that the user is already authenticated and then the signed request will have all the necessary data including a signed request then you just load the canvas page and use the js sdk to get an access token there as well but in this case there s no need to use the fb.login since it opens a popup and will automatically close it you can use the fb.getloginstatus method which won t annoy the user

10367140
google-chrome	firefox
it s worse in google-chrome than in firefox but firefox still isn t completely smooth

10367145
width	height
otherwise i would suggest getting the height and width of the textview at run time if it is below a certain threshold then set the textsize to a smaller value

10367146
getter	setter
they are actually a pair of methods getter and setter with special syntax

10367146
getter	setter
in both cases you usually have a private backing field inside your class which holds the value manipulated by the getter setter subscribe unsubscribe methods

10367146
accessor	properties
and there s an auto-implemented syntax for both properties and events where the compiler generates the backing field and accessor methods for you

10367148
profiler	vtune
take a look at at intel vtune amplifier xe formerly â intel thread profiler to see if it will meet your needs

10367174
post	get
you can get the default button style here and then see this post on how to set the style programmatically

10367203
google-chrome	firefox
are there any run-time tools i can use maybe as browser plugins for google-chrome firefox or ie that will analyze the css dependencies and help me to break out a widget.css file from mondo.css

10367211
textview	imageview
i trying to set visibility of my imageview button and textview

10367211
textview	imageview
i tried the view.gone but that just remove all the textview imageview and button

10367211
hide	show
but i just want to hide and then show

10367243
accessor	properties
just like a properties is an accessor for a field

10367243
accessor	properties
like a properties has a get and set accessor an event has the add and remove accessor

10367243
accessor	properties
it does behave somewhat different from a properties if you don t write the add and remove accessor yourself then the compiler auto-generates them

10367256
visualvm	yourkit
yes there are memory profilers such as visualvm and yourkit

10367264
try-catch	exception-handling
i handled exception-handling using try-catch .

10367300
implements	extends
it looks as though you are trying to mimic the generated rpc code where a async rpc interface would be implements by code that extends from com.google.gwt.user.client.rpc.impl.remoteserviceproxy which implements serializationstreamfactory

10367300
serializable	deserialization
remember when building your own serializable deserialization mechanism that you need to decide which types can be marshalled within this system - if you open it to all types then you will need to generate fieldserializer types for all possible objects on the source path

10367306
hash	md5
you just need any hash function let s take md5 and a way to commutatively join things

10367306
hash	md5
for example if i choose md5 and addition then i could md5 each digit and add the resulting hash

10367352
folder	directory
it does leave folder in the working directory but since it does overwrite attributes correctly on the initial folder on the move back it s satisfactory and in the end i can just rm the empty remaining directory

10367422
treemap	treeset
this suggests that obj is null at that line and that you are maybe adding some null object to the treeset within the treemap i d imagine

10367448
hash	salt
when storing passwords it s been said that salt doesn t need to be secret and it s only purpose is to keep all hash unique

10367448
hash	salt
we store hash on server a and store salt on server b

10367448
hash	salt
is there any problem with this approach since in the event of hash reversal keeping the salt secret gives extra security and keeping plain text length uniform arguably adds layer of obfuscation

10367458
dlsym	dlopen
you can get into issues with dynamic loading dlsym plus dlopen etc to get the new symbols

10367476
int	chars
i am trying to put an unsigned int into a chars buffer and then fetch it back into another unsigned int

10367520
hash	salt
salt doesn t need to be secret and it s only purpose is to keep all hash unique

10367520
hash	salt
it also makes it slower to brute-force a table of hash since you need a try per row for every hash + salt combination instead of just trying out one hash for the whole table select from passwords where hash xxx

10367524
put	get
if autopair minor mode is enabled when you insert a it automatically inserts a there are some exceptions where it doesn t for example if you insert it after a but i like the exceptions and put the cursor between them so you have now if you type a+b you get a+b and not a+b

10367529
pbkdf2	salt	pbkdf2	hash	hash	salt	scrypt	salt	scrypt	pbkdf2
use an existing one like pbkdf2 bcrypt or scrypt which have advantages over simple salt hash since they use more cpu time all three and or memory the latter two which makes parallelization expensive

10367529
hash	salt
the salt in a hash protects only against rainbow tables not against brute-force attacks

10367529
hash	salt
the purpose of a salt is to avoid an inexpensive creation of rainbow tables that is instead of just calculating the hash of every probable password and comparing them to your database an attacker has to do this for every different salt

10367535
hash	salt
your salt passwords still begin with actual password data which typically looks very much unlike hash

10367538
inherited	subclassing
i would like to create a subclassing which inherited these methods

10367555
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
two points first of all a uinavigationcontroller is a subclass of uiviewcontroller so you could create an instance of uinavigationcontroller whose rootviewcontroller is your tableviewcontroller and have the tabbarcontroller manage the nav controller as one of its tabs

10367570
gdi	direct2d	gdi	directwrite	directwrite	direct2d
1 on the text api to use direct2d directwrite or gdi or something else

10367591
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
should display well in latest version in ie firefox safari and google-chrome

10367647
jobs	cron
i think for reading page walls you need an access token at any cost and realizing an automatic crawler via an application therefore is not possible i guess as apps only react to users actions and cannot act like cron jobs for example

10367678
folder	directory
added ... zeromq-2.2.0 include folder to c c++ general additional include directory

10367684
multiplying	add
all those 10 11 add well multiplying up

10367685
int	chars
you can shift only members of that arrays a chars or an int

10367730
openbsd	linux
otherwise if you already have a proxy server you can use the solution above by placing a router or a server running the routing software between the access point and your network for example vyatta or mikrotik routeros commercial but pretty powerful some open-source freeware router firewall distribution pfsense openwall m0n0wall ... or even a vanilla openbsd with pf firewall linux with iptables to achieve the desired effect

10367739
mergesort	timsort
as a matter of fact with java7 java has switched from mergesort to timsort named after python dev tim peters who implemented it for cpython first for some sorting tasks

10367772
children	parent
i know that if i set the alpha for a parent uiview to to 0 that all its children are also invisible

10367772
children	parent
is it also true that setting a parent uiview s userinteractionenabled to no affect it s children in anyway

10367789
onresume	onpause
about ui how about updating the username ui probably textview upon onpause to and updating it to the current user upon onresume

10367811
folder	directory
right now this code reads the directory and it recognizes if an item in the array of files is a folder however it doesn t add the files from the subdirectories into the array properly

10367818
rubygems	rvm
packages rvm installed ruby 1.9.3p194 w openssl rubygems

10367859
post	get
however if i try to post the json-string i get 404 error

10367866
boost	stl
i don t have problem understanding mine but whenever i looked into implementations of the stl boost or cgal i found myself wondering what language they were using

10367867
spaces	delimiter
you are just joining a single element the latest with a spaces delimiter thus overwriting what you previously put into merge

widening an int or long value to a float or of a long value to a double may result in a loss of precision

10370386
int	double
an int can be widened to a float and a double but a float 4 bytes is smaller than a double 8 bytes so java will choose to call m float

it works fine just some time it fires width and height zero value

10377592
width	height
do you guys have any idea why returns zero to its width height

but all your examples concern words n-gram and i can t think of any work that found n 3 to be useful in that domain

hash	md5
since you want the number yes a md5 hash is nothing but a base16 number we can of course convert that to base-something to shorten the string to be pronouncable over the phone i suggest avoiding mixed upper- lowercase

10383841
addclass	removeclass
you could also use toggleclass in order to only have to deal with that one class once for your current element rather than using addclass in one condition and removeclass in another

10384414
min	max
depending on your needs you have several solutions for instance you can simply reset the min and max from time to time like dirkgently suggested

10384414
range	max	range	min	min	max
if you want a moving range so that at any point in time you have the min and max of the n last measurements then you will have to use a more complex solution

10384418
min	max
it seems you only want a recent max min value so you could do something like the following

10384418
min	max
this tracks the age in samples of the min and the max values and when they exceed a predetermined threshold 1000 samples in the above case they expire and get replaced by more recent min max values

10384445

my question is how much backwards compatibility should i be looking for ive currently been aiming for the last 5 versions of the major browsers so ie google-chrome firefox opera and safari is it neesary to make sure the last 5 versions are suported or should i be aiming to make say the last 2 versions or even more compatible the code is most likeley compatible with most versions but some parts like rounded corners in css i know arnt suported so most people with older browsers may not see it corectly should i make it viewable for them or just have a pop up box lil youtube that says your using a older browser for best results use a newer browser and link them to it

button	checkbox
edit every views are affected button textviews checkbox

10384973
min	max
after a little algebra that becomes max q min 1-q

10384973
min	max
so plugging uniformly distributed values ranging from 0 to 1 such as you d get from nextdouble into this function will give you values with a and ranging from the given min to max

10384973
min	max
one more point you could of course set min to double.min_value and max to double.max_value but i don t know enough about floating point representations to know if that would be problematic and if it is then i don t know how small large a number would need to be to become so

10385002

10385242
width	height
please notice width and height are not fixed in real just in my example

10385255
ienumerable	iqueryable
the fix could be as easy as returning iqueryable from find instead of ienumerable

10385263
rdf	owl
strictly speaking owl is not rdf

10385263
rdf	owl
however all owl ontologies can be written as rdf graphs so you can directly store them in a triple store without any preprocessing note that any conformant owl tool must be able to serialise ontologies in rdf xml

10385277
decoder	encoder
2nd question - if i write an encoder decoder which uses 5 bits for representing a-z say a 0 b 1 etc - is this also a considered a valid compression algorithm

10385341
width	height
when you change the width and height of the frame also change the x and y position of the frame by half those amounts

10385361
ssl	https
you should set up your server with ssl access it via https not http

10385390

10385767
multiplying	multiplication
some processors have multiplication units so that actually multiplying only takes one instruction

10385768
width	height
find the browser s width and height

10385786
dictionary	map
a fast method when a is a large list would be using a dictionary to map values in a to indices

10385807
post	put
the put request to post new object on the jsonrest store however doesn t seem to have asynchronous callback capabilities

10385834
getter	setter
make sure you have notes with getter and setter

10385869
int	chars
however if you had written this- operator it would have searched for a function like chars mystring operator int i

10385882
cpu	processors
opencl is a bit more flexible than cuda in that kernels can run on the gpu cpu and in theory cell processors on a system where it s available - think running mono+linux+ps3 though i haven t tried that combination

10385895
children	parent
csla parent-child relationship does not support folder-file pattern where files are children of the parent folder but they are

10385897
folder	directory
i m using this asynchronous recursive function to iterate through a directory s files and folder and when a .css file is found i append data to a file called common.css

10385951
getter	setter
2 getter and setter are evil and should be used carefully

10385951
getter	setter
2 should we provide getter setter for struct passdata

10385951
getter	setter
so in this design i do not provide a getter setter for the struct passdata

bigloo	gambit
some scheme implementations that existed in 1994 still are still around and maintained scheme 48 chez scheme gambit bigloo mit scheme and scm

sudo	passwd
under ubuntu this is normally done with the sudo command which will prompt the user for their passwd

10386202
children	parent
yeah you would need to get the parent of the current textview then get all the children contained within that parent

10386241
filesystems	hfs+
looking at the source of some of the simpler filesystems hfs+ is a bit big for this will probably also help

10386242
filtering	grouping
when you are filtering on grouping conditions you need to use having instead of where

10386245
nexus	artifactory
use an artifact tracking system such as artifactory or nexus to store binaries after build along with the header files used to generate those binaries

10386313
button	checkbox
when one or fewer checkbox are selected and you click the compare tours button a popup should appear

10386319
qkeysequence	qkeyevent
in general you cannot compare qkeyevent and qkeysequence objects

10386319
qkeysequence	qkeyevent
qkeyevent represents the event of a single key press or release whereas a qkeysequence can contain a sequence of up to four keys each with optional modifier information

10386319
qkeysequence	qkeyevent
you can even write a conversion function for qkeyevent to qkeysequence

10386319
qevent	qkeyevent	qkeysequence	qkeyevent
note that it does not make sense to convert a qkeysequence to a qkeyevent though since you have to choose a specific event type such as qevent keypress or qevent keyrelease

10386323
width	height
it only allows 100 width and a fixed height

10386332
versioning	upgrade

10386702
ostringstream	std	std	ostream	ostream	ostringstream

10386715
google-chrome	firefox
i was getting the same error in google-chrome and different one in firefox ie

10386723
post	get
see what is the difference between post and get

10386778
ostringstream	std	std	ostream	ostream	ostringstream
the real problem with your code is that you ve overloaded std ostringstream rather than std ostream

10386778
std	ostream
so the solution is to overload std ostream instead of std basic_ostringstream

10386786
entity-relationship	diagram
there are tools that generate entity-relationship diagram for a given database

10387366
yacc	bison
look at the code generated by lex yacc or flex bison

10387402

getter	setter
if i use dynamic index which works even though the documentation doesn t say that custom property getter setter would be dynamically implemented display is called every time the value of index is changed

10387713
junit	testng
i always recommend that people switch to testng which is just like junit 4 except with more functionality

10387713
junit	testng
i suspect what you re trying to do will be easy with testng - junit does not have the grouping capability that testng does

10387737
mongodb	dbref
saving child objects is not built into spring data mongodb so you have to do it manually or you can extend abstractmongoeventlistener as i described it in my article spring data mongodb cascade save on dbref objects

post	get
when i send a test post message with http analyzer i get

10396150

margin auto only works when div have fixed width

10396243
min	max
and let the grid in fourier-space run from k_x min to k_x max same for the y-direction

10396279
lwjgl	jogl
my question is does this feature available in lwjgl jogl or in any possible java bindings for opengl

10396295
hash	md5
a possible issue is that you are running jdk 7 and that shows the sha1 hash as default instead of an md5 hash the thread below could help you in that case

10396300
width	height
basically you always have a container element that contains the image and i assume this container has a width height set

10396303
post	put
for that you can either update some table in db or just put a file with post data content on your local drive and dump as a file with timestamp

10396356
sorting	filtering
i would insist to use lambdaj library which is mostly used in such cases where you want to restrict loops for sorting and filtering collections

10396363
put	get
its asking me for my callback_url and application website inorder to register my app and get my authentication code but i dont understand what im supposed to put in for those links since i dont have a domain name for this app

10396369
profiling	debugging
i know that there is node-inspector module for debugging and he has a profiling tab but it looks like this module is no longer maintained last commit 6 month ago and not working for profiling on my osx and node.js 0.6.15

one idea might be to use mustache which can be rendered on both the server-side and client-side

10396475
for-loop	loops
recently talked about for-loop not introducing a new scope as compared to each loops

10396659
openni	kinect
i just installed the openni libraries and make my kinect work on my computer

10396700
post	get
you can use mongodb to embed the comments within the post document which means you get the post and the comments in a single query yet you could also query for post documents based on tags the author etc

10396868
sqoop	hadoop
for this i have configured hadoop hase hive sqoop in ubuntu machine

10396868
hive	hdfs
i have seen some options in sqoop import - it can import to hive hdfs hbase

10396868
hive	hdfs
when importing into hive it is indeed importing directly into hdfs

10396873
width	height
just try to keep to the same width and height as the original icons 14x14 this way you won t have to define your own width and height and it won t mess with the line-height of your elements

10396907
mamp	wamp
my code works perfectly on wamp but doesn t work on mamp and i don t no why

10396907
mamp	wamp
i looked the phpinfo but there are the same for the session between mamp and wamp

10397009
google-chrome	firefox
the page_load timeout setting is an experimental feature in the firefox driver and not supported by the google-chrome driver yet

10397010
width	height
while browsing and uploading images i want to know the image s height and width and based on this i want to resize and show it

10397032

the first para children of their parent

10397092
google-chrome	firefox
firefox google-chrome work

10397095
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
cross browser compatible minimum ie google-chrome firefox safari

10397110
post	get
because it s an redirect the post request is turned into a get request

10397115
portrait	landscape
and how many layout folders i should have to support the app portrait landscape modes on both the devices

10397117
junit	testng
when i google for it then every thing shows about testng and junit

10397179
for-loop	loops
originally it was an eof while loops but i changed it to a for-loop to try and fix it

10397181
hide	fadeout
also you ve unnecessarily called hide after you ve set the content but the item should already be hidden because you have called fadeout

10397186
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
somehow it s working with all browsers including firefox ie google-chrome and safari on ipad2

10397189
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
it works well on pc with google-chrome and opera but not with firefox

10397221
folder	directory
paste it to your local directory so the resultant folder structure would look like this

10397243
accessor	properties
accessor functions to the properties

10397276
hash	salt
secure hash and salt for php passwords

10397331
salt	md5
the password should be protected by hashing with a strong salt either md5 or sha1 are fine to prevent attack using rainbow tables

10397338
typedef	typename
it only seems to fail and require a typename keywords iff the dependent name is a typedef

10397339
implements	extends
as the previous answer states jersey comes with two filters but you can usefully implements the jersey interfaces containerrequestfilter or and containerresponsefilter if you don t want to extends them

10397383
ienumerable	ilist
if the same key can appear in more than one keyvaluepair use ilist ienumerable

10397404
hash	salt
as for the passwords they should absolutely be encrypted or hash preferably with salt too

10397440
gmail	hotmail
then depending on whether i choose to send via gmail or hotmail i get different results

10397468
put	get
the routing is working to the index method because i can eg put in a redirect and it gets acted upon but i cannot get the template to display

10397474
hash	md5
md5 is insecure now as you can reverse the hash perform a rainbow attack

10397474
hash	salt
use a strong salt to ensure an attacker cannot guess commonly hash passwords if they ever gained entry to your database

10397480
ecj	javac
which kind of compiler adt exactly use ecj or javac

10397513
xstream	jackson
the code you provided seems to use xstream annotations while your spring configuration is configured to use jackson

10397570
weka	libsvm
libsvm in weka can handle one-class svm

10397570
weka	libsvm
unlike the weka smo implementation libsvm is a standalone program which has been interfaced into weka and incorporates many different variants of svm

10397570
weka	libsvm
this post on the wekalist explains how to use libsvm for this in weka

10397644
put	get
you can get your interface to put a job into the gearman queue and then write a gearman worker to pick up notification tasks from the queue

10397686
stdout	stderr
you should definitly use subprocess this allows you to distinguish between stdout and stderr and you can also check the return-code

10397726
bionic	glibc	toolchain	bionic
if you are going to use glibc instead of bionic it may be worth looking into using the toolchain of a compatible kernel generation arm-linux distro rather than the ndk

10397726
bionic	libc	toolchain	bionic
for a jni sub which remains the only officially endorsed vehicle for native application code it could get a bit interesting with either toolchain as you will be running in a process that has already mapped and is making ongoing use of the bionic libc to support the dalvik vm

10397792
integer	unsigned
so putting c++ portability aside and just being practical if you are in a 32-bit architecture then an unsigned int should be fine and in a 64-bit an unsigned long that is an integer long enough to hold the value of a pointer

10397799
getter	setter
note that you have to use getter and setter with interfaces because you can t use them to define vanilla variables

10397802
freemarker	velocity
so for example in the spring mvc framework the m is whatever your business logic is the v is whichever templating language you decide to use freemarker jsp jstl velocity and the c is the dispatcherservlet which selects the controller implementation

10397865
post	get
the forms method is post while your handler implemented a get method

10397865
post	get
change def get self to def post self

10397876
for-loop	arrays
the cleanest way to work with an arrays in java with a for-loop is to start your indexing variable at 0 as well and change your comparison from to

10397898
int	double
where the mat is an mtl4 matrix giving pointers to its internal data with pointers to int and double

10397898
int	double
and these pointers point to blocks of nz double m+1 int and nz int respectively

10397962
pbkdf2	hash
for the password hash use pbkdf2 it s nist approved

10397967
public	protected
the identifiers implements interface let package private protected public static and yield are classified as futurereservedword tokens within strict mode code

10397981

10397990
gmail	hotmail
i ve heard good things about mailsystem.net which contains a more complete implementation of pop3 and imap that you d need for things like hotmail gmail yahoo and presumably aol

10398000
pull	push
the key concept to understand with a dvcs distributed version control system is that you don t have one workflow merges between branches but two publication push pull between repositories

10398001
width	margin
my row header width is 36 and close button width is 28 with left margin 26

10398006

notice the projection this is not a simple filtering or grouping statement. i then display newlist in my ui via data-binding

10398101
int	double
i have a double value i want to convert it to an int value

10398119
post	get
we are using jax-rs with some fairly basic pojo entities and have a number of get and post annotated methods that produce and consume mediatype.application_json mediatype.application_xml

10398151
getter	setter
i a prefer similar to your method but using a private static property key value array with a getter and setter

10398165
hide	show
html css media queries and jquery all play a part to expand the ui and manipulate show hide content elements as the browser gets bigger

10398179
int	double
just remember that a conversion like yours will cause an overflow since double holds 2 words 8 bytes and int only 2 4 bytes

10398274
longlistselector	silverlight
on another page i do the same thing with the silverlight toolkit longlistselector and have the same issue

10398312
put	get
if you are having a different folder for each language and you can get the name of the folder from code then you just have to put here

10398431
maven	pom.xml
to avoid issues with the synchronisation of directory structures the most common way is to use maven - it will manage all the dependencies for you but you have to manage the pom.xml - the maven s project descriptor

10398456
xcodebuild	xcrun
i m building the app using xcodebuild and then signing and embedding the mobileprovision file using xcrun

10398493
google-chrome	safari
use the margins for example margin_left to animate horizontally which works when google-chrome safari and others are zoomed in

10398507
pull	push
branches a slightly deprecated way to store shorthands to be used to specify url to git fetch git pull and git push commands is to store a file in branches name and give name to these commands in place of repository argument

10398535
plot	heatmap
in python we can read the labels and plot this heatmap by

10398541
integer	fractions
the maximum number of integer and fractions digits must be 2

10398554
portrait	landscape
my app shows list of items and portrait mode - it works perfectly - and it turned to landscape mode display should show a preceding list and textbox in right side and here the issue occurs

10398558
postgresql	mysql
window functions with the over clause require postgresql 8.4 or later and are not available in mysql

10398571

10398603
try-catch	exception-handling
is there anything i can kinda try-catch to catch the constructors exception-handling throwing

10398618
post	put
problem is you cant put in audio callback function objc functions or other things that takes time such as post a notification to other class when decision has made

10398618
put	get
put the decision in a global variable singletone then schedule that var from the main thread- which seems to be a bad idea and the nstimer cant get under 50ms

10398622
int	chars
i don t know if there s any built-in solutions for this but you could loop through the string and make a regular expression that would check the given chars for being an int

10398693
width	height
my question is what is a valid algorithm that would when the user clicks one in the menu correctly place a new panel of a given width and height in unoccupied space that is closest to a left and top x and y value of 0 0 without overlapping any of the existing panels

10398724
division	modulo
i would reccommend using modulo division and get the remainder of number 100

10398742
children	parent
further to your comments above i think this should give you what you re after total number of enrolled children classes per parent

10398744
perforce	cvs
subversion cvs perforce

10398763
try-catch	exception-handling
in this case the object they will represent at runtime is a subclass of exception-handling as they are used in the catch clause of a try-catch statement

10398838
for-loop	loops
you can use the simple for-loop in place of foreach loops and do iterating with your own index counter

10398850
subtract	add
since your square is 5 km around the center you just need to add and subtract 0.045 degrees from the center point

10398851
octal	decimal
in your example there is no radix parameter so the interpreter will fall back to the default behaviour which typically treats numbers as decimal unless they start with a zero octal or 0x hexadecimal

10398857
folder	directory
in public_html i have framework files and public directory and when i visit my site i want to run public folder

10398937
rdf	owl
i have found data sets such as umls and galen which are large rdf owl data sets that give me this sort of data but i have found getting the subset of data i want out quite difficult - mainly due to the lack of .net libraries tooling for owl and my lack of knowledge of this area

10398944
int	double
this is confusing but d is the format for an int like i most people expect it to be for double since f is for float but it s not

10398975
int	double
in the first case printf extects a double due to the f but you pass an int

10398975
int	double
the format of double is different form int see ieee-754 for most-used double format

10398975
int	double
the second is similar printf expects an int due to d but you pass in a double

10398987
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
in the root view move the code to load your number to viewwillappear instead of viewdidappear

10399028
rss	feed
2 you could also rely on an rss feed to update the contents of your app

10399067
width	height
width and height are image sizes in millimeters

10399089
profiling	debugging
i can see the web debugging toolbar and clicking in the profiling info in the project configuration tab i can see

10399145
jar	war
before build a war for one of your webapp if common classes have changed you should first install in your common repository the jar mvn install

10399145
jar	war
once jar is installed you can build your war mvn war war

10399165
packets	pcap
there s nothing intrinsic in a pcap entry to tell you whether the packets was inbound or outbound

10399167
keystore	jks
i would like to access the identity keystore jks configured in weblogic s custom keystore configuration in my web application

10399205
youtube	vimeo
youtube and vimeo pro continue to be good options if you re looking for a hosting platform and they now both support a large range of hd formats as well as supporting html5

10399205
youtube	vimeo
youtube and vimeo are probably better choices if you want your videos to be visible to the widest possible audience

10399223
width	height
if panel overlap rectangle you can increase x or y which is in nested loop not by 1 but by width or height of panel

10399232
expander	grid
when this view load the expander does expand but inside the content the grid doesnt align left

10399243
oncreate	setcontentview
use setcontentview in oncreate in your activity to indicate the layout you are using

10399260
post	get
i should note here that the abbazabba macro does the closing and saving of the file but if this is useful for anyone you can get how to do that from the 2nd link in this post

10399263
width	height
show animates width and height from zero to their natural values which may be messing with your margins

10399266
jar	war
it just copies the files of the main class and merges the jetty jar files into the war file nothing new just to simplify your life if you are new -like me- to maven

10399277
put	get
if you tostring your editable to get a string object and put that in the intent you should be able to get it back out with getstring like you re doing

10399300
google-chrome	firefox
i use google-chrome as my main browser but sometimes firefox has much more verbose errors warnings that can make debugging a complex issue easier

10399303
implements	extends
also your b should implements callable not extends thread

10399338
move	drag
save the start position of the drag get the current position on each move event

10399353
width	height
following query uses common table expression cte to convert width and height from mm to cm along with rounding and then produces a derived table output

10399353
width	height
this cte output is then used to group the width and height values to calculate the sum of the amount column

10399381
post	get
this is a great idea and is entirely possible with the facebook graph api with the api you can do get post and delete requests to view update and remove post view news feed stories read inbox etc

10399381
pop-up	dialog
an access token is granted once a user grants your app permissions and this can only happen through a pop-up dialog in a browser or mobile app

rss	feed
what is the best way to read rss feed

10399400
rss	feed
after reading the rss feed using xmltextreader is there any way i can populate data to listitem instead of dataset

10399413
.htaccess	httpd.conf
which means entry can be set in php.ini .htaccess or httpd.conf

i have a form that i create a checkbox on a click of a button

10399496
google-chrome	firefox
on the index of my website i have 3 containers with little images and they appear nice on ie and firefox but on google-chrome there s a displacement of the second container which i dont know how to fix

10399539
getter	setter
i usually keep the settings values that are not necessary to modify as constant and other settings that has the modify option into the database getter setter

10399544
for-loop	loops
for years i ve gotten in to the habit of not using the value of a for-loop iterator after loops exits

10399547
width	height
but i also would like to validate the width and height of that image

10399547
width	height
i tried to add a second method which is the same like above but instead of size i used height or width but this doesnt work

10399565
width	height
i have textfield that is expanded from its normal single line width and height but the cursor to start typing in the edittext is always in the center of the expanded textfield when i change the height of the textfield and thats where it starts putting text too

10399577
for-loop	loops
and in python world the word seems to be that the ordering was chosen because that s the order in which you d write a for-loop but i gather that thinking in terms of for loops is not exactly what most haskell programmers do.

10399610
cakephp	lithium
i m attacking lithium from a cakephp standpoint so this seems odd to me

10399617
folder	directory
copied .jar files directly to lib folder in directory structure but i doesn t display in eclipse

10399640
for-loop	loops
make a for-loop which loops from level 1 to 10

10399690
floating-point	integer
as a matter of convention integer and floating-point parameters are never declared const even if your function has no intention of changing them within its body

10399710
stateless	stateful
the thing is that the bean is stateless and not stateful or a singleton

10399747
move	drag
i can drag the letters about but the placheholder doesn t move as smoothly as i could wish occasionally sticking in a certain location

10399795
int	double
make cellheight and ystart double and convert them to int in the call the drawrectangle

10399806
ant	maven
p.s it is almost always better to use a build tool like maven ant to manage dependencies

10399863
getter	setter
you are essentially banking on whether or not the compiler runtime will be able to optimize out the getter setter or not

10399876
floating-point	fractions
observe that each of these hexadecimal floating-point constants has exactly 53 bits in its significand the fractions part often inaccurately called the mantissa

10399876
range	infinity
floating-point significands are always scaled to start with 1 except for special cases zero infinity and very small numbers at the bottom of the representable range so we adjust this to 0x1.00000000000004p0

10399903
trie	tree
there s a data structure called a prefix tree or trie that allows you to very quickly check whether a string is a prefix of some string you ve seen before

10399927
folder	directory
simply do a svn log and then when you see that a directory got renamed in a particular release do a svn ls --recurse on that folder and get all the files in it

10399941
for-loop	loops
even though the value of that for-loop s control variable is well defined you might have been told to avoid using the for-loop s control variable after the for-loop because of the way scoping of that variable is handled and especially because the handling has changed of the history of c++ i know this question is tagged c but i think the rationale for avoiding using for-loop control variable after loops may have origins in this c++ history

10399956
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
the margin top and left has to be negative half the height and width of the element

10399956
width	height
the same principal applies if you don t know the width and height and need to calculate it with javascript

10399956
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
just get the width height divide those by half and set the values as a margin in the same way as the example above

10400019
inherited	properties
to do this have the new type not inherited from anything and have two properties one being of the old type what you re currently considering using as the parent and another with the new piece of data

10400020
vsto	add-in
i am trying to load an automation add-in that is an excel application automation add-in it is a dll not xla or xll from within a vsto add-in in the thisaddin_startup method of the vsto add-in

10400020
vsto	add-in
is there anything else i need to do to activate the automation add-in in my vsto startup

10400028
children	parent
this causes a left or right join to be performed so i get two parent if there are two children

10400028
children	parent
i don t want that i just want one parent and two children

10400086
width	height
i found a method to change the width and height of tab but i m not sure whether it works for all devices or not

10400086
width	height
layoutparams take height and width in int variable so is there any way to change the height and width using some other method like changing in layout xml or some other technic

10400095
floating-point	integer
as you note ieee-754 does not specify what happens when you convert a floating-point nan to an integer except that it should raise an invalid operation exception which your compiler probably ignores

10400095
floating-point	integer
intel specifies instruction behavior very carefully and the behavior for converting a floating-point nan to a 32-bit integer is to return 0x80000000 regardless of the payload of the nan which is what you observed

10400128
pop-up	dialog
as you can see in the documentation for that method it will pop-up a permission dialog which the user must accept in order to register for your app and therefore your site

10400142
tostring	string.format
i m aware of the added flexibility of cultures and formatting offered by string.format but i d always just tostring numerics to attach their value to a label or text based property in general

10400169
min	max
so i searched on the web and i found that there is a limitation using google maps api min 1 sec between 2 queries and max 2500 queries per day

10400197
hash	md5
next take the md5 hash or something faster of the resulting string

10400197
hash	md5
do a database lookup of the md5 hash as two 64 bit integers in a table if it exists it is an exact duplicate if not add it to the table and proceed to the next step

10400275
m2e	pom.xml
many ides like eclipse when using m2e can provide a visual graph of your pom.xml to help figure the dependencies out

10400303
submit	submission
as i said in the chat you should try by starting from the ground up by first submission the form normally then improve it by validating it with javascript and after that try to submit it with ajax

10400371
width	height
for example if we have 10 rectangle sprites and we generate them using random width height position and z-index

10400418
int	boolean
my form fields are boolean int strings and enums

10400418
onchange	onblur
set a hidden form field using an onchange or onblur listener in javascript

10400418
post	get
is there a way to stuff it in the page s modelandview that will survive from the get to the post

google-chrome	firefox
it works on firefox google-chrome ie9 but not ie8 have not tested it on 7 6 but guessing it wont work there either

10404661
mouseleave	mouseenter
the idea here is to trigger manually the display of popover with mouseenter mouseleave events

10404746
put	get
so these i ve either hard-coded in the makefile or if they require some detection put the detection logic in configure but passed them through a separate make variable instead of cflags so they won t get overridden

10404764
versioning	upgrade
you simply need to upgrade the local versioning 2008 express to r2

10404840
bitblt	gdi
you could try using gdi to bitblt from the screen s dc to a memory dc as most screen capture programs do but that s not guaranteed to work

10404862
postgresql	mysql
postgresql not sure about mysql has a character limit on constraint names so when using add_index for multiple columns make sure you re either giving a custom name or that your column names are short enough to fit under the limit because otherwise the auto-generated index_users_on_col1_and_col2_and_col3 could screw things up for you

10404933
sorting	filtering
while working on a large list of tabular data that needs an easy sorting filtering system i discovered the isotope library which seems to do exactly what i want and provides a lot of nice visuals and functionality

10404933
opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this works beautifully in firefox google-chrome opera and safari

10404981
glassfish	weblogic
also does tomcat have some way of testing the data source similar to weblogic or glassfish

10405026
ready	each
i would expect and prefer so the user sees progress each div to display as soon as it s ready and added using mootools element.inject to the dom

10405028
ssl	https
https ssl has nothing to do with django as such you must set apache configuration correctly using mod_ssl see

10405090
textmate	sublimetext
textmate snippets and themes port over nicely to sublimetext

10405136
uilabel	uitextview
to my knowledge text isn t an animateable property for any object uilabel uitextview etc. but there are a number of controls available that subclass these objects and allow animateable text among other properties

10405148
post	get
however on win7 it returns json from both get an post requests

10405148
post	get
on windows 2003 server it returns xml from get and json from post

10405169
sudoers	passwd
i don t have the root passwd to login to the machine nor am i a sudoers but i do have a root principle in kerberos

10405210
tarfile	zipfile
however i am having trouble figuring out how to build this sort of thing around the zipfile or tarfile libraries and i m afraid they may not support reading files as they go or reading the archive as it is built

10405212
width	height
obviously in your case you would specify the size you want explicitly instead of trying to get the intrinsic height width of the drawable

10405224
for-loop	loops
for-loop condition should be correct to ensure it loops the right

10405231
range	minimum
i ve tried taking the minimum of the distance and range - distance but i think due to the way i ve structured the program this is giving weird output

10405231
distance	pdist
currently finding euclidean distance with numpy.linalg.norm though there are scipy pdist routines that do the same thing that i might use i guess

10405275
listview	gridview	gridview	repeater
to build a second gridview or listview or repeater to show that information

10405280
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
you may want to use this kind of code in viewdidappear or viewwillappear instead when your table has already been populated with data

10405291
post	get
they say that i need to submit a http post request but i must also submit some configurations via an http get also

10405291
post	get
httpwebrequest with post and get at the same time

10405304
submit	submission
validate automatically with xmlhttprequest or something similarly working so on submit click js accesses php file validates returns the result and allows submission of data

10405355
width	height
depending on how many views you want to change the layouts on i think it s better to create a helper method and pass whatever views you want to change to the method along with the height and width values you want them to change to

10405355
width	height
remember that setting the width and height here are not going to match the same values in your xml android layout_width 32dp is not the same as lp.width 32

10405361
turkish	polish
handles latin characters as well as greek turkish russian ukrainian czech polish and latvian

10405365
superclass	subclassing
browsing back and forth using open declaration f3 and the back button alt+left can get confusing i start loosing focus and happen to mistakenly read a superclass s method implementation that actually gets overridden by the subclassing i investigate

10405392
for-loop	loops
just for simplicity i ll point out that a for-loop that has only two iterations and one line of code inside loops is kind of a waste of typing

10405405
turkish	polish
handles latin characters as well as greek turkish russian ukrainian czech polish and latvian

10405418
nsstring	nsdata
network layer same applies as described above in the end you ll get an nsdictionary of headers and some nsdata or nsstring of content

10405440
rank	percentile
only other way i can think of is to ditch the comparison of the lev_distance to either string lenghts but instead present the comparitive distances of the top n matches as an inverse percentile rank 100-percentile-rank

10405452
turkish	polish
handles latin characters as well as greek turkish russian ukrainian czech polish and latvian

10405465

firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i ve tried this for firefox 12 safari google-chrome

10405586
width	height
the actual link in question did not have the comma between the width and height

10405629
nsstring	nsdata
but depending on what you re doing you might want to look into nsstring or nsdata the cocoa classes for dealing with text and binary data respectively

10405764
width	height
onclick window.open media-player.html player scrollbars 0 width 360 height 655

10405768
put	get
you already have so you can probably get the right row from that and put it in a variable then access it in the callback to put the result in the right place

10405782
floating-point	fixed-point
also until recently we didn t actually use floating-point numbers for time but fixed-point microsecond counters

10405833
integer	unsigned
the unsigned right shift doesn t exist in c++ because it s not necessary -- c++ has distinct signed and unsigned integer types

10405852
google-chrome	safari
i m facing same issue but i have not done any mods so i think it s facebook fault as this is very straightforward just copy from fb and paste in your site and it works in ie google-chrome and safari so far i ve tried

10405858
profiling	instrumentation
you could use instrumentation included in xcode with the time profiling to monitor your app s launch

10405875
hide	show
alternatively keep both itemscontrols in your xaml and conditionally hide show them using visibility and a booleantovisibilityconverter

10405890
int	double
i tried changing some int to double but ultimately ended up with this being the closest i ever got to the real pattern

10405896
minimum	max
the split view will call your delegate method hoping it can leave the max divider position at the height of the split view passing this in as the second argument but you can simply subtract some quantity from that value say 60 to return it as the minimum height for the bottom view

10405918
integer	fractions
an integer can only hold whole numbers no decimals or fractions

10405924
piston	tastypie
to expose your application s api you can use tastypie piston or djangorestframework

10405931
implements	extends
my solution so far was to create my own preferenceeditordialog by extends dialog and implements my own preference dialog style layout

10405948
maven	m2e
for whatever reason and i m sure it s a perfectly good one the m2e plugin authors didn t provide a run maven package hook

10405994
hide	show
i have seen examples to hide or show columns but i need really to remove them so then when i get the 2-dimensional matrix of data i don t have crossed references nor bad data

10406017
width	height
thus doubling the scale factor doubles the width and height of the resulting renderbuffer giving you more pixels for your content

10406063
int	double
i use it because c c++ mixes bool type with int long pointer double etc...together

10406096
listview	gridview
i ve got a listview and in the listview i have a gridview

10406100
pop-up	dialog
looking to catch the click eventfrom this anchor embedded within a div....the anchor actually calls a modal dialog form and i need to supress that call so the pop-up doesn t come up

10406122
put	get
excuse the messy code the only way i could get it to work was to put the javascirpt in the html box

10406163
put	get
i ve looked everywhere but i can t get how to have gridview put the sql server db content in that textbox on page_load one textbox + for each row

10406210
hide	show
you should add both select_tag and text_field_tag in your template then hide and show them using javascript

10406224
setinterval	settimeout
edit simply change setinterval ... to settimeout ahitrate 5000

10406240
google-chrome	firefox
you can bring up the console with ctrl+shift+j using google-chrome or by installing the firebug extension under firefox

10406251
width	height
if it s a radius then the height and width paramters should each be 2 circle_size rather than circle_size

10406257
stdout	stderr
is svn outputting that data to a buffer than stdout or stderr

10406267
memcpy	strcpy
i guess you meant to use strcpy or memcpy

10406278
switching	screens
this will let you create different screens and you or the user can switching between them easily

10406289
qsort	bsearch
of course you ve already sorted the array with qsort before you use bsearch on it mdash

10406292
width	height
set a minimum width or height on the parent

10406317
getter	setter
write a class that holds a day and a temperature make the attributes public or use getter and setter

10406339
popupwindow	pop-up
the view under popupwindow has to consume the touches outside the pop-up properly

10406347
integer	unsigned
arc4random returns a u_int32_t -- that s an unsigned integer one that doesn t represent negative values

10406347
subtraction	modulo
to promote the result of the modulo before the subtraction and everything will be okay

10406388
queue	fifo
amazon sqs has just gained fifo queue with exactly-once processing deduplication

10406388
queue	fifo
for fifo fifo queue

10406388
queue	fifo
as emphasized these new fifo sqs queue will cover the use case at hand but are not yet available in all sqs regions initially only in us east ohio and us west oregon

10406388
queue	fifo
also the sqs faq for fifo queue outlines notable differences between standard and fifo queue that should be considered upfront for example a throughput limit of 300 transactions per second

10406388
beanstalk	amazon-web-services
i ve only tested it shortly myself so far but have been pretty pleased with the offered features and language integrations see client libraries and beanstalk support - given their competitive price tag and especially the free tier makes it a good candidate for exploring a message queuing as a service solution not the least in combination with their second product ironworker an easy-to-use and massively scalable task queue ... which provides functionality not even available from amazon-web-services as of today

10406404
objectoutputstream	objectinputstream
one reasonably easy solution is to use the objectoutputstream and objectinputstream classes to write and read your arrays

10406434
post	get
i m guessing this is due to the admin.site.unregister post line but if i don t use that i get the error the model post is already registered. if instead i remove both that line and the post from admin.site.register post postadmin i get the error mediadefiningclass object is not iterable

10406450

i want war to use this jar really effectively speed load memory usage etc.

10406495
rss	feed
i am working on a little function for fetching and displaying items from my twitter rss feed

10406571
post	put
i m trying to figure out what to put in the data portion of the ajax post function since there s no form no data entered and what to do about the submit part of the controller

10406623
stdout	stderr
if this does not work have you tried piping stderr to stdout as well

10406631
button	checkbox
i know with libraries like beautiful soup you can submit forms by adding post data to the url but how could i check a checkbox and click this javascript button

10406632
width	height
i am currently working on a webpage and i have achieved fitting it in the whole browser window by using percentage values in the width and height properties of my css

10406632
width	height
the problem now is that when i resize the window everything gets scrambled and distorted e.g labels links etc. is there a way to have a minimum height and width so as when the window is resized there is a limit those properties to prevent the layout being distorted

10406636
jsf	seam
i m in the process of migrating our primary application from seam 2.2 to seam 2.3beta1 in order to get some of the benefits of jsf 2.0 and jpa 2.0

10406636
jsf	seam
this works with no problem in seam 2.2 with jsf 1.2

10406643
width	height
you can use the css properties min-width and min-height to set minimum width and height respectively for a block level element like a container

10406647
children	parent
there s menuitem which contains a label an associated function a link to its parent and a vector that contains references to its children

10406695
accessor	properties
the name of your accessor method needs to follow the naming conventions for a properties foo the setter is setfoo note the capitalization

10406706
ubuntu	linux
if possible i would avoid changing default setting in ubuntu linux server postgres server as it tends to cause other side effects

10406725
innodb	myisam
fulltext indexes can only be used with myisam tables currently though soon v5.6+ you can use them with innodb also

10406736
stdout	stderr
i edited my command to add and thereby redirect stderr to stdout and suddenly everything worked as expected

10406739
post	get
for example i try to paste the url for get messages into the browser i get a response with an empty array which is ok because i couldn t post any messages onto a queue

10406778
unsigned	short
but if i comment out the contents of the union so that unsigned short is not used anywhere at all and include this file into swig it still creates swigtype_p_unsigned_short

10406823
min	max
but in my exposed filters for min rent and max rent i want it to be a dropdown list of â 100 â 200 â 300 â 400 â 500 etc - incremented

10406825
for-loop	loops
they make sense in languages where for loops stand for repeat until condition changing this each iteration which is not what for loops or for comprehensions are in scala a for comprehension is a for-loop which yields something for each iteration

10406838
post	get
for those who get on same problem follow above post steps

10406851
uitableview	nsindexpath
it s a simple call inside tableview uitableview tableview didselectrowatindexpath nsindexpath indexpath

10406867
uiview	subviews
uiview touches do not get passed to subviews if they lie outside of the superview s bounds as mentioned by the solution

10406867
uiview	subviews
use this uiview subclass as the superview so subviews can respond to touches

10406874
put	get
both the methods get called as indicated by the nslogs i have put in both of them but the timer never gets fired and the player continues to play indefinitely

10406945

jquery live deprecated or on works just with click dblclick keydown keypress keyup mousedown mousemove mouseout mouseover and mouseup events

10406949
equals	compareto
originally this answer neglected the fact that a treeset does its comparisons based on compareto rather than equals

10406949
equals	compareto
you need to define equals hashcode and compareto for your player object correctly

10407026
repo	egit
okay this is what s happening -- i go to the install new software page and i ve added the egit repo but the window below doesn t show anything

10407051
textmate	sublimetext
some editors like textmate and sublimetext will allow that

10407067
int	chars
the first column is hashtag and the second is counter which has chars 10 and int properties respectively

10407085
addition	multiplication
the issue is definitely the for-loop not the addition of handling multiplication at the top of the function

10407222
folder	directory
windows searches the same directory as the exe any directory in the path windows or msys directory as well as a few special ones in the windows folder

10407238
put	get
i can already retrieve them manually as long as i have a file name but i would rather just get all of them at once and put them in the documents directory if possible

10407246
move	drag
this does not conflict with the ability to drag and move cells in the edit mode

10407246
uitableview	nsindexpath
- uitableviewcell tableview uitableview tableview cellforrowatindexpath nsindexpath indexpath

10407266
scikit-learn	nltk
i am comparing two naive bayes classifiers one from nltk and and one from scikit-learn

10407330
google-chrome	firefox
the problem i m having is that google-chrome reports a height of 25px and every other browser ie8 ie9 firefox reports 27px

10407332
put	get
although it s a bit odd if you put a semi-colon after a brace in this kind of scenario it ll get rid of your errors

10407345
accessor	properties
this is only one of the many many many reasons you should never access ivars directly and always use accessor -- especially now that they re essentially written for you automagically by properties synthesize

10407419
min	max
after playing with the min max not sure where my fault is

10407489
width	height
i wouldn t use position absolute instead use position relative as an absolute positioned element has no height or width

10407501
post	get
i m stuck on 6.5 of when trying to validate my blog post and this is the error that i get unknown validator presencesvalidator

10407505
for-loop	loops
i need to have a variable inside my for-loop and then access it outside of loops

10407513
int	boolean	int	double
specifically numeric types int long double etc. are initialized to 0 boolean are initialized to false and reference types are initialized to null

10407522
int	chars
or if you really needs to use getchar and to print it as a chars declare ch as a chars itself and if you need to use it as an int again use the itoa function that transforms a chars to an int

10407523
bmp	png
what about images png jpeg bmp

10407543
google-chrome	firefox
for google-chrome it just works for firefox you need firebug

10407544
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the following fb.login function works fine in desktop google-chrome firefox and safari

10407544
pop-up	dialog
fb.login triggers a pop-up dialog

10407549
post	get
if i select academia law policy full-time part-time early-career i expect to get a post that matches this filtering logic

10407556
for-loop	loops
in java for-loop statement local variables must first initialize and then use in loops block

10407596
post	get
the method is simple just post the value and parse the return value when i run it i get the console output

10407658
post	get
you don t want to see post that do not match the criteria but using left join will mean that many post get selected in this part though all the rows are later discarded by the broken where condition already discussed

10407660
oncreate	recreate
then put the following code inside the loginactivity s oncreate ... to listen for when loginactivity is recreate and the exit signal was passed

10407689
for-loop	arrays
this probably means that each object titles you re retrieving from dict in the last for-loop is not an arrays but in fact another dictionary that your code is simply referring to as an arrays

10407711
int	chars
right now i have the python code taking out all chars and keeping int like so

10407713
catransition	uiswipegesturerecognizer	uipangesturerecognizer	uiswipegesturerecognizer	uipangesturerecognizer	catransition
if you want to use a continuous gesture that tracks the user s finger you can use uipangesturerecognizer rather than uiswipegesturerecognizer and i think animatewithduration is better than catransition in that case

10407765
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
also use web inspector for google-chrome safari or firebug for firefox to catch some errors in the console

10407769
keydown	keyup
sendmessage for keydown and postmessage for keyup worked for all functions but the reliability rate dropped dramatically as well as adding latency into key events

10407769
keydown	keyup
only a combination of postmessage for keydown and sendmessage for keyup managed to do anything useful with a maybe 5-10 fail rate of keyup registering

10407781
gtk	cairo
it s not intended to have practical value but rather to be relatively simple excercise to get me comfortable with libpcap gtk and cairo before i use them for anything serious

10407781
packets	pcap
it s eventually going to read frames with pcap currently i just have a hardcoded test frame then use cairo to generate pretty pictures using color values generated from the raw packets at this stage i m just using cairo_show_text to print a text representation of the frame or packets

10407781
gdk	drawingarea
now i m at the point where i think the widget really needs private storage for things like the cairo_t context pointer and a gdkregion pointer i had not planned to use gdk directly but my research indicates that it may be necessary in order to call gdk_window_invalidate_region to force my drawingarea to refresh once i ve drawn a frame not to mention gdk_cairo_create

10407801
for-loop	arrays
one thing to try would be a regular for-loop with a fixed upper bound rather than one based on the length of the arrays

10407809
gridview	onclientclick
in fillresult.aspx here i want all subject names with textboxes or any other possible way like gridview dalalist etc that are assigned by admin and button onclientclick event to fill the marks.

10407812
maven	m2e
when you want to compile your maven project using m2e plugin try

google-chrome	firefox
i have tested and it won t work in ie9 and ie8 and i know it works as i want in google-chrome and firefox

10407824
firefox	safari
i tried logging in different browsers sadly there s only safari and firefox here

10407838
strcpy	strncpy
see the manual entries for strcpy and strncpy or strcat and strncat for the differences

10407877
getter	setter
why use getter and setter

10407877
getter	setter
i have read books on java saying that it is good to create setter and getter for variables such as x and y

10407877
getter	setter
if setter and getter are better could you explain to me what practical problems would arise

10407880
post	get
get this far if you have any more questions post them with an example of what you have tried

10407891
public	protected
their visibility can be changed however using either protected or if necessary for some bizarre reason public

10407908
getter	setter
using getter and setter functions allow for constraints and encapsulation

10407925
public	protected
another reason is for accessing fields outside your class you will have to mark them public protected or default and thus you loose control

10407925
getter	setter
you will allow field access as they cannot be changed for instance variable you will place them with getter setter

10407925
getter	setter
but if you carefully design your class with getter and no setter you keep the immutability intact

10407925
getter	setter
we can use the private variables in any package using getter and setter

10407939
getter	setter
i would say that neither the getter setter nor the public members are good object oriented design

10407941
range	minimum
if it is a signed type then its range is at least from -128 to 127 and if it is an unsigned type its range is at least from 0 to 255 these are the range that the type must support at a bare minimum the range supported by the type may actually be larger than this depending on the implementation

10407943
getter	setter
getter and setter encapsulate the fields of a class by making them accessible only through its public methods and keep the values themselves private

10407946
getter	setter
the methods that change a propertiy s value are called setter methods and the methods that retrieve a property s value are called getter methods

10407960
fgets	fread	fgets	fgetc	fgetc	fread
in c you d use the standard fread fgets fgetc etc functions

10408000
getter	setter
getter and setter method are used to get and set the value of x which is the way to achive encapsulation

10408005
gridview	onclientclick
the way i would approach your problem would be to have an onclientclick event for your link button that iterates through the gridview get the data from each text box and then perform the appropriate data base action in the code behind

10408009
getter	setter
one of the best reasons i can think of for getter and setter is the permanence of a class s api

10408009
getter	setter
by providing getter and setter a programmer has the flexibility to modify members and behavior freely as long as the adhere to the contract described by the public api

10408019
portrait	landscape
but if i make zoom-in in portrait mode and then rotationg in landscape webview takes margin from right side

10408023
hash	md5
if you want to assure users that files have not been tampered with you can give them an md5 hash of the file

10408023
hash	md5
they can use free tools to check the md5 hash of a file they downloaded and compare it to the one you ve given to make sure their file was not altered

10408023
hash	md5
this functions almost like getting an md5 hash of a file with a private key known only to you so that the end user can compare the file signature to your public key to ensure the file has not been tampered with and is coming from a specific source

10408066
.htaccess	httpd.conf
enable mod_rewrite and .htaccess through httpd.conf and then put this code in your .htaccess under document_root directory

10408070
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
i have no problem in opera browser but in every other google-chrome ie firefox

10408071
g++	gcc	clang	llvm
xcode includes both clang and gcc built with llvm as clang and gcc g++ respectively

10408083
getter	setter
another good reason to user getter and setter can be understand by the following example

10408083
getter	setter
the point of getter and setter is that only they are meant to be used to access the private varialble which they are getting or setting

10408083
getter	setter
there is no requirement for getter and setter to start with get and set - they are just normal member functions

10408091
folder	directory
you ll need to put that in a folder called oauth2 in the same directory as your html file

10408092
folder	directory
i uploaded my folder to the website directory through ftp and pointed the domain to my rails folder in the control panel but when i go to the website homepage i get you don t have permission to access on this server. i tried using passenger but i m not sure if that is needed or if it worked at all

10408100
getter	setter
originally getter setter pattern was created to promote good object-oriented design by encapsulating the internals of a class from its external interface

10408100
getter	setter
this is the best answer of your question why use getter and setter

10408119
dictionary	map
however the dictionary methods cannot be redefined easily like map and zip .

10408150
cassini	iis
cassini cannot be accessed from another pc so you would have to switch to iis express or iis

10408156
portrait	landscape
if the device is in landscape it will show the portrait screen mode.why

10408156
portrait	landscape
but when i manually rotate the simulator then it will go in landscape and portrait mode properly

10408177
jgit	egit
in the indigo release there is the eclipse egit eclipse mylyn to github connector and jgit in indigo r2 release site

10408208
flask	pyramid
pyramid uwsgi pylon flask

10408245

i used below code for show hide caption in jquery

10408313
vertica	teradata
i am trying to convert a vertica view definition to teradata

10408408
sharepoint	cqwp
surprisingly content query web part doesn t allow multiple selection in the original list setting as this cqwp was pulling the data from a list available in the sharepoint site for the value field

10408427
filtering	grouping
you would probably want to do a filtering or grouping by on the patient_id and the datepart test_date_time in your recordset to make sure you don t step into other patients days in your iteration

10408437
entity-relationship	diagram
are you constructing an entity-relationship diagram for a schema

10408442
caliburn.micro	prism
we did some comparisons on mvvm libraries mvvm light caliburn.micro prism etc and we will choose mmvm light because it seems to offer a huge userbase lots of functionality and updates plus a gentle learning curve

10408506
http	spdy
http pipelining is susceptible to head of line blocking at the http transaction level whereas spdy only has head of line blocking at the transport level due to its use of multiplexing

10408506
ssl	spdy
spdy as deployed in the wild does not have this problem since it is generally deployed over ssl port 443 using npn to negotiate spdy support

10408506
http	spdy
i could go on and on about http pipelining vs spdy

10408507
post	get
my idea is simply to point them all to mysite.com and somehow get the subdomain name with php so that i echo the city post and content with php

10408510
post	get
i want to get the an app access token and then post as the page to the page

10408566
hide	show
once scrolled to the bottom of the page it show all and immediately slices to 40 and then hide again the rest again

10408577
jar	war
seems that the jar file for the jdbc connectivity is missing from the war file that you have deployed

10408606
google-chrome	safari
however even if my game now compiles in .air and works fine it works terribly slower than directly in ie9 google-chrome or safari

10408612
mouse	keyboard
provided fiddle select correctly the items with mouse but if i someone download the code and run the provided example then it works fine with keyboard keys but with mouse only last one can be selected

10408642
ienumerable	iqueryable
it can expose collections of model objects using iqueryable ienumerable but there are no primary key foreign key navigation properties customer.invoices to use once the entities are loaded on the client because there is no data context which loads them asynchronously or in one call using expand and manages the changes

10408660
ssl	https
1 is ssl https or ftps

10408840
super	implements
if an object do not support clone it throws clonenotsupportedexception this means that if you try to clone a super object and you get the exception you can t implements the clone object also in your subtype and the object cannot be cloned .

10408844
button	checkbox
for example when i clicked on checkbox i want text to be selecting... and after click the button to see text loading...

10408859
ftpwebresponse	ftpwebrequest
with the ftpwebrequest and ftpwebresponse classes

10408912
decltype	auto
there is also a bunch of post-c++11 features like decltype auto member initializers and aggregates that are supported by clang 3.3

10408966
junit	testng
my suggestion would be to try to use a testing framework testng or junit which gives many more features than just parametrization

10408975
stateless	stateful
yes http protocol is essentially a stateless protocol but to make it stateful we make use of http cookies

10408990
children	parent
you use a layout that allows the children to be placed relative to others like a relativelayout instead of the parent linearlayout with the id centerlayout

10409022
free	malloc
why i use top in linux to show my memory of one process i get that the storage of the process do only increase and do not decrease except i close the all process.i don t know why though i use free only behind malloc

10409032
math.h	sqrt
is sqrt not in the math.h header file

10409053
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	free	calloc	free	malloc	free	realloc	calloc	malloc
ubuntu manpage malloc free calloc realloc - allocate and free dynamic memory

10409059
g++	gcc
gcc not g++ historically would not by default include the mathematical functions while linking

10409093
stdout	stderr
the source code for truecrypt is available so you could modify it to output to stdout stderr

10409099
portrait	landscape
when i push from one view to another view in landscape portrait mode and move back in same mode the shouldautorotatetointerfaceorientation method called on move back

10409112
post	get
in rest architecture get and post are just the verbs which tells either to retrieve or create update the resource

10409172
submit	submission
then if you want to do it without a page reload you write an ajax script and hook it to the submit button and disable the form from submission

10409179
rpm	yum
if installation is done via yum or directly from rpm files and rpm package has python-config as its dependency then even if you install python config from setup.py file missing package error wouldn t go away

10409179
rpm	yum
in this case you may have to do force install using yum or rpm or install main application via different method

10409185
width	height
i need access to already evaluated width and height of all component in fragment view

10409190
post	get
you need to include the authentication token somehow in the request either as a get or post paramater or in the header

10409190
post	get
post or get is simply a matter of adding the paramater to the request data

10409200
mouse	keyboard
eventargs itself is pretty pointless as it has no information - but it s used as the base class for other classes which do have information such as keyboard and mouse information

10409239
websphere	ibm
i am using ibm websphere v 7.0

10409239
jobs	cron
i want to use cron jobs for logging purposes

10409239
jobs	cron
is there any way to use cron jobs in websphere

10409259
fseek	fread
it s pretty similar to regular fread fseek functions

10409309
hide	show
the idea is to hide everything then show them in increments

10409314
put	get
i m not sure if there s a way to put it somewhere i can easily get it from

10409315
free	malloc
it is a pretty common misconception that malloc directly gets memory allocations from the host operating system when called and free directly releases them back to the host operating when called

10409315
free	malloc
but they almost always don t work like that instead the standard library maintains a circular list of free d and malloc d memory which is opportunistically expanded and contracted by interacting with the host os see some of the answers on how do malloc and free work

10409315
free	malloc
the context maintains its own list of malloc d and free d memory and will expand and contract the memory held in that list as host driver window manager and the gpu itself allows

10409315
free	malloc
this implies there is rather coarse granularity in cudamalloc calls and means sometimes a malloc appears to not effect the amount of free memory or to consume much more memory than was requested and sometimes free calls appear to have no effect if you are interested you can find a little tool which helps illustrate the page size behaviour of the cuda driver here although it was written for an early version of the cuda api and might need a couple of changes to compile with modern versions

10409318
getter	setter
string password and correspongding setter and getter for the same

10409365
width	height
try setting the webviews height and width according to the pages width and height and then take the screenshot

10409368
client-side	server-side
i do not suggest ajax as it is way harder for hackers to hack into php then javascript-related technology as javascript is client-side and php is server-side

10409381
for-loop	arrays
and then iterate through the original arrays using a for-loop

10409381
for-loop	arrays
so basically every iteration of the for-loop clears the arrays created above

10409430
asterisk	freeswitch
other solutions comparable to asterisk are yate and freeswitch

10409519
put	get
if you just want to put 3 flickr photos in a page you can use the share button when viewing each photo at flickr to get a piece of html you can then paste into a page

10409546
post	get
from there this blog post showed me how to traverse the plist s structure and get the correct string in this case the fifth element in the file corresponding to cfbundleshortversionstring

10409614
stdout	fflush
the problem is stdout is almost always buffered and in this case the buffer will not be fflush unless explicitly told to until after threader exits

10409614
stdout	fflush	fflush	gets
that is why the reader will not see anything and then suddenly it will get a burst of output when threader exits and stdout gets fflush

10409650
try-catch	exception-handling
maybe you should try to capture an outofmemoryerror better to catch throwable which will catch it too instead of an exception-handling in try-catch block at captureandsaveimage

10409674
centroid	convex
there is a single white blob in the image nearly circular and i want to find the centroid of the blob it s always convex

10409686
post	get
for example if i have a retrievebalance post that takes the id number of the person in the body anybody can call this method with other id numbers and get their balance

10409701
pylons	pyramid
pylons is called pyramid now after the project merged with repoze.bfg some time ago

10409706
uitableview	uisearchbar	hide	show
i have put a uisearchbar into uitableview headerview and in viewcontroller viewdidload methods sets the headerview height to 0 and hide the searchbar and wanted to show searchbar when the button will touched in touch handler i restore the headerview height and show uisearchbar but the searchbar overlays the first row of tableview

10409729
proficy	historian
we are two university students doing an internship at a company that currently uses a proficy historian database for storing real-time data

10409729
proficy	historian
as indicated the database is a proficy historian 3.0 database running on a server

10409748
hash	md5
in order to track file changes i am using an md5 hash i had problems using timestamps

10409786
width	height
in addition the image width and height is wrong as well the only correct data that i found in the header is the bmfh.bftype which is 19778

10409789
google-chrome	safari
this process displays the first dialogue in all browsers but shows an error for the second dialogue in safari and google-chrome

10409789
google-chrome	safari
i understand that google-chrome has a caching process but not sure how may effect this or if it exist in safari

10409789
google-chrome	safari
in any case it appears that the second call the ajax fails in safari and google-chrome before the returned javascript is run

10409789
google-chrome	safari
hence due the fact that the same ajax functions are run and the same code is being returned google-chrome and safari are having issues with the second call

10409823
inherited	properties
the properties are inherited implicitly no need to model them explicitly again

10409885
free	malloc
adding to what sarnold says it could be helpful to free in the opposite order as malloc - especially for the smaller memory chunks

10409886
width	height
so i thought that i should define height or width in terms of screen

10409886
width	height
but don t know how to use that in defining height or width from java file

10409890
implements	extends
for doing above you cant do simply creating a thread in anonymous inner class do it efficiently by creating a class extends thread and implements one listener which notifies both ui thread and background for image downloaded or not

10409893
ienumerable	ilist
can ienumerable be used in this case or is it better to try other means ilist with indexation support

10409897
stdout	stderr
as best i can tell nothing is disconnecting the process from the stdout stderr streams - the terminal is still open for example and everything appears to be fine

10409897
stdout	stderr
in terms of handling the exception i can obviously catch it but i m assuming this means i wont be able to print to stdout stderr for the remainder of execution

10409897
stdout	stderr
in this case not being able to write to stdout stderr is not considered fatal but if it is an indication of something starting to go wrong i d rather bail early

10409928
width	height
i currently do a strait copy of images that are the correct width height to go into my site

10409991
sip	sdp	sdp	turn
i find that freeswitch handle the incoming message as a normal sip invite and will generate a session also a channel instance for the invite i make.the channel state is set to cs_new then it into the sofia state callback to handle the different stage of sip procedure.when the sdp is parsed the freeswitch tell me the sdp is not match so the session is turn off and the channel is hungup.i don t know how to configuration if the freeswitch support msrp or how to make this right.thank you very much if you can give me more infomation

10410030
filtering	grouping
the reduce function should essentially filtering out the duplicates and grouping them all together

10410049
uitableview	nsindexpath
to create an nsindexpath for use in a uitableview use this method

10410049
viewdidload	viewwillappear
you also need to call this from viewwillappear rather than viewdidload the static table is not populated that early on

10410153
ubuntu	linux
i have a .so file that was created on linux ubuntu

10410154

10410216
jqgrid	datatables
i had the same problem and ended up dropping jqgrid and getting datatables instead -

10410242
parseint	isinteger
whereas calling some isinteger method and then convert using parseint will always cause a performance overhead for valid numbers - the strings are parsed twice once by the check and once by the conversion

10410274
cvs	svn
commit uploads your changes on the cvs svn server and update overwrites the files on your localhost with the ones on the server

10410289
decimal	ieee
your problem is decimal numbers are represented as ieee compliant binary representation 32 64 or 128 bit

10410310
getter	setter
a lot of people have mentioned encapsulating the specifics of the implementation which to me is the biggest reason to use getter and setter in a class

10410310
getter	setter
if you choose the form a+bi for internal representation and expose that using fields rather than getter and setter not only do you force the class consumers to use that form you also cannot later easily change your mind and replace the internal representation with re iî because that turns out to be easier to implement in your particular scenario

10410317
postgresql	mysql
hsqldb 2.x is very standards-compliant also mysql knows the bit_and aggregate function which is a non-standard alias to every also supported by postgresql

10410329
wsdl.exe	svcutil.exe	xsd.exe	svcutil.exe
when you use add service reference add web reference xsd.exe wsdl.exe or svcutil.exe only properties are described - all your methods declared on server are lost

10410347
google-chrome	safari
ie google-chrome and safari have built in profilers in the web development

try using a svn or cvs solution.

10410386
mouse	keyboard
i ve implemented changecase keyboard shortcut like shift+f3 in ms word for richtextbox which changes the text either selected by mouse or the last word before caret s position

10410395
width	height
x y facewidth and faceheight are coordinates of the box and the width and the height passed into the kalman filter

10410462
mouse	keyboard
with my current code the keyboard layout changes every time i plug in my mouse

10410490
width	height
data is saved to session data as in rotation angle cropping - x y width height resize - ratio of width and height original_image_width thumb_image_width

10410490
width	height
if it s cropping the x y width and height must be calculated so that cropping takes place only once

10410490
width	height
since resizing takes place between each cropping to fit to workarea i can t seem to work out the math to calculate to needed variables x y width height

10410498
apache	nginx
do it via apache or better nginx

10410517
disk	ram
you could use a ram disk

10410528
width	margin
also you should be incrementing the slide margin by 500px 460 width + 20px margin + 20px padding

10410553
pentaho	saiku
if you are considering leveraging the reporting module and analytic tool of pentaho along with cdf i would suggest integrating saiku as there is no more support for jpivot in pentaho

10410571
int	chars
btw you have to set ah to 1 before int 21h that reads a chars into al from the keyboard

10410644
hide	show
edit btw if anyone wishes to use a theme via the manifest and uses actionbarsherlock you could use either theme.sherlock.light.noactionbar or theme.sherlock.noactionbar and if you wish to hide show in code simply use getsupportactionbar hide and getsupportactionbar .show

10410648
put	get
just get them and whatever data you need along with them and put all these in the sqlite database

10410664
pop-up	dialog
so it seems that after 2nd call of jquery dialog telerik mvc controls which are inside this dialog loose a capability to display any pop-up divs telerik s dropdownlist and datepicker are similar that they need to show floating div with a list of items or a calandar when you click on the arrow or calendard icon but manual edit of text in editable areas still works

10410679
geocoding	geocode
assuming that you call initalize before the geocoding otherwise geocode will be undefined

10410699

10411236
short	base
your puzzle game sounds like a typical app you work alone or with few people on it the entire code base will be small it s not a library it s life cycle will rather be short once done you ll fix bugs and have small improvements but not adaptions to complete new environments and so on

10411437
scheme	racket
i m using racket scheme

10411473
nsstring	nsdata
but if you want to see the actual result check request.receiveddata which is nsdata you need to convert it into nsstring then it is in pure xml format now you need to parse the xml and fetch the result you need

10411478
versioning	upgrade
the versioning comparison in my example is obviously very simple and would also cause the what s new to be displayed if they downgraded as well as if they upgrade but it should be straightforward to fix that

10415715
textview	imageview
actually there is nothing different just keep one thing in mind that in android id text1 id will simply work as an class name will contains other objects like textview imageview or any other

10415738

google-chrome	firefox
i noticed that i see these strange messages both in google-chrome and firefox

10415904
implements	extends
the only time i can think of where i might extends thread rather than implements runnable -- or even better just using an executorservice with a future -- is when i needed to override thread.interrupt to do some cleanup

10416019
put	get
to put multiple files at once use mput or to get multiple files at once use mget although you will probably be prompted for each file that is uploaded downloaded

10416019
put	get
if you still get errors make sure you have permission to put files in the directory that you are in on the server

10416026

10416090
apache	nginx
django says you should never serve static resources with django they should be served directly by the webserver you re using as a reverse proxy for django apache nginx etc. but it makes no contention on whether that must be on a different server or the same server

10416097
width	height
set the flex application width and height to 100

10416097
width	height
no matter what the html template s width and height are always 100

10416097
width	height
you have to set the flex application width and height to 100

10416107

firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
strangely this only happens in firefox safari and google-chrome

10416274
opencart	vqmod
i have written a module that uses vqmod for opencart

10416275
int	chars
if the corresponding argument to printf is a chars that is a undefined behaviour and b probably leads to the value of the chars promoted to an int and possibly some arbitrary adjacent bytes being interpreted as a pointer

10416337
folder	directory
i am trying to copy all of my output files from the solution target directory to a shared bin folder but for some reason the files are not being copied

10416351
post	get
there are obviously other situations where you could get an assertion but you didn t post enough code to debug thoroughly and the 2 i listed are the most common ones

10416363

10416411
nexus	artifactory
i m learning about artifact repositories such as jfrog artifactory and sonatype nexus

10416442
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome and safari use webkit which sencha touch requires in order to function

10416469
screens	tablet
with android api 10 the best option for targeting tablet is probably just distinguishing the actual size of the screens in the code using something like

10416522

10416617
range	minimum
the java primative int has a range of minimum value of -2 147 483 648 and a maximum value of 2 147 483 647

10416636
associativity	operator-precedence
expressions are parenthesized according to operator-precedence and associativity

10416747
coalesce	nvl
as others said nvl can be cascaded but the preferred solution would be to use coalesce instead

10416747
coalesce	nvl
2 however coalesce requires all arguments to be of the same data type thus being stricter than nvl which will first attempt an implicit conversion

10416755
free	malloc
that the value assigned to the varname is dynamically allocated using malloc for example and lives for as long is required remembering to free varname when no longer required

10416781
int	double
obviously when the returned result is double and you cast it to int you ll get only the highest 32 bits and the rest will be truncated - hence you always get the int math.pow 2 x

10416804
mouse	keyboard
i fixed it by unticking minimize window âœ - m in preferences keyboard mouse fusion shortcuts

10416861
google-chrome	firefox
does it work from the javascript console firefox google-chrome

10416862
width	height
now it works fine but the space that these resized images are going into are 200 height by 225 width and sometimes i will get an images that are tall and skinny and some images that are short and wide and that makes it difficult to fit them in the space ideally if i can resizes these images with them being squished or cut off but i m not sure if that s possible.

10416862
width	height
if that is not possible i guess i am looking to adjust this code so if its an image that is tall and skinny to resize with a height of 200 and if an image is wide and short to resize to width 225...i hope this makes sense

10416874
int	double
int d where d is a double greater than 2147483647 returns 2147483647 the largest representable value of type int

10416929
backgrounding	multitasking
specifically look for backgrounding execution and multitasking in the above link

10416949

in firefox the status says aborted in google-chrome failed

10417066
versioning	upgrade
you should also know that most of the emoji characters are encoded using a 4 byte utf8 codepoint which cannot be stored in mysql unless you upgrade to versioning 5.5 and convert your tables to the utf8mb4 character set

10417112
put	get
problem when then connection is slow and i do a put for a file that is not yet completely uploaded i only get the yet uploaded part

10417137
min	max
on the page hide the min rent and max rent from css

10417145
backgrounding	multitasking
scroll down to the section in backgrounding execution and multitasking

10417190
getter	setter
i d like to take advantage of the enum find iterator in the library and not have to use 100 properties with getter setter and 100 outlets to the text fields and other controls in the ui

10417190
getter	setter
similar to an approach i ve seen in a program using this library i d like to have one getter and one setter with a switch based on the meta data s enumerated fieldid

10417190
getter	setter
within the getter and setter i d like to programmatically access the appropriate text field or other control in the ui to get or set the value as needed

10417190
getter	setter
can i use the binding to pass the appropriate meta data fieldid to the getter setter

10417222
post	get
i think you have several choices one is to not get too hung up on dryness there is nothing preventing you from just repeating the post

10417239
prepare	execute
did you try to execute the prepare statement by hardcoding the and values

10417243
google-chrome	safari
this is the current css i have to implement image reflections though applied to div tags which contain imagehyperlinks - fb and twitter and it works in google-chrome and safari

10417267
google-chrome	firefox
seem to accomplish the same thing at least in google-chrome firefox ie so what is the difference

10417316
width	height
you can bind it to its parent s width and height as one of the many solutions

10417407
getter	setter
i filled in all my class variables and then right click on the page and select - source - generate getter and setter

10417411
put	get
a typical case where locking can be useful is a read-modify-write cycle you want to get the object modify it locally and put it back but disallow another client from making a competing change between the time you get it and the time you put it

10417411
put	get
update based on your updated question i see that you are see a partial truncated or half-uploaded version of the new file if you do a get concurrent with a put

10417550
puts	gets
anything above 0 puts it above the map and it gets the mouseover

10417554
int	chars
everything works as expected - when i click submit the code in getconvertedvalue is called and i can throw error messages if the conversion values if the user enters chars in the int fields

10417572
puts	gets
if you want mq to really look after your messages use synchronous puts as described above persistent messages and perform your puts and gets within transactions aka syncpoint so you have full application control over the commit points

10417577
cout	cin
instead of you most likely want to include as that includes cin and cout

10417577
for-loop	loops
the semi-colon at the end of your for-loop ends the statement that executes in loops

10417579
int	double
so long as the types of return values are limited int double or std string a function like this will do the job

10417587
cout	cin
std cout and std cin are defined in iostream so you have to add at the top of your file

10417591
queue	fifo
now for your problem i don t see where it could hang unless you gave it a fifo queue for the pid file

10417628
cout	cin
1 you have to for the definitions of cin and cout

10417637
jar	war
i have a war artefact and i need use some of their classes from a jar

10417652
getter	setter
generate one getter or setter method using the right click option source - generate getter and setter

10417652
getter	setter
on the second blank line use the right click option source - generate getter and setter to generate the rest of the getter and setter

10417676
min	max
even better would be a function -- call it mycolorramp -- which is like colorramp but instead a maps values between min values and max values

10417726
webkit	gecko
how can i do this in all the major engines gecko webkit ie

10417751
getter	setter
just make the binding getter setter a normal getter setter and manipulate the datatablegroup inside the listener method instead

10417757
folder	directory
directory trunk and tags are tagged in the tags folder

10417759
folder	directory
i am new to yii and i need to get a list of files inside a directory outside of the system folder

10417782
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this cannot be a browser issue as it has been tried on several different windows pcs in google-chrome ie safari and firefox

10417796
google-chrome	firefox
it seems to be a recurring issue that the tricks below work in ie and google-chrome but not firefox

10417806
put	get
simply put i get a cursor from the database iterate through it creating each list-item dynamically in code as textviews

10417817
fileinputstream	fileoutputstream
in my code i am using fileinputstream and fileoutputstream

10417890
google-chrome	safari
it happens in google-chrome 18 google-chrome canary 20 and safari 5.1.2 5.1.4

10417902
setinterval	settimeout
first you will need to create an update function that is called by settimeout or setinterval and has access to your puzzle object

10417917
post	get
i get the file name in the post

10417920
equals	compareto
null s are not string so i cant use equals or compareto for split the null s from my list

10417963
ubuntu	centos
sshpass is in the ubuntu repo however for centos it needs to be installed from here

10417993
pillow	libjpeg
you just need to have a working libjpeg install before running the pillow install and you should be off to the races

10418077
ienumerable	iqueryable
if you call tolist on any iqueryable or ienumerable properties does it return the expected data

10418124
int	double
i ve tried a lot of things already casting with float double unsigned int instead of only int and assigning to variables of those types as well

10418139
photoshop	fireworks
i know it s easy to create that effect in photoshop illustrator or fireworks

10418147
versioning	upgrade
what is my best solution....add a fire fox versioning conditional statement to ask people to upgrade i know ff 11 works fine or is there another more elegant solution

10418157
rdf	owl
more generally i think quite a few developers quickly get lost in the inter-tangled mess of rdf owl skos ontologies reasoning engines etc

10418188
equals	gethashcode
i ve done this before by creating the gethashcode and equals methods for the skinnyitem class

10418215
button	checkbox
edit i have noticed that there s a controlpaint.draw__ however it doesn t have a lot of controls it is able to draw it has border button checkbox combobox

10418218
postgresql	mysql
is this behaviour a standard thing one can count on in the most common databases mysql oracle postgresql sqlite sql server

10418220
post	put
you have to put it into xml content yourself but this is how you can post from php

10418221
post	get
apparently i wanted a get operation and i was running a post operation

10418231
int	boolean
i mean in php - in theory - i could use the same variable to store an int and then a string and then a boolean and then an array.

10418273
jobs	cron
i ve checked for cron jobs but there is nothing there using terminal

10418297
button	checkbox
don t use radio button use checkbox instead checked yes unchecked no

10418312
post	get
i couldn t comment on your first post but i wanted to kindly ask you if you could explain in a little more detail how you managed to get this list with date headers

10418318
google-chrome	firefox
if i open my webpage and then look at developer tools on the browsers like google-chrome firefox ie i see multiple copies of the same view javascript files loaded

10418365
post	put	post	get	put	get
in actual consideration example value put into verb has commonly of http get and post

10418368
width	height
i tried to change width and height in many tags but nothing new

10418393
post	put	post	get	put	get
the get post put delete actions correspond to the http request type

10418404
folder	directory
i added the path to the folder where is testlib.dll in properties- vc++ directories- executable directory

10418404
folder	directory
i added the path to the folder where is testlib.h in properties- vc++ directories- include directory

10418460
width	height
using this 2d bin-packing algorithm edit fixed demo which is a variation of this how can i get the final bin width and height of each bin

10418460
width	height
the original algorithm only deals with a single ever-expanding bin so i modified it to take a max width and height

10418565
width	height
possible solution a min-height on the div in css or computing the image dimensions and setting width and height when you append them

10418618
google-chrome	firefox
so if it is not possible to achieve in html would be possible to do using some feature build in specific browser like google-chrome or firefox

10418622
width	height
my problem is i cannot guess the width of my text so what would i need to do in order for my setbounds to take the width and height as the text is

10418623
pull	push
is it possible to push and maybe pull from mercurial hg to cm synergy

10418654
range	median
so is there any other approach which would give the result even when the points are very far apart where median gives a range which is of the order of 10 9

10418655
hash	salt	hash	md5	salt	md5
they suggested i use one-way encryption. now i m not a huge security freak but i m pretty sure this involves one aspect anyway stuff like md5 hash with salt or the like

10418673
for-loop	loops
let s restrict the requirements a bit no number overflow just for loops while can be sometimes transformed to full for-loop except when using continue etc. no breaks no modifications of the control variable inside the for-loop

10418688
melt	reshape
here it is with reshape in base though joran is right melt is likely easier

10418713
post	get
if you need further help it might be easier if you give it a try yourself and see what issues arise so that you can focus your question post some code and get a more detailed response

10418720
width	height
this method uses a postscript command snippet of to shift and place the pdf pages on a smaller media size defined by the -gnnnnxmmmm parameter which defines device width and height in pixels

10418726
daemons	systemd
but as i understand it memory mapping relies on buffering by the operating systemd and so i m not sure what would happen if my daemons updates the input bytes while my client app is in the middle of a read operation

10418745
hide	show
i wonder if there is a simple beautiful way to toggle content of the link between show more... and hide details when the div toggle occurs

10418748
post	get
you wish to set the destination with your imagedata the above post shows a function which will serve the image through a get request like so

10418799
vim	emacs
i ve searched the vim docs but was unable to find a way to embed the syntax mode in a file like the major-mode does for emacs

10418838
boost	allocator
it has support for object oriented non-singleton usage but you will have to wrap it to an allocator object supported by boost unordered_map

10418848
pull	push
right now if i want to add an element to the set i need to pull the row from hbase deserialize it into a setwritable add my element serialize the setwritable and then push it back to hbase

10418906
post	get
there s already 2 tools available in wordpress import and export xml in backend just install that and you ll get what you want there s no need to do any custom thing on every post but if you still want it then read about publish_post hook

10418916
int	chars
i assume intconvert ... converts an int to a string and thus you get lexical comparisons which meahs 25 is greater than 100 because the first chars is greater 2 1

10418919
automake	autotools
i am writing a small library and want to make it accessible using autotools with automake 1.11

10418987
folder	directory
the implementation was such that we had a symlinked directory symdir inside the web content folder that pointed to another folder on the same filesystem but outside the web application and wasce for that matter

10419005
hide	show
if i hide the img wait some time and show it again it works but it s an ugly hack.

10419037
folder	directory
when i execute this command all the files in st2 project gets added to the www directory and not the folder and the files containing in those folder

10419156
int	double
one way to do that is to convert the random int to a double between 0 and 1 then convert back to an int

10419213
folder	directory
you can make sub folder in your res directory api level specific by adding a suffix like -v11

10419221
uiview	subviews
this is a view controller mvc with a uiview subviews the latter where drawing takes place

10419225
int	chars
so if you have a tree with an int range of 0 - 25 you can print out a valid chars of a - z

10419252
folder	directory
my feeling is that we should have a folder under the root of our project named something like dependancies or thirdparty with all of the dlls included there and set their build event to copy to the output directory

10419280
int	chars
i think that unsigned int is converted to signed chars and thus it will be -1

10419288
setinterval	settimeout
if you d like to see stack trace that spans over settimeout setinterval calls then more sophisticated would be the way to go

10419294
width	height
by default android tabs does not support set width and height in xml

10419348
int	chars
in a tiff between signed chars and unsigned int unsigned int wins

10419362
implements	extends
here is one of the way of implements it please take a look and also pls extends refactor it based on your needs

10419368
getter	setter
i think you need to add the getter and setter to the users class

10419371
post	get
step 3 if i first post my url to the linter and get its id

10419407
int	chars
i would either cast the chars to an unsigned int if the unsigned int s value is greater than sizeof chars

10419407
int	chars
or cast the other way if the unsigned int s values are to be restricted to a sizeof chars

10419410
portrait	landscape
similarly switching from portrait to landscape is a configuration changes so that too makes sense

10419437
opennlp	lingpipe
i ve heard the names of gate lingpipe and opennlp - however i m unsure whether they fit my needs

10419442
hide	show
as others have pointed out it is much more preferable to hide show the image through css either visibility none if you want to keep the space occupied or display none if you want the image to completely disappear

10419477
hide	show
my choice was to create a function in ajax asynchronous call to which this report was generated and while this process does not answer me back i hide the button and show the loading and so has the return button i show and hide the loading

10419485
ati	nvidia
any ideas using the nvidia or ati sdk maybe

10419485
ati	nvidia
judging from results of google search nvidia provides api for overclocking their gpus and there are some ati tools available as well though ati tools look unofficial

10419489
ubuntu	centos
however one is running ubuntu 10.04 where i compiled while the other is running centos 5

10419494
put	get
but when i want the specific event to open in a new window when clicked i just get the event that lies last on the screen when i put this in a browser

10419539
int	double
if you re comparing int s to double s you re going to need to come up with whatever rules you want to use when determining if two values are close enough. you may consider using the std modf function in in making the comparison

10419539
int	double
in your case though you re trying to compare a double with an int and i have to assume you want some rounding

10419585
oncreate	ondestroy	onresume	onpause
i managed to do it doing the bind unbind of the service when i create and destroy the activity using oncreate ondestroy e saving in a boolean if this activity is visible through onpause onresume methods as the following code bellow shows

10419598
devise	cancan
i am using devise and cancan to manage users and user-rights

10419628
maven	pom.xml
i have the following maven pom.xml

10419651
public	protected
you can create a public method inside a partial class for myentity that fires calls the protected method

10419653
width	height
if width and height of your anchor are constant then you can use sprite and define coordinates 0 -47px in your example

10419667
rss	feed
i am trying the rss feed code from this website it worked fine

10419680
public	protected
someone else might point out a why you shouldn t have to do this but one simple thing is to add a public method that relays to the protected method

10420964
mouseover	mouseout	mouseover	mousedown	mouseout	mousedown
if a mousedown event is triggered it ll remove which is fine and this removes the tooltip but then if the user also triggers the mouseout event which they will because the mouseover and mouseout events are currently chained it will then delete another dom element which i don t want

10420964

but this should be irrelevant as i d like to just know if it s possible to return from that mouseover function if the mousedown was triggered without using a global variable

one advantage of the for-loop over the while loops is that you can freely use continue inside the body without a fear of forgetting to increment your counter

i have this code to parse an rss feed but for some reason my catch for itemdownlink is never firing

10424074
daemons	launchd
apparently that was a mistake because the nova-compute node trying to launchd the image crashes on daemons startup with a networknotfound error presumably because it can t find the misconfigured network id i had to delete

subscript	superscript
how can i programmatically add superscript or subscript for inline element xaml for windows 8

10424130
x86	mips
no two processor families are the same an arm and an x86 and a mips have no reason to resemble each other in any way and may very well not look the same even though on all of them you can say for example store the value 0x1234 to the address 0x1000 using an instruction

10424131

i want to find a queue structure a data container whose elements must be fifo

mouseup	mousedown
the problem is that i have events assigned mousedown mouseup etc... to the svg element beneath the html

10424160
mouseup	mousedown
all of the views have been bound with mousedown and mouseup events

10424160
mouseup	mousedown
but every time i go from a subview to the index view and then go to any of subviews again the mousedown and mouseup events in the current subview will be triggered one more time which means when i click the subview there will be several consecutive mousedown events triggered followed by several consecutive mouseup events triggered

10424160
mouseup	mousedown
so i think that s why the mousedown and mouseup will be triggered several times

10424250

you could use window.performance.now - since firefox 15 and window.performance.webkitnow - google-chrome 20

10424677
post	get
if i changed the authentication to apikeyauthentication then i would have to post the username and api key on each get post request to a resource

10424677
post	get
the problem with doing that is that i would have to create a new intermediate view which queried for the username and the view and then did the get post to the tastypie endpoint

10424677
post	get
the second way is to embed the username and apikey into the webapp and get js to grab those values and add them to the get post querystring but this could lead to a security issue

10424729

10424801
heroku	engineyard
i checked out bitnami heroku and engineyard and ran some serious tests against heroku and engineyard and engineyard was by far the winner

10424801
heroku	engineyard
the cost is actually cheaper on engineyard than on heroku once you start adding web dynos and the performance is way way better especially if you switch to the jruby stack

10424801
heroku	engineyard
i think heroku is a good solution if you are not concerned about performance or scalability and just want to deploy a simple web app it is probably easier to use than engineyard for that sort of thing

10424806
pdfsharp	itext
normally i would use itext or pdfsharp but i was introduced to aspose and was using it as a test for this project has some cool features to desaturated image and save space which work very nicely - a tb of tiffs is about 200gb of pdf

10424876
accessor	properties
then the problem is that the outercontrol.inner properties has a set accessor

10424876
accessor	properties
next because the inner properties has a set accessor asp.net creates a new instance of innercontrol not asp.innercontrol_ascx as you might expect and attempts to initialize its url properties to #

namenode	checkpoint
basically the checkpoint node is a new implementation of the secondary name node and the backup point is an interim release on the way to a warm-standby for the namenode plus it can currently offer a small performance boost by separating reads and writes - reads in the name node and writes in the backup node

integer	fractions
over the top keep the integer and fractions parts as separate small integers

this will require an additional floating point operation at the end to combine the integer and fractions parts probably not worth it

10425073
screens	tablet
fragments was developed by google as the screens size of tablet is large and we can accommodate more functionality in one screens

10425073
width	height
what you need to do is get the width and height using following function

10425075
addclass	removeclass
so click addclass slide menu open click again slide menu closed removeclass

10425075
toggleclass	slidetoggle
i ve tried adding before the slidetoggle function instead of using the toggleclass which gives me the correct effect on the first click but i can t figure out how to remove the class after the nav has closed again

tunnel	vpn
i would recommend setting up a vpn tunnel between the remote iis server and the in-house sql server

10425129
tunnel	vpn
with a vpn tunnel the sql server is just like any other server on the network to the app

10425136
setinterval	settimeout
note that we only call setinterval once versus settimeout every time we didn t want it to continue

10425175
setinterval	settimeout
apparently you have mistaken setinterval for settimeout

10425175
setinterval	settimeout
setinterval runs the enclosed function every n milliseconds while settimeout executes only once after n milliseconds

10425193
memcpy	strncpy
we use memcpy because strncpy checks each byte for 0 on every copy

width	height
the code uses window.innerwidth and window.innerheight to set the aspect ratio and the width height for the renderer but it seems as if it picks up 20 to 30 extra pixels somewhere and adds them to the bottom and the right of the page

10425310
width	height
i ve echoed the screen size to the page and made javascript alert functions to check the window width and height and then watch as they get passed to the three.js api during runtime operations but the error remains the canvas rendering object is resizing itself to slightly larger than the screen size

post	get
what i want to do is grant access to a file in my bucket using an http get post request

10425328
post	get
i don t want to do that i want the file to be privately available at a url with required post or get credentials deciding who can access the file would be based on a database containing application users and their permissions

10425328
post	get
i understand the security implications of passing any kind of credentials over get or post on a non-https connection

10425354
for-loop	arrays
note i understand that i could probably use something like boost ptr_vector but i wanted similar to hashtable functionality so the for-loop would need additional information but that is outside of the direct scope of this question which is why i am using a traditional arrays

10425897
getter	setter
property getter and setter in most any object-oriented language provide an external or user interface around private members of instances of your classes

10425897
getter	setter
this way you can for example protect a private variable from receiving an invalid or out-of-range value or make a property read-only by providing only a getter but no setter

10425897
getter	setter
even more interesting is the idea that getter and setter may wrap properties that aren t natively retained in your class but might for example be computed based on other instance members

10425897
getter	setter
getter and setter surely aren t unique to objective-c

10425902

10425920
getter	setter
getter and setter are used to control changes to a variable field

10425920
getter	setter
often a setter is accompanied by a getter also known as an accessor which returns the value of the private member variable

10425920
getter	setter
getter setter methods may also be used in non-object-oriented environments

10425920
getter	setter
in this scenario the compiler cannot restrict code from bypassing the getter setter methods and changing the variable directly

children	parent
so if you want to maintain immutability you can t create a node until its children have been created because those children have to be specified at the time of creation but you also can t set parent pointers on the children before the parent has been created because the parent doesn t exist

10426800
children	parent
certainly maintaining parent pointers makes the programmer s life more difficult because as soon as you change one node in the tree you have to make changes to all its children s parent pointers which is a pain

lme4	mgcv	lme4	nlme	mgcv	nlme
gamm4 is built on top of lme4 which does not allow for a correlation parameter in contrast to the nlme package which underlies mgcv gamm

10433743
lme4	mgcv
mgcv gamm does handle binary data although it uses pql which is generally less accurate than laplace ghq approximations as in gamm4 lme4

10433743
mgcv	nlme
your desired autocorrelation structure autocorrelation can exist within each single value for block but assume independence among blocks is exactly the way correlation structures are coded in nlme and hence in mgcv gamm

put	get
to put in a nutshell static keyword in this case allows to get inner class independent of its parent class

the simple rule is for every malloc there must be exactly one free

10434079
free	malloc
the destructor does not free the memory allocated by the malloc right

10434079
free	malloc
in that case you have invoked malloc but never free

10434079
free	malloc
free is malloc s partner

10434109
realloc	calloc	realloc	malloc	free	calloc	free	malloc	free	realloc	calloc	malloc
if you call malloc or calloc or realloc you need to free that memory

10434146
free	malloc
a memory allocated with malloc should be free with free

10434146
free	malloc
in c++ there it is rare that one would need to use malloc and free and don t use them unless you have good reasons to do so

10434147
free	malloc
things allocated by malloc need to be deallocated by free

10434147
free	malloc
then you are correct in thinking that without a destructor the memory allocated by malloc will not be free

so i recommend you start reading at this question implements vs extends when to use

10435203
int	boolean	getter	setter
but without giving the explicit type like int float boolean string list string by creating the getter setter in the backing bean

10435203
int	boolean	int	double
it can be a boolean int float double string or list string in my case

10435203
int	double
a lot of try to cast to a type and if it succeeds its your type but without knowing for sure whether its a int or a float double

10435203
getter	setter
but the question is is it any good to bind values from jsf uicomponents in my view to some kind of a value wrapper to avoid write to many simple dummy getter setter in my backing beans

10436115
google-chrome	safari
do google-chrome somehow cached all these requests in a different way than safari or have google hacked webkit to be speedier

opera	safari	opera	google-chrome	google-chrome	safari
i my opinion the increase in speed is simply made by the way the browser renders a page safari seems to rebuild everything from scratch while google-chrome similar to opera build up the page even if it s not fully loaded

10436356
int	double
the use of data.vector.unboxed in some form is clearly now the standard naive way of doing this sort of thing -- it s the new data.list for int double etc. everything but the sort is irritating io management which could i think still be massively improved on the write end in particular

10436358

instead of using fadeout and fadein with a duration of 0 you should simply use hide and show

the keys you are using in your current code are lowercase textview1 when you put but upper case when you get textview1

10437432

right now every time i try to post with this code i always get a 422 response code failure which i believe means the entity passed was unprocessable

if the process your are ld_preload ing forks off children they will be using your hooks too using the same set of descriptors as the parent and all their siblings and children will do

10437535

often calling starthandshake explicitly when establishing the connection is unnecessary since the handshake is initiated when you start reading from the inputstream or writing to the outputstream

10437690
width	height
if your text won t be larger than the width of the box you could set the line-height equal to the height of the box

10437784
width	height
you can set the line height on the span to whatever you like and if it is less than half of the line height of the parent it will center and allow text wrapping if your text exceeds the parent container width

10437837
bindparam	pdostatement	bindparam	bindvalue	pdostatement	bindvalue
since even php doesn t know what type its variables are i believe the only way to do that is to directly bind them with either pdostatement bindparam or pdostatement bindvalue as you are doing although it isn t strictly necessary to specify the argument as a simple int cast of the gives php s otherwise clueless type system enough to work with

10437845
put	get
the problem is that any return from the required file is also inside the comment so you might put this return in a function in the required file and call it from the native file to finally get the data and put it wherever you want

this little bit of code works for firefox and google-chrome but hideprogress does not get called in ie

10438322

it would seem that my server is completely ignoring my for-loop and if statement that is supposed to check for authentication and skipping straight to that loops regardless on what i type in for my username and password on the client side

10438388
put	get
the problem is that regardless of where i put the whitespace in around the bold tag i can t get a space before the t in this

10438394
children	parent
i think this is where you re coming from because i was in that boat once too not understanding the relationship between updating a property and it affecting it s siblings parent children but it s really key to reducing processing load since a property can be modified multiple times between frame refreshes and it doesn t need to re-calculate everything around it until it will actual be redrawn

10438403
folder	dir
oddly enough if you navigate to the folder in cmd it ll show up in dir but if you tab until you get a suggestion for the folder name it will not let you cd into it

int	chars
i have a string of chars but i would like to have a string of hexdecimal chars where the hexadecimal chars are converted by turning the original chars into int and then those int into hexadecimal chars

accordingly i d like the checkbox to act like a set of radio button

10438657
free	malloc
obviously you have c++ code here so prefer new and delete over malloc and free because the latter two do not take into account constructors and destructors for complex objects

the issue i m encountering is that every time i make a draw call when rendering a light to be added to the light map it completely replaces all data in the texture including its width and height

10438990
getattr	setattr
the heart of the matter is that python interprets lines of code left to right so when it arrives at a statement like it s first operation is a getattr a b and not a setattr so i can t determine easily if the last operation in the stack of operations is an assignment

10439051
inherited	subclassing

so you can initialize a property to either be a specific value in which case the setter will be used or via an object collection initializer in which case the getter for the property will be used and then setter or the add method will be used for the body of the object collection initializer

10439096
hide	show
the first example show how to have multiple datatables on one page while the other allows you to show hide details about each row

10439096
hide	show
i have applied the class datatable to each of my dynamically generated tables so the following code turns them all into datatables and disables sorting on the first column since that s where the show hide icon goes

10439096
hide	show
then i add an event listener to show hide the additional row of details when the user clicks the image in the first column

10439096
hide	show
when i click the show hide icon in a row on any other table the icon changes but the details row does not appear

10439322
min	max
do this iteratively involves both host and device code till you are left with only one set of min max values

10439322
min	max
an alternative if your current work distribution is amenable is to find the min max inside of each workgroup and write it to a buffer in global memory index local_id

10439330
post	get
it s usually recommended to use post redirect get pattern for example

10439338

the url will be appended and called but the form submits and grab the action and post the data to it and if you keep it the page won t be called so theoretically no cause the get would be lost because of the second page load with not get value but you can get this working by using this editing to your form like so

i have playing around with a steriotab system with the prototype.js library everything works fine except the next div under the container of steriotabs is showing like a flash when turning to next tab

10454345
for-loop	loops
since the code works if i remove the for-loop i m assuming that somehow the names card1 and card2 are not visible outside loops

10454345
for-loop	loops
i see now that if i move my instantiate statements outside the for-loop i could theoretically assign new values for those objects over and over again using a loops which is all i need to complete this particular task

10454385
for-loop	loops
the card1 and card variables are declared inside the for-loop and is thus only visible inside of loops

10455229
getter	setter
constructors getter and setter

10455269

in order to size something to the width of it s children you would need to get the height and width with javascript and set it on the parent element

10455519
accessor	properties
cocoa style notes properties variables should have lowercase initial letters and this is actually more important now because of arc don t name accessor methods to start with get -- that has a specific meaning in cocoa involving passing in a buffer and getting data back by reference

running it on ie safari or firefox alerts and empty string

10455526

versioning	upgrade
i m looking for the simplest way for the user to upgrade to the full versioning while preserving the data from the lite versioning

10455589
for-loop	loops
also the iterator statement in the for-loop contains a lot of operations instead of loops actually having a body

10455643
width	height
display inline-block makes width and height go to auto like an inline element and as you said default vertical align is baseline

10455652
hash	md5
another idea is to store all tweets as text and add another column with the tweets hash to md5 and add a unique key over the column

10455808
min	max
i understand sending a date to the min and max but that doesn t really solve my issue

10455858

10456107
pull	push

10456117
width	height
after the two images which is the same width and height

10456124
width	height
this works accurately where the width and height of the containedview is larger than that of the scrollview and sets the views so that subsequent scrolling will take you exactly to the edges of the containedview

10456124
width	height
however when either dimension of the image is smaller than the scrollview width and height the image is magnetically attracted to the top left corner of the screen

10456124
width	height
for example with scrollview.bounces no a horizontal image whose height is smaller than the height of the scrollview but whose width is larger so it can be scrolled from left to right will scroll further to the left than it should when scrolling to the right it stops correctly at the edge of the image although if scrollview.bounces yes it then bounces in from the edge so the image is always cropped on the left when the image is larger in both dimensions than its containing scrollview this issue accentuates and the whole result feels broken which is unsurprising given apple s documented advice

10456143
concave	convex
the problem is the function i m using scipy.interpolate.griddata uses the convex hull of the cloudpoint in the plane x y thus giving as result some values that don t exist in the original surface which has a concave perimeter

10456210
google-chrome	firefox
i ve tried in several browsers google-chrome firefox etc... but it all looks the same

10456234
mouseup	mousedown
to try and solve this i was hoping to trigger the mouseup event followed by the mousedown event so that jquery will use the new container size

10456236
put	get
while i was trying to get this to work initially i noticed that if i defined the function as below it would put a tab character at the cursor position

10456236
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
edit this only seems to work in google-chrome not in ie safari or firefox

10456241
int	boolean
my question is - is there some kind of research and maybe some proof-of-concept projects where this analysis is extended from boolean variables to variables with int and maybe even float domains

10456241
drools	jess
so - the other question is - is there theory of production rule systems for rule engines like drools jess clips and so on and is there practical need for such theory and what are the practical issues of using drools and other systems that can be addressed by the theory of production rule systems

10456360

10456506
google-chrome	firefox
but the problem is my code works fine on ie8 but on firefox and google-chrome it just displays a blank page

10456506
google-chrome	firefox
if i directly request the welcome page from the address bar it is displayed correctly both in firefox and google-chrome

10456506
google-chrome	firefox
its only the display of the welcome page that is having problems in firefox and google-chrome

10456542
mouse	keyboard
what focus means is that any given window receives mouse and keyboard messages

10456542
mouse	keyboard
in order for scroll bar to process mouse click or keyboard to move slider scroll bar must have focus

10456542

it is a popup window that for the duration has keyboard focus and captures mouse

10456547
gif	png
when i upload any jpg jpeg png or gif if outputs the data

10456554

while directly computing and comparing hands seems an attractive exercise there are almost no applications for computers with reasonable amounts of ram disk for which they would be practical

10456561
public	protected
i have a java public class a that has two protected static methods foo and bar

10456570
google-chrome	firefox
this works properly meaning it appends the audio track onto the page in google-chrome but fails at different points in internet explorer and firefox

10456587
children	parent
a better approach would probably be to give them all the same class and then use things like parent find children etc

10456594
width	height
this makes it difficult to use in scenarios where images can take up the entire browser view port instead of the predefined width and height

10456594
width	height
the images that i want to use in the slider are of 1600px in width and 804px in height which i want to be scaled as per the aspect ratio and browser screen size on different screens

10456707

10456727

ffmpeg	libvpx
edit #6 fixed the above error by adding --enable-shared to the configuration options of libvpx and ffmpeg

10456747
filtering	grouping
i m not totally sure what your update needs to do exactly but you could add a filtering on groups.groupname to your query and then do with to append a member only to the grouping that matched

10456759
filtering	grouping
it s because your user model can have multiple grouping so you need to match a grouping in the filtering and use the positional operator in the update

10456815
freemarker	velocity
if you are looking for a way to generate some complex html and also going to inject some data into it some templating engine velocity freemarker or any other would be useful here

10456840

10456863
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome and firefox there s no mouse events and no tool tip

10456866
vim	emacs
emacs and vim have their own configurable rules for symlink handling but most commands rely on the kernel to deal with it

10456923
free	malloc
another possibility would be to have my_malloc call malloc each time it needs to allocate memory and simply handle whatever bookkeeping aspects you re interested in such as number of blocks allocated number of blocks free largest outstanding block total allocated memory etc

10456924
ffmpeg	libav
my issue is that when i attempted to expand out from a single multimedia format into something more flexible specifically connecting to libav ffmpeg the direct2d render control starts to crash display drivers

but that just hide everything and just show this particular div

10457115

10457356
min	max
i generate weights between two double values min max with an adjustable sparseness ratio

ubuntu	debian
if you install the bsd process accounting utilities package acct on debian and ubuntu you can use the sa 8 utility to summarize executions or give you semi-detailed execution logs

10457368
tiff	png
an option would be to save it as a file in some image format jpg png tiff using either matlab or java and return file instead of image

10457409
rss	feed
i m trying to require my template for rss feed in php

10457436
width	height
note that you should try to get the spritedimension etc values from the image itself by dividing the image width w and height h by the size of an individual sprite

10457509
pop-up	dialog
i m working on a gallery type application - one template puts together a pop-up dialog for a larger view of thumbnail images when clicked

10457561
folder	directory
if you are using maven clear the .m2 folder from your user directory build the project and that should help

10457605
int	double
for example 2 4.6 is parsed as int 2 and double 4.6 in my teststruct below

10457621
width	height
make sure you change the width height left and right values to match the width and height of your two image files

10457628

the idea is that once the alert fires an alert dialog pop-up with a short blurb about the site with the option to either close the alert or get more info uses webview

10457668
post	get
basically i wanna retrieve all post by custom post type get all menu but ordered by taxonomy by reference

set up a target platform with all the external bundles you need - you can just dump them into a directory and then point the target platform configurator at that folder

onclick	onchange
it s easy to see this if you have a button field with onclick action and a text field with onchange action change the text field and move the cursor directly to the button and click it

10457820
mousemove	mouseout
to do this judicious use of mousemove and mouseout events can provide mouse tracking which can then be inspected in the onchange handler

10457856
put	get
instead you put the event on a parent object of the elements that will be created in the future but already exists and you supply a selector to specify which elements within that selector qualify to get the event called on

accessor	properties
one caveat it s perhaps controversial but for various reasons it s generally frowned upon to use properties accessor in init and dealloc

10457929
accessor	properties
if you fall into the properties accessor in init dealloc is bad camp i do you could change it to this

10457929
accessor	properties
the code above is exactly equivalent to what you re doing except that it s not calling the properties accessor

10458000
int	chars
if you allocate a static buffer then you can write the converted int into it and return a pointer to it just as the interface to your posted function shows but the chars string you d be returning would only continue to contain that number until the next time you called the function

10458000
int	chars	free	malloc
alternatively you could dynamically allocate a buffer in which to put the converted int s chars either using malloc or new and then the caller of your function would be responsible for later free ing or deleting the allocated buffer or else you d have a memory leak

10458000
int	chars
be sure whatever way you allocate it you allocate enough space for the largest numeric string you might need to create probably based on the size of an int 12 chars would be sufficient for representing any positive or negative 32-bit int value

10458036

profiling	benchmarking	innodb	myisam
i m interested in learning why the different storage engines i benchmarking innodb myisam and memory have the profiling that they do

10458095
innodb	myisam
i m guessing that the answer will be along the following lines innodb fsyncs after each update since each update is an acid compliant transaction whereas myisam does not since it doesn t even support transaction

10458095
innodb	myisam
this gives us a similar behavior to myisam but we still get to benefit from the transaction features available in innodb

10458354
public	protected
so a protected function can be overridden as either protected or public but it can t be overridden as private and a public function can only be overridden as public

10458354

10458513
superclass	subclassing
you can t call the subclassing s constructor from the superclass s constructor because it s the subclassing s constructor that called the superclass s constructor in the first place

10458513
superclass	subclassing
it s not that the superclass is being instantiated with the subclassing as some kind of parameter instead the superclass is instantiated as a step in instantiating the subclassing and the superclass should only know about its own structure leaving subclassing details to the subclassing constructor that triggered the superclass

10458542
subtract	add
i do that testing if the rotation changed more then 300 degrees in either direction if it does then you need to add or subtract 360 depending on the direction

10458543

10458653
inherited	properties
unless you change the container control to inherited from usercontrol a contained control will not conform to the container control s padding properties

this code is run on both kohana and fuelphp - identical basic codebase uses built in db module no orm used accessed the same database

10458835
width	height
if you pass a the result tag will have its width and height set to 260 and 180

10458835
width	height
resizing image by setting the width and height of tag will not keep the image s original aspect ratio

10458852
for-loop	arrays
i have a function to check if all the form input fields are equal to null or which is all fine but wanted to see if there is another way of doing it by loading all the fields into a javascript arrays and then doing a for-loop along with an if statement to check if any of the fields are empty unfortunately i can t seem to get this to work and wondering if i ve simply just missed something some where

10458881
runtimeexception	unchecked-exception
any subclass of runtimeexception including runtimeexception itself is an unchecked-exception which means the compiler won t force you to check for it in a try catch clause

getter	setter
the emailstr getter and setter should be private and the getemail creates the email object lazily based on the emailstr

10459975
int	double	int	chars
a consequence of this is that the time it takes you to write long instead of int or double instead of float they both have one extra chars can be worth thousands of times more than the extra memory it uses

10459975
int	double	int	chars
however i would still suggest almost always using double instead of float and often long instead of int because if it saves one bug it will more than make up for the extra chars you had to type

if you only need to save the data to pass it to the next action you can use post or get the get would pass through the url and the post would not typically

so you would likely be very satisfied passing the few pieces of data around as parameters post or get

width	height
if that is true then it alters the request by swapping the width and height and then rotates the page content by 90 degrees

10460560

now having read the documentation properly i realize that the wp_get_attachment_image_src function returns an array with both the img source and width and height so i don t even need the getimagesize function

more specifically i do not understand why the length of the input arrays is divided by 3 in the for-loop condition and the for-loop variable i is also incremented with 3 every iteration

10466300

short answer there is no special relationship between icmp and arp

10466434
width	height
when you use the visibility hidden or display none way of hiding an element the height and width of the element aren t changed it just ain t visible

10466693
free	malloc
you should call a malloc and store it there and don t forget to free

10466694
hash	md5
another thing you can do is compare the values against md5 hash as the md5 hash is unique for each string

10466694

you may have issues with indexing but it s definitely worth a shot alternatively you could store an md5 hash next to the column such as column_md5 and run searches based on that column

int	chars
they take int arguments but expect chars values in the unsigned chars range so on a platform where chars is signed passing a chars value directly could lead to undesirable sign extension

10468306
typedef	typename
wchar_t like char also may be signed or unsigned but because wchar_t is itself a typedef a typename of unsigned wchar_t is illegal

10468309

10468532
google-chrome	firefox	versioning	upgrade

also if you have simple fields such as ones that only hold a boolean value you may want to consider declaring it as an int instead of whatever you declared it as

10484870
int	double
declaring it as any type not specifically defined by sqlite will cause it to default to a numeric type which will take longer to compare values because it will store it internally as a double and will use the floating-point math processor instead of the int math processor

inherited	properties
the math object inherited a constructor properties through the prototype chain from its prototype which is the standard built-in object prototype

10485005
inherited	properties
that the math object also inherited object.prototype.constructor is merely a side-effect of that unconditional inherited in ecmascript implementations as with the exception of implementations of the edition 4 proposal and perhaps of future editions properties do not have a suitable visibility modifier to prevent that like private in several class-based languages

10485005

and of course the constructor of object instances which inherited from the same prototype is the object referred to by the initial value of the object properties of the global object

distance	polygons
in such cases you should snap to the nearest polygons up to a certain distance and revert to the natural time zone the one determined by longitude alone in the open ocean

10489206
distance	polygons
to do this you will need code to compute the distance between a query point and a line segment of a polygons this is non-trivial since latitude and longitude are a non-euclidean coordinate system and your spatial index will need to be able to return nearby polygons not just potentially containing polygons

10489234
width	height
it is important to note that without some styling if you empty a table cell it may collapse to zero width or if all cells on a row are empty the row may collapse to zero height

10489264
width	height
however i was already performing my initialization within the pageinit event and my map div has a set width and height

innodb	myisam
this gives us a similar behavior to myisam but we still get to benefit from the transaction features available in innodb

10489327
spring-data-commons	spring-data-jpa
the only ressource i found regarding this problem points out errors in previous spring-data-jpa versions which are marked as fixed by now or errors using wrong dependencies to the spring-data-commons jar - however i m leaving that to maven so the data-commons version should be fine

10489336

numofmiles needs to be declared as a double not an int

10489892
width	height
for a sprite sheet where the frames are of different height width you could use scaling

10489892
width	height
how you navigate through the sprite sheet is up to you meaning you are not restricted to a sprite sheet of same height width

10489904
width	height
if i add .attr transform translate + width 2 + + height 2 + to the points.append call it s somewhere in southern indiana

10489911
put	get
i m starting to look into how to make projects modulair now i get the part that you can for example make a folder and put the module-files in there which brings the following question

10489942
google-chrome	firefox
i ve recently bought a htc one x and installed mozilla firefox and the google-chrome beta..

10490018

i want to initialize this checkbox when the wpselecttasks page shows and read the value when the next button is clicked

10490106
post	get
the problem with the blobstore is that the files are saved on the server and other people can view them so my best solution is just to use a global variable to save the data from the post and then pass it to get and call get from javascript with window.open

10490111
post	get
based on your comments and post i m guessing you are trying to use the same method twice in a row so you get logged in

10490122
implements	extends
however rather than extends actionlistener as in your second example you ll probably find that putting the listener implementation into a different class even an inner class which implements actionlistener provides better logical logical separation of your code

10490168
width	height
also is there any way to call the height and width of the image

10490184
for-loop	arrays
i have a php for-loop and in each one of these it throws out i have a javascript onload function with a for-loop looking to see if that id from mysql is in the javascript cookie arrays

stdout	stderr
how can i force stdout to stderr

10490289
stdout	stderr
i want to send stdout to stderr

10490289
stdout	stderr
i was expecting following example to redirect stdout to stderr and that tmp test would would contain the output and error for the command

10490289
stdout	stderr
but instead it appears that stdout is never redirected to stderr and thus tmp test only contains the error from the command

10490289
freebsd	centos
i have tried the above example on centos unbuntu freebsd and macosx

10490295
client-side	server-side
if getting these in sync is an issue make the client-side timer shorter than the server-side one

i found a discussion here but trying this i get a typeerror nonetype object is not iterable

10490388
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	webkit	gecko
browser rendering engines like webkit safari google-chrome or gecko firefox are opensource

10490430
calloc	malloc
the added benefit here is since you calloc ed instead of malloc ing your array all values are zero initially so in this case once you are done copying the data at len-nlcount through to len will all be zero ie 0 so it is automatically null-terminated like a string would be anyways

10490466
scheme	racket
racket and more generally scheme provides a port datatype that allows you to get sequential access to a file or stream

inherited	subclassing
i m wondering if it s possible to have a method on an object but prevent that method from being inherited by classes that subclassing it

10490746
inherited	subclassing
uitableviewcontroller inherited from uiviewcontroller so if you want to be able to call your custom method from both you can write a category on uiviewcontroller and then call methods from that category in any subclassing of either uiviewcontroller or uitableviewcontroller

10490790
google-chrome	firefox
the benefit here for filtering is that this you means can leave your data on disk a .leveldb in google-chrome and .sqlite database for firefox and filter out unnecessary records either as a pre-filter step or filter in itself

10490791
int	chars
the stack array must be an int as the pid can be larger than a chars variable can fit my pid was 25689

10490797
hide	show
you can show or hide elements by using

10490812
imagemagick	libtiff
there is imagemagick which does handle tiff images you can pull the metadata using the framework it uses libtiff underneath using this you should be able to pull the metadata tags using calls to tiffgetfield like ed s

10490820
google-chrome	firefox
decoding from google-chrome firefox is fine but i m consistently having a problem sending data from the server to the client google-chrome 18 websockets 13

10490828
stdout	stderr
that first redirects stdout to stderr whatever it was initially -- probably the terminal and then redirects stderr to tmp test

10490828
stdout	stderr
so stdout will be left pointing at whatever stderr was originally pointed at and not at the file

10490828
stdout	stderr
redirect stderr to the file first and then redirect stdout to the same place

10490851
google-chrome	firefox
currently google-chrome and ie do display a multiline text in span element but firefox doesn t it just concatenates several lines into 1

do subclassing inherited private fields

10491002
inherited	subclassing
says that a subclassing does not inherited the private members of its parent class.

10491002
accessor	superclass	inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
also my computer science book baron s ap computer science a has the correct answer to a question that says that the subclassing inherited all the private instance variables and public accessor methods from the superclass .

10491017
google-chrome	firefox
interestingly google-chrome matches firefox when you use the white-space pre-wrap style.

10491017
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome with white-space style

10491021
accessor	superclass	superclass	subclassing
remember that the accessor runs in the context of the superclass and so the accessor will be able to see the member that s hidden from the subclassing

10491021
inherited	subclassing
the subclassing inherited the private members in the sense that they are actually there inside instances of the subclassing so they ll take up memory etc. but the subclassing will be unable to directly access them

10491029
button	checkbox
i have a number of checkbox that i want to handle them as toggle button

10491029
button	checkbox

button	checkbox
now i have added another gridview column of hidden checkbox which i want to use for passing the toggled button instances back to the code behind on another button click event

10491041

10491050
inherited	subclassing
nevertheless a private field is never inherited by a subclassing

10491074
webclient	webrequest
you should simply use the webclient or webrequest classes

10491124

10491129
viewdidload	viewwillappear
a simple test revealed that viewwillappear is being called after viewdidload

10491146
pull	push
that is -- not only get new tags when created as usual when fetch -ing pull -ing but also prune tags no longer on a remote and also delete existing tags when someone else git push -f s a tag

many-to-one	one-to-many
now you can call one-to-many relation and you can call it many-to-one depends on your point of view

10491180
many-to-one	one-to-many
looking from criteria oint of view it s one-to-many while looking from task point of view - it s many-to-one

10492107
ostringstream	std
in c++ you can also use a std ostringstream for similar results

10492149

one should use a copy accessor when the setter parameter may be mutable but you can t have the internal state of a properties changing without warning

10495414
accessor	properties	getter	setter
non-atomic non-atomic offers thread-safety whereas default atomic doesn t but the read writes of atomic are thread safe it uses an object level lock that ensure serialization of read writes.also the value returned from the getter or set via the setter is always fully retrieved or set regardless of what other threads are executing concurrently.if you specify strong copy or retain and do not specify nonatomic then in a reference-counted environment a synthesized get accessor for an object properties uses a lock and retains and autoreleases the returned value

a problem is np-hard if an oracle for it would make solving np-complete problems easy solvable in polynomial time

10495552
np-hard	np-complete
for example obviously every oracle that solves the halting problem can also solve an np-complete problem so every turing-complete problem is also np-hard in the sense that a fast oracle for it would make solving np-complete problems a breeze

you cannot clip the background in css if the sprite is tight other option would be to add a span next to the input box and set the background to the sprite and the height and width correctly then use the background position to get the correct image once this is done you can then position the span using a minus left value to pull it to the left over the text box hope this helps

onclick	onmouseup
my problem is that for such design to take place i d have to let dynamically-attached onmouseup event handlers stop event propagation to the pre-existent onclick events on those controls
