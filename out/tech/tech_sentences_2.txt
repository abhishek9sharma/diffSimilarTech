note that this will also include the .svn directories which is kind of a pain but you can always pipe the output through a grep -v .svn that will strip out these lines possibly with some additional magic to take out anything underneath such a .svn-containing line in the hierarchy using sed or a procedural shell-script loop or similar
100021
in contrast the worst i ve ever worked with are boost and the c++ stl
100035
make that encapsulation public or protected or private that choice of information hiding is still to be made
100037
note that the magic behaviour that initalised gains by having the metaclass init_attributes is not passed onto a subclass of initalised
100037
here is an even more concrete example showing how you can subclass type to make a metaclass that performs an action when the class is created
100047
the ability to use javascript frameworks like jquery to manipulate the dom
100049
i have been using spring mvc and it is good but wicket has a neat features that spring mvc has not server-side state management and encapsulation rich component model no unnecessary xml mapping files - just pure java and html
100056
perl ruby php etc all have distribution mechanisms built into the language to consume such libraries
100064
however you should be able to use getc getchar from tango.stdc.stdio - i changed the faq you mention to reflect this
100076
at the end of the day you will still want to install ff ie6-8 opera and safari chrome for testing manually
100125
in fact it might be better to change your insert function so that it performs a sorted insertion that checks for duplicates
100125
then you always have sorted lists that are free of duplicates and merging them is a trivial matter
100146
to create your own metaclass in python you really just want to subclass type
100150
c++ didn t need a separate language concept of interface because any class might be used as an interface -- just define a set of methods in it make no implementation call it like iexecutable and use
100155
so are ibm s websphere offerings
100161
i m primarily using pydev aptana and subclipse very little java development
100188
we used tex miktex and it was perfect because
100198
this isn t as simple as just checking whether the file name contains any of system.io.path.getinvalidfilenamechars as mentioned in a couple of other answers already
100198
for example what if somebody enters a name that contains no invalid chars but is 300 characters long greater than max_path - this won t work with any of the .net file apis and only has limited support in the rest of windows using the
100200
that will recursively search the current directory for symlinks to particular folder
100209
i have an owl ontology and i am using pellet to do reasoning over it
100228
i tried doing the following but xmlspy complains that the content model contains the elements element name dateconstant and element name dateconstant which cannot be uniquely determined.
100290
can somebody in so please provide me with a list of resources about enterprise mashups and technologies related to sharepoint platform
100315
example i m writing code that updates a variable and i need to make absolutely sure that the gui changes to reflect the change the easiest way is to add an accessor method aka a setter which is called instead of updating data is updated
100315
from experience the only times you d want to make a member variable public and leave out getter and setter methods is if you want to make it absolutely clear that changing it will have no side effects
100326
the team got rid of spring in favor of guice but that was more like a political change at least from my point of view and other developers i ve talked to
100350
mono.gendarme similar to fxcop but with an opensource licence based on mono.cecil
100350
smokey similar to fxcop and gendarme based on mono.cecil
100365
that is until i tried to use some of the model s associations and functions
100369
this constructor should be private if your class is sealed otherwise it should be protected to allow access to derived classes
100380
and i also found both getc and getchar is also line buffered in my development environment so it could not achieve what i wish i could do
100394
for cyclomatic complexity you can try this perl program or this article which introduces a python program to do the same
100426
if this is not what you re asking for and the model and its associations actually do exist but cake seems to be unable to find them you ll have to triple check the names of all models and their class names in both the actual model definition and in the association definitions
100450
instead of passing it via a query string you should create a hidden form field with its value and then post to your 2nd page which can then grab the posted value and it will be hidden from the user
100477
add n to the end of the definition to make studio show you the next n items as well
100480
prefered languages c++ python
100520
java already eases the debugging process a lot by giving you the line number and full stack trace
100532
users should login through webapp2 which will call webapp1 securely for authentication
100555
as well as the standard case of calling a virtual function from the constructor or destructor of an object with pure virtual functions you can also get a pure virtual function call on msvc at least if you call a virtual function after the object has been destroyed
100596
a rather comprehensive site explaining the difficulties and solutions involved in using a dll written in c c++ and the conversion of the .h header file to delphi pascal was posted to a mailing list i was on recently so i thought i d share it and invite others to post other useful resources for this whether they be links conversion tools or book paper titles
100634
there is no sequence point between the evaluations of function arguments so f test test++ is undefined behaviour test is being read for one argument and modified for the other
100659
with separate lines you have the opportunity to add a comment on each line describing the use of the variable if it isn t clear from its name
100698
if your old site is vbscript it s probably easier to go with vb.net
100700
sendmessage will return with whatever value is returned from the wndproc that handles the message s_maxgettaskinterface
100708
keeping in mind that you shouldn t imho port directly asp to asp.net since you d loose much of the features in .net this would include a fair amount of rewrite anyway
100710
there are other automation tools like ranorex i didn t tested it you can even use some scripting language lua python with a library to send messages wm_xxx and another to call winapi.
100738
if this is in vb6 vbscript etc i would first look towards vb.net
100740
a quadtree is best for when you use a height map for terrain etc
100741
since you ve done vbscript migration to vb.net is more natural - you can learn the new syntax then move onto the framework and bcl when you are familiar with those you can learn the c# syntax as weel - being bi-lingual is always good
100758
the most important factor in choosing a secure payment clearance service the people who will connect to the banking networks and clear the money for you - will refer to them as spcs is how many widgets will you be selling at what cost
100758
simply put if you buy something on a credit card your card provider is liable for ensure you get what you paid for broadly speaking in most countries does not constitute legal advice etc. and if you have a problem with your purchase they will refund you very quickly and then will go and chase the person that you paid
100802
opera and ie these days treat getyear as getyear was originally specified for dates before 2000 but will treat it as getfullyear for dates after 2000 while webkit and firefox stick with the old behavior
100820
i managed to get a selection of rowkey objects but can t find out how to get the original objects i put in back
100838
i wrote basics for years ms-basic gw-basic quick-basic visual basic vbscript and it was very difficult to use vb.net because i always try to write things as i used to do with vb6 or vbscript
100869
on a good tcp ip stack it should not be able to guess the sequence numbers so it can t keep up with the expected conversation
100875
the difference is that the # symbol specifies a data binding directive that is resolved at data binding time for example when you call page.databind and the sign specifies an evaluation expression just evaluates and prints to the html output when that line is processed
100879
spawn command start remote login program telnet ssh netcat etc
100890
one line number is 1222 from memory and the other is a few lines earlier
100919
on the server-side we have asp.net webforms or asp.net mvc
100928
however creating your own http module to do something similar is of course trivial -- the onbeginrequest handler could look as follows in this case implementation for a httphandler shown but in a httpmodule the idea is exactly the same
100930
the populartags element exists in the html document that calls the function
100930
code for mozilla firefox opera etc
100937
they are most probably much less mature than any common lisp or scheme implementation but there are lisp dialects for .net l# and dotlisp
100971
i would invest in profiling software to trace down the actual cause of the problem
100971
on linux valgrind which contains cachegrind callgrind + kcachegrind can make working out where all the heavy function calls are going on
100976
if a user clicks on a https link i can block that load in onstarturi of nsiuricontentlistener.but if the user types in say orkut.com i wont know in onstarturi whether its a http url or a https one whether it will use ssl or not
100978
as for spring i would seriously check if guice is a viable alternative and then try to show how spring guice makes development better and easier
101033
i want to create a stored procedure with one argument which will return different sets of records depending on the argument
101048
if that contains non-sequential elements as well you might be facing a problem where the xslt transformation takes place before the objects xml and xsl are fully loaded
101049
there is nothing wrong with this code and you can still use it with dependency injection frameworks like spring and guice
101065
for instance javascript manipulates dom objects provided by the browser php operates enormous library of c-based functions and so on
101066
i have set up another question for any task that takes more than a minute or two and so ought to be scheduled into a deployment process
101071
h for width height
101083
whereas javascript ruby python perl etc
101089
as you can see fn1 and fn2 each generate their own independent sequence of numbers
101130
i mean you can t really say something like python or ruby are scripting languages in this day and age you even have stuff like ironpython and jit-your-favorite-language the difference has been blurred even more
101169
you can validate that and much more by using an xml schema language like xsd
101194
when discussing lisp these days it is commonly assumed to be common lisp the language standardized by ansi x3j13 see the hyperspec and practical common lisp for a good textbook with implementations such as gnu clisp sbcl cmucl allegrocl and many others
101239
row and col at first glance this seems more succinct than row_num and col_num and just as descriptive
101239
irow and icol this conveys extra information since i can mean it s a loop counter while row and col tell you what it s counting
101239
reads as the row num ber is less than the max imum number of col umn s
101239
at best reads as the integer loop counter for the row is less than the max imum number of col umn s
101268
default argument gotchas dangers of mutable default arguments

this process always has pid of 1 and controls spawns all other processes in your unix according to the rules in etc init.d
101293
there are other ways to get the correct resources out of a jar to make sure someone didn t put a duplicate resource on the classpath
101294
i am more curious about whether there is a demand and i am wondering since the oses we use most today linux windows mac os x free bsd were actually written more than 20 years ago and i am being generous - i mean dual and quad cores did not exist back then buses were much slower hardware was much more expensive etc ... i was just curious with the new technology if we would do anything differently
101318
if you are interested in user functionality maybe you should look into participating in existing desktop environment projects such as gnome kde or something
101318
if you are interested in kernel-level functionality either try hacking on a bsd derivate or on linux or try creating your own system -- but don t think too much about the user functionality then
101338
is it valid to have a choice or group elements when defining an xml schema xsd
101343
so i would look into pykde pygtk pyqt or python + opengl there are certainly some tutorials on the net i know of some czech ones but that won t help you
101361
to be less flippant there is generally a tradeoff when generating random numbers between how hard it is and how predictable the next one in the sequence is once you ve seen a few
101373
it is very easy to map user input to a database xml or csv file
101381
that s one reason why going from hex to binary is much easier than from decimal to binary
101406
declaring a parameter as a reference just tells the compiler to use the input variable memory space instead of allocating a new memory space during the method call
101428
kernal operating system virtual server instance linux windows server windows home ubuntu aix zseries os 390 et al

for web sites i use supergenpass which derives a site-specific password from a master password and the domain name using a hash function based on md5
101445
rdbms postgresql is a free relational database with a track record stretching back a couple of decades
101461
most languages ruby included allow number literals to be written in at least three bases decimal octal and hexadecimal
101499
of course don t tell anyone which lottery and which draw and put those numbers through a suitable mangle to get the range you want
101507
i would first try to figure out why your application is crashing on https ssl connections
101673
the best real alternative i have at the moment is to call a vba form from my delphi add-in but that s far from ideal
101673
if there is one it s not easy to find i ve been searching pretty hard and i ve not been able to find a drop-in refedit replacement for delphi vb6 or .net
101673
i don t know of a way to do that by manipulating the excel object model through vba delphi or whatever
101701
you will not lose your password for site a if your password for site b gets in the wrong hands due to an evil admin wlan sniffing or site compromise for example yet you will only have to remember a single password
101707
make sure that asp.net has permissions it needs to things like the .net framework folders the iis metabase etc
101770
the problem as someone pointed out is the visual basic guys - you know people that came from classic asp experience and never seen any unit testing and or mvc-based java ruby php development
101770
people who came from java ruby php shops who already used to mvc apps will certainly adapt ms mvc framework
101777
but is there any pre-set variable that contains the first or second condition of the current if
101789
if disposable object is passed to other methods including calling its members when this is implicitly passed the tool should analyse if dispose is not called within or that object is not stored somewhere for later disposal
101798
we set up an account and got an api key
101819
i have a setting with ssh no telnet so i can t test if your problem is telnet related but running the following script logs me successively to the different machines asking for a password
101834
i ve worked on a variety of systems as a programmer some with oracle some with mysql
101905
the obvious upper bound is max heap size divided by the minimum amount of memory required to service a request but even that is hard to measure in an environment with a garbage collector.
101923
its very very robust oracle db will do virtually everything it can before breaking your data i ve had mysql servers do really weird things when they run out of disk space oracle will just halt all transactions and eventually shutdown if it can t write the files it needs
101923
for a small database i d seriously recommend oracle xe well before mysql
101923
mysql has its uses many many people have shown that you can build great things with it but its far behind oracle and sql server and db2 in terms of features.
101927
for small-medium look at mysql or postgresql
101934
i have a project that sends data 10m rows 1.2gb of data to three different databases 2 oracle and 1 mysql
101934
if you re in a place that already uses oracle for other projects adding on one new database shouldn t be too much of a problem but if you re thinking of setting up a new database server and don t have anything in place already mysql will save you the money
101941
create a simple perl php python ruby script that serves a bunch of javascript files based on the request
101969
using this trace method not only would i have to keep adding and removing keywords from in front of variables as i worked on different bugs but i don t think that it would be any real improvement over just adding good logging debugging messaging which is much easier to remove or disable when pushed to production
101988
if every developer had written code for fx safari and opera i think ie had to start following the rules sooner than with version 8
101989
the entity bean would then contain the xml marshalling and unmarshalling features found in jaxb
102018
if you re doing any serious work with latex you ll find make very handy because of the need to re-interpret .tex files several times when using bibtex or tables of contents
102022
ant nant and msbuild are supposedly the modern alternatives but plain-old-make is still used extensively in environments that don t use java or .net
102041
and while more people may be using msbuild ant nant and others tools these days they are essentially just make with a different file syntax
102059
with previous versions of flash entering the full screen mode increased the height and width of the stage to the dimensions of the screen
102059
now that hardware scaling has arrived the height and width are set to the dimensions of the video plus borders if the aspect ratio is different
102093
i wrote a small php application several months ago that uses the wordpress xmlrpc library to synchronize two separate wordpress blogs
102094
there are different cases depending on whether you installed mysql with the official binary installer using macports or using homebrew
102261
firebug works great in firefox which isn t having this problem nor is safari so i m hoping someone might spot something obviously wrong with the way my code will play with ie

use cruisecontrol or cruisecontrol.net to automatically label at a fixed interval nightly or every 15 minutes
102462
lots of good answers here about learning ajax or javascript dom as a standalone entity but the cgi ajax module from cpan is the quickest easiest way to set yourself up to have a webpage which uses ajax to update a page on-the-fly using a perl backend
102462
it requires no knowledge of dom xml json or any language other than perl a little html and the barest hint of javascript
102471
title case in vb.net can be achieved by an old vb6 fxn

i believe you ll need to add the usercontrol to the placeholder during the init phase of the page life cycle in order to get the viewstate to be filled in by the load phase to read those values
102521
what is the best way to add subtract and traverse quarters
102544
i found something that showed me how to do this with perl and ported it over to ruby
102548
you can use the almighty exiftool perl utility which handles nearly every known set of tags both standard exif iptc adobe s xmp etc and proprietary ones
102580
shutdown -r -t 0 - restart
102587
as an example i have a simple login page with the standard username and password text boxes and the log in button and a remember me checkbox with a i can t remember my username and or password hyperlink
102640
so essentially does margin collapsing occur when you don t set any margin or padding or border to a given div element
102643
i would use aes for the bulk data encryption and rsa for encrypting the aes key
102657
edit - i added a scriptmanager control and wrapped the buttons in an updatepanel however now i m receiving the following error
102670
i recommend hosting a cgi-bin which looks up the ip-address of a hostname and access that via javascript
102684
the processor natively executes 32-bit x86 code
102686
ctrl + r show hide results pane
102690
then we can make two instances of some reference type which are actually equal because of the overloaded gethashcode and equals
102690
for complicated dictionary keys you must override equals and gethashcode correctly
102716
you get a root page via a http get parse it to find urls and put them on a queue unless they ve been parsed already so you need a global record of pages you have already parsed
102717
however the future is with gxt as it s native gwt and actually developed by the company that made extjs
102736
the expression collapsing margins means that adjoining margins no non-empty content padding or border areas or clearance separate them of two or more boxes which may be next to one another or nested combine to form a single margin.
102744
f# language you could reference the fsharp.core.dll that contains a set of generic immutable
102747
strong tool support exists for creating manifest files a core ant task for example or the maven jar plugin
102755
if you don t set any margins then there won t be any margins to collapse
102757
internal field in the system.object class to generate the hash value
102764
the trick is not only to generate all possible letter combinations that match a given number but to select the letter sequence that is most easy to remember
102788
a hashing function md5 sha1 crypt etc is not suitable as i would like to be able to decrypt the information as well
102832
how do i induce seam jsf to use get and include the query expression as a parameter rather than post the default
102836
don t override gethashcode and equals on mutable classes only override it on immutable classes or structures else if you modify a object used as key the hash table won t function properly anymore you won t be able to retrieve the value associated to the key after the key object was modified
102862
on the mac or nix you can use command line or gui versions of emacs or vim
102920
for example if your application server runs on linux unix as root then make the password properties file owned by root with 400 -r-------- permissions
102924
that is also how it is done behind the scenes when the mxml in your example is transformed to actionscript before being compiled
102924
...except that the code generated by the mxml to actionscript conversion is longer as it has to be more general
102997
cruise control will be automatically pulling the source from visual source safe ok it isn t subversion but we can deal compiling it and then running it through fxcop nunit ncover and last but not lease simian
103005
table one contains a set of data that uses an id for an unique identifier
103009
html lets you set a tfoot element which will sit at the bottom of any data you have therefore you could just set the total separately from the person objects and output it on the page as-is without any computation on the jsp page
103053
but i definately now make sure sites i work on render well in chrome as well as firefox latest versions of ie safari konquerer and opera
103117
assuming that you have a safe way of sharing a key whether rsa encryption of it retrieval over an ssh or https link or callling the other developer on a secured phone line any of the major modern encryptions like aes as mentioned by ed haber would be suitable
103117

note i ve set this up for the more usual 0-based but given you an optional parameter to start at 1 or any other integer
103240
i have a table in a rdlc report which is utilized as a subreport and the first column of this table is a static string
103258
it allows the select command to complete without having to wait - usually other transactions to finish
103290
wpf and silverlight look promising for this purpose but so far haven t been set up for game integration
103292
python perl ruby powershell are great supplements to c# vb.net
103292
if your boss hands you a text file and says insert it into the database once or twice then any of perl python ruby i m not sure about powershell but i imagine it is not that much more difficult should be fine to parse it
103292
ms in the future has plans to use powershell a lot more so it is probably easier to justify powershell then say python perl ruby
103292
it is much harder to argue learning perl ruby python in a microsoft shop

in any case as you probably know terracotta gives you the ability to express concurrency across the cluster the same way you do in a single jvm by using pojo synchronized wait notify or by using any of the java.util.concurrent primitives such as reentrantreadwritelock cyclicbarrier atomiclong futuretask and so on

lazy loading is the big gotcha in mvc applications that use hibernate for their persistence framework
103521
there are good resources out there such as applied cryptography by bruce schneier and security engineering by ross anderson available for free online
103564
one of the other ways i thought of solving it was to use a type id integer primitive instead and use a bitmask to represent categories of the subclasses and then just do a bit mask comparison of the subclasses type id to a constant mask representing the category
103591
doing some tests if you connect to a database even with a slow dynamic language like perl and perform some row by row operation on a dataset the speed will still be much greater than a cursor in the database

given an unsigned int 0 is 0 or 360 degrees and the max 32 bit unsigned integer 0xffffffff is the biggest value just below 360 degrees
103723
the problem is this - in order to have add a flexbuilder project to the library path for an application it must be a library project
103768
if you only allow https you can take the password out of the document completely and put it into an http basic authentication header instead
103768
http basic authentication is simple widely supported and will be much easier for you and your partners to implement than ssl client certificates
103813
normally between postbacks information like the value of a label is contained in the viewstate but if you change pages that viewstate is lost because it is was being stored in a hidden field on the page
103869
after getting comfortable with the way svn works then you can get into distributed version control systems like git bazaar or mercurial but i ve seen enough professional developers have problems wrapping their heads around the basics of version control branching merging etc that i d get comfortable with that first before moving to distributed systems
103895
even though the body of the loop is at the start of the listcomp the order of nested loops and if clauses is still the same as when you would write the loop out
103910
the union and having statements tend to be the most overlooked part of standard sql but they can solve a lot of tricky issues that otherwise require procedural code
103928
so if your java server has a point where it can listen to incoming requests and process xml or json your flash client can just make the request to that url
103960
your best bet if you really need more than 1.2g of memory for your java app is to look at 64 bit windows or linux or osx
103979
also if you have one main window and set its icon properly as long as you use that main window as the parent for any dialog classes they will inherit the icon
103979
any new frames need to have the icon set on them though

my current approach uses a map of all tuple field values as keys for lists of each tuple using that value
104113
if you use an external host make frequent backups of the repository that you keep control of
104126
if you set the width or height of the decoratorpanel you need to set the height and width of the middlecenter cell to 100 so that the middlecenter cell takes up all of the available space
104126
if you do not set the width and height of the decoratorpanel it will wrap its contents tightly
104148
the main culprits in insert slow downs are indexes constraints and oninsert triggers
104151
those elements of b which are also in a will have duplicates and the other elements won t
104151
if these tuples can stay sorted then the sorting cost is only incurred once
104227
it looks like the the actual data for the image is stored by the tcl tk interpreter and not accessible from within lisp
104227
of course you could simply render each pixel individually on a canvas object but i don t think you would get very good performance doing that the canvas widget gets a bit slow once you are trying to display more than a few thousand different things on it
104251
this means that while its okay to read from a hashmap in a multithreaded situation i d definitely use a concurrenthashmap if there were multiple writes
104260
xml - xsd - vb
104264
all the previous responses are great answers - here s one gottcha with cassini that might require iis on the destkop
104264
cassini runs in the context of the developer not as the iis user iusr_ iwam or in winxp x64 the w3wp process
104264
when you move to the server iis something that you would have had access to in cassini doesn t work the same
104292
currently my working directory is temp builddefinitionpath but now i don t know what wildcards are available to specify a different folder
104295
preg_match will store everything he captures in the var passed as third param here out
104360
once done flex will create a generated directory in your source folder and inside you ll find all teh temporary as files that were used during compilation
104394
but i guess unix linux whateveros have the same gizmo functions
104394
anyway in unix linux they have the everything is a file
104395
i need some info on how to use margins and how exactly padding works
104395
for example should i put a line to occupy the whole width of the page no matter what resolution is used to display the web page letting just a small border on each side how could i achieve this
104398
be warned that even in single-threaded code replacing a concurrenthashmap with a hashmap may not be safe
104398
this answer is intended to point out that even aside from concurrency issues there is at least one api difference between concurrenthashmap and hashmap which could scupper even a single-threaded program which replaced one with the other.
104401
basically an element consists of content surrounded by its padding then the border then the margin
104403
i m currently needing to be able to read java and c++ but i can t really program in them and i ve hacked python as well
104423
i already did that for a legacy database using enterprise architect
104462
btw - the sequence this code genreates repeats after 4.61169e+18 numbers
104473
and sadly since console is final you can t extend it to create a a wrapper around system.in and system.out that does it either
104510
the c and jni code can allocate memory as well malloc free new etc which is outside of the vm s 256m
104520
i can do the validation in 1 line of code in asp.net which requires like 10-20 lines of code in wpf
104562
to expand on nils answer yes it will throw but what happens when it throws is sometimes confusing in the spec
104563
you can define css at three levels externally embedded in the document inside a style tag or inline on the element
104569
typing a semicolon anywhere on the line will place it at this lines end as in word openoffice backspace if you d like to have it in the original place
104599
if the two strings it is comparing are the same at the beginning and end of the string are the same and the middle part that differs is an integer then compare based on the numeric values of those integers
104617
i m using udp not tcp at this time
104618
i ve been trying to get into f# on and off for a while but i keep getting put off
104620
i ve seen a litany of them for sql server a few for mysql and oracle but nothing that supports sql anywhere correctly
104622
if you haven t already try hp openview trial version and apart of using snmp it also uses arp tables to figure out your topology
104627
add a preprocessing step that normalises your input xml into a particular order and then use
104699
it s safe to access the map but in general it s not guaranteed that all threads will see exactly the same state and thus values of the hashmap
104727
scp will do the job but there is one wrinkle the connection to the second remote destination will use the configuration on the first remote destination so if you use .ssh config on the local environment and you expect rsa and dsa keys to work you have to forward your agent to the first remote host
104749
i think you may be able to install the normal 32-bit mdac but it will install to the x86 folder
104770
you can make more than one movieclip dragging at once using events mousedown mousemove and mouseup
104772
in .net world you could create a custom xmlresolver so that document dir c foo would return the list of files in the c foo directory in an arbitrary format you wish
104813
this is used in the sh ksh bash shell interpreters within the if while until commands to check conditions
104855
any variable beginning with an underscore is a private member of the class that contains this code

ffmpeg reorders the packets so that the dts of the packet being processed by avcodec_decode_video will always be the same as the pts of the frame it returns
104883
if the packet s pts is 2 frames later than its dts then avcodec_decode_video will delay the frame and not return it until i provide 2 more packets
104890
i read an article by rocky lhotka .net legend inventor of csla etc where he mentioned almost in passing that last year he felt very terribly overwheled by the rate of change
104915
many web based email services dont provide any real security either and even if they offer ssl its often not default and you are still relying on the weakness of the email password to protect the user which in turn has a reset mechanism most the time
104939
deletepersoncommand will have the execute and in the execute can check attribute that will be passed by getter setter previously the call of the execute
104948
you ll need to associate the parameters with the command object either by constructor or setter injection or equivalent
104952
it would be nice if the code coverage tool compensated for this i suppose by scanning the source and matching it up with the linker output but i didn t find anything to suggest it has a special mode to be turned on
104960
edit i d like to be free to choose from postgresql mysql and sqlite as far as the actual databases go
104966
make sure all of your passwords are out of source control if you have database.yml mail.yml if you use yaml_mail_config or other sensitive files in source control get them out of there replace them with database.yml.example and put them in the shared folder on your server
104986
you have to create a subclass that implements the abstract methods with empty methods but none of the concrete ones
105005
to disable editing on any cell you need to override the iscelleditable int row int col method
105010
a novice but competent dba should be able to secure mysql much more easily than oracle just because oracle is inherently more complex
105010
of course oracle has the enterprise monitoring tools beyond what mysql currently features as far as i ve seen but the dba needs to be able use them to be effective
105082
it also supports many languages java c# c python actionscript and has an excellent book and a very good website that should be able to get you up and running in no time
105212
suppose i have a directory dir inside which there are 3 symlinks to other directories
105217
you can select the member list given the stored order by using an inner join
105246
it s important to note that inline elements cannot be assigned their own width height or vertical whitespace margin padding top bottom
105266
javascript looking for mouse movement keyboard activity and scrolling
105287
although several ci tools such as teamcity have better support for nunit probably would change as mstest becomes more popular
105287
in my current project we use both and the only big diffrence we found is that mstest always runs as a 32bit while nunit runs as either 32bit or 64bit test which only matters if your code uses native code that is 32 64 dependant
105303
another disadvantage i ve run into is on a forms authenticated website using custom iprincipal iidentity
105303
check this blog post for more.the headache on this made me drop cassini and stick with iis
105352
it s flexable like ant while leveraging maven s dependency system
105368
an inline element does not define a box that s why you cannot set its width and height it will be appended to other inline elements in the current block
105380
the paramaters to this method include the current value as well as the cell coordinates a link back to the table and wether or not the cell is selected
105391
that means that if your project depends on jar a and a depends on jar b jar b will automatically be bundled with your war even though you don t explicitly list it as a dependency in your build config
105391
also i ll say from a professional development standpoint it makes sense to learn maven since in my experience maven has overtaken ant as the de jure build tool of choice both in open source and proprietary java projects
105395
i started with the cygwin.bat batch file that launches the cygwin bash shell and modified it like so
105395
oh yeah when i created the .bat file in a bash shell in cygwin i noticed i had to actually chmod +x test.bat before i could launch it with a double-click
105481
you can set any attribute on the view class in a similar way
105507
you ve allocated arr in foo but that pointers value is stored in the call stack
105514
even better would be to inject the appropriate values for a given environment into the configuration during the build process assuming your build process has some kind of macro-replacement functionality
105514
this way you can create a targeted build for a given environment and not have to change the configuration every time you do a build for a different environment
105520
most likely the performance difference is either zero or so small it doesn t matter it s just a matter of preference
105532
i don t think they have a place in the constructor or ms should got back and refactor them to allow you to use them in a private fasion
105532
with object initializers you allow the values passed into the constructor to be modifiable
105542
first install haml as a gem in bundler by adding this to your gemfile

asa graphics designer i ve used flash on and off over the last few years and silverlight and its big brother wpf over the last 1.5 years

i created an online programming contest web app called codefire on xampp later i had to switch to wamp where none of the php scripts worked properly.
105556
is there a simple way to generate sql schema using the xsd file describing these xml documents
105570
maven can also help you in integration tests on tomcat if you have some since you can start stop or deploy a war using the cargo plugin
105579
any of these setups can be stable robust and secure if its properly set up
105611
if so you can write your own logging wrapper class that propagates log messages sent to it to several targets like the trace stack and internal memory so that you can access the log from within the app and send it to a server when the user agrees to send a bug report
105611
this sort of a change of course means that you d have to translate all trace commands in your code into calls to the logging system but that can be easily achieved with a regex search replace
105625
if you ve only done groovy so far you ll be surprised how well documented swing and the rest of the java api is and how well everything is integrated
105647
in fact i d suggest using a different configuration file for each environment
105710
i ve been looking at scala which compiles to the jvm and can use the java libraries and f# which is .net but these are young and have some inefficiencies
105710
is it possible to build a web service using haskell ml or any of the other more traditional functional languages or would it be better to go with scala or f#
105725
while solutions in interpreted languages like perl php ruby etc might be easy.
105737
the concept you are missing here is that for every calloc there must be a free
105737
and that free must be applied to the pointer passed back from calloc

if you have solid proof using the query plan that the query can t be executed any faster than that then you should increase the timeout there s no other way to keep the connection that s the purpose of the timeout to terminate the connection if the query doesn t complete in that time frame

for any given page n you ll may want to walk up to the parent of n and its parent and so on recursively to build a list of nodes back up to the root of page tree
105955
the abstract syntax tree nodes naturally lend themselves to recursion

the 2 flavors are windows sharepoint services wss and microsoft office sharepoint server moss
105981
while moss only extends upon the wss it does add a large amount of functionality that can be very important and useful to a business
105981
some of the more important features available in moss and not in wss are records management document retention and auditing policies browser based forms infopath forms without installing infopath on client machine and some of the business intelligence capabilities
105981
easy to read list of features not in wss that moss has

the compiler is free to read the field this.done just once and reuse the cached value in each execution of the loop
106018
put your value into a byte array then getstring to get the c# native string for the character
106031
this is easy in languages like smalltalk or python that support lambdas and closures but is still doable in java with a bit of imagination
106045
currently the communication is over unix domain sockets linux is the expected server platform
106052
if you add a calculated field to a piviot table and make the formula simply be the name of the field you need a duplicate of that allows you to use the same field twice the calculated field does have to be a value field
106155
however there is an argument to be made that you should specify a margin for each one of those elements and zero it out if you don t want to apply it since browsers all handle margins differently
106168
also if you lack a plugin such as testdriven.net you cannot debug your nunit or mbunit xunit etc. unit tests within the visual studio environment as you can with the microsoft vs testing framework which is built in
106252
if by logging you mean system.out.println or system.err.println and if you re sure that your test really doesn t need the logs then you can redirect stdout and stderr programmatically
106281
if they already know actionscript then use flash if they know c# vb.net javascript ruby or python then use silverlight
106286
remember when two elements are vertically adjacent and they don t have a border or padding between them their margins collapse
106318
in sql on it s own it would probably need to be a big stored procedure but if you read all the records out to the scripting language of your choice you can easily loop over them and split each out into arrays hashes
106331
you might find that depending on how fast your new data is coming in doing the trimming and conversion to numeric on the database side is plenty fast enough once what you re comparing to is properly formatted but if possible you would be better off writing an import utility in a .net language that would take care of these formatting issues before hitting the database
106340
visualsvn - svn integration
106365
i also like testdriven.net because it integrates nunit for unit testing ncover for code coverage and reflector for disassembling the .net framework
106405
ideally i d like to only have to support one version of the gnu autotools but i get the impression that i m really going to end up having to have a copy of every version lying around
106428
this approach would be similar to using json or xml but is more performant since hessian is a binary protocol
106443
i would recommend lucene - its free its fast it is is pretty easy to set up a powerful index on any content for anyone with programming experience
106469
in c++ you simply specify a modifier before the base class of private public or protected
106485
increases the productivity a lot and i am keyboard freak who hates using mouse
106497
is your pkg-config a cygwin app
106553
if you were to use a fifo queue for the semaphore the kernel would have to traverse the queue of tasks waiting for the mutex to find the one with the highest priority
106581
some vendors supply their own ide s for development are these a necessity or can we or is it possible to standardise on a gnu toolchain type build process
106599
i ve found problems using the datacontract json and xml serializers
106599
most of these errors seem to center around serialization of lists dictionaries xml serializable generic dictionary
106610
the simplest thing to do is mark your objects with the serializable attribute and then use a binary formatter to handle the serialization
106620
soap serialization worked well for me even for objects not marked with serializable
106627
are you forced to use nsarray and nsmutablearray for data structures
106628
otherwise they should just be used to handle the unexpected and exit gracefully while capturing as much information as possible to help with debugging
106668
i ve used poderosa a .net terminal app to monitor logs on multiple linux solaris servers
106668
i m wondering what other users do to simultaneously monitor several logs in real-time as in tail -f logfile

if encoding and or errors are given unicode will decode the
106735
if you don t mind the possibility of having duplicate results then a simple union as mariano conti demonstrated is fine
106771
and not just in java but also in c#. there are times when you need to get or set a value that is guaranteed to be an atomic operation on your given platform an int or boolean for example but do not require the overhead of thread locking
106773
i don t believe dreamhost gives you access to the configuration file for their installation of phpmyadmin
106787
basically the value of a volatile field becomes visible to all readers other threads in particular after a write operation completes on it
106826
have you considered serializing to json instead of xml
106826
in my opinion json is more human readable than xml and json.net gives the option to write nicely formatted json
106837
it also has good integration with project sprouts which is a build tool for flex and flash similar to ant however it uses ruby rake tasks and includes excellent dependency management along the lines of maven
106838
in many situations the enterprise applications needs to connect to with a number of legacy systems they are not only web pages and with the features availalble on the edition of java that kind of connectivity can be solved
106840
there should also be a hidden field to hold the form_submitted initial value of 0
106842
when i say adjust the image size i don t mean set the height and width in the html image tag
106843
simply create a class that has the appropriate width and height values set and make all tags use this class
106846
really what they are looking for is experience and understanding of the java ecosystem servlet containers jms jmx hibernate etc
106847
java ee is actually a collection of technologies and apis for the java platform designed to support enterprise applications which can generally be classed as large-scale distributed transactional and highly-available applications designed to support mission-critical business requirements
106861
it s worth noting that in firefox 3 and safari resizing an image by just changing the height and width doesn t look too bad
106862
i m interested in using it for some multi-level parallel applications mpi + threads in unix mac linux etc. environments
106915
pre-load them into javascript image objects then just reference the height and width
106925
you can get the height width of an image after the page loads via javascript info then you could resize the height of the div after loading
106942
munin and cacti provide very nice interfaces and pre-built scripts for rrdtool
106969
private protected internal public give classes variables properties and functions the least amount of visibility they need for everything to still work
106990
as some other answers have said in general go for the highest level of encapsulation as possible ie private unless you actually need internal protected public
107043
the biggest component is that if you re creating anything that s an nsobject subclass and you create it with a xxx alloc method or if you get it from another copy with xxx copy then you ve got the responsibility to match that with an associated release
107053
in functional programming languages erlang haskell ml ocaml f# etc. it s very common to have any list processing use recursion
107096
when i put the ccommandbar.insertmenubar before i create child dialogs i do not get my ok or cancel soft keys when i put that line after the creation of child dialogs the softkeys show as expected and work great
107115
you re guaranteed that either all the changes are applied if you commit or everything is scrapped if you query rollback
107131
there are two very nice browser-based vector javascript-manipulable graphics packages which together are virtually universal svg and vml
107131
svg is supported by firefox opera safari and chrome - technically only part of the specification is supported but for practical purposes you should be able to do what you need
107131
vml is microsoft s answer to svg and surprise is natively supported by ie although svg is not
107131
by the way you say that you re asking for an algorithm and i m offering technologies if that s the right term for svg vml
107149
this will position the first letter on the right edge of the paragraph then shove it left it by more or less the width of the paragraph then move both the letter and all the padding into the float s large negative margin so the paragraph fits in the margin and doesn t try to wrap around
107150
it doesn t fire the selectednodechanged since the selection has obviously not changed but then what event can i catch so i know that the selected node was clicked
107171
you can use the component key as a token in the value field of the entry in the registry table in your msi
107171
you can set the value field in the registry table to register your assembly to assmb.dll and it will get resolved to the install location of the assembly
107177
or save some bytes and convert that to decimal or hex
107188
nowadays we let the lisp runtime deal with tags without additional hardware support
107230
whether the resulting assembly can run on x86 machines running 32-bit windows versions

if you don t specify a platform the default is anycpu which indicates that the

i m not interested in php or perl or web development

in my head it s as simple as replacing a select stuff where tag buffer-overflow with select stuff where tag not in php offtopic funny-hat-friday but i ve not put together any db backed sites that get absolutely pounded on by thousands people
107279
one quick-and-easy way to see non-printing characters and whitespace is to pipe the output through cat -vet
107301
each addition or subtraction mean the subsequent prior element in the array
107321
i tried a couple utilities like joytokey and xpadder but they only recognize game controllers and the dm2 falls into the more generic usb controller category
107323
i will target chrome as soon as a stable linux and osx client is available
107349
if you look at the quicksort or mergesort algorithms you will see that they both take the approach of dividing the list to be sorted in half sorting each half using the same algorithm recursively and then recombining the two halves
107358
i don t know if this advice applies to sunos or any unix
107364
pass in a size with the desired width and a maximum height and then you can look at the height returned to fit the text
107431
instead of doing malloc followed by memset you should be using calloc which will clear the newly allocated memory for you
107446
quicksilver is awesome when integrated with parallels vmware fusion to launch windows apps too
107466
you can always use the mousedown or mouseup event and check to see if it the selected node
107510
you can then take the quaternion product which uses only simple multiplication and addition of the current rotation quaternion and incremental rotation quaternion to get a new quaternion which represents performing both rotations
107510
converting the quaternion to a rotation matrix is very straightforward uses only multiplication and addition when you want to display the model in its rotated state using traditional graphics api s
107544
did you see how a bunch of lines suddenly disappeared and was replaced with just one single line
107552
we have played a bit with vmware virtualpc virtualbox etc creating a virtual build server but we came across a lot of issues when we tried to copy it for others to use having to reconfigure every new copy of the vm

one of its functions is to generate a changelog entry from your local diff currently supporting bazaar cvs svn git and darcs
107574
http requests are much faster to initiate than https and this is very obvious especially on sites with lots of images
107574
browsers also sometimes have a different cache policy for https than http
107613
it fills a very narrow niche right between not needing it at all and needing to whip out perl python whatever
107616
i m especially interested in python and c++ but all information is appreciated
107619
the following command is probably the only one for which i ve used awk in the last two years it purges half-removed packages from my debian ubuntu systems
107625
even though it might be interesting you can do everything that awk can do using other more powerful tools such as perl
107650
i ve used it a lot in my projects since a winform needs an ico file for it s icon while i usually have png or bmp files
107653
of course i could use perl or python but awk makes it so much simpler with a concise single line command
107668
if you have a situation where a tcp connection is potentially too slow and a udp connection is potentially too unreliable what do you use
107668
i m interested in the various options here of which tcp is at one end of the scale and udp is at the other
107668
various reliable udp options are available and each brings some elements of tcp to udp
107679
template-based frameworks are very good for this but we ve had some good experiences with jsf + facelets + seam too
107691
most awk one liners can be achieved with perl one liners - if you choose to get into a perl one liner mindset
107705
is there any other way to set some global flag in sys sys.stdout programmatically during execution
107723
parsing a tree of controls in windows forms or webforms .net windows forms asp.net
107740
otherwise as far as i can tell they will have to first scp or rcp or ftp or ... your config file to a scratch space not overwriting theirs and then do the same queries on the local config file
107783
update a comparison between tcp and sctp shows that the performances are comparable unless two interfaces can be used
107801
i agree that the datacontract-based serialization methods to json xml etc is a bit more complex than i d like
107810
due to the nature of private keys each segment is useless to by its self
107869
the best way to do this is have a build script for releases that will determine the revision number using svnversion or svn info and insert it into a file
107880
makefile would use svnversion or svn info and grep to read the repository revision and write it into a header file before the build takes place
107883
however we often deal with sufficiently small n such that constant factors and so on make a real significant difference
107883
for example quicksort average cost t n.log n and heapsort average cost t n.log n are both sorting algorithms with the same average cost - yet quicksort is typically much faster than heapsort
107883
this is because heapsort does a few more comparisons per element than quicksort
107937
secondly i ran a simple test and it also shows that no memory is leaked at least not on sun s jdk 1.5.0_05 on 32-bit x86 linux 2.6
107972
is it possible under any set of circumstances to be able to accomplish this
107981
calculate your percentage of diff by using the total ammount difference byte count and the total byte of the story the one you calculated earlier
107990
sniffing was once on its way out because of fully switched wired networks where you would have to work extra hard to capture anyone else s traffic as opposed to networks using hubs but it s on its way back because of wireless networks which create a broadcast medium once again an make session hijacking easy unless the traffic is encrypted
108027
i have no idea what can cause this but i would try to find out by subclassing qdrag overwrite deletelater well reimplement it but as it s a slot it will get called anyway use this instead of a qdrag and put a breakpoint in deletelater
108030
if you have a situation where a tcp connection is potentially too slow and a udp connection is potentially too unreliable what do you use
108030
if you want to get reliability out of udp then you re basically going to be re-implementing some of tcp s features on top of udp which will probably make things slower than just using tcp in the first place
108054
lexical analysis should probably be used to separate the input stream into lexical tokens number line-change keyword and so on
108081
are there any good cross platform sbcl and clisp at the very least easy to install gui libraries
108102
the thing that i like most about lisp and smalltalk systems is that they feel alive
108182
.net is microsoft s current enterprise software platform
108189
that same method of console.writeline can be invoked from c# vb.net pascal c++ ruby python f# and any other language that has been made to work on top of the .net platform
108211
i want to add a column to an existing legacy database and write a procedure by which i can assign each record a different value
108236
depends on the database as each database has a different way to add sequence numbers
108292
configuring and using sender-id domain-keys spf reverse-dns etc to make sure your emails are properly identified
108345
any number with only one bit set must be a power of two
108421
alternately you can buy a href rel nofollow noreferrer parallels a or a href rel nofollow noreferrer vmware fusion a for less than 100
108421
it primarily focuses on objective c though python ruby and other languages can be used to develop native mac applications
108423
keep in mind that the alternative ip and port iis runs on should be reachable to the clients connecting to your server if you only have a single ip address available you should take care to pick an iis port that isn t generally blocked by firewalls 8080 might be a good option or 443 even though you re running regular http and not ssl
108440
my current web environment is having capacity issues and so i m looking for best-practices regarding configuration tuning determining bottlenecks security etc
108451
if you need the reliable in-order delivery of tcp and also the fast response of udp and don t need to worry about congestion from sending large streams of data you can disable nagle s algorithm
108467
it depends on how much encapsulated you want your class to be and what you want to hide or show
108478
if you have a naming convention for included files inc.php for example you could redirect .inc.php requests to a 404 for specific folders - in apache rewrite supply r 404 at the end of the rule will return that http status to your client
108493
you also find it used in very math-heavy applications as well it makes a difference if you for example remove all multiplication with zero out of a matrix multiplication if you plan to do such a multiplication several thousand times
108521
i need a calculated field in the list items such that if user a created the item the field vaule will be x and if user b created the item fields value would be y
108525
if the wsdl is designed properly there should be an underlying xml schema xsd to validate the body of the request against
108579
placement new will be extremely cheap if the object type has no constructor
108579
operator new and operator delete are c++ s closest equivalent to malloc and free and as these in the absence of class overrides are called as appropriate by new and delete expressions they can with care
108585
here s one i did for the asterisk pbx a long time ago as an example
108615
i think you should watch powershell or any other programming language capable to perform scripting tasks easily python perl php ruby
108649
i think jeremy has hit the nail on the head - if you just want to detect if files are different a hash algorithm like md5 or sha1 is a good way to go
108650
edit in response to chris i have set the partialchars parameter to 1 and the control works in all the other browsers i ve tried which are the latest versions of firefox safari opera and chrome
108685
i believe you can create a text field that has the default value set to me which should then be usable in a calculated field
108692
there is a well-known debate in java and other communities i m sure whether or not trivial getter setter methods should be tested
108754
...and java python ruby and others..
108791
if c s not your bag python has a similar library as does perl
108795
these are thing like expectations for reliability security performance scalability configurability etc
108820
it lets you build applications with a svn cvs git like user interface easily your-command -o --long-opt some-action-to-execute some parameters
108892
is there anything like the ruby tool autotest part of the zentest package but for python code
108910
your command line interface class should accept an inputstream as it s input and provide an outputstream it can t hardcode output to system.out and input to system.in that it s output will be written to
108910
when a connection is made the server would take the inputstream from the connection and give it to the command line class which would provide the outputstream that data written to will be passed to the client that made the connection
108925
if the former then the war is just a normal jar file and you can execute classes in that just like any other other jar file
108938
i would however like something like asp s application context which instead of sharing data only within a single session will share it with all sessions in the same application
108949
and because it also detects ssl you wont have to worry about weather your resources will be sent over http or https if you ever add ssl support to your server
108980
in the most cases setter and getter do more as only setting and getting an internal field
108980
if you have no logic on the setter and getter then it must be used anywhere in your application
108980
test your business logic and not the getter and setter
108980
the result should also a coverage of the getter and setter
108980
if the getter and setter have no code coverage then removed it
108982
in your code where ever you wanted to change any behaviour for a specific set of directoris or running modes check if a environment variable is set or not
108984
the underlying database oracle microsoft mysql postgresql others custom.
108995
sometimes even in c++ you have to make profit of the malloc realloc free utils
108995
and in c you could override malloc and realloc etc. through templates to achieve type-safety
109009
branches and tags in svn are lightweight - on the server it does not make a full copy of the files just a marker saying these files were copied at this revision that only takes up a few bytes
109017
help ulimit at a bash shell prompt
109026
if you want to show the current svn revision number in the caption bar i would suggest
109032
i also have this button labeled bold that i want if someone selects text in the richtextbox then presses the button the selected text turns bold
109061
gedit which comes with gnome and has many of these ide features see for example this blog entry
109061
these would be lightweight ides as opposed to heavyweights like anjuta kdevelop eclipse or netbeans
109069
to make binaries optimized for the machine you build them on use with gcc clang or icc
109069
see asm from gcc clang icc and msvc on the godbolt compiler explorer
109069
this source isn t x86-specific or gnu-specific at all but only compiles well for x86 with gcc clang icc
109070
i have heard of mono and that it allows you to write .net apps that run on mac and linux but i want to be able to write a single app that when compiled for windows will run as a service and when compiled for linux will run as whatever the unix equivalent is
109081
we re working with ejb here and it works quite well with jboss seam and jsf faclets and myfaces trinidad
109083
does anyone know of any problems with using wcf to expose a soap interface for non .net clients
109091
setinterval returns an interval id which you can pass to clearinterval
109091
see the docs for setinterval and clearinterval
109098
if you set the return value of setinterval to a variable you can use clearinterval to stop it
109124
is it possible to run an external process from perl capture its stderr stdout and the process exit code
109124
how do you capture stderr stdout and the exit code all at once
109150
with system both stdout and stderr will go the same place as the script s stdout and stderr unless the system command redirects them
109150
you could also call something like the following with open to redirect both stdout and stderr
109234
raphael is a plugin that uses svg for firefox and other browsers that support svg and vml for the ie products
109305
i have an asp.net gridview control that i need to remain a fixed size whether there are 0 records or n records in the grid
109317
is there any good reason to use c-strings in c++ nowadays
109325
how do you perform the equivalent of oracle s describe table in postgresql using the psql command
109339
contrast that to datacontractserializer where all properties are opt-in you must explicitly declare inclusion attributes
109355
of if you re interfacing with other language domains python ruby etc. you might do so for the same reason
109379
you cannot define default arguments or block arguments
109393
one decorates various properties or fields with attributes to inform the serializer what to serialize
109409
what are the key strengths of asp.net webforms 2.0-3.5
109476
however i think that the mechanisms the standard requires for synching stdin cin stdout cout and stderr cerr don t have to be visible to you
109496
you will need to make sure each table cell in the header and footer tables have fixed widths that correspond to the widths of the cells in your gridview
109496
you will probably have to tweak the margin and padding value to get it all to line up exactly though
109518
it supports wsgi standard interface for python web frameworks rack standard interface for ruby web frameworks and direct support for ruby on rails
109534
so to answer your question do net unit-test things that are better implemented as an integration test and also don t test getter setter - it is a waste of time
109580
let s see i let a user set a variable foo and i store it using any web programming language
109590
until then it is recommended to either use system or open a pipe into stdin of iptables-restore
109605
sql is used for relational databases ms sql server oracle sybase mysql postresql sqlite etc... and xquery is used for xml databases marklogic sedena qexo qizx db etc...
109646
you could try using a cosine interpolation for the points in-between
109658
overall asp.net webforms is a great development model and most of the downfalls that people complain about are misconceptions or poor design architecture
109663
the only thing that is missing from the mono distribution on the mac compared to linux is the apache module that one you will have to compile yourself if you want to deploy your application in production on osx
109672
it also means you only need to remember one single approach to capturing stdout and stderr or merging them instead of using ipc open3 for external programs and other modules for capturing perl output
109678
the expression means look inside the data structure that temp1 points to and return the value of the field next . so assigns the value of to temp1
109678
of course the lookup happen before the assignment. temp1 will now contain whatever value the next field happened to contain
109735
if you really need very quick estimation you can do work breakdown structure with every task for 1-2 days or smaller and after this estimate every task by providing min and max estimated values
109735
sum of min and max values specify interval for the whole task
109737
i don t see any reason to believe that creating an object in the constructor will automatically dispose the object
109790
once the error reaches the ui - if necessary - it can then iterate through the nested exceptions in order to display an error message that firstly tells the user which operation failed but also provides a bit of technical information about what actually went wrong
109827
for example on avi it gives all sorts of data about resolution fourcc fps etc while for an mkv file it just says matroska data telling you nothing about the internals or even the video and audio formats used
109861
i ve seen questions for doing the reverse but i have an 800mb postgresql database that needs to be converted to mysql
109864
if you just need a text format and not specifically xml you might try json
109877
debian gnu linux testing lenny
109879
will only serialize ienumerable or icollection collections conforming to specific rules
109879
the xmlserializer gives special treatment to classes that implement ienumerable or icollection
109879
a class that implements icollection such as collectionbase in addition to ienumerable must have a public item indexed property indexer in c# that takes an integer and it must have a public count property of type integer
109879
the xmlserializer cannot be instantiated to serialize an enumeration if the following conditions are true the enumeration is of type unsigned long ulong in c# and the enumeration contains any member with a value larger than 9 223 372 036 854 775 807
109898
my organization recently hosted a legacy vfp 7 app on a windows server 2008 enterprise 64 bit server for access over terminal services
109926
i remember it being wait and pay and nowadays the mobile phones usually have a real browser like opera mini or safari
109976
i am setting up a rails app and i just finished making some unit tests and my friend said that apparently fixtures are no longer cool and people are now using rspec or shoulda
109979
parallels workstation -- it s commercial somewhat expensive and not up to par with vmware
109979
for myself i stick with vmware workstation 7+ years and vmware server for my linux-hosted virtualization needs
109979
at work it s vmware workstation on windows vmware server on windows and vmware esx on bare metal
110012
an example way it can work well is this find a fairly simple but necessary component of your software and implement it in verilog vhdl
110037
jxtable is an extension of jtable that supports multi-column sorting as well as other functions that jtable doesn t provide
110121
for the record i believe the situation that i wanted this sort of behaviour was a generic printing function that displayed lists of objects by calling tostring and formatting the strings nicely
110131
symfony lost me with all the configuration at the time i was new to both frameworks and cakephp stood out as being the best for me and i was able to pick it up very quickly
110158
the easiest way to think about it is that building a gwt app is kind of like building a java swing application that hooks into a server
110158
when you re done it all compiles down into html and javascript and has very good modern browser support ie6+ ff opera safari
110162
it s important to learn the syntax for the one you re using eg don t learn oracle syntax and then try and use it in mysql but they are similar enough that the concepts are the same
110172
one thing you can do is to create client classes corresponding to the web service data contracts with any additional functionality that you want and set the web service reference to reuse existing types
110182
well you can run svn info to determine the current revision number and you could probably extract that pretty easily with a regex like revision 0-9 +
110197
svn -u status | grep status against revision | awk print 4
110221
also if you have boost use transform_iterator to avoid making a temporary copy of the keys
110232
creating a new model to represent this that will have a save method itself maybe a sql view in the database create a controller to deal with this view that bind s or unbind s info
110241
place the following code inside the post-commit.bat file this will call your post commit cmd file passing in the parameters that svn automatically passes 1 is the repository 2 is the revision that was committed
110274
what do i gain and or lose going from vmware workstation to esx
110305
i know i m working on positioning the sidebar
110321
there s probably a more elegant way to break up that string and create delete ingredient model associations as needed but it s late and i can t think of it right now
110326
from my experience moving up the vmware application stack has never been problematic server to workstation to esx
110326
however i would verify this by exporting all of your vms from the workstation install to an esx install to make sure you re not seeing any weird issues related to running the high-end tool from vmware
110341
markr is absolutely right -- the problem is that the kernel is sending reset packets in response to the initial packet because it thinks the port is closed
110343
nsarray and nsmutablearray provide methods to filter array contents
110366
to complement greg s post if you re on a posix system which includes macos linux unix etc
110373
just make sure you properly encode the entire comment according to the context - see my answer on this here will html encoding prevent all kinds of xss attacks
110385
i have a group of checkboxes that i only want to allow a set amount to be checked at any one time
110418
enable system preference keyboard mouse keyboard use all f1 f2 etc
110431
we ve just been tasked with updating an e-commerce application to use paypal s payflow product
110436
slow compilation times linux unix
110453
i strongly recommend vmware over parallels as vmware supports 2 virtual cpu s i think it s up to 4 virtual cpu s in v2
110454
even better if we are talking about a database based web application i would go beyond the core j2ee patterns and use hibernate or the java persistence api to create a domain model that supports lazy loading of relations and use this in the view
110489
i can t recall the details offhand but the graph features may require you to install graphviz and tell doxygen the path where it can find graphviz s dotty.exe
110491
vsts 2008 tfs power toys if you re using tfs
110562
is there a similar way to define a property so that i could invoke it s getter and or setter in the function code
110564
with this technique you can quickly test for factors near the square root of n much faster than by testing individual primes
110573
just make sure when you create the flat file connection manager select delimited format then set ssis column length to maximum file column length so it can accomodate any data
110587
in a db2 trigger i need to compare the value of a clob field
110591
i know how to do it in c# sql with a key value table but i don t know how to do it with nhibrenate including filtering and sorting by the user defined fields
110617
it is already installed when you installed 64-bit version and all you need to do is run the 32-bit dtexec.exe - the one installed program files x86 microsoft sql server 90 dts binn replace 90 with 100 if you are using ssis 2008
110619
cvs update becomes git fetch and rebase if you have local changes or just git pull if you don t
110619
cvs commit becomes git commit and git push
110619
using git because you get to perform local commits and can manage local history the need to push to the central repository may not be felt as much by the individual developer as with something like cvs
110624
crossftp clients available for windows mac osx and linux
110629
basically joomla drupal phpnuke dotnetnuke umbraco are all examples of what we don t want
110639
basically the solution is to modify the expression tree before serializing it by replacing all subtrees that do not depend on the parameters with constant nodes
110720
since i ve switched from ant to maven as my build system continuum is the obvious choice
110729
code for mozilla firefox opera etc
110737
so my guess is to use it for external libraries you won t even touch like the stl c api headers boost whatever
110738
the checkstyle and cobertura code coverage plugins are two that we use
110775
in ruby python erlang and countless other languages you also often go into c mode
110788
in model class you would probably have to add order field to maintain specific order eg
110804
combine gyroscope and accelerometer data
110830
sorry but order of information in a database is determined by the information itself you always have to add a column for ordering
110830
further to retrieve things in this order you ll need to specifically add .order_by x to your queries or add ordering to your model
110843
if you usually program in one language and switch to the other only occasionally then unfortunately you are doomed to write common lisp in scheme or vice versa
110843
then at least you will always know whether you are in common lisp or scheme mode
110866
this utility is the direct descendant of vtune and provide the best available sampling profiler available
110902
valgrind has already been mentioned but it s especially useful with the callgrind tool
110909
you can increase you interoperability level by adding an explicit namespace to your servicecontract and datacontract attributes
110911
i do most of my development in common lisp but there are some moments when i want to switch to scheme while reading lisp in small pieces when i want to play with continuations or when i want to do some scripting in gauche for example
110956
get passes data in the url post passes the same data in the http content both are exactly the same from a security standpoint that is completely insecure unless you do something about it yourself like using https
110987
in your locale culture are technical words translated into locale words
110993
continuum and hudson are both very easy to set-up and use compared to cruisecontrol but hudson offers a lot more functionality
111010
notice the sign in the rewrite rule instead of the sign
111028
in addition to the other good answers i would add that writing code that was transliterated from another language is just bad form
111074
at the command line it s tools such as maven ant and subversion that are used the most
111079
simpletest which is very similar to phpunit but a lot simpler has a good introductory tutorial
111100
it has rich support for macros and vba
111109
sqlyog for mysql toad for oracle management studio for sql server
111111
this example shows that the closure contains any local variables that were declared inside the outer function before it exited
111111
a new set of local variables is kept every time a function with a closure is called given that the function contains a function declaration inside it and a reference to that inside function is either returned or an external reference is kept for it in some way
111151
i hope boost format will soon be included in the stl
111164
the results of the compile as well as the test execution exit _ success exit _ failure are used to update the project build dashboard
111183
if you want it sorted by both keys and values have the class extend treemap don t define the accessor methods and have the mutators call super.xxxxx instead of map_.xxxx
111190
once i have a match i save the results into a hashtable as a cache and then use the cache results if i get that same input set later
111213
but when you code at all you must use the best tool at your disposal and sometimes it is never hide an error and show it as soon as possible
111239
note that vsto is not necessary for doing non-bundled extensions - you can do this with any .net development tool if you install the primary interop assembiles for office
111239
examples of such languages are c++ delphi and python
111250
inject the commandargs object using the constructor of the command object

emma and the eclemma plugin for eclipse to get some insight in your code coverage
111386
i am trying to understand what s the actual difference between ssl and kerberos authentications and why sometimes i have both ssl traffic and kerberos
111386
or does kerberos use ssl in any way
111404
a short answer ssl and kerberos both use encryption but ssl uses a key that is unchanged during a session while kerberos uses several keys for encrypting the communication between a client and a client
111404
in ssl encryption is dealt with directly by the two ends of communication while in kerberos the encryption key is provided by a third party - some kind of intermediate - between the client and the server
111407
i have a simple unordered list that i want to show and hide on click using the jquery slideup and slidedown effect
111410
i would like to configure asp.net process to run under an account with domain credentials
111442
a possible solution would be to assign a unique prime number to each of the words
111449
if cost is not a factor you might consider runtime virtualization software such as vmware thinapp or xenocode postbuild both of which allow .net applications to run without having to install the .net runtime
111471
on checkout svn will substitute the revision number into the file
111475
the standard at my company is to use var everywhere which we came to after reading various recommendation and then spending some time trying it out to see whether the lack of annotated type information was a help or a hindrance
111483
i used merge sort but not quicksort or heapsort
111501
calculate the md5 or other hash of the clobs and then compare these
111510
if we add an index to the order table
111512
both lotus notes 8+ and lotus symphony use the ibm lotus expeditor toolkit
111515
for example you can t pass properties as ref or out parameters
111522
if you are using forms authentication there s no need for you to set the result to user login
111552
if it s just a getter setter without changing anything to the values i d say there s no need for testing
111558
the only multimedia function is to pick an image from the camera or library and it uses simple nsurl nsurlconnection functions to post data to a couple of web services

for the record wf was developed in conjunction with k2 s development team and the new k2 blackpearl is built on top of wf so is moss 2007 and wss 3.0 s workflow engines
111598
i have tried doing honeypots where you put a field and then hide it with css marking it as leave blank for anyone with stylesheets disabled but i have found that a lot of bots are able to get past it very quickly
111600
if you don t mind investigating how a non-java api handles these problems it s worth looking at rails active record which allows ruby server pages to work directly with the domain model and traverse its associations
111631
however this method only works for properties that were already exactly identical for the different projects you can not use it in order to add an include path to a set of project that were using different include path
111639
ant maven
111646
if you need to ensure the field has a value i would recommend moving such initialization into an initialize method that is called both from your constructor and from a method marked with the ondeserialized attribute
111654
for other stuff which tends to be stl boost then i add an underscore suffix to all member variables and i don t bother with hungarian notation
111670
if you re worried about flickering for accessibility reasons just sniff for ie6 and replace the animation with a generic show and hide instead
111678
if it has getters setters i ll usually put a _ in front of the private member variable and the getter setter will have the same name without the _
111692
you can open the file in paint.net if you need a free editor or something more fully featured like photoshop or fireworks and extract the exact size you want
111697
first you specified that you are using wss 3.0 so the cqwp is not available you need moss and to have publishing turned on for this to be available
111756
what is the web interface tool that debian or ubuntu use for publicizing their custom repositories on the web
111780
while kerberos and ssl are both protocols kerberos is an authentication protocol but ssl is an encryption protocol
111780
kerberos uses udp ssl uses most of the time tcp
111780
ssl authentication is usually done by checking the server s and the client s rsa or ecdsa keys embedded in something called x.509 certificates
111801
writing shell scripts applescript bash powershell etc.. is a great way to automate most mundane tasks assuming your apps are scriptable as well as pick up a new language
111928
i can print with printf as a hex or octal number
111934
now how do i find the width and height of mytext
111942
jsmooth is a simple program that takes your jar and wraps it up in a standard windows executable file
112022
you can for example put all public methods in one file and all private in one to make it easier to get an overview of which methods are available for use from other objects
112029
personally i chose for a few prefixes that i find useful the most important being b to prefix boolean variables as they are the only ones where i allow syntax like if bvar no use of autocast of some values to true or false
112036
the selected button becomes deselected and unselected ones become selected
112067
for instance if all you re trying to do is limit how many times a user can fill out a contact me form you can simply throttle how many requests each user can submit per hour day whatever
112068
perhaps also early versions of perl and php
112075
you could put together your own business objects but it would be difficult and you would get no help from isd
112138
the windows system api is a bit weird and frustrating if you expect the same flexibility as with basic js objects but they do have thorough documentation if you can handle digging through the msdn pages and seeing all the examples in vbscript
112148
for each var line in lines
112191
you could use something like tumblr or sweetcron with disqus comments
112212
sax is essentially event driven so the only state you should be holding on to from element to element is state that relevant to that element rather than the document as a whole
112223
and new javascript engines in firefox safari or google chrome optimize so
112242
akismet was originally built to thwart spam comments on wordpress blogs but the api is capabable of being adapted for other uses
112249
an update limit like mysql is unavailable for postgresql
112250
you may want to try stax instead of sax i hear it s better for that sort of thing i haven t used it myself
112266
i wanted to read the type version height and width of a gif image but couldn t find anything useful online
112266
png are slightly more complex width and height are 4-bytes each
112266
however i think the wikipedia entry on png and gif formats is the best place to start
112268
like heath borders said swt doesn t support l fs so you have to use swing for that
112432
com vb mfc can do this with an activex control - you can hide show multiple activex controls in the same region
112446
assuming you had a mouse. what did you did have to deal with were event callback functions in which everything was passed to you as either a 16-bit int word or 32-bit int long word
112513
also xna is neither open source nor cross platform so if you wanna have a wider knowledge about game development i d suggest first learning sdl and then ogre3d
112528
please note that std wstring is native unicode on the mac no utf-16 needed for characters above u+10000 and therefore it uses 4 bytes wchar_t
112537
this is the same api supported by recent versions of desktop safari and firefox
112554
you cannot create new instances of enum s at runtime anyway unless maybe via some reflection mechanism
112558
bash s arrays are unportable but the only sane way to handle argument lists in shell
112573
the tutorial you linked to doesn t specify where in the environment file to put the configuration information
112576
corin points out that min and max priorities would have to be calculated for tasks inserted at the top or bottom of the priority list
112601
i want to select the topmost element in a document that has a given namespace prefix
112604
once i disabled it i can use f10 and f11 in visual studio 2008 without any problems and as soon as i switch back to mac os they act as set in system preferences in my case they behave as standard function keys
112607
you should also set the return-path header of any email as email without this will often get filtered off
112607
configuring and using sender-id domain-keys spf reverse-dns etc to make sure your emails are properly identified
112618
on some linux distros ubuntu debian you can use
112642
groovy my pseudo java scratchpad
112647
another option would be to have an extremely simple webapp left in the old context that does nothing except have one custom servlet filter declared in the web.xml that re-writes all requests to the new path essentially simulating apache s rewrite rule behaviour
112663
the operating systems that the team has used previously are vxworks threadx ucos psos and windows ce
112721
i want to combine the two and use my jquery based functionality in my rails application but i m worried about jquery and scriptaculous clashing they both define the function etc
112731
jrails is a drop-in replacement for scriptaculous prototype in rails using the jquery library it does exactly what you re looking for
112751
using a dfs you might get lucky on some input trees but there is no way to know you got lucky so you still need to search the whole tree but using the bfs method is much faster and you can find a solution without touching all nodes
112752
just change min to max to get the maximum tree depth
112759
i m looking for a solution to map one or all of the following flickr twitter vimeo by exif keywords or whatever to google maps
112825
by programming in a language that is typically slower at run-time but is higher level compared to c c++ and thus faster to develop python programmers are able to accomplish quite a bit
112828
your page and the sharepoint site might as well be on different servers as far as authentication is concerned -- in order to get the information over you might need to pass it via the querystring from the webpart if you can -- or you might need to make your own webpart to do this just put an iframe in the part with the src set to your page with the querystring passing the username
112832
on the other hand there are many php frameworks out there such as cakephp symfony and codeigniter that take a load it as you need it approach
112838
using a left-shift there helps to indicate that each value is intended to be a single bit it is less likely that later on someone would do something wrong like add a new value and assign it something a value of 9
112845
the .cpp files are created by a script both python and perl scripts are provided
112864
solaris has the pstack command which was also copied into linux
112880
i usually post a link or two per day on a variety of topics threads actors locking parallel programming in a variety of environments erlang java scala .net c++ ruby python etc
112906
when editing an html document
112911
nant is a dot net port of ant for java
112965
perl is compiled like java and c++
112989
in python 3.0 file is going to move from being a built-in to being implemented by multiple classes in the io library somewhat similar to java with buffered readers etc.
113013
if i deploy the exact same application to a different folder on the server and create another application under a new name and set up the directory security setting again it works
113024
how should i encode the embed code on one side and then decode it on the other so i can insert clean html into the db on the receiving server
113048
also make sure that their row has a fixed width which is equal to the sum of the cell widths + margin + padding
113048
lastly make sure there is a fixed width on the table level div which is the sum of the row width + margin + padding
113048
but if you want to show tabular data you really should use a table some browsers more common with previous generation handle floats padding and margin differently remember the famous ie 6 bug which doubled the margin
113104
there are others - cakephp symfony
113113
i can t seem to find any recent rails tutorials or whatever to set up an openid authentication system
113117
you might also want to place a delay in authentication so that an ip cannot attempt a login more than once every y seconds or so
113169
you would have a private ifoo that would be set with this constructor and every time you wanted to call foo you would call your ifoo s version
113172
it supports the formats you re asking about vb and aspx as well as heaps more xml xsd txt js sql...
113173
i know that there is no set data structure in .net 2.0 2.0 was the latest when i started the project i want to know if there is any library that offer fast set operation in .net c# or if 3.5 has added native set data structure
113198
be careful with mutable default arguments
113215
if you re searching for all contents that are marked with any one of a set of tags
113218
basically there is a select box with the id selectbox which contains just one option any
113218
i know that i can load the list before the box is even clicked but the real form i m developing contains many such select boxes which are all interrelated so it will be much better for both the client and server if i can load each set of options only when needed
113228
the port number is an unsigned 16-bit integer so 65535
113229
the largest port number is an unsigned short 2 16-1 65535
113232
i generally work in perl rather than php but so long as you have a command-line interface to your firewall rules engine like say sbin iptables you should be able to do this fairly easily from any language which has the ability to execute system commands
113250
now in a new bash instance or after reloading .inputrc in your current shell by pressing c-x c-r you can do the following
113251
just try to implement a small example in some smalltalk like visualworks and than the same in squeak
113259
i think you are going to have explore slightly different options to obtain what you want as you are probably stuck with internet explorer closing that drop down list if you use the onmousedown or onclick events
113277
what s the best way to maintain a multiple databases across several platforms windows linux mac os x and solaris and keep them in sync with one another
113278
another way to illustrate it is in the box model padding is the inside margin of a box margin is the buffer around the box
113293
i know windows vista xp ubuntu and debian do it but does everyone do it
113314
if the host dns settings are misconfigured localhost will not resolve
113316
this can become a fairly lengthy compile just to support some legacy communication channel and since there is a large tendency to put wrappers around corba to make it simpler well things just get worse
113330
check qt licensing page the library is free only for gpl projects
113331
i have both worked with pyqt and wxpython extensively
113331
wxpython has a very good demo and it can do pretty much anything which pyqt can do i would anyday prefer pyqt but it may bot be free for commercial purpose but wxpython is free and is decent cross platform library
113350
you can also use pl java pl perl pl php
113350
perl would be second with python beating it because of the easier reading syntax
113352
and i get a screen position sx sy from a mouse click
113365
when a folder in the eclipse package explorer one which is linked to a directory somewhere in the filesystem contains files whose names begin with a
113387
css width value display width of inside
113387
css width value display width of inside + css margin-left + css margin-right
113402
it explains where padding margin and border as well as width work
113408
by the way the type is text not textbox as others are writing however you have to use javascript with textarea s
113423
using a distributed version control system dvcs such as git easy git bazaar mercurial answers the need to have the backup available locally
113442
so for example when you get to the + then rather than putting 7 on the stack you put + 3 4 on the stack
113445
but in scenario you re describing probably multiview or simple hide show visible property will be better solution
113455
basically you want to create a syntax tree out of your rpn by making the 2 expressions you want to operate on leaf nodes and the operation itself which comes afterward the parent node
113476
all my projects are in subversion on an external host
113488
you ll also need to respond to touch and drag events to update the state of the control
113498
now we like to port it to linux hp-ux and aix too
113498
what is the appropriate and commonly used performance monitor under linux hp-ux and aix
113510
i m not sure for hp but at least linux and aix should have that tree if it s not deactivated at kernel compile time
113519
it is not currently computationally feasible to generate a hash collision for a specific md5 value but it is possible to generate two different inputs that will produce the same md5 therefore not triggering your code
113539
ctrl + 9 find any object whose name contains a given string for when you know you there s a procedure with option in the name but you don t know what its name starts with
113550
here is an article that walks you through how to create a rewrite rule using this
113550
just in case the above url fails later here is an example rewrite rule for wordpress
113571
zbar previously known as zebra - h t bgbg natim - implemented in c with interfaces for python perl and c++
113573
the legal issues are along the lines of getting sued into oblivion for any leak of personal information that contains ssns
113598
this works generally as advertised by browsers such as opera firefox safari
113598
internet explorer is your exception where the width includes the margins padding and borders
113600
if the field f is a double calculate double.doubletolongbits f and handle the return value like every long value
113600
if the field f is an array see every field as separate element and calculate the hash value in a recursive fashion and combine the values as described next
113617
some dbs fail spectacularly if you move them from a big-endian system such as solaris to a little-endian system such as x86 linux again the manual section on moving a db would cover any extra steps that are needed
113636
paul graham posted an article several years ago about why python programmers made better java programmers
113637
vmware esx
113644
if i however use the property field as a combo box and select a value from the drop-down i get the standard property grid error box with the error
113660
the -a switch splits each input line on white space and saves the results in the array f functionality inspired by awk s capacity to split input records into its 1 2 3.
113671
it has versions for windows osx and linux works effortlessly keeps files versioned and works entirely in the background based on when the files changed not a daily schedule or manual activations
113677
if you squint a bit and ignore the java its quite pleasant - or alternatively use one of them dynamic languages on the jvm groovy is my recommended one
113690
wia is primarily for capturing stills from imaging devices and directshow used either through directshow.net or managed directx is for access to fuller video features

for multi user or multithread try mysql or postgresql
113751
you also have nearly limitless options for development environment including php ruby on rails django and .net
113753
if you want several users a few gigas of data and multiple connections i would use mysql or firebird
113766
so it s possible to set up a firewall rule that drops icmp ping packets going to localhost 127.0.0.1
113780
functions like slideup fadein take an element as an arguments and are normally a curried function returning the high order function with the default animation function built-in
113791
i would like to hide this folder for entire application and it should not show up anywhere
113799
rather than having to pass for each call a set of impacted elements and a function describing how the element should behave to a higher order function that will ensure all the timing stuff its generally easier for the customer to release as public api some function like slideup fadein that takes only elements as arguments and that are just some curried function returning the high order function with the default animation function built-in
113801
wxpython and i m assuming pygtk also can use wxglade to help you design most uis you will create
113804
the customer can open a special page that shows logging and trace statements using dhtml
113814
that s why it s far better to check it on the server side with a php python whatever script
113823
queue size - if too many items get put in the queue and aren t removed in a timely manner the server can stall
113832
if you want lazy evaluation not to reduce latency but to avoid calculations my approach won t help because it relies on a push model not a pull model
113832
while pondering this problem i also investigated tie-ing an array to the thread results to make the perl program flow more like map but so far i like my api of introducing the parallel keyword an object constructor in disguise and then calling methods on the result
113856
as for any class that contains a virtual function a vtable is used
113873
so i did that but then it gives invalidoperationexception with an innerexception message of nullreferenceexception
113879
encapsulate this with an api in one of the base classes of your domain classes and provide a generic getter setter api for instantiation or persisting
113879
edit i can t think of a c++ library with the type of pluggable persistence mechanism you re describing but i did something in python that could have had this type of facility added
113879
the particular implementation used facilities in python with no direct c++ equivalent although the basic principle could probably be adapted to work with c++
113892
if you can use scp instead of ftp the -r option will do this for you
113895
but using scp or rsync over ssh is probably better than ftp if you can
113898
for programmer time as it is on the order of 1000 s of times more expensive than a cpu cycle i d usually just throw it into a join if it wasn t going to be run 10 0000+ times per second
113904
if you can i strongly suggest you tar and bzip or gzip whatever floats your boat the directory on the remote machine for a directory of any significant size the bandwidth savings will probably be worth the time to zip unzip
113906
i know plenty of gui toolkits intended at keyboard mouse interfaces but can you advise something suited for touchscreens
113908
if you call getimage too early your component will not have been displayed yet and will still have a 0 width and height
113912
a result of 0 indicates you are in a case-sensitive collation mode 8 indicates it is case-insensitive
113948
after you commit your object into the db the object receives a value in its id field
113953
long answer only let users browse your site by visiting your office and using a machine located there - under strict supervision of course
113980
you will see that ci specifies case-insensitive and cs specifies case-sensitive
114010
is there any way to create c# 3.0 anonymous object via reflection at runtime in .net 3.5
114024
i have a menu on the right visualstudio style when the user wants to add an element should i expand the menu down and let them select something from it there and then have to press the ok button or display a modal popup forcing them to select
114028
i had to take a .net c# course about a year ago and i really enjoyed the c# language hated asp.net but it made me a better php developer
114031
however i do give an object with a generic method to the constructor of this object
114060
another solution is maintaing all the configuration files for every environment in svn
114069
i have a menu on the right visualstudio style when the user wants to add an element should i expand the menu down and let them select something from it there and then have to press the ok button or display a modal popup forcing them to select
114086
it s written in perl and easy to set up with apache lighttpd the only web servers i ve tried it with
114128
then your various wizard instances just need to be given the underlying character object as a place to put and get values
114145
the only options for setting private fields is to have explicit setters to set them in your constructor or to set the indirectly via other methods functionally deferring the setter to another place
114145
no matter if it is a getter setter
114165
at work we use wix for building installation packages
114165
we want that installation of product x would result in uninstall of the previous version of that product on that machine
114176
although i m currently not a gentoo user on ubuntu now i used to be one for years and had learned that it s a good thing to search for linux answers on forums.gentoo.org
114181
i think that basically double clicking or scrolling the mousewheel changes values from the value collection while selecting from the drop down is like editing the field value as a string
114185
a good mnemonic rule is to remember that and is like multiplication and or is like addition
114193
since the getter is called before the new value is put in the field the old value is returned
114194
option 1 - in my app directory under program files create a data directory in my installer make this dir read-writeable by all that way the user program files virtualisation won t kick in and all users can update the file and see each others changes
114209
something like the following written in delphi virtual pascal so it will result in a win32 executable but any compiled language should do
114224
if you are looking for small footprint up to a few mb and easy deployment end-user should only install your application to get it working then your options are sqlite and firebird embedded
114231
the files in etc profile.d are only executed in the current shell not in a subshell when you log in
114257
it is available for windows linux solaris os x hp-ux
114260
the classic asp page communicates with the ihttphandler through basic http requests using serverxmlhttp in vbscript or ajax calls in javascript
114268
mod_wsgi in combination with a virtualenv for all the dependencies a mercurial checkout into the virtualenv and a fabric recipe to check out the changes on the server
114278
if it were me i d probably find a way to conceptualize the data as a model and then just make it a singleton with a factory method and a private constructor
114285
there s much less need for class methods in python than static methods in languages like java or c#
114291
firebug is a very good firefox extension that allows you to examine which css declarations are active for which dom element in your document tree

114448
my vote would be for the field value
114474
when you change lines add the current line count to the buffer count count the words in the current line and a set the current line count and b subtract it from the buffer count
114522
if you know the dimensions of the div you can just put the image at div width - image width - 10 div height - image height - 10
114538
is there thus a free program for me to use it it ll have to work on a mac but feel free to suggest pc apps for others with the same q or script preferably in php or python that allows you to design database structure and will then output either a basic diagram or the code as chosen by the user
114555
what i m looking for are some starting points to get me up and running such as installation configuration guides for red hat
114587
most of the proprietary unix variants such as solaris have numa support as well
114594
second if you have control over your inputstream outputstream try extending objectoutputstream and objectinputstream and override replaceobject and resolveobject and then you can implement serialization for java.sql.date
114627
during deserialization constructor is not called but attributes of object set directly to values from serialized data and you can use the object as it is since it deserialized
114633
currently it s a text field but i want it to be a group of radio buttons and it should work in both insert and edit mode the correct current value should be selected in edit mode
114648
i settled on httplib2 because it allowed me to send put and delete in addition to get and post
114653
background images only appear within padding not margins
114659
99 bottles of beers made me realize that ada erlang and smalltalk were not so odd languages after all
114662
setting up subversion in general is very easy you just have to install the binaries and run svnserve or adapt the apache configuration
114666
also note that access to raw sockets is normally only available to root processes since otherwise any user could both a sniff all traffic and b generate spoofed packets
114719
compare documents of ms word doc docx etc excel pdf rich text rtf text html xml powerpoint or wordperfect and retain formatting
114737
you could handle the gridview s databound event and hide the dummy row
114741

if you have a nice database mysql sql server oracle or db2 there are nice tools to do this replication for you
114807
i am a .net webdev using asp.net c# etc.
114811
the query still has a lot of loop joins but the join order is different and it runs in 2-3 seconds
114843
if for example you have a complex nested hash you want to save assign the following to your data text field
114861
this searches for lines in file the do not match -v lines that match the pattern -e s which is the beginning of a line followed by 0 or more whitespace characters followed by the end of a line ie
114889
there s fink and macports if you want an easy installer updater
114915
however you can use expression templates as described here to minimise them and do fancy lazy evaluation of the templates
114939
the service then has access to the credentials and can do any role lookup authorization check it needs to and return the appropriate response
114941
extensions for tcl perl and python are available
114969
to recode the video on the server i prefer to use ffmpeg or mencoder both have windows and linux unix versions
115010
it is possible to embed the player in another flash movie but most often you will control the playlist from html links
115040
if you want to constrain the values getting into the table you can add on insert and on update triggers that check the values
115045
mfc wxwidgets qt were started a long time ago and they don t use modern c++ features and standard library
115058
instead you want to have the mailbox be a pipe to the application and have the application simply read in the message from stdin parse out the body and mime parse the body to get the attachments
115071
bc will show the comparison in a nice table layout and you can hide rows and columns you re not interested in
115083
w3 s reference of dom for html in most web applications today the javascript code manipulates the dom which is an internal keeping track of the objects displayed on screen but you already knew that right
115083
because javascript has closures and first-class functions he believes it is closer to lisp and scheme than to other languages
115094
you should then add another spike to your next iteration to complete the necessary work you need to complete in order to accurately estimate the task resulting from the spike
115107
- an thus java.sql.date too as it extends java.util.date serializes it to a string in some common date-format so the type information is lost and deserializes it back to a calendar object on the receiving end
115108

if i m deploying to servers with websphere 6.1 java 1.5 should i use ibm s jdk on my build box
115194
if you are planning to do cocoa or carbon developing i strongly suggest installing the entire package because you will need all the documentation and headers
115208
these items can all be tested for shorts opens by finding access patterns that drive each individual line high while its neighbors are low and vice-versa then reading back the lines values
115210
i d be happy with either a tool i can drop in and use ideally cross-platform or a ruby perl script i can make part of my data loading process
115211
rails handles the 99 case it s fairly unlikely you d ever need to do any xml or json translations in your edit action because non-visually the edit action is pretty much just like the show action
115243
i can t tell you where to get ibm s jdk but if you ve got a license to websphere at your company you should have a contact at ibm to get you a link to that jdk
115247
however even though there s no direct correspondence between ice and wcf if you need your .net app to communicate remotely then they re both contenders

add your symlinks to usr lib jvm java-1.5.0-sun-1.5.0.11 jre lib note you may need to specify a different version in this path to allow all java programs access to these libraries or add them to tomcat s shared libraries at var lib tomcat5.5 shared libs again the version number may be different for access by all tomcat contexts

do this by finding the equation of the infinite line on which each side lies v1 + t v2-v1 and v 1 + t v 2-v 1 basically finding the point at which the lines meet by solving for t when those two equations are equal if they re parallel you can test for that and then testing whether that point lies on the line segment between the two vertices is it true that 0 t 1 and 0 t 1

it may just be the tools i m using but gif files usually seem to be a bit smaller than a comparible png but using them just seems so 1987
115819
i know that my gnome environment seems to underperform compared to my coworkers kde setups
115825
they are faster than fully fledged window managers like kde or gnome and trim down on most visual distractions
115834
the main reason to use png over gif from a legal standpoint is covered here
115834
the patents have apparently expired as of 2004 but the idea that you can use png as open-source over gif is appealing to many people
115838
as a general rule png is never worse and often better than gif because of superior compression
115838
there might be some edge cases where gif is slightly better because the png format may have a slightly larger overhead from metadata but it s really not worth the worry
115838
it may just be the tools i m using but gif files usually seem to be a bit smaller than a comparible png

any tips on getting dtc set up properly to talk to datadirect s formerly neon systems shadow odbc driver
115878
on the downside it s slower since you re making an extra temporary copy and the compiler will assign each member to 0 individually instead of one memset
115887
if typing echo htmlspecialchars ... all the time is too wordy you can always make a function with a short name like h that does the same.
115906
linq has been very fast for me to pull data from the database but linq-to-sql does directly translate your request to sql to run it
115906
by hand-tweaking the sql namely by placing where -type arguments in join s in order to minimize the data intensity of the join i was able to drastically improve performance
115944
therefore if there is no business logic for example when a getter simply returns a value or a setter sets it then there is no point in writing a test

it uses texvc which validates ams latex mathematical expressions and converts them to html mathml or png graphics. sounds like what you are looking for
116063
they also have an extensive reference on latex and pros cons of the different rendering types png mathml html
116063
tex can be converted to mathml for browsers which support it thus
116068
some are innodb specific while others are for myisam
116068
you didnt mention which engine you were using which might be relevant in this case count is much faster in myisam than in innodb for example
116073
here s an online converter that will emit mathml from tex markup which you can then embed in your webpage
116073
i know gecko-based browsers like firefox and camino play nice with mathml as does opera
116074
how can i ignore the whole directory folder with svn

enlightenment v16 is actually very lightweight compared to gnome kde these days and it is very configurable although nothing seems to be as configurable as fvwm florian s suggestions are all good but if you re used to gnome kde then you probably won t like ratpoison xmonad
116118
i would recommend that you profile your application with a good profiler like the netbeans 6 profiler or yourkit to make sure you don t have any memory leaks
116142
i would like to know if there is any way to add custom behaviour to the auto property get set methods
116142
an obvious case i can think of is wanting every set property method to call on any propertychanged event handlers as part of a system.componentmodel.inotifypropertychanged implementation
116163
delphi v7 - object pascal standard tquery object name query1
116170
if you want to put custom logic you must write get and set explicitly
116177
there were some reports that this method is slower than preallocating the string and using std istream read
116210
indexed png less than 256 colors is actually always smaller than gif so i use that most of the time
116235
interface languages like x12 and hl7 existed for sure but with xml people could tailor it to their individual aix or as 400 systems
116240
for any values that are specific to the user the default value is set like this

my advice as you write these t-sql instructions keep also trace of their counterparts so that you can at any time debugging time for example downgrade your database structure to previous version

okay outright disclaimer i m a developer for a company called mks which makes a version control system for enterprise companies as part of a software configuration management platform called integrity
116290
written in php works with mysql or postgresql
116301
it supports ftp sftp synchronization integrates well with subversion cvs mercurial and even with git with plugin
116306
you can also derive from this class numericupdowntoolstripitem which initialize the control property with the custom control and can populate next properties from the hosted control min max value - for example
116326
i think it is hard to quantify software compatibility but i d say code written for solaris is quite forward compatible with opensolaris kernel
116326
opensolaris source code evolves into what will be solaris 11 and sun s commitment to backwards compatibility is quite a fact
116337
it does syntax highlighting ftp sftp support super fast macros etc
116338
the cells can be of different colspans so when the cell is dropped into the middle of another cell which is bigger the following steps should be performed
116342
if you want one thread to wait till another thread reach a point in execution you might want to use waitevents autoresetevent or manualresetevent
116347
you really can t compare xml to csv because csv is an extremely limited way of representing data
116391
attributes properties
116448
you need to put any proprietary code in your back-end where client machines can t get at it
116450
an example of this is an object interface i worked with that instead of exporting constructors and properties for particular objects required me to author xml programmatically and pass in the resulting xml to the single constructor
116461
png is a 100 replacement for gif files and is supported by all web browsers you are likely to encounter
116461
virtually all browsers support single-bit transparency in png files the type of transparency offered by the gif format
116461
if your png files are coming out larger than equivalent gif files it is almost certainly because your source image has more than 256 colors
116461
gif files are indexed to a maximum palette of 256 colors while png files in most graphics programs are saved by default in a 24-bit lossless format
116461
if file size is more important than accurate colors save the file as an 8-bit indexed png and it should be equivalent to gif or better
116461
it is possible to hack a gif file to have more than 256 colors using a combination of animation frames with do-not-replace flags and multiple palettes but this approach has been virtually forgotten about since the advent of png
116481
however the only platform where it looks nice is linux bsd running gnome
116484
i haven t done them in mysql but i ve done them on other databases oracle sql server etc
116490
kernel modules in particular will be very compatible between solaris and opensolaris
116517
sql delta shows the rows in the database just like they would look in a diff tool - changed added deleted
116569
kernel modules written for solaris should function in opensolaris following a simple recompile providing you are using the exposed kernel apis that are compatible between the releases that you are using in solaris and opensolaris
116571
i need to take any given valid xml schema xsd and denormalize it to a simple form containing no refs no includes etc
116571
all simple type definitions should be inline such that when looking at any given element all declarations are visible without performing another lookup
116578
scons has a configuring mechanism that will do a lot of what autotools do without as much complexity and is pretty darn portable although not as portable as autotools
116611
you could then write a chunk of perl python groovy that would slurp up your procedure declaration and crank out these calls to your null check procedure
116626
i m trying to polish up my ruby by re writing kent beck s xunit python example from test driven development by example
116627
my personal preference is eclipse with various plug-ins as i am developing in several languages php java and ruby and this way i am always used to interface and keyboard shortcuts
116627
for others ides i have used jedit for little java notepad++ still for some scripting and short test code runs
116630
the subreport just grabs the correct logo image and then it automatically displays in the report
116630
is there a setting i can use set to get the subreport to either not show or not take up any space if there is no logo to be displayed
116632
i used to use opera and firefox as my standards compliant browsers but i ve recently become much enamored with safari
116664
the autotools uses a multi-stage process that s relatively easy to break and scons just feels weird to me
116697
is there any way to force active directory to authenticate against our user store or can we set up a kerberos authentication server that isn t active directory
116705
md5 or sha in combination with a randomly generated salt value for every entry
116707
use a strong crytographic hash function like md5 or sha1 but make sure you use a good salt otherwise you ll be susceptible to rainbow table attacks
116730
don t get me wrong here - i m not trying to dismiss the users of opera safari or any other browser
116739
sha all variants is now trivially breakable and best practice is now as of jan 2013 to use a key-stretching hash like pbkdf2 or ideally a ram intensive one like bcrypt and to add a per-user salt too
116739
sha-256 uses 64 characters in the database but with an index on the column that isn t a problem and it is a proven hash and more reliable than md5 and sha-1
116753
when a unique salt is used the benefit of using a more secure algorithm than sha1 or md5 is not really necessary at that point it s an incremental improvement whereas using a salt is a monumental improvement
116767
however all sha variant hashes are designed for communication encryption - messages back and forth where every message is encrypted and for this reason they are designed to be fast
116767
a key-stretching algorithm like pbkdf2 applies a quicker hash like sha512 thousands of times typically causing the hash generation to take 1 5 of a second or so
116773
the most user friendly way i ve seen to do validation is to have an indicator that shows up next to the input field to indicate the value is invalid
116796
for the new field value
116819
the goal would be to take this expression and be able to construct for any set of keywords
116860
pbkdf2 for example uses salt large number of iterations and a good hash function
116891
here is some pseudocode for linux unix
116905
i would like to use my laptop as a web development php python etc. machine but i m hesitant to do this unless i can ensure that it can not be accessed by the outside world
116918
my advice is that if you really want to have access to modern language features like closures but wish to stay within the java ecosysteym you should take a look at scala
116933
you can forward ports to your main machine or just put the main machine in the dmz if you need it to be available to incoming connections
117000
this is useful when you want to use for some t through reflection and won t know t until runtime
117009
you code it with groovy a dynamic language based upon java and runs smoothly together with java code classes and libraries
117010
automake or scons are quite complex and are worth your time only if you intend to release your code to a wide audience
117091
groovy is the best java alternative i ve seen that includes features of dynamic languages including closures run-time class extension etc
117091
while ruby has a slight design advantage imho i d have to say the fact that groovy compiles into java byte-code and interacts with java without any interface code is a huge plus that can t be ignored
117095
in my previous work we had real genius guy on deployment duties he deployed application python sql perl and java code as set of deb files built for ubuntu
117097
you can look at haskell ml ocaml etc
117112
take care not to use any gpl library code however lgpl is ok
117148
in fact you could even for example use the gnu toolchain the linux kernel and then have your own system on top of that or just a de that is closed source
117154
otherwise i would recommend a third-party report generator that fits your reporting needs and create an app that uses it to create export the reports
117163
on a normal linux system between the gpl kernel and a non-gpl compatible application there is always the gnu libc which is lgpl and thus allows derived works that are non-free
117170
every 2nd pixel is thrown away during the encoding process and those 8x8 dct blocks started out as 16x16 and will decode back to 16x16
117211
let s say the combo box text field currently has the value thing1
117211
if i type new into the box and then click on the button with my mouse it will pops up the message thing1
117217
id say validating xml with a xsd schema is a good idea
117226
something like ruby s god for php
117267
keep using ftp for that and just use svn for revision history
117274
customizing the root menu is also easy much easier than doing so in kde or gnome which i never did figure out adequately
117279
grails is written for groovy not java
117282
if you want to manage rights to an internet facing git repo i suggest you look at gitosis rather than whipping up your own
117299
i resigned from using pylint pychecker in favor of using pyflakes with django code - it just tries to import module and reports any problem it finds like unused imports or uninitialized local names
117343
i also keep a folder in this repository which contains sql files of any changes i ve made to the database structure labelled according to their revision number
117370
the logging application block has a instrumentation event that can be used to trace events you can find more info on the ms enterprise library docs
117407
you can use xml serialization deserialization by yourself
117440
i use a custom xml configuration file where a different config file is used for each environment dev qa prod
117444
i try to put the absolute minimum configuration in config files with most of it being configured in code with an application that is self-aware of its deployment environment such as by machine name or ip address if known
117451
i believe that to do it the way you are hoping to you d have to have each version of the file in a separate directory in the repository and check it out into your source folder
117475
the object has a parameterless constructor
117477
a while ago i came across a python library that formats regular text to html similar to markdown restructuredtext and textile just that it had no syntax at all
117547
called whenever a draggable is released over the droppable and the droppable is accepts it
117547
the callback gets three parameters the draggable element the droppable element and the event
117547
my question is does anyone have a good example on how to reference the draggable element and the droppable element in this callback javascript function
117560
you can t find out if an enumeration contains elements without calling movenext at least once and once you ve done so you can t guarantee to be able to reuse the enumeration it is allowable for ienumerable.reset to throw a notsupportedexception
117564
it will tell you the number of cpu cycles executed since the processor was booted
117620
they will all be web applications written in php or python
117625
wcf windows communication foundation is the way to go - much more scalable easily swappable to other technologies if you need in the future and builtin to .net 3.0
117674
use the ide you like best emacs vim vc++ express code blocks bloodshed - again whatever
117678
this is with ubuntu linux 1gb ram
117707
the key thing here is to turn the anchor tag into a block element so height and width work
117741
become familiar with the stl and boost and use their facilities whenever possible rolling your own
117742
for a there is some set of data that must be in memory to perform the work at any given time and if that working set size heap size performance will obviously suffer
117769
the cursor s header data structure will let you get the column names - a bit of introspection will let you make a dictionary with col-name value pairs for the row
117811
if the array is sorted as in your example i would define buckets containing a min and a max
117811
initialize create a bucket with a min and a max equal to the first value
117811
at the end you will have a set of buckets with a min and a max in each
117811
if the min is the same as the max print a single number ie in your example the first bucket would have a min and a max of 1
117819
markdown in python is a python implementation of the perl based markdown utility
117834
safari 1.3+ opera 9.2+ konquerer and ie8 all support it at least to some degree
117849
you would also be surprised how many people struggle to implement a map dictionary type data-structure
117897
for example i myself haven t taken the time with msbuild because i ve been using nant for this task since before msbuild existed .
117918
general how do you find min and max from an array n size with just 3 n 2 comparisons
117938
cpan.pm will get the right installation paths from that perl s configuration
117972
many programs and utilities on unix linux use epoch values to represent time so this has proved invaluable for me
118016
in addition the second syntax is more flexible if there are further aggregates which may be added in the future in addition to count like min some_scalar max avg etc
118019
you could employ output buffering capture + the last modified time of related data on the page and use the apc cached version
118043
i know you can just use css to hide the div or silverlight plugin but is there a way to instantiate a silverlight component app using javascript that doesn t show any ui element at all
118050
if you do the detailed requirements prior to the high level set the users will never grasp any concepts in the design and get bogged down in the tiniest detail specifications
118071
the backslash is being eaten by cygwin s bash shell
118089
accesses not on word boundaries 32-bit on most cpus carry heavy penalty on x86 and cause fatal traps on risc architectures
118107
you should have a set of rules each rule stating something like if the bnumber is 1792 and the message text contains the keyword video then the message should be directed to the video providing service
118126
although asp.net mvc seems to have all the hype these days webforms are still quite pervasive
118137
then to show the whole multi-part query you can either show five circles with some combination of union and intersection or else combine each parenthesis and then hide the detail making the results into a new circle to combine with other elements
118143
essentially i am trying to work out why it works in php but not python
118144
the table contains millions of rows and at any given time i don t know how large the table is it is constantly growing
118175
basically you just open the docx file which is a zip archive using zipfile and find the content in the document.xml file in the word folder
118180
php uses 3 different flavors of regex while python uses only one
118182
both php and python s regex objects take strings as arguments
118197
you seem to be working mostly with java and or ruby so forgive me that this answer is based on perl -
118219
for instance once it can compile ruby perl and python it should be easy to cross those boundaries to let me use a ruby library in python a perl library from python so whatever combination that i like
118222
another option would be to enable scripts to default to the php.ini in the folder with the script then go to the user host s root folder then to the server s root or something similar
118235
anyway i m sure other people have tackled this and the solution is probably applicable to many apps similar to wordpress drupal phpbb phpmyadmin etc.
118251
in your javascript set the font size and attributes that you are trying to measure put your string in the div then read the current width and height of the div
118309
you will than be able to access subversion with http or https but the port number must be different from the one your local iis uses default port for visual-svn server is 8080
118325
firefox with ie tab because those are the two browsers with the most market share and chrome because it is one of the few windows browsers that use webkit meaning it should display similarly to safari
118336
i know that the author just added support for wcf wpf and silverlight
118340
i find that if you stick to standards compliant markup and don t use anything too unusual it will render fine in firefox 2 3 and safari chrome and usually fine in ie7 8
118360
my advice don t do this at least not under linux unix
118360
gui programs under linux unix traditionally do not auto-background themselves
118372
this might be way overkill but you could use git-cvsimport to import the cvs history to a git repository and search it using git s tools
118373
depending on what other attributes you put on a checkboxlist or radiobuttonlist or whatever asp.net will render the output using different structures
118375
i myself only use pyflakes primarily due to some dumb defaults in pylint and laziness on my part not wanting to look up how to change the defaults
118377
from my understanding you should use synchronized on both the getter and the setter methods and that is sufficient
118388
in this specific instance with a single int variable then eliminating the synchronized and marking the int field volatile will also ensure visibility each thread will see the latest value of val when calling the getter but it may not be synchronized enough for your needs
118397
to that end i would use awk or perl to process the output line-by-line setting an echo variable when you find a section of interest
118460
for php you have several high-quality packages for deploying apache+mysql+php such as wamp and xampp
118460
personally i download the latest binaries of each and install manually to have more fine grained control
118469
log of login logout activity by each user
118469
in the server side it should use php 5 perl or python with php5 perl preferred
118486
i also second the idea of using a css reset file and definitely use a library like jquery instead of reinventing the wheel on javascript event and dom differences
118492
in some languages like ruby or perl this technique is straightforward
118499
in some languages like ruby or perl this technique is straightforward
118503
yes purely asymmetric encryption is much slower than symmetric cyphers like des or aes which is why real applications use hybrid cryptography the expensive public-key operations are performed only to encrypt and exchange an encryption key for the symmetric algorithm that is going to be used for encrypting the real message
118504
it s arcane but one can learn enough rtf to create simple formatting and printing print previewing can both be implemented using native classes as well
118507
if you install in debian ubuntu package name python-zsi the documentation is in usr share doc python-zsi in a pair of pdfs you can find in there

there s support for firefox safari firewatir project
118610
question to watin guys does it support firefox safari
118616
but if you want to have each project be served on a different port try setting up your virtual host config exactly like kelly s above minus the dns stuff except instead of 80 give each virtualhost its own port number assuming that you ve added this port to your ports.conf file
118617
json xml etc.
118680
if beautifulsoup doesn t work on ironpython it s because ironpython doesn t implement the whole python language the same way cpython does
118680
beautifulsoup is pure-python no c-extensions so the only problem is the compatibility of ironpython with cpython in terms of python source code.there shouldn t be one but if there is the error will be obvious no module named ... no method named ... etc.
118716
would you use an array to store a dictionary when you have a hashmap
118726
it shows virt res and shr by default on debian linux
118740
edit as you ve noted in your reply the issue is with trailing whitespace - i don t know notepad++ too well but most modern editors designed for coding have a strip trailing whitespace on save option i know komodo does
118744
pindent.py it s located in the tools scripts directory in a windows install my path to it is c python25 tools scripts it looks like you d have grab it from svn.python.org if you are running on linux or osx
118806
if you want to teach them programming start with some simple procedural language like basic or pascal
118863
when is it appropriate to use a class in visual basic for applications vba
118884
i have noticed that some browsers in particular firefox and opera are very zealous in using cached copies of .css and .js files even between browser sessions
118886
first we use the following rewrite rule in .htaccess
118933
i don t want to set a datasource that establishes a fixed connection between some column in my sql query and some displayable element at design time i want to perform any query that i want and show elements tied to any query field anytime in run time
118942
if your application can live with this type of login is works great for ajax and all other accesses to your site because the browser handles re-submitting requests with appropriate credentials and it is safe if you use ssl but only if you use ssl -- don t use basic auth with plain http
118958
this regex should work in ruby 1.9 and in perl and many other places
118968
facil.io c with optional http and websockets linux bsd macos
119004
as said your business should not be exposed to anything but your dto and facade
119031
is there a standard format for kde gnome etc
119062
for gnome and kde you would probably want to include a desktop file with your app that defines how it will be launched
119103
on those rare occasions when your algorithm really is most comprehensible in terms of a path through a sequence of nodes states connected by a limited set of permissible transitions gotos rather than by any more specific control flow loops conditionals whatnot then that should be explicit in the code
119132
also a library may be compiled under x86 with 32-bit ints and you may be comparing its components on a 64-bit process would would give you a different result if you were doing this by hand
119149
consider lisp s format python s printf-style formatting or php bash perl ruby and their string intrapolation
119152
this will disallow the user to create any site under the site where these permissions are set
119153
i do this in asp.net and i actually create a webbrowser object that is avaialable in the .net framework class libraries to generate the screenshot
119190
i recommend using something like maven or ant as a standardized build system
119194
thus assignment to an object explicitly checked the type at compiler time of the object being assigned too generating an compile time error if required
119194
scanf printf and family on the other hand rely on the programmer getting the format string correct and there was no type checking i believe gcc has an extension that helps
119209
the clincher for us was the speed the lack thereof of vss over vpn and low bandwidth hotel networks on the road and the problems of trying to tunnel through firewalls so that two teams at two different sites could quickly securely and reliably work from the same code repository
119210
for binary io i tend to use stdio s fread and fwrite
119249
map is a function that works on ranges and arrays and returns an array
119250
thus the easiest way to produce a sequence of random numbers on a modern ruby is
119283
interesting feature it can emulate safari ie or firefox browsers when rendering
119295
clarification we don t have a single-sign-on server shibboleth setup yet
119306
i know four lines is what you started with but you d match as many parameters as you want without having to add a fifth line
119326
according to though ie and firefox ignore this opera and safari don t
119336
i googled on the problem and the main source seems to be that the ssl port is speaking in http
119365
32-bit x86 processors are generally slow at manipulating 16-bit data in general purpose registers
119388
how do i manage routes to those controllers
119414
however how would you unit-test for example a memory allocator think malloc realloc free
119414
my experience is that assertions even if complex and time-consuming traversing the whole free list to check invariants are much less work and are more reliable than unit-testing esp
119461
my unit tests usually don t use tools like cunit cppunit and similar software
119468
routes do not depend on where a controller is stored
119478
we ve inherited a wcf web service that has a custom messageformatter that constructs a custom message subclass in the serializereply method
119478
every way we tried we managed to get the ws-addressing headers into the actual response but could never get the ws-security header in actually we were just trying to put in a security header with timestampid and created expires elements
119508
i want to create a keyboard and mouse hook which will be started as a windows service
119516
because until the constructor has completed executing the object is not fully instantiated
119516
in c++ when you are in a constructor this only refers to the static type of the constructor you are in and not the actual dynamic type of the object that is being created
119531
an object s base constructor is called before its own constructor
119531
by having a virtual call in an object s constructor you are introducing the possibility that inheriting objects will execute code before they have been fully initialized
119536
in c++ the object is not initialized and therefore it is unsafe to call a virutal function inside a constructor
119538
the lua version posted above is faster but relies on the truncation of double to a 32-bit result therefore it requires the x87 unit to be set to double precision and cannot be adapted for double to 64-bit int conversion
119539
the paper streamed lines branching patterns for parallel software development is an excellent discussion on branching patterns such as the main line pattern you mention - it lists the options in the form of patterns together with discussion of anti-patterns
119613
when you are in the constructor for some object in c# that object exists in a fully initialized just not constructed form as its fully derived type
119621
in addition to all the other comments about the practicalities of getting the project under source control i d encourage you to take a look at streamed lines branching patterns for parallel software development as guide to code line and branching policies - might save you some re-work later
119632
i want to run javascript python ruby inside my application
119665
delimited encoding makes it especially easy and fast to decode the values
119680
look into ironpython and ironruby -- these will allow you to easily interoperate with c#
119706
is there any way to determine the module handle of the module that contains the currently running code
119721
i think this is possible with ironpython and ironruby as well
119733
this does not happen with mysql or postgresql
119744
basically you have two problems how to define point of injections in your generated code and how to run python ruby whatev scripts from there
119744
the function would check whether the user has associated any scripts with given points and if so runs the script by invoking ironpython ironruby with optionally given parameters
119751
when using feature descriptors like sift surf - is approximate nearest neighbour the fastest method to do matching between images
119788
so what is a good way to write a shell script bash to recursively compare files with the same name in two different directories
119798
i would suggest that at your earliest convenience you dump that repository svnadmin dump and reload it into a new one backed by fsfs svnadmin load
119818
this is supposed to validate if the checkbox is selected in the page or not
119852
adobe air is a cross-platform runtime environment for building rich internet applications using adobe flash adobe flex html or ajax that can be deployed as a desktop application
119892
if you choose xhtml as a standard your markup will be more likely to be useful in an ajax environment
119909
if you choose to go with subversion and you want to host your own svn server then there is a very nice and easy windows based server called visualsvn server
120046
i recommend a combination of the sap business connector which provides an easy interface for receiving sending rfc calls from to the sap side and the ibm websphere java library which allows easy interaction with websphere
120052
that said it s possible that starting from a blank slate with git might actually be easier - my vcs experience is all with centralised version control cvs svn perforce... and part of my ongoing

for instance if you re running nunit the default testrunner will run in mta multi-threaded appartment while as wpf needs to run as sta single-threaded appartment
120076
chris uses a modified version of peter provost s crossthreadtestrunner to wrap the mta sta issues in a bit more friendly way
120084
where type is int double long long or whatever describes the alignment requirements
120140
on one hand i think that everyone should be free to use the set of developemnt tools they are most productive with as long as all source artifacts are stored in version control and the build script say ant or maven ensures standards compliance by specifying exactly which jdk to use which versions of which third party libraries to depend upon running style checks checkstyle and running unit tests etc
120140
on the other hand i think so many people use the same tools eclipse and often it is much better to have some things standardised at design time instead of build time - for example checkstyle is far more useful as an eclipse plugin than as an ant or maven task - that it is better to standardise on the set of development tools and a common set of plugins
120156
i also ommitted most of error checking whether given width height is out of bounds
120212
i have heard of parallels and virtualbox but i did not have the time to try them out

i m trying to put together a selector in sass that will operate on the visted hovered state of a link but i can t quite seem to get the markup right can someone enlighten me
120250
so is there a way to force python to use only 2 bytes for some integers equivalent of c++ short
120256
as long as the value stays in that array it will be a short integer

i m using vmware now as it supports usb virtualization which virtual pc doesn t
120284
let me list a few important details about how metaprogramming works in lisp or scheme or slate or pick your favorite dynamic language
120284
add prolog like backtracking to the language that very seamlessly integrates with normal lisp code see screamer
120317
and use javascript s settimeout or setinterval to do the periodic polling
120345
ie7 only sends windows credentials ntlm kerberos if it identifies the server as being on the intranet
120442
why no favicon for my web site
120469
the python documentation said the minimum size for that array of short integer is 2 bytes and

this creates a big problem with downloading excel spreadsheets as square brackets are not a valid filename character inside excel worksheet name
120506
the physical console is the monitor keyboard and mouse
120508
the actual test cases are created with junit dbunit and easymock
120530
from my experience of parallels and vmware on the pc and more extensively on the mac the difference between any 2 competing versions of the software is usually quite small and often reversed in the next releases
120530
i never found parallels to be much faster or slower than vmware - it often would be a case of the state of the vm i was running the host machine itself and the app s i was running within the vm
120530
if vmware brought out a new release which did something faster you could be sure that parallels would improve their performance in that area in the next release too
120530
i have trouble taking parallels vms from the mac to the pc and back again and this worked fine on vmware
120586
you can optionally return a value from the script that will be checked in the shell-script to exit restart immediately or sleep for a few seconds -and then restart
120614
window.onerror catches all errrors in ie and most errors in firefox but does nothing in safari and opera
120657
in case it matters i m grabbing a pipe to stderr for processing it but ignoring stdout and stdin

create an alias by creating a file var qmail aliases .qmail- blackhole with this content
120794
you can use cairo with pycairo which has support for rendering svgs
120820
equals uses hash code of pair class but take a look at the definition of gethashcode it just a combination of pair members hash codes - it s has nothing to do with equality of items
120825
the solution could be to reward posters if they self police tag their entry to the right category and give all users a way to filter out categories they do not want to see
120829
once upon a time i did this - installing a freebsd on x86- although i had some linux knowledge already at that time and it took me 3 hours mainly that much time because i was working on another machine in parallel
120832
it probably should complain that this does not make sense but when n.times is called in mri it returns an enumerator whereas jruby complains that it needs a block
120838
it supports oracle postgresql and mysql
120876
what are the c++ rules for calling the superclass constructor from a subclass one
120888
as for the original topic i ve used linux and unix extensively but have yet to get freebsd working after several tries over many years
120907
it works fine for order entry but causes problems with order reporting or editing since the product record has to track what kind of product it is in order to determine how to join product to its more detailed child product x or product y
120913
it has support for logging to console file recordstore canvas form bluetooth a serial port bluetooth ir usb socket incl ssl udp syslog mms sms e-mail or to amazon s3
120916
if you want to call a superclass constructor with an argument you must use the subclass s constructor initialization list
120933
terrence barr talks about running netbeans in virtualization like via virtualbox vmware fusion or parallels
120960
instead of changing the version manually i would recommend you use an md5 hash of the actual css file
120960
you could still use the rewrite rule to strip out the hash but the advantage is that now you can set your cache policy to cache forever since if the url is the same that means that the file is unchanged
120988
there are some libraries most often implemented in c c++ with python bindings
121054
it can only be called on an array object and not on the constructor array itself
121059
what is the best way to divide a 32 bit integer into four unsigned chars in c#
121094
i don t see any obvious reason for this - either of aforementioned constructs should get you something semantically equivalent to this with a very cheap index lookup
121099
edit it s a bug in the component draw always uses the highscoresmoduletext property on page which is only set when the page is a highscorestextpage and not any of the other pages eg highscorestablepage which showhighssores sets it to

on my current keyboard which is not a split this means the wide enter key the arrow keys and the number pad all jut out to the right before i have space for my mouse
121130
as the user expands nodes load children just in time
121154
i don t know of any keyboards like that but what might help is a keyboard with a built-in touchpad like for a laptop that you can use instead of your other mouse for some of your mousing small adjustments quick taps to click etc to avoid having to go out to the mouse
121177
we essentially created a full product product attribute definition system data types min max occurrences default values required flags usage scenarios etc. the system worked ultimately but came with a significant cost in overhead and performance materialized views to visualize products custom smart components to represent and validate data entry ui for product definition another smart component to represent the product instance s customizable attributes on the order line blahblahblah
121178
i m left handed so my mouse is quite close to the keyboard
121178
if you re having trouble with your mouse being too far out to the right you could try a small footprint keyboard such as a happy hacking keyboard and a separate numeric pad on the left or somewhere else to get a more clement key layout
121191
my mouse usage is minimal though because i focus on using the keyboard for everything
121205
java -classpath jmxquery org.nagios.jmxquery -u service jmx rmi jndi rmi localhost 8004 jmxrmi -o java.lang type memory -a nonheapmemoryusage

i don t believe the .net treeview supports what you want although this type of model is supported by .net s datagridview see datagridview s virtualmode property
121246
i move my keyboard and mouse around i change my position and the position of those two
121246
additionally i use keyboard shortcuts a lot to not overuse the mouse
121246
this way i got rid of my wrist problems without replacing keyboard or mouse
121280
how do i detect what browser ie firefox opera the user is accessing my site with
121280
examples in javascript php asp python jsp and any others you can think of would be helpful
121289
hashbytes to return the md2 md4 md5 sha or sha1 hash of its input

the fact that array.slice is even non-null at all is an incorrect implementation of the object function constructor itself
121316
we see it as 2 by recognizing that nsthread is a cocoa framework which provides a set of handy features
121316
but the kicker is this the cocoa framework here nsthread is providing us this handy service in a way that is explicitly tied to the language the framework has been written in
121323
armv6 even has saturated addition subtraction and all the other stuff for 32 bits and packed numbers
121336
finally especially if you are going to validate the date you might want to use perl for the whole job or python or ruby or tcl or any scripting language of your choice

what is the best way to access a running mono application via the command line linux unix
121482
by definition statically typed languages like java and c# are strongly typed but so are many popular dynamic languages like ruby and python
121507
i load the initial tree root + children + grandchildren deep
121507
when any node is expanded i load the tree nodes that would represent the grandchildren of the expanding node if any
121507
you can visually decorate tree nodes to indicate they are still loading for the case where a user gets ahead of your io to the data store
121545
my suggestion is to start with assuming pear pecl modules and get the rest of the code done
121547
code it initially using pear pecl and if you get people asking for a non pear pecl version start coding your own alternatives then for such a version
121565
if you want to cover your bases make sure you store the date in utc and pick an iso standard
121580
3des yes it s obsolete but it s a good starting point for learning fiestel and block cyphers and there are some good lessons in it s creation from des

121607
loadviewstate is the only place to add dynamic controls where their viewstate values will be restored when recreated and you can access the viewstate in order to determine which controls to add
121611
if you re just trying to make something that works go with pear pecl
121611
once you understand the innards of whatever you re trying to replace you may want to switch to the pear pecl version so that you re not wasting time reimplementing what has already been implemented.
121620
primitive data byte char int double and arrays of them byte ... are erasable by writing new random content into them
121620
if we talk about passwords it s better to use crypto-strong hash functions md5 sha1 ... and never ever work with passwords in clear text
121638
for example i have seen in the past all about the cakephp but lately i have just come across the symfony project and was thinking that if i had a server stack set up i could develop at home how would i go about deploying anything live
121651
i realise this doesn t exactly answer your question but there s a library called squirtle that will render svg files using either pyglet or pyopengl
121652
as a rule of thumb it is best to commit all merge modifications in a single commit and to only have the merge modifications in the commit so that you can rollback the merge later if needed

termite a port of erlang s process approach and message passing to scheme
121697
again i have to admit i ve never tried to use cakephp on a server but i have setup codeigniter before and it really is that simple
121708
however you can pull the newly-focused element from the document
121713
is there any way to set this attribute to be preserved via subversion or do i have to write a script to get the date of each file and have him run touch after each intial check out
121731
i know of reia - a language that is based on erlang but looks more like python ruby
121736
if you have complex graphics like ones made in photoshop or paint.net with multiple layers you may be better off by allowing the client a choice of only a few colors 4-8-16 and pre-make the graphics to match the selections
121790
you can use iostat on linux unix to get some feedback on the i o and there s iotop too though it s not packaged in many distros yet
121808
i can use properties of an excel worksheet to tell if the worksheet is protected worksheet.protection worksheet.protectcontents etc

121862
in iis manager expand the local computer expand the web sites folder right-click the web site or virtual directory that you want and then click properties
121872
i don t like dynamic event-handling bind unbind since they tend to get out of hand when called from different points of your code
121873
i suspect that you can get rid of the outer query and put distinct on the inner but i m not sure
121882
the first one works because cassini is handling all requests the second one doesn t work because iis is looking for that directory and it doesn t exist instead of the .net framework running the code you have
121902
for instance a binary search algorithm would have a worst case scenario of o log n on a sorted set whereas a linear search s worst case is o n

if you re inclined to start using a lot of javascript on your site jquery makes playing with the dom extremely simple
121947
i come from the java camp where i can happily hand-code swing awt guis and thus don t have a clue where to start
121950
this means that you can do multiplication and division by doing addition and subtraction of the logs
121975
in-block code i tend to leave a comment above a block of lines to explain what it does or one at the end of line if it s a short and cryptic function-call
121977
one option might be to use the svnadmin dump and load commands
121977
dump the repository using svnadmin dump
121977
load the updated dump file back in using svnadmin load
121994
given a set of ordered data think a sorted array of int s you want to find the index key to a value in that data

so in short wpf or silverlight is a paradign shift in the way we do winforms development
122089
a brief search shows that all available uunix command line tools that convert from xsd xml schema to rng relaxng or rnc compact relaxng have problems of some sort
122101
run them on vmware server or virtualbox
122115
is there a maintained replacement that allows for separating stdin stdout and stderr
122118
handling the mouse click and the mouse double click are not necessary once you can create your own ui editor
122126
checkout the revision where the directory was still almost empty and then use svn cat to extract the file from head
122144
beginmethod asynccallback callback
122174
in summary if your single-parameter constructor converts the parameter into an object of your class you probably don t want to use the explicit keyword
122176
.net3.5 sp1 is really matured to do asp.net and standalone ui development wpf and silverlight
122268
note in particular that element names are case-insensitive in html but case-sensitive in xml
122268
in this case the backslash is followed by at most six hexadecimal digits 0..9a..f which stand for the iso 10646 iso10646 character with that number which must not be zero
122276
one thing i know doesn t work is to close stdin or attach it to a pipe before running sudo -s true
122277
i switched from perl to python about a year ago and haven t looked back
122277
there is only one idiom that i ve ever found i can do more easily in perl than in python
122299
i recommend lucida console for windows users and adobe courier for linux unix with a size of 10pt these fonts looks great
122307
i think it would if you ran the executable under one account and then changed it s credentials with code like sp does
122328
vs add-ins for svn such as visualsvn will automatically ignore those files on your behalf
122344
another thing that helped me much more than replacing the keyboard is replacing the mouse
122357
there ins t an option for setting the size but if you do set the size some browsers will let you set the width height properties to whatever you want via css

setuptools distutils will work for installation and your program may be running in a virtualenv where your pythonpath is completely user-local so it shouldn t assume use of the system site-packages directly either
122410
it has a control column type of selected or something like that which will display a checkbox in the column with the other column populated from your bound datasource
122410
the user can select any rows desired by checking the checkbox on the row and you can get all the selected rows easily inot a collection to process
122424
both of which are perfectly possible with perforce but the git workflow has some advantages. so although tributary development would be distributed and not refer to a common revision sequencing we d still maintain a master git repo that all changes would need to feed into before a build was created
122435
for a while it was using mysql but after porting the entire project over from perl to erlang i decided to go for the gold and migrate all of the data into couchdb and use that instead
122470
or you can override the constructor for your function object to pass in the params that way
122546
in order to handle some problems with the way webkit and ie handle links at the end of lines there s no way to use the cursor to get out of the link on the same line we insert a blank element and move the selection to that than collapse right
122571
edit sorry i should ve specified jndi to lookup the db connection and jdbc to perform the operations

implementation by layering itself on top of tomcat s jndi instantiation
122714
anyone have any thoughts on how i can configure the jboss naming service which according to the above quote is overriding tomcat s jndi implementation so that i can do a lookup on java comp env
122723
an httpresponse is something that is sent back to the client in response to an httprequest
122724
is there a java package providing funcionality like the .net system.data namespace
122739
we are currently working on deploying a .net clr function to make some wcf calls in the db
122742
i m not sure how it works if the server uses client authentication only on specific paths because the initial ssl handshake is complete before the client transmits the http request
122752
assume i m primarily interested in unix linux including macos x but i wouldn t automatically ignore windows-only solutions
122811
an alternative though more effort would be to use something like virtualbox or the free version of vmware and run a light-weight linux distro where you could use the loopback mounting feature and expose it via samba as a windows-share
122840
makes certain things harder than it has to be but that s not something you re going to miss unless you re coming from nemerle ocaml haskell or something along those lines
122858
i was looking at httpmodule and httphandler when i had used webclient.downloadfile in the past
122865
the iframe has its content with a popup having a z-index of 1000
122876
when inserting a dom element you have to re-retrieve your handle if you wish to reference its siblings since the handle is invalid i m not sure but i think it refers to a dom element inside of a document fragment and not the one inside of the document. after re-retrieving the handle from the insert operation movetoelementtext stopped throwing an exception
122911
also use strncpy instead of strcpy to avoid buffer overruns
122947
join superclass instance to subclass instance
122947
java programmers use ibatis or hibernate or toplink or cocoon python programmers use sqlalchemy or sqlobject
122954
if it is change the value and remove the end time field if it isn t do nothing
122954
any suggestions for improvements or better methods would be greatly appreciated preferably in php or perl
122981
i think you ll need on the provider to send the data be sure to flush and then on the requester use fopen fread to read an expected amount of data so you can drop the connection to the provider and continue
123002
now before i started using an inversion of control container i would have created a factory and maybe even a simple objectsettings object for each of the objects that requires more than 1 setting to keep the size of the constructor to the recommended less than 4 parameter size
123005
for example you could get the default namespace uri on the document element using the path
123005
a second way of getting that namespace uri is to use the namespace-uri function on the document element which you ve said will always be in that namespace
123005
you could go one step further and test the namespace uri of the element against the one of the document element if you really wanted
123011
override malloc free and new delete with wrappers that keep track of how big the allocations are and by recording the callstack and later resolving it against the symbol table where they are made from
123029
one drawback of an interfce in .net 2.0 at least is that you cannot have private members or protected it must be public
123034
first rule of cryptography and password storage is don t invent it yourself but if you must here is the absolute minimum you must do to have any semblance of security
123037
i ve had to work with divs and iframes when creating a javascript menu that should show overtop dropdown boxes and listboxes -- other menu implementations just hide these items whose default behavior in ie6 is to show on top of any div no matter the z-index
123043
however you can get away with just taking the max width and max height of your skewed rectangle
123044
if you prefer closing a tab window over hitting the back button then by all means click links with your middle mouse button
123076
edit double metaphone was specifically designed to be better than soundex and work in languages other than english
123077
there s bbfreeze and pyinstaller and py2app also
123084
you can try to show the iframe without the content in which case the popup displays normally
123125
i recognize there is no actual building for php but you could set up automation to change any configuration or setup issues and save everything off to a folder ready to be implemented
123133
it s the webserver which looks at the host topleveldomain.com header and knows that s equivalent to server.sharedhost.com username
123139
virtual hosts aren t a dns trick they re an http trick - the hostname requested is sent by the browser in a host field of every request
123144
in the callback the properties on my server control which were previously set in order to display the data are not set yet any of the other standard controls on the page still have their property settings
123176
you may want to try appending an iframe under your popup that is the same size as your popup
123176
with ie7 if you render the iframed popup after the other iframe has already loaded you should be able to cover up elements that are beneath
123176
i believe some js calendars and some lightbox thickbox code does this if you are looking for examples
123180
i follow the java python ideal that namespaces should follow the directory structure
123181
is there a way to do this dynamically at runtime using reflection
123205
you can use an autoresetevent or manualresetevent
123232
works on win32 and linux at least and probably any other unix system
123234
ideally something that will work with oracle ms sql server mysql and posgress
123235
i was trying to remove all the lines of a file except the last line but the following command did not work although file.txt is not empty
123240
delphi 7 onwards technically object pascal or delphi language i guess
123251
although you cannot test for randomness you can test that for correlation or distribution of a sequence of numbers
123307
as i understand it elementtree code can easily be ported to lxml
123315
starts usr bin tail -1 reading from the pipe and writing to file.txt
123322
the lightbox display of the original larger sized images in a modal box is handled in javascript with a library such as thickbox
123387
the only thing we can rely on is http port 80 and https 443
123387
if not after a timeout the connection is closed with a no-data response
123387
second about half the time the client times out without any response from the server the client timeout is five minutes longer than the server s
123401
using jquery how do you bind a click event to a table cell below class expand that will change the image src which is in the clicked cell - original will be plus.gif alternating with minus.gif and hide show the row immediately below it based on whether that row has a class of hide
123401
show it if it has a class of hide and hide if it does not have a class of hide
123421
ordinarily i would look to see this entirely within an open-source license-free environment like a php mysql apache server environment however strict it approvals processes have limited the areas of exploration to oracle as the db component with java then making the likely programming environment
123421
e-commerce style checkout system no payment methods or infrastructure required
123451
if the spread between the min and max occurrences is small then your distribution is good
123485
in the edit view include another hidden field for the field you want to monitor but suffix the field name with something like _prev and set the value to the current value of the field you want to monitor
123488
seems your question is really a struggle between oracle java and php mysql
123518
you don t need the show and hide tags
123549
if this code is called in response to an awt event mouse click button press ... then that s not the problem but if it s still the same thread that started your app or this code is running off a timer could very well be

123645
every tcp udp client on the local network has up to 65535 ports in use except port 0 and a private ip
123645
on return it translates the port back and replaces the public with a private ip again before forwarding the package back
123647
you might look into using snmp and the host-resource mib
123648
do i create another field in the vehicle table that is veh color that holds the text value of what is selected in the drop down in addition to fk atr vehiclecolor
123677
if you need to do this to import a large amount of data then consider that bulk insert does not fire the triggers
123677
but then your process after the bulk insert will have to fix up any data integrity problems you introduce by nor firing the triggers
123743
another option is to use substance or nimbus if you want something different from the metal look and feel
123743
substance is a separate look and feel collection and nimbus is available as of the 6u10 release
123776
from one of the pages within the iframe i want to look back and make a panel on the default page invisible because it is overshadowing a popup
123786
skype and im clients such as live messenger are also good tools
123818
you can access all of these scopes via the httpservletrequest variable that is passed in to the methods that extend from the httpservlet class
123822
supposing you are testing a range for randomness within integers one way to verify this is to create a gajillion well maybe 10 000 or so random numbers and plot their occurrence on a histogram
123822
if you were to write a binary file of say 10 000 random numbers from your generator using say a random number from 1 to 1024 and try to compress that file using some compression zip gzip etc. then you could compare the two file sizes
123848
if you want to develop against wordpress have a local instance running on your machine so you can develop themes get blogs and sites laid out etc. and you re running windows on your development machine with iis and sql server already installed what s the best way to do it
123855
i started with trac but i found the mercurial support and the administrative interface for everything to be much better in redmine
123909
try the keyboard shortcut to get to the window s main menu then hit m for move and hit an arrow key to attach the window to the mouse - then at the next move of the mouse it should jump to it
123932
but the best advice i can give you is to catch the exceptions and log them in an error log so you have the stack trace for debugging later
123969
this will give you the document height and width in inches which you could then compare to the min size needed
123999
is there an efficient way to tell if a dom element in an html document is currently visible appears in the viewport
124012
the advent of new problem domains break this condition of course so you just need to build something so clever that it is obvious after the fact.
124055
i have a website asp.net and some winforms .net 2.0 for a project written in c#
124065
3 could be an int a double or a string
124077
on the client side in the iframe you could use some javascript code to access the outer page s dom and set the visibility of it there
124109
if you need to capture this output in a variable you can do that with the output buffering functions
124124
watch out because sql datetime columns are non-nullable and their minimum value is 1 1 1753 while .net datetimes are non-nullable with min values of 1 1 0001
124156
you basically add an element that appears somehow on the page for example the pop-ups on stack overflow when you earn a badge with an appropriate message then remove this with some javascript that runs as soon as the page is loaded and i mean the dom not the whole page
124171
i d be very grateful if you could compare the winning o rourke s perl solution to lundh s python solution as i don t know perl good enough to understand what s going on there
124177
the only way to do this is to use ssl tls https
124181
or use jquery and wrap a fadeout call in settimeout
124187
for example if you want to protect the parameters sent by your java app to your server from an attacker who has access to the communication channel you should consider communicating with the server via tls ssl https in your case and the likes
124203
java will also offer the whole write once run everywhere thing and open up a path to doing unix linux server based integration projects
124226
modbus rtu over tcp udp and com-port
124242
the pivot unpivot operators have been a big win for me
124248
so for instance you d use a secure random number generator to generate a 128 bit random key for aes and encrypt those 16 bytes with rsa
124248
algorithms like rsa are much less user-friendly than aes
124248
that is actually not the case with rsa which is --- more so than aes --- just a math equation
124248
block crypto algorithms like aes do suffer from this problem too but without a pki aes is no less safe than rsa
124255
there are so many factors that it s hard to say what s the exact difference
124255
python s regular expression engine is a custom one and not as much used as the perl one
124277
the project s been abandoned for a while in my opinion using delphi to develop a c++ ide is a very stupid thing to do to draw developers attention however there s nothing that stops you from using it and updating the version of mingw s gcc it uses to the latest one - besides it s gpl-licensed
124285
i prefer to use objects for collections of data instead of arrays since it organizes the data a little better and i know i m a lot less likely to try to add arbitrary properties to an object than i am to try to add an index to an array for the first few years i used php i thought you couldn t just assign arbitrary properties to an object so it s ingrained to not do that
124378
i connect to my corporate lan using vpn from the main os the host but my vm s aren t seeing the servers in the corporate lan
124384
in other words you can downcast to reverse the effect of previous upcasting
124410
for spatial queries for example finding all nodes within a rectangle you do a depth-first search of the tree starting at the root and you use the discriminant at each level to avoid searching down branches that contain no nodes in the given rectangle
124426
using these tools you can see if it s stale credentials used in your app bad password overloads or some security elsewhere that s being tripped by your application that your ad policies don t like
124427
simple directmedia layer is a cross-platform multimedia library designed to provide low level access to audio keyboard mouse joystick 3d hardware via opengl and 2d video framebuffer
124452
you may instead want to consider accepting that you will have to re-code the view and controller for the different platforms and instead concentrate on keeping your controllers extremely thin and putting the bulk of your code in a service layer that can be shared
124460
you could use an msbuild on nant build script to do that
124498
if it is possible in your situation a cleaner method is to use an intended protocol for directory listings like the file transfer protocol ftp sftp ftp like over ssh or ftps ftp over ssl
124528
namespaces can have any number of dots in them but sql identifiers can t unless the parts are explicitly set apart by square brackets
124533
you d need to declare a new object of type function with the function constructor assigning a variable an anonymous function etc. and copy over any properties of methods from your old object
124536
i don t think you can - it s not an array it s an associative array like a perl hash or an awk array
124550
they are similar to .so files in linux unix
124604
coming from a perl 5 background what are the advantages of moving to perl 6 or python
124612
perl is generally better than python for quick one liners especially involve text regular expressions
124623
i m looking to compute the moore-penrose pseudo-inverse of a matrix in c++ can someone point me to a library implementation or a numerical recipe
124638
i found an article on getting active tcp udp connections on a machine
124641
for example from command prompt or a terminal
124641
if a udp packet is sent to a port that is not open the system will respond with an icmp port unreachable message
124679
do you know a dynamic language like perl python ruby groovy
124679
what c is best at in my opinion is low-level programming that involves hardware access hefty math and highly efficient algorithms
124689
on c++ your only other alternatives are mfc and wxwidgets
124694
when i set up my own repository i used visualsvn which took 2 secs to run and didn t involve any apache or lamp stuff
124722
because the model might be changed from outside the controller there might be other controllers using the same model undo operations etc the controller listens to changes on the model
124722
modify the controller to set a flag when the model is updated and not react to any events from the model if this flag is set
124727
i ve only used it with mysql but it claims firebird support
124768
so if you plug a machine with a packet sniffer into the switch it will only be able to see traffic to and from the sniffing machine
124778
i couldn t get it to work with a mousemove event on the usercontrol but putting a keydown event to set the focus works although the template doesn t update to the focused template
124797
there is no advantage to be gained by switching from perl to python
124797
there is also no advantage to be gained by switching from python to perl
124798
a language like python ruby or erlang will really expand your horizons as a programmer
124804
i like perl a lot but as soon as i learned enough python to get it i never turned back
124804
in my experience random snippets of python tend to be more readable than random snippets of perl
124804
the difference really comes down to the culture around each language where perl users often appreciate cleverness while python users more often prefer clarity
124804
that s not to say you can t have clear perl or devious python but those are much less common
124804
i personally lean toward python if for no other reason in that it seems to be gaining momentum while perl seems to be losing users to python and ruby
124822
create sequence which is more or less the equivalent of an orrible function that generates unique numbers when selected from as opposed to serial which generates the unique number when the row is inserted
124830
for watching local network traffic your best bet with a decent switch is to set your switch to route all packets out a specific interface as well as whatever interface it would normally send
124830
on a 100 megabit network however you ll want a gigabit port on your switch to plug it into or to filter on protocol trim out http ftp printing traffic from the fileserver etc. or your switch s buffers are going to fill up pretty much instantly and it ll start dropping whatever packets it needs to and your network performance will die
124835
you can do this with most systems cvs svn git and so on
124842
maybe f# for example or give ruby or python a try
124844
any subset of the flags may be set for a given entry
124844
usually i do c and c++ work so my gut reaction is to use an unsigned integer field as a set of bits which can be flipped.
124861
using this you can create an arbitrary number of bit fields that mysql is happy to treat as binary hex or decimal values however you need
124896
rest requires you to define resources named via uri s and transactions based on the canonical crud rules get post put and delete
124903
you could make the constructor private then provide a public static factory method to create the objects
124930
can t you just get the image data and put it on the clipboard directly
124944
if iis doesn t fit your requirements you should choose another web server such as apache with mod_mono or lighttpd
124949
drools is used to apply price promotions and discount over products while users just navigates inside the product s catalog
124949
and while checking out the products there are may promotions that can be applied due to the customer address region state age sex product amount product amount per category combined promotions holidays and so on
124951
you can use webrequest or webclient class to load data via proxy and pass obtained response stream to xmldocument
124956
if i had a choice i d go with a system like debian or ubuntu and set up a repository that the systems could all pull from
125001
the worksheet data is a dictionary where the keys are row col pairs starting with 0 and the values are the cell contents -- generally int float or string
125011
c in your constructor for this object have a synchronized run-once call to this function similar to a singleton pattern
125030
a logarithmic function is simply the inverse of an exponential function in the same sense that subtraction is the inverse of addition
125030
a quick-and-dirty emphasis on dirty interpretation of the common base 10 logarithm of some number x is that it is one less than the number of decimal digits required to express numbers the size of x
125068
atlassian fisheye allows you to get commit notification on email as well as rss and as a bonus you can select which directory file to subscribe to and only get notified of those file dir changes
125111
if you were using scala there is scala check - but i am not sure how well it works with java source even though its all byte code
125128
the properties are gecko-only firefox mozilla camino the properties are webkit-only chrome safari epiphany
125130
the -moz ones are firefox specific the -webkit ones are for safari chrome and a few other browsers that use that rendering engine
125131
those are for firefox the ones labeled -moz-border and for safari -webkit-border
125136
you could use a metaclass that auto-wraps methods or class attributes that follow a naming convention into properties shamelessly taken from unifying types and classes in python 2.2
125179
you might look at the internals of webrick to see a simple server daemon coded in ruby -- or if you want something more performant look at mongrel or thin
125187
keep in mind that and javascript fanciness is messing with the brower s internal dom model of the page and does nothing to the raw html
125188
what i m trying to achieve is to determine if the postscript that i m parsing contains any element that resides in a table box
125209
now draw a triangle with this distance and the wheelbase pencilled in plus some sin and cos equations approximations and you might get an approximate equation like
125230
search for foo and replace with bar so a record with a field with the value hello foo becomes hello bar
125292
non bash ways abound awk perl sed and so on
125303
also perl 6 has both a primitive boolean type and by having true and false roles that any value can mix in so you can have a 0 but true value or a 1 but false one for example or a false list containing elements or a true list that s empty
125313
edit i realized that each particular launcher java python etc has its own configuration method so i will restrict this question to the java domain which is what i need most
125314
afaik this method works in all cases in firefox and safari
125361
possible workarounds would be running the source through html tidy or some other cleaner if you re after valid markup
125379
the ability of the interpreter to deduce type and type conversions makes development time faster but it also can provoke runtime failures which you just cannot get in a statically typed language where you catch them at compile time
125379
mobile code runtime reflection etc
125415
these are usually implented in a device driver or the kernel
125463
i created an abstract class that extends jpanel
125463
the concreted class that extends the abstract one are responsible for defining control and deciding what do to with the data when a line is added or deleted from the jtable
125463
i told myself i could use the same concrete custom jpanel attributespanel which extends the abstract jpanel class i created to store the methods for a class or and interface
125484
so let s say i write a simple c program that counts all numbers or the fibonacci sequence or something else without stopping
125491
it doesn t get around the one-use typedef unless you put that in a header which is always an option but it makes the resulting code shorter by one iterator
125505
i don t think you can set any part of the sheet to be editable only by vba but you can do something that has basically the same effect -- you can unprotect the worksheet in vba before you need to make changes
125535
the interrupt is a physical signal in the processor that tells the cpu to store its current state and jump to interrupt or exception handler code
125548
i believe it can also help embed images hosted on flickr and videos from youtube
125569
making any change to a row probably takes just as much i o as writing the entire row except of course updating indexed columns also requires index writes so you lose out by making several updates which hit lots of rows
125586
for example using sdl or cairo if portability is needed
125586
somehow it has become a model of simple graphics language there are several applications trying to mimic processing in other languages like ruby scala or python
125586
one of the most impressive is a javascript implementation using the canvas component implemented in firefox safari opera etc
125615
both mandriva red hat based and ubuntu debian based have packages for the boost libriaries
125666
examples in php python c c++ preferred but in other languages is fine if the methodology is explained properly
125684
unfortunately until the release of a security update on october 12 2004 windows would not enforce this rule allowing an application to set any other application s gwl_userdata
125697
i just wondering how the .net wcf application caching is implemented
125710
my ultimate goal here is to write a utility that lets me quickly set the folder on any dialog box choosing from a preset list of favorites
125762
this technique means that given a set of images each individual image can t appear more than once every iteration through your list
125763
now if this is a comparegenerator it really should either return a boolean true or false or a int 0 or 1 lets use the former
125767
and as noted several times already interrupts are usually triggered by outside entities such as hardware or users such as a mouse click or keystroke like ctrl-c while exceptions are generated thrown synchronously by software detecting a problem or exceptional condition
125801
the university of oslo has recently starting teaching python as the default language for all science students outside the department of informatics who still learn java
125804
every programmer should have some experience with a modern jit d oo language c# java a lower-level simpler language c fortran etc a very high level interpreted language python ruby etc and a functional language scheme lisp haskell etc
125806
i have actually a fairly similar problem in that i need to be able to capture input for mouse keyboard joystick and i d also like to avoid sdl if at all possible
125806
the point is to capture mouse motion keyboard press release mouse clicks and potentially joystick handling for a game
125816
and from the other end i think everyone should know a bit of something like haskell or lisp to get an idea of higher-level stuff and see some of the ideas being introduced in c# 3 in a cleaner form
125833
however i feel that learning lessons from languages like haskell python and even arguably regex not exactly a language but you catch my drift
125852
it s inference which is undecidable as it requires higher order unification

gives you the active tcp udp ports
126062
then you can use the ports with fuser -n tcp or fuser -n udp as root and supposing that fuser is gnu fuser or has similar options
126087
this module implements rfc 2047 mime
126088
because we set the capacity of itemstokeep we don t waste any time copying values during a resize
126103
i think that the encode module handles that with the mime-header encoding so try this
126116
i am trying to create a web servlet to allow ftp users to change their passwords without ssh login access

is there any python module for rendering a html page with javascript and get back a dom object
126138
it doesn t appear to be possible to get a channel from an inputstream or outputstream filestream has a getchannel method but that doesn t help here
126149
so you send it autorelease instead which puts it in the autorelease pool which is emptied once control gets back to the program s event loop
126154
in users view the individual columns of the table row have labels to display a record values and when users click on edit button the labels are hidden and text boxes are displayed for users to edit values - the problem is - as soon as the text boxes are visible the table size increases - the row height and cells size becomes large
126163
technically the environment.userinteractive checks if the wsf_visible flag is set for the current window station but is there any other reason where it would return false apart from being run as a non-interactive service
126196
we d like to show this over multiple lines and possibly apply some formatting to the final line
126201
however in order for the invocation to work on the nested list the pointer would have to be a reference to that list not your class
126254
set the s width and height to those px values so they re no longer relative
126254
in your css make sure the input has no padding margin border and set width 100 line-height 1em and height 1em
126254
when you switch back make sure you un-set the width and height so they return to automatic values
126264
we don t use jsf spring mvc here so i can t comment on the added complexity of that framework in an osgi context
126264
when a web ui contributing bundle activates and publishes its controllers they are automatically picked up by our central web ui bundle and the aforementioned custom url mapper gathers these controller services and keeps an up to date map of urls to controller instances
126267
unless you have truly biblical data volumes and are choosing between oracle and a shared nothing architecture such as teradata you will probably see little practical difference between oracle and sql server
126300
if the iis server has a secondary token the ntauthority anonymous account credentials are used

i had to implement exact check upon file upload recently and what i came up with is swfupload library which totally met my requirements and also has a lot of additional features
126311
with your preferred cell width height
126311
assign the class to both your label and textbox and you should not get width height changes when switching control thanks to the display block property
126311
in that case i would suggest ignoring height problems just set the width to be consistent and always show a 3-4 lines textbox for editing
126315
this way clicking both the menuitem and the button will execute the same code and provide the same functionality
126341
requires a running glib and gtk but that s probably less problematic than wrapping the parts of webkit without glib
126366
as you said the solution outlined in this answer is the traditional way of reading both stdout and stderr from a process
126374
using encapsulation you can define any set of policies to access the inner private member
126388
one technique is to use a well-known hash algorithm say md5 or sha-1 and use only the first 32 bits of the result
126392
in addition this is the most general solution it scales best in the future as you add more keys it is easy to code the sql to get the data out and the database will be able to optimise the query better than you would imagine i wouldn t put effort into prematurely optimising this case unless it was proven to be a bottleneck in testing later on in which case you could consider the next two options below
126397
so you keep the itemid field then have an xml field that contains the xml defined for some key value pairs like
126417
using a dictionary you can map almost any input to some other value object function
126423
if your use case allows for combining both stdout and stderr of the process in question you need only one thread otherwise two are needed
126426
system.web.routing is part of .net 3.5 sp1 and you can use it both for your asp.net webform-application and your mvc-application
126445
this looks just right in firefox safari and opera
126457
in the expression s foo bar you actually have a regular expression foo and a substitution bar that should replace what is matched by the expression
126457
in the approaches you ve tried thus far you ran into problems trying to use eval mainly because of the likelihood of special characters in the expression that either interfere with eval or get interpolated gobbled up in the process of evaluation
126470
some of them support paging like mysql with the limit clause rowid with oracle
126470
open to debate unless it is built into the database system itself or unless there is a company say abc that uses oracle mysql sql server and they decide to have all the various database systems provide their own implementation of paging by their database developers providing a universal interface for the code that uses it
126473
just as addition of the float type is inaccurate multiplication of the decimal types can be inaccurate or cause inaccuracy if you exceed the precision
126473
since you multiplied numeric 24 8 and numeric 24 8 and sql server will only check the type not the content it probably will try to save the potential 16 non-decimal digits 24 - 8 when it can t save all 48 digits of precision max is 38
126473
again between numeric 24 8 and numeric 38 6 sql server will try to save the potential 32 digits of non-decimals so a + d reduces to
126481
although trac can be configured to use mysql or postgresql too
126484
edited to add in perl system vi just works because perl doesn t do the kind of fancy pipelining buffering php does
126486
i haven t don t really know about jquery but i do know that the dojo toolkit does make highly unobtrusive javascript possible
126505
assuming you re on an embedded platform you might find that your toolchain has a go at this
126507
this is similar to what ted elliot suggested but the usage of runtime type handles instead of full type objects avoids the overhead of loading the type object through reflection
126526
i m using nunit but i had the same issues with mstest
126573
for example i d like to simulate a mouse click on a button and validate that a movie-clip is displayed at the right position and in the right color.

to manage this a number of system development life cycle sdlc models have been created waterfall fountain spiral build and fix rapid prototyping incremental and synchronize and stabilize
126632
version your css js files whenever you deploy something like screen.1233.css the number can be your svn revision if you use a versioning system
126685
index.php would implement your front controller which routes the page request based on the parameters given
126722
behaviour at these switch points is then either inherited from the superclass overridden to provide new behaviour or implemented to avoid a compiler error when the super method is abstract
126744
host the help files on my webserver
126746
the solution is certainly one that includes having proper network security at the server and network level to really reduce the number of people who can get access to the system and having the database credentials only give access to a database account with the bare minimum of permissions required for the application to run
126759
i ve created an implementation of the qabstractlistmodel class in qt jambi 4.4 and am finding that using the model with a qlistview results in nothing being displayed however using the model with a qtableview displays the data correctly
126771
most probable source of the myth is that many people get only to know lisp from a cs course about scheme where they write themselves an interpreter
126772
if the administrator hits the reload button in firefox explorer safari everything gets refreshed fine and the new image just appears
126773
there are a couple of more or less well-known and widespread members of this family scheme common lisp emacs-lisp and autolisp are the traditional ones
126773
i do not know much about autolisp or all the other lisp dialects beside scheme and common lisp but what i do know is that common lisp is definitely not a single-paradigm language that eschews imperative or even object-oriented programming
126799
another couple of usual-suspects are quicksort and mergesort

check out memcached and apc they re both free and highly performant
126978
should i use a hand-written schema for my projected developed in a high-level language such as python ruby or should i let my orm solution auto-generate it

blackberry applications can be standard midp apps or cldc apps that make use of the blackberry specific apis
127040
how can i do that in firefox safari and or chrome
127099
the second example uses c style block commenting which allows for commenting across multiple lines or in the middle of a line
127130
the case is different in .net projects which mix c# and asp.net for example within one codebase
127165
if you find one that does chances are they ll have apc enabled and may even be able to provide a mechanism for memcached
127170
the scrollbars you see most often including those built into most winforms controls are rendered by windows and there is no way to override their appearance in winforms short of implementing an entirely custom solution which completely takes over the rendering and behavior of the common scrollbar control
127188
can you explain sta and mta in your own words
127197
there s also www.mygenerationsoftware.com but they only advertise support for template based code generator supporting four template languages - jscript vbscript c# and vb.net.
127213
that throws out java .net python and many others
127220
in the constructor of an object you can call methods defined in that object or base classes but you cannot expect to call something that will be provided by a derived class because parts of the derived class are not constructed yet
127233
it does not implement ienumerable but has 2 methods that pass back a ienumerator
127306
if you re implying runtime reflection then no
127340
this means mta threads that create apartment objects will be marshalling all calls to a different thread. the class factory can be called concurrently by multiple sta threads so it must protect its internal data against this
127340
it will always load in the mta even if created by an sta thread which again means the sta thread s calls will be marshalled
127340
they must be written to fit both sets of requirements however they must protect their internal state against concurrent calls in case they re loaded in the mta but must not block in case they re loaded in an sta
127340
worker threads should use the mta unless they re going to use apartment -marked com components in which case use the sta to avoid marshalling overhead and scalability problems if the same component is called from multiple threads as each thread will have to wait for the component in turn
127340
it s much easier all around if you use a separate com object per thread whether the component is in the sta or mta
127342
according to dave mills article ntp v3 is accurate to 1-2ms in a lan and 10s of ms in wan nets

i have seen the books and lists about design patterns in static object oriented languages java c++ but also the videos about design patterns in python
127377
i m interested in to see some common design patterns in other languages like forth icon lisp etc

conventionally the commit message of such a commit will contain the svn revision number of the second parent commit which you simply translate to the corresponding commit id
127393
the cost of the whole operation is o 4 n since the lookup in the map dictionary may be considered constant
127412
these are nice but i would like one that allows for many configurable extensions html css js vb c# java python ...

your code can t even tell the difference between count 1 and 1 1
127477
in wpf how do you find out if any of your data bound controls have validation errors set
127516
guideline #4 a base class destructor should be either public and virtual or protected and nonvirtual
127520
when your frame receives an onsize message it will give you the new width and height - you can simply call the cedit setwindowpos method passing it these values
127530
how do i add the field to a particular column or rearrange the field order
127531
you can use inheritance to extend c-structs with methods and constructors
127556
the problem i m having is that when i click on the checkbox or its content the parent listboxitem does not get selected
127556
if i click on the white space next to the checkbox the listboxitem does get selected
127578
in short the formula is 171 - 5.2 ln avev - 0.23 avev g - 16.2 ln aveloc + 50 sin sqrt 2.4 percm
127582
in fact i find that it s more common for my interfaces to have protected dtors than it is for them to have public ones
127617
you should add onsize handler in your frame class and inside this handler as rob pointed out you ll get width and height of the client area of you frame then you should add the code which adjust size and position of your control
127653
a unix shell and the handy notepad++ is what i used to use when i did maintenance work in coldfusion php perl etc
127659
you can now call the various object functions such as hide and show
127687
i ve tried mbunit for a short while as well as zenebug and xunit but i keep coming back to nunit
127692
does that mean that in order to check out the revision 10 of the file foo.baz svn will take revision 1 and then apply the deltas 2-10
127706
in particular for an email to be considered as valid mime the headers must in the rfc sense of the word contain both of these headers
127744
with your code as it stands you d extend myobjdiffer and override its methods which is certainly workable
127753
i will accept answers where in and out are an inputstream and an outputstream preferably with a conversion from to reader writer

an example of an np-complete problem is the problem of finding a truth assignment that would make a boolean expression containing n variables true
127842
when we put break points in vs everything behaves as normal but without them we get the original search criteria and results
127863
scriptlets linking done at compile time but taglib class field access has to use such java api as reflection at runtime
127877
this can be done via the keyboard mouse pane of system preferences
127892
you are really asking two different questions swt vs swing and eclipse gui editor vs netbeans gui editor matisse
127892
first the difference between swt and swing is that they are two fundamentally different gui libraries
127892
this akin to asking the difference between tk and win32 or java swing vs .net forms not to say that swt is .net
127922
mbunit has compatible syntax with nunit but has more features especially data driven tests
127968
as an aside i know from doing some heavy atlas ajax things that there is definitely not two sessions one for normal postback one for async is there any chance you re using a webfarm
127984
i ve done it for quite a while now and it s natural to me even though i m not an emacs user either i m in the vim camp of that particular war
128015
normal osx applications eat the first mouse click when not focused to first focus the application
128024
for emacs ctrl should be at caps lock - for vim the escape key should be on the caps lock
128030
if there are no records in dbo.standard for that contract serviceid you may need to left outer join instead from the contract service table to the dbo.standard table in order to show contracts without completion records
128031
while dom is a pretty lousy api it has the advantage of having been designed for multiple languages and environments so it s easy to implement in java c# javascript c et al
128055
if you use shellsort no extra memory is needed at all though shellsort will be much slower than quicksort
128068
new projects in visual studio 2003 and later have the compile as c++ code tp option set by default so any .c files will be compiled as c++
128076
responding to the first mouse click when not focused is called click through
128083
my client is now requesting that the textbox s which are being repeater can be either a textbox or a checkbox
128093
clicked - this is useful if you want to add sorting and filtering functionality
128093
c in your listview code bind the template with your gridview
128098
read in the first line for each into an array of current lines
128101
what about something similar to this in your markup in each the textbox and checkbox controls
128110
flex also has the power of actionscript 3 behind it which allows you to do much of what flash does in cooperation with the mxml frontend components without ever touching the timeline or keyframes
128127
in your repeater drop a panel then create an event handler for the repeater s data binding event and programmatically create the textbox or checkbox and add it as a child control of the panel
128132
compare the lines and write the older one to the output file and advance to the next line
128132
the break condition isn t exactly right as this is just quick n dirty but it should look similar
128206
explicitly blacklist certain characters even though this is usually bypassable if your whitelist cannot be extremely tight
128207
for example given a list of cities for the salesman to visit in order we can add up the times for each trip between cities and easily see if it s under the time limit
128221
i have had this happen with gcc and g++
128221
unfortunately g++ packed the structs significantly looser than gcc which caused significant problems sharing objects between c and c++ code
128240
so proxy definitions have to be defined for both macos safari and firefox
128245
you can instead of drawing calendar take a calendar control set them the grid as parent and set them same bounds left top width height as cell has
128259
first will i get a smaller memory footprint using the set type over the dictionary type for this or should i use a sorted list where i check every time i insert into the list to see if the id exists or is there a third solution that i haven t thought of
128260
that as far as i can tell is the intent of the design - npobject objects are instances of the npclass they point to they implement methods and properties through the npclass function pointers that deal with these entities and any private data is expected to be allocated and deallocated by the implementation and its format is unspecified
128281
it s not just a test framework but a test automation platform so it will work with many existing test frameworks mbunit nunit xunit.net yet be fully extensible with a number of built-in additional features such as report generation in many formats and code analysis tools
128297
i m not 100 familiar with lisp but i assume it has some of the same problems as ocaml in that there isn t stellar library support
128315
if you use the latter approach you may need to set a border or slight padding on the parent element to prevent margin collapsing
128327
this is my main loop for getting input via keyboard and mouse using x windows on linux
128365
but this just produces a single line of a grand total of matching lines
128373
it accepts any callback type so also methods in classes
128382
although you are showing a fake task called testng in your example i presume you are using the junit target
128399
during my professional career as a .net and before that vb 2-6 developer i ve written small projects in pascal lisp c c++ php javascript ruby and python and am currently dabbling in lua and perl
128400
if i click my mouse wheel on a link
128428
if you haven t tried this already i d suggest firing up a set of vms with foreign language versions of windows installed rather than just changing the language settings on your machine and seeing if that makes any difference
128450
should i create an abstract class that my controllers extend or should i create module and add it in to each controller
128477
you ll need to have the 32-bit dll loaded into a separate 32-bit process and have your 64 bit process communicate with it via interprocess communication
128489
the rules of java state that you should never pass this to another method from its constructor for the simple reason that the object has not been fully constructed
128489
usually you can get away with passing this from constructors as long as you don t actually access any members or call methods for example if you want to set a reference to this in another object
128493
so assuming that your wcf communication is configured to use soap messages not the binary .net remoting datapower shouldn t have any trouble deciphering what s in your messages xpath and routing appropriately
128499
my guess is that imagemagick isn t talking to ghostscript
128510
if you don t want to use a datagrid to display data i sugest using a textbox with a monospace font at least like courier new
128513
this is for c# and .net 3.5 and includes both old web references as well as the newer wcf web services references
128522
added note in ironpython imports can be quite a bit more expensive than in cpython because the code is basically being compiled as it s being imported
128579
when developing a module device driver middleware etc... that will run in the kernel space we would like to have some way to capture the reason an operation might fail
128580
i m trying to get the contents of a xml document element but the element has a colon in it s name
128581
the supplied utilities including a java applet allow you to tag gif s jpeg s and png s without changing them visually
128589
a command line along the lines of following is all that s needed to get the correct values in the correct places
128632
notepad++ ultraedit and textpad are good ones
128636
what s the difference between array arraylist list hashtable dictionary sortedlist and sorteddictionary
128683
there is a problem with tostring it s expecting a numberformatinfo type that implements iformatprovider but the numberformatinfo class is sealed
128718
is there a way to define a class variable that has an own custom setter getter or is this a stupid way to handle it
128725
sorteddictionary is an idictionary that is sorted based on the keys
128725
sortedlist is an idictionary that is sorted based on a required icomparer
128754
sortedlist - a sorted generic list
128782
not to steal chris thunder for his suggestions on notepad++ ultraedit and textpad but i would like to point out that there is a version of ultraedit which can be run from a thumb drive for those people who lack admin rights at work and can not install programs
128788
dictionary sorteddictionary and hashtable implement idictionary
128792
antlr 3 uses a ll parser as opposed to a ll k parser so it will look ahead until it reaches the end of the input if it has to without backtracking using a specially optimized determinstic finite automata dfa
128805
you ll have a much better understanding of what is actually going on with the computer and it will make sense as to why we use binary hex
128805
i would let your interests steer you into which language c# java ruby python etc.
128850
if a filestream object is created using a file path that should exist and a constructor that should return a file in read mode checking the canread property is not necessary
128853
i m sure there s some trivial one-liner with perl ruby bash whatever that would let me run a command in a loop until i observe some string in stdout then stop
128872
for the heck of it here s a bash function version so you can call this more easily if it s something you re wanting to invoke from an interactive shell on a regular basis
128909
depending on the type of cell you want you could use others such as button checkbox combobox etc
128909
the cells deal with their value s as objects so you will be able to pass your car class into the cell s value
128909
i also did an override on paint so that i could do custom cell highlighting depending on value conditions altering the cells style.backcolor to what i wanted based on the value
128925
javascript doesn t have a concept of private members but you can emulate member privacy with closure by declaring them in the function constructor
128933
does anyone have a perl or python script that allows the specification of a user and group for removal
128943
i moved the code that updates the loading progress from inside the preloader movie clip which was looking at some _root level progress variables and updating itself on enter frame into the onloadprogress event itself
128945
it is very feature rich and supports even more exotic databases like informix or sybase
128956
you may also need to watch out for file system resources - sqlite is great awesome fast etc - but you do get some caching and writing benefits when using a standard database mysql postgresql etc because of how they re designed
128958
maybe you ve already done something like this but to make sure that you ve got the problem isolated to imagemagick and ghostscript as opposed to magicknet which is just a wrapper can you see if imagemagick s command-line convert.exe is able to convert your pdf to tiff
128958
if that works your imagemagick and ghostscript installations are basically ok and something needs to be done in magicknet or your app
128958
if it doesn t work there s something wrong with your imagemagick and or ghostscript installation configuration
128966
in the case of clicking on links this would be following the link but the difference is most noticeable in form submit handlers where you can cancel a form submission if the user has made a mistake entering the information
128966
all the ancient javascript interfaces like this have been given the nickname dom 0 and are mostly unspecified
128998

is it normally possible to embed all of your rails templates models into a jar inside of a war file for deployment on tomcat
129157
when i make the same ajax call using jsonp to a server in the same domain as the web page all goes well in all browsers including ie6
129186
immediately before this part you create an element with an id attribute that is similar but you would use to select that and even that will fail to work until you insert it into the document which you do not do until afterwards
129301
i have a rdlc report which has a table calling a subreport n times
129303
this practice is emphasized by mvc model-view-controller frameworks such as ruby on rails django and asp.net mvc i don t know any php ones off the top of my head though i am sure there are some
129346
attributes give extra information for reflection but if you externally know which properties you want you don t need them
129352
on the other hand if you re dealing with something more complex than what i m imagining as a simple contact form submission for example then it might behoove you to learn how to log your actions instead of depending on a web stats package
129353
however i m sure python perl or lua would be fine
129369
the system.componentmodel.typedescriptor stuff can be used to add attributes to types properties and object instances and it has the limitation that you have to use it to retrieve those properties as well
129378
you could actually store the file in some other encoding but you had to use a disgusting hack like this after loading to properly decode the data
129385
if you do a directory listing and pipe it to copy-item it will not preserve the folder structure
129401
however it seems most people on windows use an xml editor such as notepad++ as described in nate s answer or xml notepad 2007 as suggested by stevec there are also several commercial editors which i won t mention here
129454
sorry to be doom-laden but i haven t seen anything that can do this in oracle sql server sybase or mysql so i wouldn t be too hopeful for sqlanywhere
129496
postgres started on linux unix
129502
there is plenty of height in the uilabel for the text to display - i m just returning a large value for the height in heightforrowatindexpath
129516
don t set any of the sizes on the text field
129580
maybe i read too much classic asp perl and c++ but most stuff i read is tricky to skim
129597
i can t promise anything but we are considering adding this type of functionality to a future release
129651
in the following html i d like the frame around the image to be snug -- not to stretch out and take up all the available width in the parent container
129689
declarative programming is the picture where imperative programming is instructions for painting that picture
129689
some examples of where declarative and imperative programming get combined for greater effect
129738
in asp.net webforms i would use a logincontrol that postbacks the username and password back to the login.aspx codebehind which then delegates to a poco - for the db lookup and validation
129739
there is a new variable created and it s accessible only within the enclosing lexical block which is usually marked by curly braces
129751
you would write them out using an objectoutputstream and read em back in using an objectinputstream
129806
perl also has a map called a hashmap which is the equivalent to a dictionary in python - allowing you to have an association between a single key and a single value
129833
now there is no authoritative source just yahoo s hierarchy or individual store results so you could just pick the first one look under categories to get the category info
129872
but if both your client machine and the server happen to both be linux boxes or similar nixes with ssh then you can ssh -xca to the server and start jconsole on the server and have the gui display on your client machine with x port forwarding
129912
is there any way to get python to use my activetcl installation instead of having to copy the activetcl libraries into the python tcl directory
129932
but when running it no traffic is generated from the host to the webserver
129945
as far as i understand it equals zero in an integer comparison but evaluates to true when used as a boolean
129956
you might also want to check if the scheme is matching http or https
129970
in an integer context it evaluates to 0 the numeric part at the beginning of the string and is zero
129973
which would be fine except when they say lisp they mean scheme by which they really mean a subset of scheme by which they really mean a half remembered subset of scheme from that ai or languages course 5 years ago that they didn t like
129977
when you want to write a function that returns either an integer value or false or undef for the error case then you have to watch out for the value zero
129979
with python or java is very easy the parsing of the html
129981
firefox and opera not java or
130044
0 but true is a string just like any other but because of perl s syntax it can serve a useful purpose namely returning integer zero from a function without the result being false in perl s eyes
130109
btw there s no need to explicitly specify static final modifiers for fields in interfaces because only static final fields are allowed
130165
on the client this enables the radio button when the textbox value is changed
130165
i then click the radio button then post back via a button but back on the server this is always false
130172
another .net profiler which plays nicely with asp.net is dottrace
130200
in addition to posting the code used to call the function and add items to the array you could try checking the memory addresses of the pointer at the end of the function when it has all of the objects and also once it has returned when it has no objects
130215
we just include a gif version of every png alongside it in the same path and if the browser is found to be one that doesn t handle pngs properly it swaps it out with a gif version of the image
130230
ssh encrypts all communications does everything telnet does and more
130233
i started using subversion for one of my projects and it would be absolutely amazing if i could just export the latest version from the repository on my production server by for example running a php or perl script
130241
then use type.getconstructor type to get a reference to a constructor for the specific generic type and finally call constructorinfo.invoke to get an instance of the object
130255
the most common way would be to package it in a .rpm file for redhat -based distros like fedora or a .deb file for debian -based distros like ubuntu
130264
amazon doesn t support more than one set of credentials per account
130270
find someone skilled with debian and get their help to set up a build process to build .deb packages for debian and ubuntu
130273
or do i have to move to a scripting language like python perl
130282
as far as i know there is no svn client fully written in php or perl
130282
again depending on your access methods i m guessing ftp or sftp you might update a local checkout and sync any changes up onto the web space
130298
here s a general-purpose batch file to print the top n lines from a file like the gnu head utility instead of just a single line
130299
there are great windows distributions for perl python ruby etc. so no reason not to use them really
130314
removing the authentication section will require you to implement the redirection to the login page in your attribute but this shouldn t be a big deal
130323
this means that every single echo or print statement should use htmlspecialchars
130323
a third example could be shell commands if you are going to embed strings such as arguments to external commands and call them with exec then you must use escapeshellcmd and escapeshellarg
130327
using any member of the windows server family i can set up an active directory and have a single pool of users for a large scale of computers
130433
the latency may also be set to any arbitrary number of milliseconds
130433
you could also use vmware to run bsd or linux and try this article dummynet or this one
130494
i use the commercial version of jalopy for my java projects but it doesn t work on groovy files
130500
running the test right after an oracle restart i will see a 1 min load average of 5 or so and average cpu around 10-15
130506
i understand his reasoning that the number of threads cannot be greater than the number of available processors so set it the the amount to get the full potential out of the processor s
130523
medium-small with more lines of code and good line spacing and syntax colouring
130523
never zoom font size but did make switch from non-antialiased bbedit to anti-aliased textmate and am not going back
130527
obviously if you re writing an application which contains some parallelisable algorithm then you can probably start benchmarking to find a good balance in the number of threads but bear in mind that hundreds of threads won t speed up any operation
130541
i d probably leave that as-is unless i found a problem via benchmarking profiling
130544
sax is a push model while xmlreader is a pull parser that has a number of benefits
130578
it is a convenient way to write complex macros including activex automation if you don t want to use vba or their c++ or .net sdks or if a diesel expression doesn t cut it
130600
ssh scp
130629
i give web developers instructions on using an sftp scp client and a login shell using scponly
130629
that way they get their access to upload files but i have fewer concerns about them doing bad things to the webserver
130678
convert each block of 47 bits to a base 26 number of 10 digits
130678
when decoding the letters a truncated final block can be filled out with zero letters and converted to a 47-bit base 2 representation
130685
when running your app seek to the end of the file minus the size of the struct extract the file offset and copy the 2nd exe to a temporary folder then launch it
130714
with emacs i can get the proggy fonts so that there are zero pixels separating the descenders on one line from the highest ascender on the line below
130715
you have the full power of -- whatever language you re using -- python java c# -- so use that language well
130730
i have an immutable class with some private fields that are set during the constructor execution
130748
based on which radio button is selected i want to display the proper control to the user
130748
the way i m doing this now is just loading both controls and setting up an onradiobuttonselectionchanged method which gets called at form load to set the initial state and at any time the selection is changed
130785
now you can use a fake mock object to set up its state such that any methods that rely on configuration can be tested to see if they utilize the correct values.
130795
the way i do it on debian ubuntu boxes
130798
if your stream is some format other than wav file data like mp3 or wma you will have to perform the additional step of decoding the data into wav format and playing it with the waveoutxxxx api
130801
i m using gnu autotools for the build system on a particular project
130826
you could use it as a text editor only though it will offer you the vb.net intellisense not vb6
130841
the elements of an ordereddictionary are not sorted in any way. so foreach s would not pay attention to the numerical indices
130862
suppose you have an object which in its constructor does something like
130862
instead pass the object in as an argument to the constructor
130887
i m more intrigued by the developer who doesn t mind writing in c c++ asm but not .net - but is apparently stymied by fopen fseek fwrite - since that s about all the program you describe sounds like it s doing
130894
i have the source of a program taken from cvs svn git ... and i d like to build a debian ubuntu package for it
130936
i use ssh config to limit users to sftp on a development server then use version control to review the changes and move them to production with got format-patch
130986
could you guys recommend some affordable sql modeling tool which supports sql server postgresql and mysql
131003
i would second michael carman s comment please do not use the term hashmap or map when you mean a hash or associative array
131023
i know there is a list-comprehension library for common lisp incf-cl i know they re supported natively in various other functional and some non-functional languages f# erlang haskell and c# - is there a list comprehension library for scheme
131030
since it s implemented in groovy you should be able to use it from any of your java projects
131042
some people i ve worked with have had good things to say about toad - it works with mysql though not postgresql
131050
since as3 does not allow private constructors it seems the only way to construct a singleton and guarantee the constructor isn t explicitly created via new is to pass a single parameter and check it
131050
the private object passed on the constructor seems preferable but it does not look like you can have a private class in the same package
131062
if i create a rootviewcontroller and call addsubview on that controller i would expect the added view s to be wired up for viewwillappear events
131068
i am trying to trap and record keydown and keyup times in milliseconds and need it in the + - 10 ms range or less
131103
still has pages that suggest twiddling padding margins or even using javascript to fix these issues
131120
but other than that what is the security risk if you can use https as opposed of http
131140
exposing your svn repo using http instead of https so people sniffing your traffic can get your passwords - again don t do this
131179
imagemagick-6.4.3 contains nothing interesting and i can t find any other files that i might be able to point gem install at
131183
if you expect multiple rows from a sub-select you can add rownum 1 to each where clause or use an aggregate such as max or min
131190
when working with databases you can get this error when you try to get a value form a field or row which doesn t exist
131224
the .snk file is used for signing the assemblies in order to be able to add them to the global assembly cache gac
131251
i believe gcc g++ have equivalent flags
131256
the first is about adding tests to the gnu autotools toolchain - but those tests if i m understanding you correctly are for both validating that the environment necessary to build your application exists dependent libraries and tools as well as adapt the build to the environment platform specific differences
131279
now that i know about this trick feature i can easily set breakpoints on any part of my code that i want to which saves me loads of time and effort
131288
for java we use javadoc for perl we use in-line pod with some javadoc style additions parameters and types return type and exceptions for ruby it s rdoc style and in our c and c++ code we used doxygen
131325
implement any alias lookup logic you want in the action that route routes you to
131334
these days prototypes usually are written in a younger dynamic language perl python ruby etc and implementations of successful research is usually in c or c++ sometimes java
131345
for .net applications system.diagnostics has lots of useful debugging things
131346
to find memory leaks use the default memcheck tool of valgrind
131359
with a multi-core processor system you could use affinity to your advantage
131369
this is because most public subversion projects either use http or if https they don t use a certificate with full cert chain
131381
if you set it up on the local machine you don t need to know or do any of the above just run the install and then use your favourite client to interact with it
131382
if it s all done with printf scanf and friends then you ll probably be best off by finding creating an include file that all the source files include and adding a macro that redirects printf scanf and friends to your own functions that are written so as to be amenable to dll implementation
131422
pretty sure the answer is you can t since the sql generated includes the value entered for any dynamic filters set up when you built the query and as you say the act of editing the sql prevents using the query editor to make further changes
131496
i don t think you will get the pause if you put an application.doevents
131499
by the way asp.net mvc is not included with .net 3.5...yet
131517
r# usually creator constructor and passing incoming variable to private field which for me mi tend to pass it to property
131605
more than one person is working on a excel spreadsheet and they may be making changes to the same worksheet which they want to merge and integrate
131619
i want to be able to define a whitelist of allowed characters and replace any non-allowed characters with an underscore but translate works as by replacing from a blacklist
131622
whatever you do don t learn git - after you learn it you realize how every other scm is trash and you ll hate every minute you have to use perforce svn or god help you vss tfs
131705
at the company where i work we run apple s open directory for our ldap directory and kerberos kdc
131705
while ldap and kerberos can be daunting at first and a bit challenging to get working i think the effort is quite worthwhile
131744
is there any easy way to use say gecko firefox or even webkit safari chrome for rendering
131766
with dependency injection instead of instantiating the groupmembershipservice within your personservice you d either pass it in to the personservice constructor or else add a property getter and setter to set a local instance of it
131833
the size_t type is the unsigned integer type that is the result of the sizeof operator and the offsetof operator so it is guaranteed to be big enough to contain the size of the biggest object your system can handle a static array of 8gb
131847
i know nothing else about the ellipse but the only thing i need to know is what angle the major axis is rotated at
131876
in your case that s the line from -2.5 6 to 5 -3 the top side of your ellipse
131911
they basically have access to anything you can do in php look around the file system get set any sort of variables open connections to other machines to insert code to run etc...
131931
you need to mark methods you want to mock virtual and the class needs a constructor with no arguments this can be protected private won t work
131954
it is an unsigned integer capable of expressing the size in bytes of any memory range supported on the host machine
131954
in particular the c standard specifies the following invariants sizeof char sizeof short sizeof int sizeof long placing no other limitations on the actual representation of the precision available to the programmer for each of these primitive types
131955
is there a keyboard shortcut for pasting the content of the clipboard into a command prompt window on windows xp instead of using the right mouse button
131973
if you can use your mouse right click on the cmd window works as paste when i tried it
131977
click and drag the mouse pointer over the text you want
132007
you could use a proxy object which acts as both a listener and a broadcaster of events and assign the real listeners to it and then assign it as a listener of the to-be-serialized object
132024
my background was predominantly c unix and python with some java and dusty 2000-vintage vb6 when i first used c#
132071
as lars mentioned one possible j2ee solution is to store such details under jndi making the exact same application binary deployable on any environment leaving dbas admins to set the username password for each machine
132109
round ceil or floor functions
132117
you could set a unique element namespace at the very end of your xml document that has one attribute value equal to true
132145
one option is to use type-ahead with postback ajax to reduce the size of the list
132199
set the angle of the ellipse 0
132199
if error is too large use the secant method or newton-rhapson to work out a new angle for the ellipse and go to 2
132237
i kept suggesting to my supervisor at my last job to use python rather than java when a considering what to use for a new project
132244
obviously once you upgrade to php5 the xslt will still work and you can migrate as and when to dom parsing
132246
supports imap pop smtp and nntp
132290
for example swapping two unsigned integer without using a temporary variable
132293
i am trying to run a diff on two svn urls using svnkit
132295
my question is how this can be done in weblogic webspehre glassfish etc.
132306
assumptions on the bit size or precision of short int long float and double types
132324
and you can use this extension method for derived types of basedataobject to chain methods without casts and preserve the real type when inferred into a var field or anonymous type
132394
you might want to check his answer where he uses the ifstream s read method as you used to do and then set the stringstream buffer to point to the previously allocated memory
132408
i ve only used it for purely 1 1 port forwarding
132424
the problem with a crt that does not leak is that the executable might reasonable expect to use the memory as malloc ed memory should remain usable until free is called
132444
it works fine on mysql and oracle
132483
if you want you could store python or tcl or something else in the database
132496
i may also require the ability to click on any of these cells to view and or set other properties
132535
fields really represent the inherent state of your object and the constructor job is to initialize this internal state
132535
the transformation logic you apply to the constructor arguments or to the properties input values before setting the internal state of the object could be very different
132539
a set is a sorted data structure insertion find and deletion take o log n time
132541
looping through wouldn t be your only option - you could perform subtraction to figure out the total number of days and subtract one for each of your skipped dates every week range in between that contains one of those days
132542
there is a java implementation of quadtree and r-tree
132569
i have used the .net s griddataview without any problems using the virtual mode while trying to show over 10000 rows but there are good products out there that are also very good in loading tons of data like developer express xtragrid and telerik s radgridview
132655
have you thought about using msbuild and nant instead
132683
the as keyword is good in asp.net when you use the findcontrol method
132686
overflow hidden means that the tag is rendered with a certain height and any text etc which would cause the tag to expand to render it will not display
132692
specified height width
132701
i do have my own custom-built messagebox class which i use -- although i did so not to cache it in my usage scenarios in winforms the same mb is rarely used twice but rather to provide a more detailed error message and information -- a header a description an ability to copy the message to the clipboard it s usually the tool which notifies the user of an unhandled exception and then the buttons
132718
alternatively you could also add access scope on the properties public get and protected set
132725
as for stack procedure-level variables my tests are showing that unitialized booleans are true unitialized integers are 2129993264 and uninialized objects are just invalid pointers not nil
132747
you need to make sure that none of your webforms pages go in the views directory in a standard asp.net mvc application though
132748
we ve found that developers are less likely to arbitrarily change the build script variables when testing things out so accidental misconfigurations have been rarer than with other techniques we ve tried though it s still necessary to add each var early in the process so that the dev value doesn t get pushed to prod by default
132749
with inlining there is no need to set up the function call because the code is directly pasted into any method that uses it
132757
what are your own reasons to prefer python over perl
132757
if so what is it about perl that gives them a hard time and might work better in python
132776
some compilers vc2005 have an option for aggressive inlining and you wouldn t need to specify the inline keyword when using that option
132787
tapestry and wicket are two more modern ones haven t used them though
132790
use a publish checkbox button and when the user interacts with the page in a way that causes them to navigate away ask them if they want to publish if that box is not checked button not clicked
132801
you ll need to make sure your mvc routes don t conflict with your web forms pages so that requests for a .aspx page don t get routed to a controller action as a parameter etc
132841
personally i prefer solaris or a bsd for stability
132851
you can then either rollback or commit
132882
you need to include rubygems only if you installed the gem using gem
132885
is there an easy way to do this based on some variable so that the configuration doesn t have to be revised when deploying to a new environment every time
132889
you can find out where gems are installed by running gem environment look for installation directory
132903
an aspect that is often overlooked is also what happens in managing the collaborations between objects in 1-1 1-n or n-n relationships should these also accept the addition of invalid collaborators and just maintain a invalid state flag which should be checked or should it actively refuse to add invalid collaborations
132917
try assigning your menu to the contextmenustrip property of notifyicon rather than showing it in the mouse click handler
132921
i was wondering how i can force a user who has requested a page using http to use the secure https version
132963
this really throws dbas off until you point out that you can derive an erd from a class diagram by sliding all the arrows the to the other end of the lines.
133002
all of this is using the blaze proxy since it involves get put delete and post calls
133006
there you add redirects in such a way that request for http are redirected to https
133106
your site is secured using nothing but asp.net forms authentication and an asp.net login server control on login.aspx
133116
one way that you could do this within your application rather than in the server configuration would be to use a filter specified in your web.xml to check if servletrequest.getscheme is http or https and re-direct the user to the appropriate url using httpservletresponse.sendredirect string url
133136
what is the best way to configure iplanet sun one be the http https front end to a jboss tomcat application
133147
https ssl
133155
this explains the ugly endlocal set return sorted syntax which actually works despite what logic would indicate
133189
it s an apache module that lets you easily specify how many instances min and max of your app servers you want to have running
133235
if you have any other pages outside the purview of the asp.net application then you set up handling for them in iis
133236
i am wanting to store the state of some actions the user is performing in a series of different asp.net webforms
133243
i want to have a uiscrollview with a set of subviews where each of these subviews has a uitextview with a different text
133243
for this task i have modified the pagecontrol example from the apple iphone dev center in order to add it a simple uitextview to the view which is used to generate the subviews of the scroll view
133247
how to convince people python is better than perl
133247
be more successful in python than they are in perl
133252
if the server-side control is within a databound control listview gridview formview detailsview then the syntax is
133271
if a function is static thus not exported anyway and only called once within your code and you never use a pointer to the function chances are good that gcc will decide to inline it automatically as it will have no negative impact the binary won t get bigger by inlining it only once
133291
note that numbers in this result set are not necessarily distinct if they occur more than twice in the original sequence so convert again to a set of distinct values if this is required
133348
i m not a delphi expert but if you can invoke win32 apis you can use findwindow and showwindow to minimize a window even if it does not belong to your app
133426
as has been suggested in previous answers use of the inline keyword can make code faster by inlining function calls often at the expense of increased executables
133426
however modern compilers are very good at inlining function calls automatically without any prompt from the user when set to high optimisation
133427
use ssl otherwise known as https
133461
also show them how they can do all the good stuff in perl in python
133461
show them how python oo is a better integrated to the language compare to perl
133530
you can use findwindow to find the application handle and showwindow to minimize it
133573
and when you need to connect to the phone software or hardware you have can use java python c++ windows mobile or the new kid on the block android
133613
if that s your case then you can just store a hash signature md5 instead and compare it with the signature of the entered password
133679
i know sourcemonitor can be scripted to allow me to supply the files to be tested and grab the metrics out of the result file csv or xml
133679
ideally i want to get metrics for a specified file revision rather than a whole project which my utility will drag from version-control automatically
133691
i am looking for an elegent way to set the chart control s along with other control s width height based on the screen browser size
133720
are you sure you are connecting your https client to the server port that talks over https tls ssl rather than http
133729
i believe it s as simple as capturing a mouse click event at an area at the edge of a cell header and then dynamically changing the width of the column as the mouse is dragged
133751
basically we want a fast setup and deploy which doesn t inherently lend itself to ssas using sql server 2005 but we want to use ssrs for reporting and we want an olap model for analysis in excel so we d still like to use ssas to build the cube if possible
133751
the common solution in ssas for a fast deploy is rolap but we are getting execution errors on larger rolap queries and we also don t like all the overhead involved in converting the binary data to sql and loading it into the cube
133751
has anyone done work on a custom olap datasource that ssas can use
133772
in my case all i had to do was initialize the collection object in the constructor and then remove the property setter
133789
so what you re going to do is work your way back up the tree using rotations to balance any unbalanced nodes you find and updating their balance score until the tree is balanced again
133833
you could also override the calendar display portion of the control to highlight lowlight the invalid options - it already highlights the current day and the current selection for example
133851
i found a very nice one for yahoo gmail and hotmail
133865
now i am invoking this popup on button click event
133865
i need this popup just next to my button and for that i have to set above mentioned offsetx and offsety properties of popup
133872
but you are going to need external tools for tracking progress and bugs bugzilla yoxel trac gantt diagram tools mylyn for eclipse a blog whatever
133877
ini json and yaml are usually ok
133890
the xmlserializer gives special treatment to classes that implement ienumerable or icollection
133890
a class that implements icollection such as collectionbase in addition to ienumerable must have a public item indexed property indexer in c# that takes an integer and it must have a public count property of type integer
133897
but now i would like to draw caps at the end of my line that is short perpendicular lines at each of my end points
133897
thus to draw my cap line at end point x1 y1 i need to find two points that form a perpendicular line and where each of its points are n 2 pixels away from the point x1 y1
133903
once the release the control i then reposition the table cell height or width according to where they moved the new control
133912
if it s not on your machine already install it sudo apt-get install libboost-dev on unbuntu get the binaries from boost.org if you are on windows
133919
the systems are diverse in that multiple operating systems linux solaris windows multiple databases several versions of oracle sybase and mysql and even multiple languages c c++ jsp php and a host of others are used
133923
this is done with javascript and dom manipulations
133932
my first reaction when testing the form was to press enter to edit the selected node but doing this would go against the normal default button behavior
133961
you could use a library like jquery and its .post method
134006
and if you re worried about perl being not-quite-as-purely oo as python use moose and i d counter that python is lacking in the functional programming department compared to perl anyway
134006
now if there s some library or such that your company needs that is available or far superior in python that is not available or of far lesser quality in perl then go ahead and switch or add another language to the mix
134013
disclaimer i m new to openid so i might be wrong here. the communication between the open id consumer stackoverflow and the open id provider your server does not require https -- it will work just as fine and just as securely over plain http
134027
you can t get the outlook address books since they re on the user s machine - they would need to export to csv and upload
134034
i then have a main.mxml file that contains the flex application i add my component to the application without any problem
134047
we are beginning to realize that we just can t use sql for querying and want to know if anyone has created a custom rolap datasource that analysis services or any olap tool can read
134062
if this is used inside a constructor function and the function was invoked with the new keyword this refers to the object that will be created
134068
any time it wraps from one column to the next previous using the up down arrows a single subsequent use of the left or right arrow key moves the selection to the left or right of the item that was selected just before the wrap occured
134068
if 0011 is selected and i use the up arrow key to move selection to 0010 then a press of the right arrow keys moves selection to 0021 to the right of 0011 and a press of the left arrow key moves selection to 0001
134110
i m running a sharepoint application on a moss 2007 with a form based user authentication without using the mysite feature
134125
the width of every div is fixed but the height isn t
134134
found this change linux or unix system password using php script in the internet
134149
when invoked as a constructor a new object will be created and this will be bound to that object
134149
use that var that this trick pattern
134152
thus if only one such resource exist in xa-transaction we may first attempt to prepare all others then commit that lro one then if succeed commit others otherwise rollback others
134181
i definitely would stress against over-use since it would lead to writing c in c# much the same way one can write java in python where you re not embracing the patterns and idioms which make the new language special but instead simply thinking in your old language and converting to new syntax
134189
use merge algorithm to merge the two sorted halves and output the complete sorted data set to a file
134263
i m pretty sure this is a simple configuration option in the war s web.xml but i haven t found the answer in google
134269
one of the best tools is using the debugging tools for windows and taking a memory dump of the process using adplus then use windbg and the sos plugin to analyze the process memory threads and call stacks
134276
c# business layer - deals with taking user request submitted via http recived by an aspx page gathering the correct response based on the state of the database and returning it to the client via xml although i would recommend json
134318
when a getter or setter is called the interceptor would check to see if the property exists in either collection and then take appropriate action
134346
using a non-reversible hash such as md5 is much more secure and you can store the hashed value as clear text

if the interface can receive unicast traffic properly and a network analyzer wireshark for instance shows that the multicast joins are being sent and the inbound multicast packets are correctly formed i would suspect a driver issue
134477
just be careful so you don t ultimately drive the move from a weird mixture of batch files excel matlab and tcl to a weird mixture of perl python and whatever other language catches your interest next
134503
you can record the microtime at the start of execution hold that variable until the end check the time subtract them and there you have your execution time
134512
poeple usually refer to valid xml as xml that adheres to a certain schema xsd or dtd
134555
you can then show or hide your puzzle in each timer tick
134607
to treat the popup or any other menu items like radio group items set the radioitem property to true for each item you want to have in the radio group
134645
i would say that a datagrid is really just a glorified listbox since almost everything in wpf is styleless
134653
i was unable to reproduce the problem on linux ubuntu mono despite using the same code on the same conditions multiple same executable running simultaneously release mode etc.
134667
make sure to give the cell an identifier in interface builder and then use the same identifier with dequeuereusablecellwithidentifier see the sample code for how this works -- the idea is that cells get re-used - the os will only allocate as many cells as fit on the screen at once
134674
say your webserver needs to upload a file to s3
134674
the webserver can then use this to actually submit the request along with the file to upload to s3
134677
this tryparse method was introduced in .net 2.0 to get over the fact that xxx.parse will through an exception if conversion fails and you have to put in try catch around the statement
134705
one key is to understand that javascript dom call are way slower than html parsing
134744
if you move to an ant or maven for you maven fans then you can automate the jar building very nicely and also use it outside of eclipse in an automated build environment
134748
is there a way to force a similar reload without having the user select shut down and then cancel

this means you can hide content in the print version which is shown in the screen version or hide content in the screen version which you want to show up when printing.all you do is apply display none to the appropriate sections in the appropriate stylesheet
134834
i don t want to just learn how to program java code with python syntax
134858
i have some code i ve written in php for consuming our simple webservice which i d also like to provide in perl for users who may prefer that language
134905
there is a nice way to return json but not for xml
134934
i want to display a leading zero for all numbers with less than 2 digits
134955
if you re working on linux or other unix variants try rapidsvn
134969
in ruby is there the equivalent of the __str__ method that you can define on python classes
134986
you then have to use distinct-values to remove the duplicates from that list
134988
however even if this works how do we get the user back to http from https
134999
bazaar and other distributed tools such as git mercurial darcs and the like are ideal because you can have your repository stored in multiple places ie
135006
edit some have mentioned doing it yourself if you do decide to do this a good source of information to start with is the us census tiger data set which contains a lot of information about the us including address information

the divmod function is a convenient way to perform both division and modulo
135017
i asked last week whether deepzoom was planned for wpf since it s available on silverlight
135035
in ruby the library path is provided in in perl it s in inc - how do you get the list of paths that python searches for modules when you do an import
135083
make sure you remove all default margins and padding and define them explicitly
135117
he has a lot of perl experience and a lot of coding experience in general so his glowing review of python comes with some weight behind it
135120
or even better you d have the default action link in the html and you d add the onclick event to the element unobtrusively via javascript after the dom renders thus ensuring that if javascript is not present utilized you don t have useless event handlers riddling your code and potentially obfuscating or at least distracting from your actual content
135128
check out swfupload which is essentially a javascript api to flash s absolutely superior file upload handling capabilities
135128
this can be done via the dom but i would recommend a javascript library like jquery
135198
perl has constants multi-line anonymous functions and autovivification but python has better default object orientation
135198
dispel the myths behind perl and python
135231
what i do is build a custom class the wraps system.net.httpwebrequest httpwebresponse so retrieving pages is as simple as using system.net.webclient
135234
what is the difference between ref and out parameters in .net
135244
ref parameters aren t required to be set in the function whereas out parameters must be bound to a value before exiting the function
135255
out parameters are initialized by the method called ref parameters are initialized before calling the method
135255
therefore out parameters are used when you just need to get a secondary return value ref parameters are used to get a value and potentially return a change to that value secondarily to the main return value
135257
they re pretty much the same - the only difference is that a variable you pass as an out parameter doesn t need to be initialized but passing it as a ref parameter it has to be set to something
135257
ref parameters are for data that might be modified out parameters are for data that s an additional output for the function eg int.tryparse that are already using the return value for something
135263
why does c# have both ref and out
135263
ref parameters are passed both into and out of a method
135263
so out means out while ref is for in and out
135275
this the out and ref paramerter in c# has some good examples
135275
the basic difference outlined is that out parameters don t need to be initialized when passed in while ref parameters do
135292
out and ref are exactly the same with the exception that out variables don t have to be initialized before sending it into the abyss
135292
to be more explicit about their use however the meaning of the modifier is that if you change the reference of that variable in your code out and ref will cause your calling variable to change reference as well
135292
if it weren t for ref or out the reference wouldn t be changed
135367
remaining within the boundaries of the c++ language and libraries i would suggest first getting used to programming using stl algorithm function templates as one the most common use you will have for boost lambda is to replace functor classes with inlined expressions inlined
135367
when you over- use the stl you find yourself gravitating towards boost bind and boost lambda
135367
so use stl algorithms write your own functors and then translate them into inline expressions using boost lambda
135403
ref and out both allow the called method to modify a parameter
135403
technically speaking you could use always ref in place of out but out allows you to be more precise about the meaning of the argument and sometimes it can be a lot more efficient
135412
i know about asp.net s capability of switching themes instantly but how do i have to design the webforms for it to be easy later
135441
i have factored this code out into a third repository and then i periodically migrate that code into my dependent project repositories as internal release and upgrade steps
135454
you should be able to use true false rather than 0 1 in your #define and because the value is a single lexical token it s the one time you don t need parentheses around it
135458
will the detached thread free the memory allocated by malloc or is that something i now have to do
135460
fwiw i think something like perl or python might be better suited to that sort of task
135494
expanding wayne s answer if anything you do needs to set response.headers you can t do it after any part of the response has been flushed
135495
easiest way would be to have the web service update a field on a database with the progress of the call and then create a web service that queries that field and returns the value
135589
make sure you use a masterpage so that all of your sub pages will have a common base and give all of your elements good ids because you will still need to get your hands dirty with css to put it all together
135599
not sure if its a part of uml but i find entity relation diagram erd very useful when modeling your database.
135656
as long as your object has clearly defined inputs and outputs the way that the object does what it does doesn t matter at all - storing retrieving data could go from flat file to xml to memcache to mysql to oracle and you only ever have to concern yourself with one single object
135656
keep one thing in mind - oo in php even php5 isn t very good oo compared to a language like python or ruby
135656
the everything-is-an-object model in python is what made me oo programming really click for me - and as a former php programmer and doubly-certified zend engineer i strongly recommend exploring python s oo if you want to understand what oo is all about
135711
if you want to get your hands dirty with kernel programming go with freebsd netbsd or opensolaris for example
135711
you say that you have experience with c -- look at web source code repositories of linux and of opensolaris or some of bsds compare the code and make your own opinion
135711
what i m saying is i guess that there s more to open-source unix than linux and that you should at least look at them before going for linux
135739
the for loop is imperative the algorithms are declarative
135791
there are no apis for other language etc.. but it outputs json or xml so.
135801
i am using prototype and i can t find any built in extensions to set or retrieve cookies
135814
you could always use a test coverage tool like emma or its eclipse plugin eclemma or the like
135832
i want to get your opinion on whether this is a good idea or should i put my application metadata in the soap header itself
135836
freebsd has specific concepts of jails and solaris has containers
135896
in case you re wondering i m looking at verilog code for a mips processor subset and trying to figure out exactly to what extent it complies with the instruction sets of any real mips processors
135904
from the clr point of view c# static class is just sealed and abstract class
135904
you can t create an instance because it is abstract and you can t inherit from it since it is sealed
135905
this is especially relevant if you are using dom searching javascript as provided by the many js libraries as it would benefit to reduce the dom tree size
135929
i d like to just put in a comment in the block of my if-statement but i get an error when i try
135946
either standard c++ stl or boost ok mfc or atl win32 api or a small single-purpose and free library that i can download from somewhere
135971
with some clever sort uniq diff grep awk later on has potential but i was wondering if anyone knows of any existing solutions
136033
what s the shortest-distance approach to getting the same simplicity speed and isolation as php s runtime environment with perl semantics
136051
take the following class it doesn t implement ienumerable or ienumerator
136053
so my preference goes to the const reference return because anyway i m just more confortable with sending a reference than hoping the compiler will optimize the extra temporary as long as the following contract is respected if you want it beyond my object s existence they copy it before my object s destruction
136069
i am planning on porting a php application over to python
136069
i did not use a framework in the php version but being new to python i am wondering if it would be advantageous to use something like django or at the very least genshi
136112
properties especially with c#3 object initializers or keyword arguments a la ruby or python are a much better way to go where you d otherwise use a boolean argument
136165
what happens is a click on a table cell or something similar in the web editor and regardless of the size of the page i m working on it takes a second or two for the properties window to show the properties for the selected item
136165
the most annoying thing about it is sometimes i ll click a cell select a property and start typing but it s still stuck on the wrong unselected item so it ends up putting what i m typing in the wrong place and then it disappears once the proper item is selected
136177
just because code passes fxcop stylecop looks good in ndepend and passes automated tests doesn t mean it provides the best business value
136178
if i use cursor keys to move right it loses colour coding and worse the lines don t line up making it harder to track the change
136182
but with bash you should know that .bashrc is executed with every new shell invocation
136195
we want to access the field variable and assign a value to it
136195
on subsequent calls we cannot set the value of the variable field
136232
if you are going to go with ctypes definitely check out the pyglet and pyopengl projects that have massive examples of ctype bindings
136233
but when i put this in my .aliases file i get an alias loop
136233
update i m still curious if it s possible to redirect stderr in tcsh from .aliases but as has been suggested here i ended up with a shell script
136234
i recently ported a php app to python using web.py
136240
for example i downloaded the manual for the mips 4ke core document #md00103 mips32 4ke processor core family software user s manual and chapter 10 contains a detailed description of the instruction set
136333
exists for windows solaris and linux
136354
for efficiency with very large files common in logfile situations where you may want to use tail you generally want to avoid reading the whole file even if you do do it without reading the whole file into memory at once however you do need to somehow work out the offset in lines rather than characters
136365
it looks like there s a copy of the gnu link utility somewhere in the search path
136397
try running first mvn install in project bar in order to put bar in your maven repository and then add the dependency to foo s pom.xml

many rss feeds only keep the latest 10 or so posts so there would be no way to provide the older data from the feed since the blog started
136436
please note that unfortunately the old-schoolers have declared that nant ant are not an option so hey why not use nant - it does that
136454
the script itself recursively inspects my includes directory and assumes that any php file not named in a short list of exclusions the autoloader itself plus some other standard files i tend to have contains a class of the same name
136476
not receiving any responses to icmp pings or arp requests is not a 100 guarantee that there s no network connection
136477
basically you construct an n-way tree with edges determined by the levenshtein distance between the nodes
136489
it is perfectly feasible to deploy user controls directly to sharepoint sites either through the controltemplates folder in the 12 hive or to a location in the web app virtual directory which you can then reference from web pages using sharepoint designer
136502
there are two possible solutions there was a conflict with an older version of scriptaculous and jquery scriptaculous was attempting to extend the native array prototype incorrectly - first try upgrading your copy of scriptaculous
136506
the basic idea is to set the window.location.hash property to a value that contains whatever state information you need then either use the window.onhashchange event or for older browsers that don t support onhashchange ie 8 firefox 3.6 periodically check to see if the hash has changed using setinterval for example and update the page

i m not sure if you can make a textblock selectable but another option would be to use a richtextbox - it is like a textbox as you suggested but supports the formatting you want
136676
having this set to true should enable any sections in your web.config so you should be fine to remove it if there s none in there
136733
for php there is codeigniter kohanaphp and cakephp
136739
i m starting with python coming from java
136786
for linux i unfortunately have not been able to find a good way to easily create keyboard mouse macros
136804
you might consider using something like web.py which would be easy to distribute since it s small and it would also be easy to adapt your other tools to it since it doesn t require you to submit to the framework so much like django does
136808
if i understand correctly you want the parent to be 25 wide and exactly the height of the browser display area
136870
prepare and execute a database
136884
i learned recently that setting a div to display table will stop it from expanding to take up the whole width of the parent container -- but now i realize that this introduces a new problem it stops collapsing margins with its neighbors
136966
knowing that the dll will reload its configuration at certain points is a useful feature since it prevents the users wondering if they have to restart the host process reboot the machine etc for the configuration to take effect

you re incrementing with the update people set chatscount after each loop iteration
137030
keep in mind that when you extend a class to override methods the method s signature has to match the original
137035
so if you really really want this effect then you will need to do the image fadeout spinner fadein and once that is complete triggering the upload
137069
svn creates .svn directories in every single folder git only creates one .git directory
137069
in svn each file folder can come from a different revision or branch
137074
use the -s option to gcc or g++
137079
i think you could also fix it by disabling anonymous access in iis on the web application you are running the report from that way reporting services would authenticate using the users credentials instead of the aspnet account
137092
3.1 selenium sample this and the next watin code sample do not show up in the original web page on either ie or firefox so i ve extracted them and listed them here.
137097
the other solution is to create triggers on the leads table for insert update and delete so that you keep the employees.leadcount column current all the time
137097
first reset the leadcount in all rows to zero then do a join to the leads table and increment the leadcount in each row produced by the join
137173
so far i ve tested it on ubuntu debian and red hat as
137174
to set an http https and or socks proxy programmatically
137177
whereas the excel worksheet function round always rounds .5 up
137177
i then finally discovered that you can use the excel worksheet round function like so
137195
by the time you define your functor predicate classes a two line for loop can turn into 40+ lines of code that is suddenly 10x harder to figure out
137241
assuming you can determine that a line is part of a middle of a record for example you could break the file into n m segments each responsible for m lines
137263
no you have to call win32 api logonuser function to get windows account token back so you can then impersonate
137274
any virtual methods you call from the constructor may fall down to derived implementations and if they don t call the base method and the constructor depends on it the object may be in an invalid state
137302
at the local end you could use something like libcurl to do the client side of the transfer which also supports on-the-fly decompression
137313
i ve been parsing through some log files and i ve found that some of the lines are too long to display on one line so terminal.app kindly wraps them onto the next line
137335
i use both java and python all the time
137378
for instance you could license under gplv3 but with extra clauses that allow you to use it as if under the terms of the lgpl and that allow the code to be integrated with other gpl products so that they can be mixed an important part of oss
137414
the first suggestion i have would be to use the httplistener class and possibly webclient or other system.net http related classes to re-post the requests to your application as a proxy for the webbrowser test calls
137431
windows has a lot of capabilities for dealing with i o blocking whereas asp.net .net has a plain concept of thread
137449
this works fine but the div contains some form elements label input
137479
this will generate the asm with the c code + line numbers interweaved to more easily see what lines generate what code
137490
or you could make a default constructor private to prevent the construction of the class without passing in values
137490
the private modifier and others like it can be a useful way of writing self documenting code
137500
what you learn for php isn t necessarily true for python or perl or c etc
137519
for example how do i show or hide the outlook envelope icon from an outlook rule
137552
well i can t remember enough from my php days to answer the part but for most c-style languages null should be used in the context of pointer values false as a boolean and zero as a numeric value such as an int
137577
0 is the integer value of zero and false is the boolean value of well false
137654
technically you can get around it anyways but you have to put in extra work to shoot yourself
137660
the iis process must have a stdin stdout and stderr
137694
also it looks like the first trace does no prepare call and thinks p1 is an output paramer in the execute while the second trace does a prepare call with p1 as an output but does not show p1 as an output in the execute step - is this significant
137697
tidy can do what you want but only for whole buffer it seems and the result is xhtml
137701

137729
consider packet sniffing instead which is pretty much a solved problem
137729
wireshark is handy as a stand alone utility you can use manually but it s also possible to do packet sniffing programmatically using winpcap the library on which wireshark is based
137738
red hat based systems fedora mandriva or debian based systems ubuntu
137754
if you re doing explicit loops when you could be doing operations on whole arrays that s the culprit
137754
this applies equally to all array-oriented dynamic languages perl data language numeric python matlab octave etc
137774
bypass the default evaluation rules and do not evaluate the expression symbol or s-exp passing it along to the function exactly as typed
137788
properties are just getter setter methods with differant syntax
137815
i ve generally been fine with plain old debian ubuntu has its caveats that sometimes hit you at wrong times
137841
for example a c program that opens a file with fopen ... r will see the lines in a consistent way linefeed only on any platform regardless of the actual line endings
137847
the standard python distribution comes with two command-line scripts in tools scripts called crlf.py and lfcr.py that can convert between windows and unix linux line endings
137848
in .net new lines are denoted by environment.newline so the framework is designed in such a way as to take whatever the system s new line is cr+lf or cr only or lf only to use at runtime
137850
if the argument to the free function does not match a pointer earlier returned by the calloc malloc or
137850
realloc function or if the space has been deallocated by a call to free or realloc
137876
be aware that each browser has their own version of watir watir ie firewatir firefox and safariwatir safari
137894
should i need to do a capture of the url with autohotkey for example i would send ctrl+l put focus in address bar and highlight content and ctrl+c copy selection to clipboard
137917
it works with both postgresql and mysql to perform non-blocking queries
137929
you can also easily export to a single file xml csv etc
137946
of course you can write good robust programs without using a lot of final modifiers anywhere but when you think about it.
137947
some people are confused by the standard disposable pattern and its use of a virtual method virtual dispose bool disposing and think this makes it ok to use any virtual method durring a dispose
137950
i m working on a django app right and i m using cherrypy as the server
137952
in between line items any number of blank lines can be added
137962
if my memory serves correctly the private keyword is the only way to create a privately scoped property getter or setter when its opposite has greater than private accessibility
138034
you also might want to consider opensolaris as it is from the same company which developed java in the first place and i ve heard rumours that it supports threading better than linux does and in java threads are quite important
138070
there are .net implementations out there amf.net for instance so it may be possible to somehow make it work with wcf - you need to explore this area yourself i have no direct experience here
138072
if you absolutely must make a class or method final make sure this class implements some interface so you can have a mock implementing the same interface
138088
using the global.asax application_error method as described in how to create custom error reporting pages in asp.net by using visual c# .net
138089
using fgets to get whole lines and sscanf to scan the strings means you always know the state of the file pointer and it s very easy to back up to the start of the line the string is still in memory
138095
just set to the appropriate value before initializing the cgi object or calling any cgi functions.
138121
jython is an implementation of the high-level dynamic object-oriented language python written in 100 pure java and seamlessly integrated with the java platform
138121
it thus allows you to run python on any java platform
138121
since you are coming from java jython may help you leverage python while still allowing you to use your java knowledge
138123
i know some virtual machine software at least vmware have features that allow software to detect virtualization
138146
websphere 6.1 ships with an ibm jdk 1.5 or is it 5
138146
if you need a 64 bit jvm i would suggest that there is probably a 64 bit build while i cannot comment on windows specifically i can tell you there is a 64 bit websphere 6.1 build for both aix and linux
138152
dynamic data for asp.net and asp.net mvc lets you do validation for model properties using attributes
138154
browser support currently is ie safari firefox 3.1 alpha
138157
i m just using basic system.out and system.in functionality but i m happy to rebuild my i o wrappers
138162
the idea is that as i develop multiple sites i can just add vhosts to apache called site1.local site2.local etc and have them all resolve to localhost while apache serves a different site accordingly
138203
is it possible for a stand alone executable to generate a report and output it as pdf or one of the other export options available from the report viewer without displaying the reportviewer control
138210
then add this account as a sql server login using windows authentication and add it to the sysadmin fixed server role
138259
if retrieval by index doesn t happen too often a sortedlist or sorteddictionary will have much better performance characteristics access by index can be achieved through the elementat extension method
138282
there are even svn tools guides and git tools guides out there that will do this cvs conversion for you
138285
empty does not mean zero length the array starts out with a size but all the elements in the array contains nothing
138285
aaa becomes 1 then aab becomes 2 so the hashtable is not sorted by any typical value
138306
even in scalar code loading 8-bit or 16-bit values is no slower than loading 32-bit since movzx movsx is no different in speed from mov
138313
i already wrote me a little program to find and load all html files but now i am stuck at how to extract src title and alt from this html
138320
you can also try simplexml if the html is guaranteed to be xhtml - it will parse the markup for you and you will be able to access the attributes just by their name
138322
in the end i rely mostly on 3rd-party storage backends like jena rdflib et al
138412
i can t get my gridview to enable a user to sort a column of data when i m using a custom sqldatasource
138414
udp tcp messages
138434
are you trying to set the display-property to table-row by any change
138440
the final keyword has visibility semantics when used on object attributes
138440
basically setting the value of a final object attribute happens-before the constructor returns
138440
this means that as long as you don t let the this reference escape the constructor and you use final for all you attributes your object is under java 5 semantics guarenteed to be properly constructed and since it is also immutable it can be safely published to other threads
138448
i need to create a button that has the same style as buttonspec with its type set to context is there any way to create a buttonspec that isn t directly attached to another control or have i missed a simple style option on another control
138450
also if you are using a dependency injection framework spring guice etc... the functor can be automatically initialized and injected wherever required
138458
if i have an .as file that is my custom component a swc class that contains the custom components skins and a css file that tells the custom class how it should look references the swc skin file how do i set up a library project using flexbuilder 3 to generate a single swc file that will contain everything
138463
if you use cryptographic hash md5 sha1 ripemd160 the hash will be unique modulo collisions which are very improbable -- sha1 is used for digital signatures and md5 is also collision-resistant on random inputs
138467
when handling the sorting event do you recreate the sqldatasource and rebound it to the gridview
138472
you put in and get out data by specifying the key you are operating on
138472
this implies that put key value get key contains key and remove key are all really fast
138504
next you can view logs for various types of attack - such as ddos which you ll want to check using ip tools as a lot of ddos attacks are made on non-web ports such as syn floods
138506
given an small excel vba app single form small amount of records saved in single worksheet that runs quite happily locally on the workstation what would be the easiest and quickest way of providing the same app on the web
138532
an example from the java-api is ioexception that has subclasses like filenotfoundexception or eofexception and much more
138550
for bonus points i d like to know how to make it safe don t overwrite existing registrations for the file type and remove the registration on uninstall only if it has been registered during installation and is unchanged
138587
the permission denied error is showing that the script is running with root credentials because it s looking in root s home dir for files
138596
view contains templates template objects handles template composition and nesting wraps with headers and footers and produces output in one of well known formats x html but also xml rss atom csv
138618
i would wrap the map inside a static object and put the map initialisation code in the constructor of this object this way you are sure the map is created before the initialisation code is executed
138641
i m duty-bound by policy to use cvs in this certain project so even though i d really to switch to something else like git i cannot
138667
of course i m working in an environment where the only available languages are some shity language which generates cobol omg omg bash old version perl i don t master it yet sed awk and some other command line utilities
138690
if you are the only one developing on the feature-branch you could simply use git as your sandbox development system and then once you have the changes done merge them into your cvs repository
138709
vim supports scripting in python and in perl as well i think
138736
for me it s western european dos or just ms-dos in microsoft word
138746
you can install an alternative hash generation function if you want to customise the way the id is generated it s a 128bit number generated via md5 by default
138779
there s a reason classes are broken into namespaces -- primarily for organization and to reduce naming conflicts
138825
so i m not really sure how the real and imaginary part of the input and output map to the arrays
138845
your graphics is tiled and thus you can easily recognize a block because it s using the same graphics as other blocks and all you would have to do is a program that when given a list of blocking tiles and a map can produce a collision map by comparing each tile with tiles in the blocking list
138850
qt c++ proprietary but free with the lgpl licensing

138871
i have a small lua python and c++ framework i made for that purpose want to add javascript for the backend with v8
138888
basic stuffs like session handling are a nightmare if you don t use a one because python is not web specialized like php
138888
if you think django is too much you can try a lighter one like the very small but still handy web.py
138898
you don t need a server for it as it s a distributed version control system - you can hold a whole repository copy on a flash drive and push pull changes from it
138929
there s a fairly intense discussion going on about the relative merits of csv json and xml
138929
we ve decided to provide xml and json due to the difficulty in recursion in csv needing multiple calls for a single logical operation
138944
json is a more compact object notation than xml so if you re looking for high volumes it has the advantage
138944
i would bet more devs are comfortable with working with xml data than with json
138949
normalisation makes updates much faster because each update is the smallest it can be you are updating the smallest - in terms of columns and rows - possible table
138950
if and when browsers are instructed to read the pages in utf-8 encoding with request headers and html meta-tag at least firefox 2 3 and other browsers from this period all encode the character themselves as d0 b6
138965
additionally for serialization to work correctly the class must have a default no arg constructor constructor can be private if needed
138973
xml - lots of libraries devs are familiar with it xslt can be easiily validated by both client and server xsd dtd hierarchical data
138973
xml - bloated harder to interpret in javascript than json
138973
the client can generate it from either xml or json if it s really needed
139034
i can see their point here but what i am wondering is with this top level set of classes any web service layer can simply call the same common method without having to rewrite code
139035
display mode - composed of the size width and height of the monitor in pixels bit depth number of bits per pixel and refresh rate how frequently the monitor updates itself
139055
i m using subversive plugin in ganymede but after today s update it stopped working - it just doesn t see any valid svn connectors i ve already been using 1.2.0 dev version of svnkit instead of a stable one because subversive ganymede could not handle it
139089
i don t have any experience with json csv works up to a point when your data is very tabular and evenly structured
139089
i have not tried this either but google s protocol buffers look really good simple format creates automatic bindings to c++ java and python and implements serialisation and deserialisation of the created objects
139112
then the actionscript that is supposed to play the movie fails because of the improper flash player version
139120
i suspect codeigniter doesn t have quite as flexible a structure it s smaller and lighter than cakephp but a quick look at the cakephp manual to see how behaviors components helpers and the vendors folder may be helpful
139213
system.out and system.in are statics and therefore evil
139218
while you might find a solution that works for strings for numerical predicates you need to also make sure they re only passing in numbers simple check is can it be parsed as int double decimal
139274
as another answerer pointed out however you may also need to deal with backspace escaping albeit not when passing the query to sql server using ado or ado.net at least -- can t vouch for all databases or technologies
139283
then shutdown and restart and at startup you look for and use the new files if found
139301
it might be a backslash windows forward slash linux os x bsd etc. or something else entirely on old or obscure oss
139308
datalist - more customisable version of the gridview
139308
listview - the new datalist
139308
almost a hybrid of the datalist and gridview where you can use paging and build in gridview like functionality but have the freedom of design
139333
insert a newline and spaces after every characters keep and indent counter to determine the number of spaces that you increment for every and decrement for every you see
139337
putting an exit statement as first statement in a function to disable the execution of that function instead of one of the following options
139363
in order to replicate the basic functionality for creating web pages that php offers out the box then you need two cpan modules that should be available in every base perl installation
139372
make sure that the streamreader and streamwriter objects you use all use the same encoding as the one you used with the xmlwriter not just the streamwriter like someone else suggested or
139372
don t use streamreader streamwriter
139441
both your streamwriter and your streamreader are using utf-8 because you re not specifying the encoding
139451
i deploy .war files developed in groovy with grails but there are more and more options for deploying php and ruby solutions
139478
i recommend using sorteddictionary string tvalue or sortedlist string tvalue
139478
from sorted data sortedlist of
139482
of course getting a system like that to work properly proper text wrap alignment styling etc. seems almost akin to writing my own document renderer from scratch
139484
i would prefer a posix shell solution or at least something that works in bash on cygwin
139516
it is essential but you can achieve nearly the same effect with a listview that is using a gridview can t you
139546
the vb.net language is related but not compatible with vb6
139546
conversion between vb6 and vb.net is problematic
139602
expect is a tool for automating interactive applications such as telnet ftp passwd fsck rlogin tip etc
139605
for debian and ubuntu there s packages.debian.org and packages.ubuntu.com
139624
you can store data for the mockup as inline xml in the xaml or you can quickly convert it to wpf silverlight application and build basic business logic behind your mockup using visual c# express or visual studio 2008
139627
if you meet all the criteria of listview but you would naturally fit in a grid you may consider datalist
139633
commit and rollback
139645
for example if you package log4j v1 in the war file log4j v2 at ear level and you put log4j v3 in your app-server s class path the module will use the jar in its own module
139646
with sql server or mysql if there is a pk with auto increment truncate will reset the counter
139674
when you have a monstrous quantity of files to copy from one directory to another doing cp an other dir doesn t work if the number of files is too high and explode the bash globber so the tar pipe
139723
i ve been using various javascript frameworks including mootools jquery prototype and scriptaculous and have found them all good but difficult to extend to more complex ideas
139744
short answer declare the variable as close to first use as possible and initialize to zero if you still need to
139771
you should now be able to run further operations on this file perhaps in some language such as python c# or java
139790
this doesn t require any recompilation just change the app pool to 2.0 then switch to x64 using the above adsutil.vbs script set to 0 rather than 1
139814
the filtering and sorting features of excel lend themselves well to logfile analysis
139821
what is the bare minimum i need to put in web.config to get wcf working with rest
139866
write clones of junit and jmock checks refelction metaprogramming
139894
windows nlb is definitely your solution - it sits in the network stack on each of your iis servers and distributes tcp requests among the member servers
139921
when i try this the page reloads the action is # but any new text typed in the fields is not passed in the request so i don t get to put it in the db
139938
the closest well-regarded equivalent to php in perl is probably html mason
139938
like php it embeds perl into your document and renders it
139948
currently when the submit button is selected the javascript confirm box appears and once confirmed the asp.net server-side validation controls are fired
139964
i m trying to get the build automated using cruisecontrol cruisecontrol.net isn t an option so i m trying to tie it into normal ant scripts and i keep on running into problems with the length of the paths
139998
try playing around with the command-line svn before trying to use svnkit
140024
i believe you need to write your own serializer for it to basically save out the width height and pixel values.
140026
the exact choice of what rows are selected will need some tuning and it s important that it s possible for the person running the cluster eg myself to update the selection criteria without getting each and every server administrator to deploy a new version of the server
140026
the language needs to be capable of simple expression evaluation as well as querying table indexes and iterating through the returned rows
140053
but regarding what you said i think it s because there s conflict in the way your browser handles javascript dom
140108
it may be acceptable to put the apache server on the dev server and host the files remotely on a stable backed-up file server though there are a number of pitfalls with this approach if you are unable to get additional server resources
140111
signals are created by certain user inputs ctrl-c triggers a sigint on both platforms for instance
140134
this works great using the eclipse save actions which adds these final modifiers among other things when saving the file
140138
however you can cheat and look at its readobject and writeobject code - find width and height grab the pixels with pixelgrabber
140142
otherwise the client will want to either trust the root certificate or the certificate associated with the server s fully qualified host name
140188
edit as pointed out by mmyers this method doesn t work on input that contains substrings corresponding to bytes with the high bit set 80 - ff
140192
if your using oracle s java jvm you could try to use svnkit to communicate with the svn server nativly from java instead of shelling out to the operating system to execute commands
140228
you may have a parser generator tool like antlr or yacc you can use to help you generate the parser or use a language like lisp scheme and marry the two up
140283
if it s a client app that doesn t use asp.net etc you may be able to use the .net client profile install which is much smaller c
140303
obviously it is a viewstate exception but i can t reproduce the error on the page that is throwing the exception a simple two textbox form with a button and navigation links
140311
there s a mod for ruby perl and python for instance and probably a fair few others
140320
having tried trac and mantis its my personal fav
140335
you may have trouble with this if you upgrade your installation to 3.5sp1 even in the core functionalities
140359
it certainly looks nicer and has better usability than mantis or bugzilla but it s not open and it makes some tradeoffs for a simpler interface
140390
i don t know how familier you are with a scriptlanguage like perl python or ruby
140406
i have a bunch of items in our inventory database with length width and height dimesions defined
140415
well as said in the other posts and in the question xsd will ensure that you re using the right type at the right place in your xml and that you ll have to think twice before changing its structure
140415
hopefully xsd is not the only way to validate a xml a much more simpler approach is to use relaxng and especially its compact syntax which is really more readable than what you could ever imagine with xsd
140428
if the min max solutions are not good enough if the dates are not contiguous and you want to group separate date ranges separately i wonder if something using oracle s start with and connect by clauses would work
140437
xsd s are not the only xml schema available
140437
relaxng lets you express the schema in xml rather than necessitating learning yet another data language as xsd s do
140448
on debian ubuntu you can install the -dbg packages to get symbols
140463
i would recommend that you make them aware of the legislation advise them to get a lawyer there are lots of good ones around who specialise in information law and put it in writing
140469
i think hudson can even be used to call ant tasks though a maven wrapper might be in order
140471
for generic possibly malformed html there are libraries to handle that kigurai recommends beautifulsoup for python i know also tagsoup for java there are others
140501
if the width is greater then height 3 4 screen.width then
140510
i would like to avoid getting strings from hessian and then do some json xml parsing to get objects.
140523
that monitors in general follow a certain ratio whereas the . avail width should be outside of it because the screen is duplicated only in terms of width but not height
140529
i m debating on how to approach this - i ve got some experience in java c++ perl and python but have never had the chance or opportunity to write and distribute an app to others of any significance
140549
is there any unambigous way in which a client can determine in which character set to interpret encoded octets or in which a server can determine what a client used to encode with
140602
i know this because i am sniffing all http traffic with fiddler and it is not a localhost call
140609
in terms of language support you can do it in c++ java c# python etc
140668
a multi-core processor or multiple processors to increase the chances of catching threading bugs
140690
if you have some code that you want to get other opinions on how to optimize the code then not having the author participate may be helpful in getting ideas and then having the author either make the change or justify why the change doesn t improve the code if someone wants to put in a bubble sort algorithm this may be rejected because of other more efficient sorting algorithms like quicksort mergesort and heapsort
140717
perl and python do
140719
it depends if you consider the crt stl boost to be part of c++ or an optional add-on library
140721
i ve used nunit for years but when we moved to vs2008 and tfs 2008 using teambuild we decided to try mstest
140734
when the image is put into the html pages it is done so using a url such as images get 200x200 guid .jpg which is rewritten to a php script
140786
min and max are ints and represent minimum and maximum values inclusive
140845
.net 3.0 is a bad name for some new libraries wpf wcf workflow and infocard
140858
is it possible to make a site with asp.net mvc framework using .net 2.0
140859
ant maven and a host of other build platforms are supported
140883
i had to do it that way recently to circumvent limits imposed by a shared host - exec et al was disabled for php run by the webserver but could run in a shell script
140914
.net framework provides linq to do this or you can use the .net system.data namespace to load data from xml files
140972
7000 lines of c++ write in c style split over 7 methods most methods are 600+ lines lots of one line macros which contain gotos to labels within the methods
140978
i ve actually seen this in production code albeit delphi not c++
141011
depending on your mysql installation and or configuration you have to set the connection encoding so that mysql knows what encoding you re expecting on the client side meaning the client side of the mysql connection which should be you php script
141033
desired width and height of the
141071
and xml-based language for uis is a blessing all modern ui platforms do that be it dhtml flex or wpf silverlight
141075
this works in common browsers i checked in ie firefox and safari
141138
i don t know about packet repitition but i ve never encountered it using tcp ip and i know that it does guarantee that the packets all arrive and in the correct order so i can t understand why it wouldn t
141153
however if they re the same packets with new sequence numbers then no
141162
it can be system dependent for linux specifically debian and or ubuntu
141184
tcp uses sequence numbers to detect duplication in the case of retransmission which will also prevent trivial replay attacks
141184
from rfc 793 section 3.3 - sequence numbers
141184
sequence numbers will also ensure that insertion rather than replacement of data in the data stream will be noticed as further legitimate packets following forged packets will have duplicate sequence numbers which will disrupt the data flow
141198
in my tests of safari 3.1 and firefox 3 window.event is always undefined
141220
php arrays act as a map table mapping keys to values
141224
a malicious person could start requesting random urls always altering the height width of the image
141244
is there a equivalent way of setting a property name to something else strictly for the purposes of serialization deserialization using the regular javascriptserializer
141271
0x04 is hex for 4 the 0x is just a common prefix convention for base 16 representation of numbers - since many people think in decimal and that would be the fourth byte since they are saying offset they probably count the first byte as byte 0 so offset 0x04 would be the 5th byte
141275
0x04 in hex is 4 in decimal
141275
0x10 in hex is 16 in decimal
141275
calc.exe can convert between hex and decimal for you
141325
before the queries are run against the dataset they are put through a query optimizer the optimizer attempts to organize the query in such a fashion that it can remove as many tuples rows from the result set as quickly as it can
141325
often when you use subqueries especially bad ones the tuples can t be pruned out of the result set until the outer query starts to run
141340
but if you re worried about that you d be worried about potential loss of precision in the original code in the case where max - min or rand_max is large
141341
there is a documented mysql bug on mktime localtime strtotime all returning this odd value when you try a pre-epoch time including 0000-00-00 00 00 00
141346
in summary assume they are different instances and don t inject your self those kind of objects
141357
obviously if you opt for smart pointers then you can t store temp stack allocated objects as you have said
141406
when i try to re-import that subreport into my 2nd master report i m getting the error access denied then re-importing the subreport failed
141422
it is easy to transform input output to and from the coordinate spaces but the end user is only interested in the coefficients a b .... z since they can reconstruct the polynomial on their own
141435
can anyone explain what advantages there are to using a tool like msbuild or nant to build a collection of projects versus running devenv.exe from the command-line
141440
asp.net 3.5 is still running on the .net 2.0 clr if you go into iis you ll see that you can only pick 2.0 or 1.1
141459
event objects are passed to an event listener as an argument in firefox and safari
141464
the prime reason for using an external build tool like nant or msbuild is the ability to automate your build process and thus provide continous feedback on the status of your system
141472
browsers like safari and firefox pick up on the end tags with their respective innerhtml methods but internet explorer s innerhtml method ignores them

you could also on any change to the cache re- start a timer with the interval set to the closest expiry timestamp

i test many environments windows 2000 xp vista mac 10.4 10.5 and for each of those that apply safari 2 3 firefox 2 3 internet explorer 6 7
141515
javascript s childnodes is unreliable because safari firefox ignore whitespace comment nodes while internet explorer doesn t
141520
you can integrate svn support with tortoisesvn into visual studio with visualsvn which is commercial but not actually expensive
141529
the most efficient way to do this is to calculate the total time difference then subtract the time that is a weekend or holiday
141541
onfocus openx true onblur openx false onchange openx false
141546
i worked on a project that required another set of eyes on any code prior to committing
141550
then do some math to find out if your start time or end time falls on a non-working day and subtract the difference
141550
if your query on isworkingday start returns false subtract from 24 the time from start to midnight which would give you 12 hours or 36 hours total non-working hours
141554
your key in the prepopulated_fields dictionary is the field you want filled and the value is a tuple of fields you want concatenated
141563
this gives me the functions that were involved what files were involved and what line or lines were involved in the error as well as whatever custom message i created so that i know exactly what s going on
141570
you probably want the isinstance builtin function
141576
bitshifting can be used for insanely fast multiplication and division provided you are working with a power of 2
141576
now we get the same offset as before except instead of an expensive multiplication operation we use the two bitshifts...in x86 it would be something like this note it s been forever since i ve done assembly editor s note corrected a couple mistakes and added a 32-bit example
141607
while you could do all this with regular scripts using nant or msbuild give you a solid framework for doing all this
141626
i need to analyse the form s postdata in the navigating event handler before the request is sent
141638
you need to control the serialization and deserialization logic in order to unhook and re-hook objects together
141638
you could do other things such as adding custom attributes to use for linking objects together which don t exist as public properties on the objects being serialized
141642
where x is any programming language c# javascript lisp perl ruby scheme etc which supports some flavour of closures
141642
some limitations are mentioned in the closures in python compared to ruby s closures but the article is old and many limitations do not exist in modern python any more
141669
i am considering building an application that is a blend of a dynamic language python or ruby and compiled language and need some help getting convincing myself that this is a good idea
141679
plus it works on windows linux and osx
141690
many programs are a mixture of a high-level language like python or ruby and a low-level language like c
141693
if we were to use the build process for deployment it would be a matter of creating the right configuration for the production environment production.build.properties
141785
otherwise just pick a root language perl and ruby use c so their incorporation is pretty simple
141785
you could also run python jython or ruby jrunby on a java vm which would give you java as a backend
141791
but if you use calloc or memset the full size of the structures before using them you can do a shallow comparison with memcmp if your structure contains pointers it will match only if the address the pointers are pointing to are the same
141792
most of the places i ve worked have used the first method with environment specific configuration information deployed separately and updated much more rarely outside of the war ear
141793
then have a busy while loop that basically keeps on checking those values figuring out the current cpu usage and waiting a calculated amount of time to keep the processor at a certain threshhold
141798
using display none in conjunction with javascript and css is the easiest way of simply showing or hiding dom elements on the fly
141814
next i d introduce them to perldoc and show them the basics of using it the -f and -q flags perldoc perl and perldoc perltoc etc. they need to know where to look when they have questions
141840
if you called begin transaction before you did it and have not yet called commit then you can call rollback otherwise.
141873
all of these operators can be applied to integer values int long possibly short and byte or char
141873
as you can see the digits have shifted to the left by one position and the last digit on the right is filled with a zero
141894
nmake seems to work but it had a problem when i changed the location of the project in my directory tree i checked out of svn into a new clean dir to try the build
141972
antlr provides libraries for python sql java c++ c c# etc
141975
how do the full text search systems of postgresql and mysql compare
141996
it also means every deployment machine has a different jar war file
141996
copy the jar war files to a production server in a shared directory named after the subversion revision number
142018
i m not well versed in postgresql unfortunately but if you use the full text search in mysql you re immediately tied to myisam
142057
as was stated above - xbox360 is fully capable of any hlsl calculation and specifically it can handle vertex and pixel shader model 3 instructions and has an enhanced set of instructions that are specific to the platform
142062
in my mind there is absolutely no reason to use classic asp compared to asp.net webforms or asp.net mvc
142064
see my threading article for a winforms example - although the article was written before backgroundworker arrived on the scene and i m afraid i haven t updated it in that respect
142080
microsoft excel uses scroll lock to allow you to scroll the spreadsheet around with the arrow keys without changing the active selected cell -- in line with the scroll lock key s original intent
142100
that being said i greatly prefer asp.net both mvc and webforms myself - but i left asp development about 7 years ago
142103
whene there is an exception the exception handler saves the stack trace and prints a url on the console that can be used to retrieve the debugging session over http
142105
my application was setting that to 0 0 and the max height and width to exactly the screen resolution size not inflated
142156
just remember that if you have a warehousing strategy of dropping indexes before updating a table then recreating them you will have to set the index up for monitoring again and you ll lose any monitoring history for that index
142165
if you remove the generic constraint above where t entity you could make this a generic rules engine that could be used with any poco
142170
there are many ways to select a cell or a range of cells but the following will work for a single cell
142201
i have found that if i just let them code i will get something very naive put together
142214
if it s really important to get the full string to display in the titlebar of a form then only way i can think of to ensure that the entire title is displayed would be to get the width of the titlebar text and use that to increase the width of your form so that it can accommodate the complete title string
142218
i usually add a second applicationsettings element with the name persistent in addition to the default settings with anything the user configures to go in the settings object and anything i just save window position to the persistent object
142225
i might be starting a new project in .net soon and would prefer not to use an xml-based build tool like nant or msbuild
142225
i like rake but i m thinking it may be better to have something based on a .net dynamic language such as boo similar in spirit to gant or buildr for java
142234
in both cases i mean test doubles created by some mocking library fakes where that works for the test stubs where you need to return something to the object under test and mocks if you really have to
142240
some fancy compilers understand the un interrelatedness of instructions to a limited extent and will automatically interleave instruction flows probably over a longer window than the cpu sees to better utilise the processor
142291
it makes the processor look like two processors to the operating system so you d need to use an actual threading library to take advantage of that
142291
gcc g++ will from verion 4.2 and newer
142297
this would still box unbox but it would allow you to store the clone back into the field effectively making it the real value
142303
are you referring to one single-core processor or multiple processors or cores
142306
that s how ant and maven and lots of other tools use declarative syntax to describe procedures
142317
public static void main string args throws exception
142330
this is safe and unsetting the backup flag and restarting the slave process with the archive logs generated during the backup process available
142335
bitwise operations including bit shift are fundamental to low-level hardware or embedded programming
142335
also common is using bit shifts for fast multiplication and division by powers of 2
142358
otherwise i just ignore the small fixes as far as version numbers go though i do have subversion revision numbers if i need to refer back for myself
142363
is there some functionality that nant msbuild don t provide that you expect to need
142406
if class b is not marked final then it s possible that the actual type of v2 is some class that extends b and overrides foo
142410
if file is a few megabytes then that is one resource-consuming statement - you might exhaust your heap or cause a watchdog timeout or generally slow down the response of the embedded system
142446
if you can get qa to by in and are on svn you could use the svn head revision as the build number
142470
hopefully the so community has programmers who have good and bad experiences with things like rails asp.net django turbogears or jsf
142475
blas - standard set of routines for linear algebra - stuff like matrix multiplication
142475
scalapack - distributed lapack implementation
142477
in addition the netmask at the end is an assumption of 24 or class c subnet

i really like the the maven integration for eclipse m2eclipse eclipse m2e
142533
xpath is a notation for locating a node within the document that is used as part of xslt and xquery
142549
if you are using maven to automate your build i would recommend you use the cargo plugin to deploy your application to the server
142549
if you cannot use your container s deployer you can still use maven with a bit more work to deploy your web application using scp sftp ftp or even webdav via wagon
142565
the group contains w which means non-word character and - so the regex should match any non-word character or any hyphen
142577
personally i started using .html moved onto php tried ruby hated it discovered python django
142587
by design a detail row only contains records that match the master you cannot for example change an order to belong to a new customer because the detail row does not contain any customer information
142614
does anyone have c# code handy for doing a ping and traceroute to a target computer
142635
for libraries stl is good then boost
142641
update once you re comfortable with the stl and start needing to do things that require a lot of code with the stl or are just plain tricky then head over to boost
142667
for turbogears pylons and django development speed is roughly equal
142667
python is famously fast to develop and debug and i would put any python framework as having a shorter development time than any other setup i ve worked with including php perl embedded perl and c# asp.net
142672
in mysql the auto increment counter gets reset with truncate but not with delete
142701
then all the classes that comprise the business objects for the application simply have a reference to the record in the data set that contains their information and all the methods for the class simply parse from the record set
142702
the svn revision gives you the very exact peace of code sent to the customer
142714
as with any lookup you need to use current

i d like to how to upgrade the default python installation 2.5.2 supplied with ubuntu 8.04 to python 2.6rc2
142801
in mozilla firefox camino safari google chrome you can use this
142803
i think the project working directory is used as the root folder for all commands in the cruisecontrol block
142855
what programming languages support arbitrary precision arithmetic and could you give a short example of how to print an arbitrary number of digits
142861
i comment public or protected functions with meta-comments and usually hit the private functions if i remember
142882
for example take a look at java.math.bigdecimal in java or decimal.decimal in python
142896
all of these packages are designed using fairly modern c++ techniques there are python apis as well as some c and fortran
142928
what is the best language to use for this python c++ java...
142931
i d say c++ you have far more flexibility in manipulating raw chunks of memory than python or java
142937
you can either use prototype s well scriptaculous actually ajax.autocompleter and ditch jquery or you can use jquery s accordion and get rid of prototype
142943
the basic premise is to first calculate the width of the form s caption text and then to use getsystemmetrics to get the width of various bits of the window such as the border and window frame width the width of the minimize maximize and close buttons and so on i split these into their own functions for readibility clarity
142953
scheme a variation of lisp has a capability called bignum
142967
if you are looking to numerical work on your images think matrix and you into python check out - this is basically the ability to do matlab in python buddy of mine swears by it
142972
a new feed has been introduced with a packed decimal comp-3 field which needs to be converted to a numerical value
142972
i am concerned that the binary field may contain what will be interpreted as very-low ascii codes or control characters instead of a value - or worse may be lost in the ftp process
143006
it refuses to respond to the mouse or keyboard and the only way to shut it down is to use task manager
143012
if you do go for the c++ option or python come to think of it i would again suggest the use of a library to get you over the startup issues of reading and writing files
143021
have the processthread create a thread message with the payload to go on the wire and send it to the networkthread push it on the networkthread s queue mailbox and signal the condition variable of the networkthread so he ll wake up and pull it off
143045
however the sheer power behind the .net platform makes it invaluable in an enterprise environment where your web is often time blurred with your other applications
143055
out of curiosity why are you still working with vb6 instead of vb.net
143066
typedef struct vbcomputernamestruct
143066
typedef struct vbnetwarelogininfostruct
143098
i have started using presentation model w asp.net webforms and like the pattern quite a bit
143163
depending on your ide and if you can change scm you might want to have a look at other fully distributed scms think mercurial bazaar git ... which support distributed development out of the box
143196
setup the gridview columns and in codebehind bind that result to the grid view
143200
since https isn t supported either by the http get file action the possible workaround of allowing basic authentication on your site isn t a good idea as you would be passing credentials over the network in plain text
143219
you can not use argv 0 for that purpose usually it does contain full path to the executable but not nessesarily - process could be created with arbitrary value in the field
143231
what are good ways to determine whether user input mouse movement keyboard input is human-generated and not automated
143233
basically what i would really like to do is find a way to redefine or redirect the stdin handle to some other value that i create inside of my program and then use fwrite from these tests so that the corresponding fread inside of the class pulls the data from within the program not from the actual standard i o handles associated with the executable
143243
you should be able to use freopen to point stdin to an arbitrary file
143291
no an enum is generally the same size as an int same as boolean
143298
further analysis with javap will reveal that each field is initialized by creating a new object by calling the new constants string constructor in the static initialization block.
143305
packet sniffing and forging are usually the first way games online anyways are automated
143316
a common method of listening to keyboard and mouse input in an application is setting a windows hook using setwindowshookex
143341
what i d like to know about are there any frameworks that handle the requirements of handling an ordered set of long running actions including but not limited to database calls calculations outside the event dispatch thread
143361
bool might be implemented as a single byte but typically in a structure it would be surrounded by other elements that have alignment requirements that would mean that the boolean would effectively be occupying at least as much space as an int
143378
note also that the w3c markup validation service has an option to clean up markup with html tidy after validation result display

lua seems to be popular in c c++ but at least luajava requires additional .dll .so which makes deployment complicated
143432
i don t think they re talking about portability in terms of porting actual code
143455
it can be read as every string starting with alt title or src then a then a a bunch of stuff that are not and ends with a
143501
this has to be done from a mouse button event or a click you can t force the user into full screen without some interaction on their part
143501
if it s in an element that scales automatically like a grid cell and the grid resizes automatically like if it s the root element on the page and the page doesn t have a width or height specified then you re good but otherwise you ll need to handle the application.current.host.content.fullscreenchanged event and either resize or apply a scale transform to the image or its container to make it fill the screen and do the same when you go back to non full screen mode
143515
going back to my previous question on ocsp does anybody know of reliable ocsp libraries for python java and c
143537
search directory dir before standard
143552
and i want to check if another date range contains any of the ranges already in the list how would i do that
143564
if you are talking about changing on the client side before a post removing fields which are not relevant based on the input in some fields as the user types you can use javascript to remove fields from the dom
143623
i m trying to create a binsor configuration file where i use logging
143623
this works great all components that are registered with the container and that takes an ilogger object as an argument to the constructor will receive the correct ilogger instance
143633
i have a more specific case here too i m wondering if there are other ways to achieve a smaller-than-normal titlebar for my window than ws_ex_toolwindow
143633
the tool window style would otherwise suit my needs but in addition to the normal window border it seems to add this one-pixel wide white border inside the black outline and that just looks really ugly for my purposes
143634
and then i ll send my events into the midi stream or into whatever control api the synth library provides
143659
strings have encode and decode methods
143659
similarly you can encode and decode base64
143680
run a command to build the source into a final state perform any source parsing or configuration necessary for the local environment
143703
i would also like to mention that you should try to use http or https over normal 80 443 ports - these are the least likely to cause problems with the firewalls and proxy
143767
they can do most of the heavy lifting for you especially when your program is more declarative than imperative but they still require the programmer to opt-in do analysis for correctness meaningfulness and probably make slight alterations to the structure of the code to make it all work.
143775
i think you should consider moving your code from asp vbscript to visual basic com dlls
143784
areas that differentiate the computer scientist from the programmer a grounding in discrete mathematics a basic understanding of vlsi and systems architecture an understanding of the basics of cryptography and security an understanding of computability theory an understanding of information theory
143789
is there a product out there that can generate arbitrary packets and packet sequences
143819
to be honest if the database content has any commercial value or contains personal data about individuals you should really control who has access to the datafiles whether encrypted or not
143824
for now the only solution to this that i have found is to use the asp.net ajax javascriptserializer to do the json serialization deserialization in javascript and then just use silverlight to store retrieve the resulting string
143826
running your application through valgrind will allow you to verify if you forget to release memory allocated with malloc if you free the same memory twice etc
143846
render your font using whatever arrange the characters in a grid and save the image in a simple uncompressed format like ppm bmp or tga
143846
if you want antialiasing make sure to use a format that supports transparency bmp and tga do
143846
finally to render a string you look up each character and bitblit its rectangle from the font bitmap onto your frame buffer advancing the raster position by the width of the character
143861
try looking at the source of the best php frameworks - zend s symfony and cakephp
143877
database access object-relational mapping via a tool like ibatis ibatis.net
143888
if you simply take 100 test coverage to mean that every line of source code is exercised by the test suite at some point then this is a good goal but sometimes there are just a couple of lines in awkward places that are hard to reach with automated tests
143888
if the cost of manually verifying that functionality periodically is less than the cost of going through contortions to reach those last five lines then that is a good reason not to have 100 line coverage
143888
rather than a simple rule that you should have 100 line coverage encourage your developers to discover any gaps in your testing and find ways to fix those gaps whether or the number of lines covered improves
143888
in other words if you measure lines covered then you will improve your line coverge but what you actually want is improved quality
143891
at a previous employer we had a home-grown vb.net application that would turn an xml schema definition file xsd into a static c++ library
143916
given a set of n points and m polygons extract all the points that lie in any of the polygons
143932
an alternative is to double the capacity of the array every time you need more storage
143977
i ve used one to generate serializable data objects which could be reformed across different platforms windows linux solaris mac bsd etc
143982
for example instead of using reflection to call method x you generate a dynamic method at runtime to do this for you
144020
conversion a double is represented completely differently from an int
144049
the server hardware would be old and low-memory but running on a relatively up-to-date debian gnu linux install
144050
they could type in a line of code or a couple lines and it would be compiled loaded into an app domain and executed and then unloaded
144087
you might want to try keyczar as mentioned by me in your other post since that library actually has implementations for both python and java
144089
however many linq methods special case for when the object implementing ienumerable actually implements icollection

the problem is that the git svn dcommit will only make one revision in svn.
144170
in leu of clever comments i m just going to accept keeping the git history and grafting to the most recent svn revision using the second code chunk above

if you were doing this on unix linux i would suggest running it from the command line and piping it through an awk script
144201
right now i m using komodo with some good success but their vim bindings have enough little errors that i m tired of it
144218
is there any way to do this without having to set the decimal precision manually
144231
edit you can alternatively call quantize every time you multiply or divide addition and subtraction will preserve the 2 dps
144233
it does mean the size of the font but using it for width height is useful for creating designs that scale with the font-size
144233
before when they could only change the size of the text using em for width height would allow those elements to scale also

gui-wise mono supports the windows.forms api on unix and macos but if you want a more native experience you can use the gtk# api this provides a .net api for the gnome library stack or you can use qyoto if you want to integrate instead with the kde apis

you should also have a book on general databases without going deep into the specifics of oracle mysql sql server etc

distinguish between prefix and postfix forms of increment and decrement operators
144460
this gives a lot of fault-tolerance and reliability and possibly some performance benefit but it also throws up a lot of headaches
144467
and use a component that has a prompt to show the prompt and enable input and a also follows the usual shell abstraction of having stdin an inputstream that reads from the prompt but can be bound to let s say files or so and stdout and possibly stderr outputstreams bound to the textarea s text

preview 5 of asp.net mvc has an extension method on httprequest called isajaxmvcrequest that detects if the post was an ajax request
144477
what i want to do is inject this value using script i can t use a hidden field as it defeats the purpose into the form post - and i don t know how to do that with jquery
144486
you ll probably want to use a hashmap for the outer map and arraylist s for the inner lists
144541
this would more or less accomplish the same thing that you re describing because then you could extend the dataaccessobject class to provide custom methods and properties for situations that require some amount of manually constructed code
144551
core data will generate not only a getter setter pair for the children property but the mutable-set accessors as well so you can use -mutablesetvalueforkey on it and manipulate the result with a minimum of overhead
144569

i don t want to start a language flame war and i m sure both ruby and python have their tradeoffs so i ll list what s important to me personally
144661
please tell me whether ruby python or some other language would be best for me
144685
both python and ruby can do what you want
144707
python java etc have bindings and i can code in those languages i just dont want the additional dependencies in this project
144716
example kde gnome x11 itself
144723
mono does not use qt kde or gtk+ gnome widgets because they don t match up with the winforms api
144723
cairo deals with the native graphics implementation such as x11 in linux or quartz in os x
144734
most of the low-level database and network methods operate on a global reference to the main form and directly show hide and modify the form
144761
where dictionary is a map like this with more entries
144762
i would also recommend that you accommodate yourself as a programmer from a testing standpoint and from the point of view that things change and there may need to be a keyboard mouse attached to a non-touch workstation
144771
and just as a complete set of tax forms includes not just the main tax form but others that may need to be filled out additional schedules for example so a package contains not just the main classes but other classes it may need to interact with
144778
i don t know about web services with php but if it were .net you would want to talk about serialization deserialization
144812
but you should keep the view decoupled from the framework and just have it dispatch events and have a mediator deal with the facade
144837
don t put any controls near the edges of the screen - it s very hard to get your finger into the edges particularly if the screen has a deep bezel and a slight calibration problem can easily shift the control too close to the edge to use
144864
there s not really a huge difference between python and ruby at least at an ideological level
144881
if sremove is equal to all which indicates an uninstall is taking place you can skip the firebird installation
144890
other than that quicksort is known to be very fast on arrays just like mergesort is the common choice for lists
144902
how fast would the lookup time be for the contains ... method and for retrieving the value to store in object o
144928
then get the cgimage s data provider from that a cfdata representation of the bitmap
144938
there is also a debian and ubuntu package named nxml-mode
144938
all that being said you will probably have to use something like tidy to re-format your xhtml example
144939
put the attribute on a short method or the getter or setter of a property and you ll fly right by even when hitting step into in the debugger
144953
note it usually makes sense to set both the min and max size of this widget to the sdl surface size
144956
then you can find it through javascript by traversing the dom
144963
should probably get into rest vs nonrest formats xml json csv...
145018
bottom line exception.data gives you serialization for free just by sticking your properties into it -- but just remember those items need to be serializable
145025
as you may know in wcf there is an operationcontext object from which you can retrieve the security credentials passed in by the caller client
145049
if you have a smart enough compiler it will do some automatic inlining for you even if you did not specify inline
145053
i ve used javascript for many years for client side scripting in web applications and apart from using prototypes it was all simple dom manipulation input validation etc
145059
that rules out i2c or spi which is unfortunate because they meet your other requirements
145059
if you re not building a commercial product but instead building something for your own use to put in the engine compartment you can probably get by with usb
145070
if your goal is to learn functional language concepts try starting with a pure functional language like ocaml or haskell
145075
that said one of the pluses of developing a web application in java is that the interface for working with the http is standardized the servlet specification so that you can pick any servlet container you want be it glassfish tomcat jetty or weblogic
145087
if its mainly cpu bound then i would create no more than 1 worker thread per processor core on the box
145094
you can do all the things you list -- log php errors with request environment data do mysql slow query logging and do analysis and application profiling -- relatively easily without zend platform from the cli and i ve always done it by building logging hooks into the application and then things like shell scripts mon and monit for alerts status gui
145102
danger of falling victim to the second-system effect -- in summary people who have designed something only once before try to do all the things they didn t get to do last time loading the project up with all the things they put off while making version one even if most of them should be put off in version two as well.
145115
of course just for completeness there is an environment variable delimident that can be set - to any value but y is safest - to indicate that double quotes always surround delimited identifiers and single quotes always surround strings.
145117
programming c++ with boost or stl is a very different experience than programming in c
145138
1 you could add routes with the prefix v1 v2 etc. that set a parameter that you can then access in the controller to specify the processing to occur
145153
there isn t really a lot to separate python and ruby
145153
i d say the python community is larger and more mature than the ruby community and that s really important for me
145153
javascript was originally designed to be scheme for the web and it s prototype-based which is an advantage over python and ruby as far as multi-paradigm and metaprogramming is concerned
145191
i understand that ironpython is an implementation of python on the .net platform just like ironruby is an implementation of ruby and f# is more or less ocaml
145195
ironpython and ironruby are built on top of the dlr -- dynamic language runtime -- and are compiled to cil the bytecode used by .net on the fly
145196
also c++ is catching up with new note the quotes features like the stl containers auto pointers etc -- see the boost library for example
145213
to mount automatically everytime put a line in etc fstab use one of the existing lines as an example - you will have to be root to do this
145230
there s only about a dozen or so oss written in java about half a dozen in c# something on the order of two oss in haskell only one in python and none in ruby or javascript
145270
what would be the quickest way to construct a python binding to a c or c++ library
145273
if it ll be dealing with natural text filenames then it would be better to use vb.net cause vb6 doesn t support unicode well
145292
available on osx linux and windows
145300
ironruby has the potential to be as fast ironpython since many of the interesting features that make ironpython fast have been extracted into the dynamic language runtime on which both ironpython and ironruby and managed javascript dynamic vb ironscheme vistasmalltalk and others are built
145300
e.g. common lisp is a language that is even more dynamic than ruby or python and yet there are common lisp compilers out there that can even give c a run for its money
145310
yourkit s .net profiler
145327
vim emacs
145347
one of the official python documents contains details on extending python using c c++
145384
they re python-like languages for interfacing between c c++ and python
145389
as i am using for-loops on large multi-dim arrays any saving on the for-loop mechanism itself is meaningful
145404
just launch it enter the dns host name or ip address in the server name box and hit connect
145424
but later i have to move on to linux ubuntu for an requirement
145426
i d need to know something like max width max height etc.
145433
in this blog article by assaf arkin there is a nice case study a 5 443 line 52 file maven configuration was reduced to 485 lines of buildr
145433
and even though everybody says ruby is slow buildr was 2-6x faster than maven
145437
btw unless you need post-increment you should always use the pre-increment operator
145449
notice in the bottom right hand corner of this page it has the svn revision id
145450
by deferring account status feedback until a later date they fail to understand what got them caught
145454
i ve use python a very bit but much more ruby
145470
you can use the svnversion cli utility to get a more specific look at the revision including the highest number
145481
unfortunately i cannot compare python to ruby since i never used that language
145491
your 4 important points lead to ruby exactly while the 2 somewhat important points ruled by python
145513
compare that with perl ruby or whatever where you have an extreme freedom which isn t that good in this case
145526
what is more important is to establish best practices for example use as little out or ref parameters as possible.
145538
coding standards are a common way of ensuring that code within a certain organization will follow the principle of least surprise consistency in standards starting from variable naming to indentation to curly brace use
145540
is it easy to set up a user-mode linux sandbox on debian
145551
so is there any thing like a universal reflections api that would work for all languages or maybe for a few mainstream languages .net java ruby python
145559
i have yet so see a real life effect on this i played only with concepts but by then the difference was seconds of execution for jit and zero for c++ but this is worth mentioning alongside the fact template metaprograming is not trivial.
145559
c# readonly and java final are nowhere as useful as c++ s const there s no way you can expose readonly complex data a tree of nodes for example in c# without tremendous work while it s a built-in feature of c++
145565
is there any free set of forms icons styles images etc for building web-based admin interfaces
145580
by simply removing the radio buttons initially and having the user click a button to call a method i could simply add a the list of radio buttons without a problem
145581
this is easy for languages like python or java somewhat blurry for c c++ and almost impossible for perl and ruby
145592
in .net there is codedom which provides a way to generate a universal syntax tree and then serialize it as c# vb .net etc... code and or compile it
145615
the enterprise manager web-based database administration tool defaults to port 80 but will use 8080 if 80 is not available
145616
if you don t need acid you probably don t need the overhead of an rdbms
145642
if you re using c c++ as the application level it is perfectly reasonable to throw in the lua engine 100kb of binary just for the sake of reading configs data or writing them out
145648
whereas in linux you can easily require users to have libxxx v.y.y installed in os x there are multiple packaging approaches fink macports and for a commercial tool the required libraries are expected to be contained in the application
145655

satellite assembly is a diff delta of your main assembly resources and your localized resources
145727
so if you have a strings.resx with 100 strings in mainassembly.dll of which 10 change in french canadian culture you should have a mainassembly.resources.dll satellite assembly containing just those 10 strings in the fr-ca subdirectory of the dll folder
145731
it s not a mutually-exclusive choice you can run both on one system in the same way that perl and php for example are run side-by-side on many systems
145737
vm console works well for accessing each environment and depending on the configuration you set up with nat vs
145754
uncommon web sounds like a pun on peter norvig s description of scheme in paip is from what i can tell a more complete framework based heavily on the idea of continuations much like seaside for smalltalk
145758
we have been using vmware server in production for 2 years now and are migrating to esx next year
145790
you could then have the controllers implement an interface and get the appropriate controller at run time using an ioc container which would automatically supply the controller with the appropriate view and model repository
145794
alternatively you can load .so files at runtime just as you can with .dll s using dlopen and dlsym
145834
ruby is my choice after exploring python smalltalk and ruby
145843
lookup table that contains pk description and code value s used by one or more applications
145884
if you re using a header-only library most of the boost libraries are some notable exceptions are signals serialisation and date time you can just copy those header files
145895
create a sample thumbnail convert it to png gif and jpeg and see which is smaller
145897
i ve setup a webserver with a proxy http server nginx which then delegates traffic to different openvz containers based on hostname or requested path
145897
inside each container you can setup apache or any other webserver nginx lighttpd ..
145899
a reflection api depends on the metadata generated for the code so you can have a universal api for all languages on the jvm or all languages on the clr...but it wouldn t really be possible to make one that does python java and vb etc.
145918
the cocoa apis for this are nsstatusbar and nsstatusitem
145929
use a profiler like jprofiler or yourkitprofiler
145938
if the people you are distributing are not up to installing boost then i would suggest distributing binaries in an install package to make it as easy as possible for them

the only way to protect the data is to send it trought ssl https instead of http
146157
if you wish to protect the http body from being sniffed you should do so over a secure channel via https
146180
this basically involves a call to the baml goop to re-hydrate the file into memory and to set any of the member variables of your class to the now-created items if you put x name foo on an item you ll be able to do this.foo.background purple
146189
you can either encrypt the http connection via https or there are md5 and other hashing algorithms implemented in javascript that can be used client side to hash the password client side before sending it hence stopping a sniffer being able to read your password
146191
also keep in mind that elisp is a very old school lisp and variables have dynamic call stack not lexical scope
146221
stuff like sin log sqrt take arrays instead of scalars
146250
should i push keypresses to vehicles when they re pressed or should vehicles pull keys pressed from the engine
146250
if the player controls the vehicle with the arrow keys should a keypress set the accelleration push and a key-release clear the velocity or should the vehicle ask the game-engine if the accellerate key is pressed pull
146250
i think a push would mean that the keyboard control module would need to know about vehicles whereas pull would mean a vehicle needs to know specific keyboard controls
146264
if keyboard events are a callback don t use the pull approach for your mouse events for instance
146269
i need to change the datatemplate for items in a listbox depending on whether the item is selected or not displaying different more information when selected
146288
double int value n 10.0 10.0
146293
i ve seen this runtime compilation use of system.reflection.emit classes in generating dynamic proxies code project sample or other means of optimizing reflection calls time-wise
146296
for any of the style rules that apply to a single page or a small grouping pages i will set the body to an id and a class making it easy to target particular pages
146336
note that it is possible in principle to extend an immutable class and change the base fields if the base class contains a reference to an array the elements within the array cannot be declared final
146343
by default tab is used to move around autocompleted function call arguments
146385
i dont want this property set in any of my servlets
146388
works with an asp.net site is a .net project
146393
note that if one of the sources contains duplicates you might see duplicates in the output
146393
if you want to remove these duplicates in the already sorted lists use the following method
146403
another way is to implement an set as an hash array dictionary and add all the elements of both the arrays to the set
146405
there are some differences in systems programming between linux and freebsd
146413
although there might be potential gotchas methinks any set of such bytes accessed as an integer divided by the maximum integer of that size will yield a floating point value between 0 and 1 with approximately that distribution
146462
unlike pointers it authorizes manipulating the object as if on stack
146463
i d have to check up on how annotations work in java though but this stuff could easily be done with python annotations.
146464
in short it is all builtin data type ex int char float long int unsigned char double and all aggregation of pod data
146476
soundex extended soundex and metaphone encoding
146490
it may seem like the project is geared towards python at first but it can be used for pure c++ as well
146510
in order to avoid the inner join of two tables in order to get a highly recurrent field requent you can violate the normalization rules and duplicate it on the table relating to the one that has the value
146512
but you should use enumdisplaysettings to get a list of valid combinations of color dept width height mode and frequency
146572
so there are workarounds as always - provide another class with a private constructor which will serve as a namespace for the static methods
146577
which means that for example it is physically impossible to compile ffmpeg or its libav libraries in msvc because they use many c99 features such as named struct elements
146578
cryptography is security but security is not explicitly cryptography
146589
int char wchar_t bool float double are pods as are long short and signed unsigned versions of them
146624
i totally agree with mikael - if you know what systems will be running the scripts and you can install interpretters on them go with a scripting language like python or ruby
146624
of course it depends on what type of automation you need to do - if you re messing with the os or active directory settings go with wsh - but for your average file housekeeping use python or ruby
146627
i d recommend python over ruby as a windows scripting language
146627
python s windows-support is much more mature than ruby s
146628
since you named delphi you do know borland c++ builder also does vcl like delphi does
146634
if you re using heroku or engineyard the main cloud hosting solutions today - they build on top of amazon ec2 you can also use git to manage your code and both heroku and engineyard have great instructions on how to use integrate git with them
146636
for example if your project is hacked together now and three years later your customer wants to add a feature you will be glad that you have put in the time to get unit tests now
146717
since ruby takes its regexp from perl this latter version should work
146744
for development i tend to switch between the keyboard for typing and shortcuts and the mouse for pointing at things
146753
spodi i agree on the keyboard for shortcuts so the only buttons i use on either the mouse or the tablet are the first and second both of which are available on the pen
146767
my left hand is always on the keyboard while my right is jumping to and from the mouse
146814
iirc there are ways to detect what tcp ip stack is being used by sniffing choices in port usage and sequence numbers
146871
in this way php and the lisp community have some similarities but so does other fragmented open source platforms such as python and perl
146871
i have decided that i prefer scheme over common lisp so that narrows it down a bit
146875
using nargin to set default values for optional arguments and using nargout to set optional output arguments
146886
in fact i d argue it s even behind so-called scripting languages like python perl php ruby and even javascript in these regards
146931
is it more appropriate to use a single event class with a type property and write logic that checks type and maintain some organization of categories of types a list of event types that are category a a second list that are category b etc
146981
if there is considerable mixing and matching of behavior i would consider using composition of other objects then have either the constructor of the specific event type object create those objects or use a builder to create the object
147039
install them in their own directories and make sure you keep package binaries separate you should be fine
147112
the input event also has various bugs in firefox and opera
147148
i d also add an asterisk to that though each time you extend the class with extra methods think about what you are trying to achieve with the extension and think about whether or not it can be generalised and worked back into the parent class
147161
so generate a 52 bit or larger unsigned random integer for example by reading bytes from dev urandom convert it into a double and divide it by 2 number of bits it was
147161
start the exponent off at 52 and choose a 52-bit random unsigned integer assuming 52 bits of mantissa
147187
what is the practical benefit of using http get put delete post head
147187
why not focus on their behavioral benefits safety and idempotency forgetting their names and use get put or post depending on which behavior we want
147187
why shouldn t we only use get put and post and drop head delete
147195
the rest 1 approach uses post get put and delete to implement the crud rules for a web resource
147209
additionally aop provides a single point of configuration for additional transaction setup and teardown and the usual logging things
147233
executable jar file
147233
see also distributing your application as an executable jar file and the oracle docs on how to create a jar file that can be executed with a double-click on windows
147233
currently installanywhere creates launchanywheres on windows 95 98 nt 2000 me solaris linux and mac os x
147234
by the way it doesn t have a meaning to set java and javascript as equals in any context a popular way of putting it could be
147248
you d have to handle the storing of the actions in a db if load balanced or in memory or such then handling commit rollback timeout
147299
in the same way that you can add multiple items to a shopping basket and then submit that basket to process the order you can add bob s account entry to the transaction wrapper and then bill s account entry to the wrapper
147305
if the data is both directly related to the additive fact and is not something you want to be grouping sorting search on then putting it in the fact table is okay
147326
you could use only get and post but then you are losing out on some of the precision and clarity that put and delete bring
147326
if you think of a resource management api then get put and delete probably cover 80 -90 of the required functionality
147363
i know vim and emacs and vim fits my brain and my habits better
147366
specificity is this code only functional in the context of this specific document or element
147378
what options do you have if you want to write the easy bits or refactor the old bits in a language like python ruby c# or whatever
147389
if you want to work between c++ and python than boost python is what you re looking for
147389
you have to embed the python interpreter into your c++ application but the work necessary to do that is documented here
147389
this is an example of calling the python interpreter and extracting the result the python interpreter defines the object class for use in c++
147390
python interfacing for instance is most easily done with boost python and many other languages will require you to interface them as you would with c using their c library and declaring your callbacks to be extern c unfortunate that you can t use the c++ class definitions in other languages usually
147392
emacs or vim is not significantly better than vim or emacs
147392
i have no doubt that anything you can get done in emacs you can also get done in vim just not standard
147394
the next release will include support for third party providers think oracle mysql db2
147415
dbfit a framework which integrates with fit and fitnesse to do functional testing of databases

my custom homebrew photography processing software running on 64 bit linux gnu writes out png and tiff files
147449
even though i have the tiff 6.0 specs png specs and other info in hand it is not clear how to include color calibration data or implement color management system on linux
147469
there are no rules as of the content of the boundary but as it must not occur in any of the parts of your message content is usually a randomly generated sequence of numbers letters or combination of both in order to guarantee uniqueness and differentiate from any possible dictionary words
147499
there s some duplication of effort between strcpy and memcpy it d be nice to get rid of though
147505
any ideas how to set the content-length header

if you wanted a quick answer from another window it was totally cool to call sendmessage and wait for the message to be processed
147561
jquery is a javascript library akin to prototype dojo etc
147570
however silverlight can do some more interesting things by using the .net framework and allows you to muck around with with wpf so you can add 3d rendering advanced printing playing back movies drm ugh and more things that jquery just can t do yet
147573
ping doesn t use tcp - it uses icmp so using a proxy doesn t really make sense
147581
there are a lot of greedy heuristics where you periodically select the minimum of a set
147587
in terms of why bother freeing individual members in response to comments to mike b s answer the automatic freeing only applies when an exception is thrown in a constructor of an object being new ly allocated not in other cases
147587
also the memory that is freed is those allocated for the object members not any memory you might have allocated say inside the constructor
147589
this is a major reason to use smart pointers - since the smart poitners are full fledged objects they will get destructors called during the exception s stack unwind and have the opportunity to free the memory
147589
when an exception is thrown inside a constructor there are several things that you should take note of in terms of properly handling resource allocations that may have occured in the aborted construction of the object
147589
this means that if your object owns resources you have 2 methods available to clean up those resources that might have already been acquired when the constructor throws
147589
when the constructor for your object throws an exception the member objects will have desctructors called and will have an opportunity to free the resource whose lifetimes they are responsible for
147612
have you actually tried ati s rendermoney or nvidia s fx composer

i ve just started playing around with pylons and was wondering if there is a way to start up the paster server through eclipse so i can debug my webapp
147654
do not store crypt password in config file but insted of this store crypt salt + password
147654
for crypt function you can use some well known algortithm as aes idea des or something as simple as xoring each byte with byte from some other string that string will be your key
147657
those inside a groupbox or a panel are not mirrowed unless i put them on a tablelayoutpanel or a flowlayoutpanel fisrt
147657
and especially to rearrange the controls one control per table cell padding margin etc
147684
apparently the dom code which inserts with width and height of the images is not working right in ie
147684
the response about the require tbody element when dynamically building tables appears to be the entire problem - this appears to even set the image width and height to 0 in the dom
147709
...the line containing the cursor and the next 5 lines d5j
147709
...a set of parentheses braces etc
147712
or use ant or maven
147713
in c i could for example zero out bit #10 in a 32 bit unsigned value like so
147726
the idea was that instead of having our program beat against the wan when it s down they d send a configuration file containing the closely-guarded admin credentials run it in each lan and zip up the results and e-mail it back
147763
it s a bit of a hack but you could add an empty div with a width of 1px and height of 1000px inside your #content div
147768
set the base directory to the root folder also
147777
while i use vs 2005 for the release builds i still use msvc 6 for much of the gui building simply because classwizard is so much quicker in this environment than the weak equivalent tools that followed
147786
javascript relies soley on the underlying page structure and dom augmentation to yield results silverlight is like flash and tends more towards being just a window in the page with its own canvas etc
147796
if found you want to find all lines in another file which contain the fourth and and fifth column of the matching line in the first file
147799
you can use a unicode_escape codec to decode the string to unicode and then encode it to any format you want

however sort with --merge -m can open the output file before reading all input so a command like cat f | sort -m -o f - g is not safe as sort might start writing f before cat is done reading it
147854
why not let the window resize itself based on the runtime height width
147886
it s been a while since i ve done so but i think the closest html dom equivalent is setting a width on a div and requesting the height cut and paste reuse so apologies if this contains errors
147887
the overhead of allocating memory and copying the data to a thread before it can be partioned will be much slower with mpi and an unlimited number of processors than quicksort running on a single processor
147908
under the view-model-viewmodel pattern for wpf i am trying to databind the heights and widths of various definitions for grid controls so i can store the values the user sets them to after using a gridsplitter
147914
your text editor may be wrapping lines but in reality each query may be on a single line
147927
note the file has 3 lines the last line is empty
147928
although it may appear like a double in xaml the actual value for a definition s height or width is a gridlength struct
147928
unlike every other property in wpf width and height don t default their databinding mode to twoway you have to manually set this
147962
words will have idword word and be a list of unique words from all the documents a specific word appears only once
148033
as the back forward buttons aren t their own windows you ll need to figure out how to do this with simulating a mouse click at a certain x y position so chrome knows what you re doing
148051
the algorithm needs to get some answer about the data such as for instance the minimum or the median
148056
in my base class certain methods involve instantiating new tree nodes adding children
148057
in other words how does one use mathematica like any other scripting language perl python ruby etc
148069
this is a good application of a min-queue - a queue first-in first-out fifo which can simultaneously keep track of the minimum element it contains with amortized constant-time updates
148098
find all unique words in the text file
148098
further you also can prevent locking problems between searching words and updating indexes when a document has changed that is if the database can perform the locking for you or can perform the update or updates as an atomic operation
148105
you could also use mutex or semaphore if you want it to work cross process with a slight performance penalty or if you need to set any other number than one of allowed simultaneous threads running your piece of code
148114
here is how i did it using python instead of perl but that should not matter

i ve seen related questions on stackoverflow but they generate mostly standard answers like use jquery or mochikit or mootools or dojo or yui
148122
it s still a bit ugly because my super class foo in the above example is not abstract which means subclasses are not forced to implement the hook
148124
any global vars are declared and set in the master file
148135
for a general inputstream i would wrap it in a bufferedinputstream and do something like this
148140
it totally depends on your requirements scalability throughput reliability and so forth
148154
remember you can always have the static syncronous method to be protected or private leaving it visible only to the instances of the class

both mysql and recent versions of postgresql have full text indexing by default

what you probably want is to tunnel your tcp connections http telnet ssh via your http proxy using the connect method
148179
keep in mind that some http proxies are configured to allow connect connections only to certain destinations for example to port 443 ony for tls ssl https
148180
when using a bufferedinputstream make sure that the inputstream is not already buffered double buffering will cause some seriously hard to find bugs

regardless of what database management system you are using you could use a scripting language such as perl or php to set up a connection to your database parse the file and then insert the data into your database

the trick is that if you try to call sum with a type that is not among the specializations of isnumber then the generic implementation is called and that implementation makes something not allowed call a private constructor

the caveat about comparing two booleans is a bit of a red-herring as most of the time you re either comparing two boolean variables in which case swapping them round doesn t help or testing whether a flag is set and woe-betide-you if i catch you comparing anything explicitly with true or false in your conditionals

use getenv path to get the path string from the environment then use successive calls to strtok path then strtok path null to parse out the paths from the path string into an array of which you will need to allocate with malloc

if you re using tramp for ssh scp functionality you ll find opening a persistent ssh connection will make tramp operations a lot faster they ll reuse the existing connection rather than creating a fresh one each time cutting out a great deal of cryptographic overhead without affecting security

in my experience as a general rule java programs that use swt as the gui toolkit are more accessible then programs that use swing which is why i stay away from netbeans
148880
for any .net programming i use visual studio 2005 since it was the standard version used at my internship and is very accessible using jaws and a set of scripts that were developed to make things such as the form designer more accessible
148880
for c and c++ programming i use cygwin with gcc as my compiler and emacs or vim as my editor depending on what i need to do
148964
also do i need ssl to stop someone sniffing http responses between the browser and the web server
148965
if a styled text view with colors formatting and pretty printing grows to large appending more data at the bottom becomes pretty slow
148968
as i understand it .bat is the old 16-bit naming convention and .cmd is for 32-bit windows starting with nt
149011
you definitely need ssl to prevent sniffing of the sensitive web traffic not to mention logins but that doesn t solve your server-side encryption problem
149028
you should use tls ssl https so that eavesdropping on the http traffic is harder to perform
149033
i know that a float isn t appropriate to store currency values because of rounding errors

now that said if you do no math other than simple addition or subtraction and then store the number then you ll be fine but as soon as anything more complex than that shows up you re going to be in trouble

we have a system written in c and running under solaris linux that uses the sybase ct-library to access a sybase database
149139
indexes are stored in b+-trees with tree nodes distributed across blocks on the disk
149139
the power of the b+tree is that you can easily find a single key value within the tree and then simply walk the leaf nodes to scroll through the data in key order
149139
for a simple format that s useful and popular consider looking up the original dbase format -- dbf files
149140
if foo s index also contains an index on bar that additional indexing level will not affect the utility of the foo index in any current uses of that index nor will it appreciably affect the performance of maintaining that index but it will give the database additional information to work with in optimizing queries such as in the example
149146
if you use the standard membership provider and set the authorization for the directory page the code will automatically set a query parameter of returnurl and redirect after a successfull login

your web server should use compression for this extension and your code should check if the number of rows returned is greater than what excel can display in one worksheet

rounding at the last minute is not the answer as real currency calculations are rounded as they go

if you want to learn different sorts of object-oriented languages you might well want to learn smalltalk if it differs significantly from ruby something like java or c++ and perhaps also the common lisp object system
149194
i d also suggest common lisp and other people will doubtless have other suggestions can you get a good forth system nowadays

are there any major differences in performance between http and https
149274
i seem to recall reading that https can be a fifth as fast as http
149287
this is almost certainly going to be true given that ssl requires an extra step of encryption that simply isn t required by non-sll http
149323
python or ruby are built for integration from the ground up and tend to be more promiscuous and thus easier to integrate with 3rd party software
149325
this was the setup for a saas enterprise application that i worked a few years back so we had full control of the servers
149351
of course like in most compiled languages assertions are not executed or even included in the compiler output unless you ve specifically enabled them so you should not rely on assertions for release mode builds

ps be glad i didn t show my example of a stored procedure that supports dynamic sorting dynamic filtering text-searching of columns pagination via rownumber over and try...catch with transaction rollbacking on errors.
149380
with sql server 2005 we can set permissions on a per-user basis if need be at the schema level on individual stored procedures and then deny any queries against the tables directly
149397
there are several tools out there to compare the performance of an http vs https server jmeter and visual studio come to mind and they are quite easy to use
149397
edit one point that has been brought up by several others is that ssl handshaking is the major cost of https
149409
3des is more expensive than aes for example
149418
you can also use your favorite programming language i ve successfully used perl c python and ruby to connect to mssql
149430
i did this by using a delete query and then using select from table 1 group by x having y z a
149445
bottom line making lots of short requests over https will be quite a bit slower than http but if you transfer a lot of data in a single request the difference will be insignificant
149458
specifically you cannot even login to frontpage administration incorrect credentials
149471
a nsrunloop internally is a linked list and by adding a nstimer object to the runloop a new linked list element is created and added to the list
149471
if the fire date for every timer is still in the future and there is no other event to process like a keyboard mouse event from ui or a sent notification it would return null
149471
performselectoronmainthread creates a nstimer object like this one that fires only once and where the time to fire is already located in the past so it needs firing immediately then gets the nsrunloop of the main thread and adds the timer object there
149474
i was using python s libxml2 libxslt to process this

in the grand scheme of things pascal vs camel doesn t matter that much and you re not likely to convince anyone to go back over an existing code base just to change the case of names

in the meantime you can put an extra comment character at the end of your comments to get it to look okay

so does anyone know if there is any relationship between the acl table and the snmp set community name
149829
if you also maintained the min and max between each return to zero you have the bounds of the superset

if you have an integration build server then of course you have no choice but to use the command line no native tasks for msbuild ant nant that i know of

accurev is new therefore there has little resources available online as apposed to svn which you would find tons of integration work that was done by hundreds with jira for example

i know how to convert my application into an executable jar file but i want to make sure that the code cannot be reverse engineered or at least not easily

strictly speaking linux cannot offer atomic interlocked functions like ones in win32 simply because these functions require hardware support and linux runs on some platforms that don t offer that support
149952
there have been tries on getting microsoft s free ui automation included in .net framework 3.0 to work with web applications asp.net
149975
so instead of silverlight vs flex you are looking at wpf vs air
149978
the crtp gets a lot less curious if you consider that the subclass type that is passed to the superclass is only needed at time of method expansion
149978
you just need the pattern to import the symbolic subclass type into the superclass but it is just a forward declaration - as all formal template param types are by definition - as far as the superclass is concerned
149978
we use in a somewhat modified form passing the subclass in a traits type structure to the superclass to make it possible for the superclass to return objects of the derived type
149978
the application is a library for geometric calculus points vectors lines boxes where all the generic functionality is implemented in the superclass and the subclass just defines a specific type cfltpoint inherits from tgenpoint
149995
if i change the type of the field wwindow to unsigned int wwindow 16 which has the same number of bits as an unsigned short the program tells me the size of the struct is now 20 bytes the correct size
149995
i am using microsoft visual studio 2005 with sp1 on a 32-bit x86 machine
150001
because the compiler is packing your bitfield into a 32-bit int not a 16-bit entity
150010
ideally the user is going to click on an icon next to a text box that will pop up the form they will select the department they need and when they click ok the dialog will close and i will have the value selected for me to update the textbox with
150012
interesting - i would think that word would evaluate to unsigned short so you d have that problem in more than one place
150023
set the code signing identity in the target properties to don t code sign
150026
for example setting documenttext in a for-loop will only set properly on the first iteration of the loop
150030
you can then use #pragma pack to reset structure packing to it s default state
150064
for each row in the datatable add subtract the credit debits to the previous row s balance and assign it to the appropriate cell of your datatable
150064
for each item or altitem add subtract the credit debits to the global variable and assign it to the appropriate cell of your datagrid
150078
it matches any character which is not contained in the ascii character set 0-127 0x0 to 0x7f
150141
in languages like lisp scheme they re often passed around quite liberally as function parameters but the idiom in c# typically finds lambdas used only for lazy evaluation of functions as in linq or for making event-handling code a bit terser
150148
value of the field of the dataset does not exist
150151
edit i forgot to mention that this needs to be able to work in a partial-trust xbap
150180
the result of this is that any extra digits of formatting that you specify are likely to be noise that can result in conversions between base 10 formatted values and base 2 floating point values
150224
this is followed by the unsigned short which is on an int boundary and then a word which is along aligned on an int boundary which means that there 2 bytes of padding between them
150224
when you switch to unsigned int wwindow 16 instead of being a separate short the compiler uses the unused parts of the previous bitfield so no waste no short and no padding after the short hence you save four bytes
150254
there s a definitive guide in the article porting 16-bit code to 32-bit windows on msdn
150278
it was a bit hard on the processor we were running on a pentium-iii equivalent machine and it was pushing 50 -75 peak cpu
150283
so for learning scheme lisp javascript isn t a bad start
150283
note though that functional languages like lisp are quite different from pure functional languages such as haskell
150296
in addition to overriding save to provide the generated value you want you can also use the exclude option in your modeladmin class to prevent the field from being displayed in the admin
150302
a short timeout value will consume considerably more cpu than the infinite timeout but there are good reasons for using a short timeout for example if you want to terminate the process thread the runloop is running in
150350
an example rewrite rule would be
150357
for asp.net development everything but the .net framework files was moved project files temporary files compiled files etc
150359
but when i try to just put something in there i get an errorinvalidchangekey
150361
doing it that way however should improve performance because it would come down to doing only about 20-30k vector transformations which doesn t take much processor power on most modern cpu s
150411
if you re going to do a lot of bit manipulation and you care much more about readability rather than performance for your application then you may want to create an integer wrapper to enable slicing like in verilog or vhdl
150435
this means that from the user s perspective pages with plenty of static content will appear to load slower after the browser is restarted and from your server s perspective the volume of requests for static content over https will be higher than would have been over http

let you access sqlplus and other command line sql environments for postgresql mysql

when the user double-clicks on the checkbox the checkbox gets checked the rowchanged event gets called is selected and then the checkbox is cleared and no corresponding rowchanged event gets called
150486
not the same way you did with a waterfall methodology where nothing really worked
150491
i tend to group things by visibility public then protected then private and use #regions to group related things functionally regardless of whether it is a property method or whatever
150528
i prefer to put the private fields up at the top along with the constructor s then put the public interface bits after that then the private interface bits
150541
the pack function convers python data types to bits and the unpack function converts bits to python data types

150762
also out of curiosity how would i do this using bash or another unix shell
150798
regarding maintenance imho is better to change a single line of code the regular expression pattern than understand lines and lines of parsing code or whatever the regular expressions purpose is
150802
substitute regex with c or c# or java or python or perl or sql or ruby or awk or .
150802
just like java perl php or especially sql each language has strengths and weaknesses and you need to know the language you re writing in when you re writing it or maintaining it to have any hope of being productive
150802
these are not the same things that would be common in general-purpose languages like perl c++ etc. so the huffman coding was targetted at this specialisation
150814
specifically if we put this into a plain html page it works fine but if we put it into an aspx page wrapped by the tag we get a mycontrol is undefined error
150862
since i usually work with java my preferred method is jflex but there is also lex yacc and several others
150872
i would suggest using ssis to copy the records to a temporary table then create a task that uses select distinct or rank depending on your situation to select the duplicates which would funnel them to a flat file and delete them from the temporary table
150872
the last step would be to copy the records from the temporary table into the destination table
150873
the idea is generally to load the image in memory so that the same contiguous block of bytes would not contain pixels in one line but rather of a square in 2d space
150879
the overhead is due to the ssl handshakes which are lengthy and drastically increase the number of round-trips required for a https session over a http one
150879
compare http with https on the same setup
150879
ensuring that your server is using http keepalives - this allows the client to reuse ssl sessions which avoids the need for another handshake
150880
registering in an object constructor would be a mistake
150902
how can an object be loaded via hibernate based on a field value of a member object
150928
excellent for anyone who is already familiar with nb for java ruby or php development
150958
i ve seen recommendations in the past to do this sort of copy operation with various permutations of dd cpio or tar but never cat
150964
so you can either pick a date range run a select max and select min against your db or execute your query and then add the missing dates

the thing is they never drop your sockets with traffic shaping they only drop packets
150998
in my actionscript3 class can i have a property with a getter and setter
150999
that s nothing against ruby because it sucks just as hard in glorp which handles activerecord for smalltalk or perl or anything else
151064
arguably the right thing to do would be to use mime s technique for encoding non-ascii data in headers as described in rfc 2047 but i have no idea whether browsers actually support that
151079
this seems to be broken in ff and ie but work in opera safari and chrome
151086
depending on the number of machines you might find it makes sense to use something like cfengine or puppet to configure the new installs
151108
ok well you can just use the basic getter setter syntax for any property of your as3 class
151115
yes you can create getter and setter functions inside an as3 class
151158
you can omit as many arguments as you like - if you only want to override the value of one argument you can just provide that argument instead of having to explicitly pass undefined when say there are 5 arguments and you only want to customise the last one as you would have to do with some of the other methods suggested
151158
when working with a constructor function for an object which inherits from another it s easy to accept any arguments which are required by the constructor of the object you re inheriting from as you don t have to name those arguments in your constructor signature or even provide your own defaults let the parent object s constructor do that for you as seen above when charfield calls field s constructor
151158
child objects in inheritance hierarchies can customise arguments for their parent constructor as they see fit enforcing their own default values or ensuring that a certain value will always be used
151204
i have a folder var unity conf with some properties files in it and i d like the caucho s resin jvm to have that directory on the classpath

note sometimes coders will add a finalizer to debug builds of their own idisposable classes in order to test that code has disposed their idisposable object properly
151267
so you asked this to someone with no c# .net asp.net or linq knowledge
151268
i recall there being an env var to control this
151275
when i was looking for 3 programmers earlier this year to work mostly in c# java pl sql javascript and delphi i looked for c c++ programmers and have not been disappointed
151289
note that i suggest a nested array instead of a hash because a hash s order is unpredictable
151302
after you set content-disposition header also add content-length header then use binarywrite to stream the pdf
151308
i recall there being an env var to control this
151308
or use libdmalloc5 drop in replacement for the system s malloc realloc calloc free and other memory management routines while providing powerful debugging facilities

irrlicht has a cleaner api lower system requirements and works better across platforms than ogre in my opinion

in ie7 once you ve popped open this notes iframe and scrolled the page down mousing over the popup s textarea makes it disappear and show the page content beneath it
151538
valgrind --tool memcheck --leak-check full . a.out
151555
note i could get an element on the document by calling document.getelementbyid id
151612
using boost iterator_facade you can easy adapt any cached on disk data structures to have a stl container interface
151630
a good text editor jedit emacs vim eclipse etc. is really all you need
151635
eclipse rcp if you are ok using swt
151641
one is a normal button with label and or icon and the second is the arrow which opens the popup
151641
my struggle here is that i just want a button with an icon that opens the popup directly without having to write all the popup handling code all over again
151641
this class would just hide the arrow and point the button click handler to open the popup
151641
edit i want a 16x16 icon button that opens a popup
151641
popupbutton shipped with flex has two buttons it contains a main button and a secondary button called the pop-up button which pops up any uicomponent object when a user clicks the pop-up button. source
151641
i want the main button to open the popup and hide the popup-button
151670
with curl or any other http client you may have to set the content encoding
151678
a fill-down can populate this into every row for you
151687
can it be put on a pty somehow so that we could potentially get access to it
151696
we are using the infragistics controls for .net both asp.net and winforms for a few years
151715
i was part of a team working to better the story around development of wss and moss solutions with tfs but i don t know where that stands
151726
differences between jruby and ruby mri
151730
i can easily do it using the listview datagridview sorting functionality -- but i d like the display to be in virtual mode because of the quantity of data i have and for that i need to provide my own sorting anyway
151774
for example authentication and authorization systems are good examples of modules
151775
the reason is that all methods defined in an interface are abstract whether or not you explicitly declare that modifier
151802
ibm in it s solaris to linux porting guide gives this example
151812
i m specifically interested in production-proven paging patterns that behave well with the concurrency scalability and reliability
151838
always be careful about putting data into a field that has no meaning special value to represent no data
151839
so the lwarx stwcx combo allows you to implement atomic increment decrement compare and swap and more powerful atomic operations like atomic increment circular buffer index
151867
dos command cd changes current directory to the root folder or cd folder1 folder2 goes to c folder1 folder2
151873
i have garnered from the responses to check out blogengine.net subtext dasblog and to stay away from the blog in dotnetnuke
151893
then pass the model object into the constructor of this new class and call its methods for getting sql
151897
you can use the open-source itextsharp which is a port from itext java
151905
i have had this problem with various dbms postgresql informix mysql and mssql thanks to lomaxx for the answer
151923
if the files you re looking for have sequence numbers store the last sequence number you got notified about so you can look for gaps on future notifications and process the files for which you didn t get notified
151979
however when i run this application and click on the checkbox i ve found that sometimes my mouse clicks are swallowed and the checkbox s status doesn t change
152068
but hey since python does not really have interfaces in the java sense maybe it is ok
152084
i m interested in actual examples of using fixed point combinators such as the y-combinator in c++
152099
there is a textbox and button on the screen as well
152099
this is the markup for the gridview as you can see it s inside an asp.net updatepanel i forgot to mention that sorry i left out most columns and the formatting
152104
first autogrow does only work on firefox not on ie safari opera and chrome
152112
we mostly write web applications with wicket spring and hibernate and we use interfaces for spring beans services and daos
152124
then use dependency injection with spring or guice if you have many implementations of the interface to inject into the places in your code you re using new
152151
basically you can use select identity to retrieve the value of the auto-increment field that is generated on your connection
152157
since you mention gdi+ i suppose you want it for windows but there are good portable solutions like sdl allegro cairo etc
152204
glib a common system library on linux and unix systems but also supported on windows and mac os x defines several atomic operations including g_atomic_int_compare_and_exchange and g_atomic_pointer_compare_and_exchange
152248
the problem i have is that users have to log in once via the http basic authentication and then again using a django login form
152256
these can be dynamically created using json as the data source rather than html xml
152321
personally i like using attributes for simple single-valued properties
152321
for single-valued properties attributes lead to more compact xml and simpler addressing in most apis
152332
it comes with a load of profilers including static code analysis and works with most important windows compilers and systems including visual c++ .net delphi borland c++ intel c++ and even gcc
152350
you can download visual studio 2008 and .net framework 3.5 training kit and .net framework 3.5 enhancements training kit if i recall correctly there were samples for wcf unit tests
152360
when feeds arrive they go into a queue and we process the feed at the head of the queue entirely before looking at the rest
152365
each structure represents an event to be inserted into the keyboard or mouse input stream
152375
you could create a table writer_status which has a last_id field each writer updates this table before writing with the id it is going to write to the log but only if its id is greater than the current value of last_id
152379
you might want to have a look at pax drone which enables you to use all felix versions as well as equinox and knopflerfish in your tests
152382
we recently installed svn 1.5.2 with visualsvn apache on some of our servers virtual machines and now when i send a commandline command with username password they don t get cached anymore
152398
ui technologies opengl glut directx gdi qt etc
152401
as for libraries c++ programmers absolutely need to know stl and boost
152403
i typically place the repositories somewhere under var usually in var lib svn - i m trying to follow the filesystem hierarchy standard which has this to say about the purpose of var
152410
this is reflected in code by having either a single entity association one-to-one or an entity set association one-to-many
152412
pax runner run and switch between felix equinox knopflerfish and concierge easily
152425
in that case i would have put a type constraint on the collection don t declare the collection as a map which would allow linkedhashmap but as hashmap for the purists a final subclass of hashmap but that might be taking it too far...
152502
edit if imultivalueconverter isn t available it looks like silverlight only has ivalueconverter then you can always pass your entire bound object eg your person object to an ivalueconverter and use various properties from that to return your brush
152510
you create a socket by either defining a local address in case of tcp ip an address is an ip address and usually in case it s a tcp or udp socket a port number both can be any and then binding the socket to it and just use it a server socket or you can create a socket by defining a remote address and then connecting the socket to it additionally you can bind it to a local address in advance if you want to keep control of the local address and port as well and use it as a client socket
152516
mstest is slow mbunit
152519
here s my suboptimal solution using a bash shell script
152521
a port denotes a communication endpoint in the tcp and udp transports for the ip network protocol
152562
the reason is that the one of the other border elements with a templatebinding of borderbrush was further down in the visual tree and was capturing the mouse click that s why setting the borderbrush to null allowed the checkbox to correctly receive the mouse click
152585
what is the simplest way to identify and separate get and post parameters from a controller in ruby on rails which will be equivalent to _get and _post variables in php
152607
i you are not using a gui for instance awt swing or swt you could try starting you application in headless mode
152614
i prefer to write in functional or declarative style over imperative whenever i can
152619
that would make the calculation of min and max fairly trivial
152625
all of these suggestions involve walking the list twice if you need to get both the max and min
152649
instead of the assigned template a generic xml json template is called which just outputs a xml that contains all template vars
152652
i don t know of any convenience methods in rails for this but you can access the querystring directly to parse out parameters that are set there
152713
netbeans is a pretty good ide which also caters for other languages php ruby c c++ if you re prone to using any of those
152722
the power of eclipse is that it s basically the same ide for many languages meaning that if you know you ll have to code in several programming languages java c++ python it s a huge advantage that you only have to learn one ide eclipse
152728
frustratingly the oracle substring function is substr whilst it sql-server it s substring
152731
since i m not a lawyer i m not going to go into what constitutes a demonstrable and obvious difference but i would imagine a colour change would count as one.
152745
i ve done some timing on various linux unix machines and gcc versions
152745
other ways of arranging a 2-d array without stl - an array of n pointers to the start of each row or defining the whole thing on the stack as a constant size - run at almost exactly the same speed as the index function method
152781
if you want to peek at code there are several open source game engine like ogre3d nebuladevice and irrlicht
152785
tuples represent a powerful method for returning multiple values from a function call without the need to litter your code with throwaway classes or resorting to ugly ref or out parameters
152789
after testing with a serialized object written to a file using the objectoutputstream in a java 1.5 program then running a read with a objectinputstream in a java 1.6 program i can say this worked without any issue
152800
most of the big players have linux unix versions these days
152808
this is typically in an application main window and it contains a set of mdi children
152819
its popularity has also meant that it has striven to maintain backwards compatibility throughout its lifecycle meaning that poor decisions about the language live on even after they are deprecated
152823
update renamed htacces.txt to .htaccess and ammended the appropriate directives in the httpd.conf file and all seems to work
152829
when signal is poor noisy data values spread max to min is low and there s proportionally higher noise in many more buckets
152869
it is easy to highlight a selected datagrid row by for example using toggleclass in the tr s click event
152869
but how best to later remove the highlight after a different row has been selected
152873
if you edit the test run configuration by double clicking the .testrunconfig file that gets put into the solution items solution folder when you add a new unit test you get a test run configuration dialog
152881
the double name n m format is very fast when you are accessing data by rows both because has almost no overhead besides a multiplication and addition and because your rows are packed data that will be coherent in cache
152922
the mapping between get and post and put and delete and controller actions is set up in config routes.rb in most modern rails code
152929
rest only cares about 4 events in the life on an object create post retrieve get update put and delete
152934
basically each task would need an individually named and then you would need to append a new uniquely named form input element for each new field that they choose to append
152957
assume there are 7 environments in the enterprise predev dev integrated test user test prod pfix training each needing it s own set of credentials
152963
then you insert one row in your temp table update it via another cursor through the variable value pairs and then select it usually joined with its parent entity in effect making it seem like those custom variable value pairs were like built-in columns in the original parent entity
152981
note ideally it needs to handle both ssh and ssl ftp connections but i d consider two separate components if it makes the most sense..
152984
if you can create com components with java you can use tlbimp to create an interop assembly for using in vb.net
152990
i use rebex.net file transfer pack for sftp and ftp transfers in .net
152994
boost especially will cause this but even the regular stl code can do this
152994
for example declaring a private copy constructor can prevent an object from unintended copying
153015
sockets are protocol specific - so the implementation of uniqueness that both tcp ip and udp ip uses ipaddress port is different than eg. ipx network node and...ahem socket - but a different socket than is meant by the general socket term
153015
since ip has become the dominant protocol a port in networking terms has become synonomous with either a udp or tcp port number - which is a portion of the socket address
153015
the api functions make it clear that both are just different type of sockets - sock_dgram is udp just sending a message and sock_stream is tcp creating a virtual circuit
153015
technically the ip header holds the ip address and the protocol on top of ip udp or tcp holds the port number
153027
these ruby source files extend a parent class overriding methods called up and down
153027
the up method contains the set of database changes that need to be made to bring the previous version of the database schema to the current version
153065
the main problem is that in one function the previous coder uses a void argument that is converted into suitable type in the function itself
153066
one big advantage of boost is that many of its features will show up in the stl extensions for the upcoming c++0x standard see for example
153071
my guess is that within xampp you need to enable allowoverride through an .htaccess in httpd.conf
153082
the only software that i see providing torrent links are linux distros and not all of them for example the ubuntu website does not provide torrents to download ubuntu
153105
doxygen will give you class relationship diagrams if you use graphviz even if you haven t specifically prepared for it
153108
doxygen is a free doc-generating tool similar to javadoc that ll also produce relationship graphs as well
153138
a few bytes of memory for the object won t be noticed and a handful of constructor calls will take maybe ten minutes to add
153154
you can of course add parameter to the main stored procedure so you can either copy all new records or only ones that you specify
153155
you should be able to use a combination of labels and id attributes to pick out the correct properties for your edit-in-place implementation to work
153193
i d like to customise the search results so that they actually look like our intranet has generated them and also place the search form s textbox and submit button on the intranet pages themselves
153200
rest has guarantees of safety a get message won t change state and idempotence a put request sent multiple times has same effect as just one time
153221
i get the idea from the example code above that your main function is supposed to sit in an infinite loop and only break out of it when it comes accross a stop condition
153221
which seems to get called when i do python myservice stop from the command line i can put a debug line in there that produces output to a file but doesn t actually exit the whole service - subsequent calls to python myservice start gives me an error
153240
iirc ftp is built in to .net system.net.ftpwebrequest and last time i looked a couple of years ago admittedly i couldn t find any free ssh sftp assemblies
153248
as i do not need to create overly complex excel sheets the most complicated thing is that i explicitely need to set a cell type to numeric or text i m looking towards option 1 next but i just wonder if there are any other good and supported ways to generate excel 2007 sheets
153253
performance will also improve if you minimize the set of things svn has to check - tell it to ignore any temporary directories object file directories etc
153297
getter ans setter too because they could accept negative value or null value that you might do not want to accept
153298
for example most tables in the document are displayed via a thickbox jquery plugin
153299
as you can see the form input takes up more space than plain text
153304
runtime flag for solaris and linux
153314
you should learn at least 1 compiled language like c# or java and 1 script language python ruby etc
153316
edtftpnet is free but you have to buy their pro version to get sftp ftp over ssh and ftps ftp over ssl
153317
i don t unit tests simple setter getter methods that have no side effects
153317
but for java i use maven 2 junit dbunit cobertura easymock
153343
ssh sftp library which my company uses
153356
i remember being able to get sharpssh to run without much hassle and it supports port forwarding which is what i was looking for at the time
153375
it doesn t include ssh and sftp though
153396
is there any possibility to get a centered contentpane or something similar with a fixed width and height
153419
asynchronous testing cairngorm events can also be done with flexunit but is not as elegant as with dpuint
153433
there is a plethora of javascript libraries that try to implement a workable platform on top of the dom and to even out the differences between browsers
153433
however impressing libraries like dojo yui and jquery are they are limited by the platform and it is limited indeed
153436
assuming this is for an intranet where you can set permissions and mandate ie you can generate the workbook client side with jscript vbscript driving excel
153438
the problem seems to stem from the targetinvocationexception not containing the error number as i d expect if it were a normal comexception so
153438
can i make this same call in a way that would cause a comexception containing the error number rather than a targetinvocationexception when the com component fails
153491
is there a tool out there that can automatically convert python to java
153502
your only possible salvation tpm but they are so rare in the consumer market your user base will be down to single digits
153505
i mean the action on it is essentially the same as a popup button without the arrow button separation
153509
if you re using ant or maven you can control which tests are run by filtering the tests by name
153527
setting accept-charset attribute to form element like this works for firefox opera etc
153530
from python source code to java source code
153530
or from python source code to java bytecode
153535
determining how to map classes defined in python into types in java will be a big challange because of differences in each of type binding time
153544
i have found that in all reality many user applications don t need large amounts of logging as really if issues come up you will be debugging to trace the values there
153546
note here i m referring to the logging that happens when trace mode is enabled for developer-oriented logs not user-oriented normal operation logs.
153570
instead we are doing put via a post and for delete we are using a get on a resource with an url parameter like
153660
requests to add a natural sort come up from time to time on the mysql bugs and discussion forums and many solutions revolve around stripping out specific parts of your data and casting them for the order by part of the query
153665
this is the default value so you d only have to change it if you wanted to save a value from a different field
153677
i have used c# ruby perl javascript and php professionally over the last year and they ve all been useful in different ways
153727
without sending an email it could be hard to get 100 but if you do a dns lookup on the host that should at least tell you that it is a viable destination system
153780
one is usually only interested in a crossing of lines if the crossing point lies on both the line segments in question
153855
long ago i made a test program where the reader would wait for a signal and read a packet - it would get a bout 100 packets sec
153855
it s important to not just get opinions but to put them to the test
153877
an autoresetevent resets when the code passes through event.waitone but a manualresetevent does not
153953
i m using mtrace to get a malloc free realloc trace
153967
usually case-sensitive table and column names are the default on linux mysql and case-insensitive used to be the default on windows but now the installer asked about this during setup
154021
you ll also be able to use bash as the shell instead of cmd.exe which is much nicer
154043
also there s pyqt for gui and wxpython mentioned earlier
154055
nb you have to subtract 1 from the month for the modulus operation then add it back to new_month since months in datetime.date s start at 1.
154076
in a posix system like linux or solaris try using posix_fadvise
154079
i have a number of rgba pixels each of them has an alpha component
154102
mapping is a unique sort of api
154133
i ve found that the easiest way to do this without touching the report code itself is to open the report in preview mode with the filter applied and then output the report to whatever format you need
154177
python has an embedded gui toolkit named tkinter which is based on tk library from tcl programming language
154177
tkinter is not hard at all to use since it doesnt have millions of widgets controls and options and is the default toolkit included in most python distributions at least on windows osx and linux
154180
i seem to remember that nunit and mstest attempts to run tests in parallel on multiple threads which would definitely trigger race conditions on the static shared gateway but i cannot find any documentation that says what actually happens
154180
my question is does nunit or mstest ever run unit tests in parallel
154225
i just tested a simple example checking getscrollpos 0 and getscrollrange 0 in evt_text event handler for wx.textctrl and it works fine for me - they return index of currently shown line and total number of lines respectively
154244
that being impossible see if the wiremonkeys can open up the appropriate port in the firewall just between the server and the web service and just for http https traffic
154266
it is often useful to define a min and max inside your enum which will always be the first and last items
154290
the installation and configuration seems to be fine
154299
when run in debugger the current directory seems to be vb6 s dir
154307
if i add 3 or 4 elements to a dictionary and then do a for each to get all the keys they appear in the same order i added them
154321
to check it quickly use the same elements and change the order in which you add them to the dictionary
154323
i d start with that and possibly replace the line data structure with something more efficiently supporting inserts deletes on long lines after you have everything else working
154333
what keys did you add with in your test and in what order
154342
no if you are using eclipse because you can configure a save action to automatically add these final modifiers for you
154345
getting a small data set from a big hashtable could be inefficient
154349
rather than using a long buffer to contain the text you ll probably want an array of lines because it s faster to insert a character into the middle of a line then it is to insert a character into the middle of a large buffer
154356
i ve tested the above in the following browsers ie6 7 8b2 firefox 2.0.0.17 3.0.3 opera 9.52 safari for windows 3.1.2 and google chrome whatever the latest version was at the time of this post and it works across all browsers
154359
there are some special container type panels that you could stick on your form such as flowlayoutpanel and tablelayoutpanel
154369
unfortunately it also requires a more space and correspondingly b a lot of work to get the data input
154388
go with a virtualization solution that is bare level like xen server or vmware esx or esxi free or hyper-v which isn t bare-level but closer in performance
154391
i made that assumption because i try to avoid overloads that differ by only a single datatype and in looking at the code didn t even pick up on the int double difference
154409
most people start out with prototype jquery or one of the top 6 libs mootools extjs yui which have different object models
154416
words containing punctuation
154417
that s styled to have a particular height and width and overflow horizontally
154425
may be storing your initial dictionnary the 25000 words in a berkeley db hash table on disk that you can probably use directly from c c++ i know you can do it from perl and for each word in the text query if it s present in the database
154437
a bunch of lines with no indentation may have control flow but it means you have to read each line to detect it
154444
the default raster position should be 0 0 0 1 but you can reset it to make sure
154464
if you declare them on the constructor they cannot be acceced on other methods you need to declare them as object fields to be global to your object instance
154500
you could also restructure the elements so that the elements you don t want to scale with the canvas are not actually children of that canvas
154525
if you have set any properties on the table then you have to re-set those properties
154554
i need to do this using a asp.net web service .net v2
154557
you d be best off running vmware esx esxi as they both have a fancy memory pooling feature

python has a module subprocess which i was thinking about using as inspiration for a similar module in ruby
154640
if you re building this for unix you might also consider packaging your script using this recipe unix zip executable but note that you might have to tweak this if you plan on using stdin or reading anything from sys.args it can be done without too much trouble
154673
an override function replaces a function inherited from the base class but does so in such a way that it is called even when an instance of its class is pretending to be a different type through polymorphism
154673
however because the function is an override the definition of tostring from your class is used even when the class instance s true type is hidden behind polymorphism
154697
the cell is originally populated from a dataset with a numeric field value but since the datagridviewcell object returns it as an object i can t do a straight assignment
154704
this is like keys in perl and python and other languages that have built in support for hashes aka dictionaries
154720
in fact we were told to ignore any problems that users running at lower resolutions reported since their internal help desk answer was set your resolution to 1024x768 or better and run with the browser maximized
154775
by putting the follow keyword on the next line i can take advantage of for example editors that let me select a range of lines and comment uncomment them all at once
154791
i m writing a java tree in which tree nodes could have children that take a long time to compute in this case it s a file system where there may be network timeouts that prevent getting a list of files from an attached drive
154791
i believe this is done so the jtree knows whether to show a + icon next to the node
154791
if i fake the value of getchildcount the tree only allocates space for that many child nodes before asking for an enumeration of the children
154809
the second question is a little harder since the cross-platform solutions ffmpeg tend to be gpl d or lgpl d
154812
unlike most sorting routines what python s list.sort which is what uses timsort cares about is avoiding unnecessary comparisons because generally comparisons are a lot more expensive than swapping items which is always just a set of pointer copies or even allocating some extra memory because it s always just an array of pointers and the overhead is small compared to the average overhead in any python operation.
154816
everything from excel to versionone to scrumworks to basecamp was mentioned
154823
i m not sure if it s entirely applicable but i recently worked around problems with a slow tree by pre-computing the answers to methods that would normally require going through the list of children
154849
this is especially important for servicing purposes - making sure that when a service pack for vsts is applied to the client machine then the tfs api s get upgraded as well

the tfs api assemblies are all marked x86 but if you app is marked any cpu then on a x64 machine it will get loaded by the 64bit clr but when it comes time to dynamically load the tfs assemblies it will fail
154854

you left out the occurs under another o s category of bugs so that a web page that is fine in ie and firefox on pc may look like crap on safari on a mac
154964
in addition timestamp_type will tell you if the entry is for insertion e.g 1 update e.g 2 and anything else you may want to add like deletion
154976
also use the correct gcc frontend executable g++ will treat .c files like c++ files unless you explicitly tell it not too
154976
so if you are compiling real c then use gcc not g++
154982
edit the logs are custom - they have a set format but i don t think they conform to any widely used standards
155004
if you set up the time-stamp stuff to run off of triggers than any action that can set off a trigger reads
155028
or if the problem is a random memory overwrite use a replacement malloc free implementation that traps writing to free memory like electric fence or dmalloc
155059
single enumeration yielding both min and max and any other aggregate you want to throw in there
155064
my concern is that there is a compatibility issue with building software using visual studio in an amd environment
155065
how can i scale the brokenimageskin to a custom width and height
155077
i then set a packet sniffing tool on the network
155077
the very last network packets to and from the system where the udp packet originated would presumably be a big clue as to what was happening
155086
seconds you can easily change things enough to hide the bug only to have it resurface again with the next patch
155146
the example for your case can be found here it uses heading of field in csv file as the xml element name
155180
windows service deployment is easy after the initial install you just turn them off and do an xcopy
155210
the .net class httplistener exposes the underlying http.sys upon which iis is built
155214
there is an io error event where you could set the width and height of the image
155228
to use different versions of a configuration file for different environments create a build configuration for each of the different environments and a config file named after the environment e.g
155228
the pre build event would look similar to the above just use configuration to get the appropriate file for the environment you want
155255
asp.net mvc doesn t use any postbacks so most of webforms server controls don t function
155283
for windows i ve tried amd codeanalyst intel vtune and the profiler in visual studio team edition
155301
readonly doesn t work on checkboxes as it prevents you from editing a field s value but with a checkbox you re actually editing the field s state on || off
155301
it s important to understand that readonly merely prevents the user from changing the value of the field not from interacting with the field
155301
in checkboxes for example you can check them on or off thus setting the checked state but you don t change the value of the field
155301
if you don t want to use disabled but still want to submit the value how about submitting the value as a hidden field and just printing its contents to the user when they don t meet the edit criteria
155306
i have a textarea with many lines of input and a javascript event fires that necessitates i scroll the textarea to line 345
155346
use an external file for all styles that are used sitewide document stylesheet for styles that are only used on that page and use inline styles when the style only affects that single element
155363
under configuration properties - debugging edit the environment value to set environment variables
155371
how do i get the xmlhttprequest object s send method to duplicate the above http stream
155385
actually this may or may not be much help but you could write a script which created a java class for each python class including method stubs placing the python implementation of the method inside the javadoc
155385
i worked for a company which undertook a port to java of a huge smalltalk similar-ish to python system and this is exactly what they did
155393
is there any one website which contains many good c# screencasts
155400
i d like to save these credentials with the other user settings but for security reasons the password needs to be encrypted
155403
this will give you access to stdin stdout and stderr
155465
i think when you are developing new features or integrating stuff on a moss wss server you need a little flexibility
155478
it is usually used when you want to encode decode some image from one format to another
155510
to create the directory dir to create type
155510
it assumes that emacs s inferior shell is bash zsh or other compatible shell
155518
the goal is to produce some set of functionality that is completely implemented on each iteration not to throw together a bunch of half-done stuff
155530
if you don t like the use of the coalesce function you can add a display_order column to this table that you can manually set and then use for the order by
155542
you could write your program to uses ncurses and then use pdcurses to convert it to an x11 application - as the readme advertise
155542
i know it because i ve used it as portable curses though i ve never tested its x11 capabilities
155583
you add your elements as sortables and code your own callbacks to execute when the items are dragged then dropped -- such as sending an asynchronous request to the server to persist the new order
155583
here is a full tutorial on creating sortable lists with scriptaculous and php
155600
the first field is the mime type value and the second field is a base64 encoded string containing the image content
155601
there seem to be enough tools protege topbraid jena etc. that knowing the syntax of the markup languages is not necessary but knowing the concepts is of course still critical
155625
given the heavy reliance by gwt richfaces etc
155628
use exitcode if your main has a void return signature otherwise you need to set it by the value you return
155628
if the main method returns void you can use this property to set the exit code that will be returned to the calling environment
155628
if main does not return void this property is ignored
155639
at one point i was using a nice recursive function to get the position of an element in the document
155662
you need to use a partial function to input the radians into cos and sin
155662
that said javascript s sin and cos aren t quite as picky so you must have halved your radian or something
155664
when performing an xmlhttprequest and executing a function onreadystatechange the xmlhttprequest.responsetext property contains the data loaded at that point in firefox but not in ie and maybe safari
155669
i might show or hide certain features or change certain text
155670
so - what s the most numerical stable way to invert a matrix
155671
the apis are totally different for windows linux mac os x and any other unix you can name it seems
155682
semantic web for the working ontologist book contains a good number of practical examples and motivates the need for rdf rdfs and owl and is in my opinion very readable
155700
since first popular programming languages such as fortran c pascal didn t cover the oo paradigm they only call to these artifacts functions
155706
i have been looking at a few options for enabling localization and internationalization of a dynamic php application
155711
glut hasn t been updated for awhile but you can also try freeglut which is a newer open source replacement of glut and is included by several linux distributions out of the box
155713
attributes are usable in domains where they map onto data structures that follow those rules the names and values of properties on an object of columns in a row of a table of entries in a dictionary
155723
this method is undocumented in the mysql adapter but is documented in the postgresql adapter
155730
as of 2008 javascript 1.7 is supported in firefox 2.0+ and safari 3.x
155750
i put all code that could cause an exception inside a try catch block and inside the catch block i spit out an alert message alerting the user that an error has occurred as well as log the exception in a database including form input query string etc
155761
generators and iterators works only in firefox 2+ and safari
155767
says that function f will return the sin of the first parameter added to the cosine of the second parameter
155767
as it happens sin and cos are also functions
155827
oo purists might argue a method is something different from a function and if you get into advanced python or ruby - or smalltalk
155830
you can set the default editor for any given file type .cs .xml .xsd etc
155845
the other thing you might try is to decorate your properties with attributes and then reflect against your class when it is constructed looking for properties with the attribute and load rules
155869
we re encoding data in coldfusion using serializejson and trying to decode it in php using json_decode
155882
if you have visual studio 6 or mingw installed and have the compiler environment variables set up at least for visual studio 6 but not sure about mingw the gem should build during installation
155950
this command parses each line in myfile.txt ignoring lines that begin with a semicolon and passing the second and third token from each line to the for body tokens are delimited by commas or spaces
155956
the netbsd and openbsd versions support only -r
155993
at a guess if you give us the code from the start of the function definition before line 44 perhaps line 40 or so through to line 54 or a few lines later - maybe line 60 - then we may be able to help
156009
because of the more tedious way of adding hosts to be monitored in nagios it requires defining a host object as opposed to the previous program which only required the ip and hostname i figured it d be best to automate this and it d be a great time to learn perl because all i know at the moment is c c++ and java
156024
note 2 i recommend you create a temporary folder for the tests and run command line or powershell whose current working directory is set to this location
156027
when you click on the link the desired radio button is selected
156043
the issue itself is regarding the behavior related with the snmp set community itself that i d like to understand if there is any relationship between them
156065
but the simplest idea would be to put the selected value into a hidden input field for the postback event
156069
when i took the isie6 condition off of the code it mostly worked in ie7 there was an extra line break at the top and bottom and firefox 3.
156076
we have put together a small utility in-house that reads the catalog changes and builds a large update script based on the contents of the catalog by grabbing the contents from each revision in the catalog and applying them
156098
3.5 in table cells make every element including the cell itself opaque for performance

is your pga_aggregate_target set to zero by any chance
156116
an answer that would work cross browser safari webkit firefox etc. would be preferred
156133
i m trying to load fragments of xhtml markup using jquery s function but it raises an error trying to add the new markup into the dom
156134
it makes debugging and maintenance so much easier and as a bonus you can easily print out the exit codes on your help screen - you do have one of those right
156136
i looked around and found the directx direct3d stuff which has all the underlying pieces but there doesn t appear to be any high level api to work with unless you re willing to use .net and use wpf neither of which really interest me
156136
directx direct3d has these pieces but you have to jump through a lot of hoops or so it appears to use it
156165
create a series of line segments to represent the drawing and render these using either lines or thin polygons
156172
the world would be better if we all ran mips i think or even arm or powerpc - or rather if intel amd took their semiconductor expertise and used it to make multi-core ultra-fast ultra-cheap mips processors instead of x86 processors with all of those redeeming qualities
156173
transitioning to any web-trendy language php asp.net ruby python is going to be worth it if for nothing more than to realize where asp classic lacks
156249
by this i mean if you take something that relied on both the mouse and keyboard and changed it to rely only on the mouse or only on the keyboard then you have improved useability
156252
having learnt java you ll be amazed how much simpler python is for getting the same things done
156254
you can t test this with is_writable so you ll need to go to the folder from phpinfo it looks like var php_sessions and make sure sessions are actually getting created
156261
the tool calls out to the shell and i wanted to capture exactly what was displayed during test runs no matter what git was displaying and no matter if it was being spit out in stdout or stderr
156266
sounds like you need either a to leverage polymorphism by putting method on myinterface and implementing in a and b or b some combination of composite and visitor design pattern
156268
select col1 col2 from tst group by col1 col2 having count 1
156270
thus the more appropriate place for the lock would be inside portions of code such as inside a for-loop or if-statement so you can free up the individual elements right away even before other ones are processed
156280
i know i can do an hg incoming -p to see the patch sets of changes coming in but it d be nice to just directly see the actual changes for a particular file that i d get if i do a pull of the latest stuff or what i might be about put push out
156280
the easiest thing i can think of right now is to create a little script that takes a look at the default location in .hg hgrc and downloads the file using curl if it s over http otherwise scp it over ssh or just do a direct diff if it s on the local file system and then to diff the working copy or the tip against that temporary copy
156292
should i declare the constructor as taking the order object as the first parameter and the productsservice and customersservice after that eg
156309
dump the database in csv xml or similar format that you d then load into mysql
156328
for keypress you can also use sendmessage sending both keydown and keyup
156341
also beware that autonumber field values behave differently than advertised after the compacting procedure according to the ms access 2000 documentation if you delete records from the end of a table that has an autonumber field compacting the database resets the autonumber value
156362
extend mixes in specified module methods as class methods in the target class
156365
linq-to-sql has some support for inheritance via a discriminator here here but you can only query on classes that are defined in the linq model - data classes themselves and more perhaps importantly for this example the query itself must be phrased in terms of data classes although tentity is a data class it knows that the property here is declared on the entity base
156369
and there are equivalents in lisp and scheme
156374
well apart from common lisp labels and scheme letrec which you ve already mentioned javascript also allows you to name an anonymous function
156397
instead of having 50x50 start with 10x10 and then draw 5x5 cells in each cell
156403
if you implement snail mail as the data link layer or if your packet traveled different routes it s possible that the receiver receives packets in wrong order
156420
in this example ebp the stack frame base pointer has the variable at zero offset
156454
not unless you exploit the webserver or .net asp.net stack itself
156470
as to a valid regex for it the perl mail rfc822 address module contains a regular expression which will apparently work - but only if any comments have been replaced by whitespace already
156538
i m building a silverlight application and one of my caveats from last time was that if you need anything done right in silverlight wpf way you d need to model your objects as a dependecyobject and use dependencyproperty ies
156538
i m aiming to minimize code bloat and boiler plates i hate them and really would like to know if anyone with experience in silverlight wpf has any tips techniques for keeping usage of dependencyobject and dependencyproperty to a minimum
156550
if you re on unix linux then you can put it through sed
156575
uses .net built in trace logging
156594
my real unit tests are built during normal tdd cycles and they always assert something although not always directly - sometimes the assertions are part of the mocking framework and sometimes i m able to refactor similar assertions into a single method
156604
depending on what you really need you might be looking for apc memcached various template caching libs.
156615
i have used both log4net and nlog
156636
a way i tend to use to solve this kind of problem is to use a dictionary field with the type as the key and the lambda as the value which is pretty terse to construct using object initializer syntax
156638
no you ll not see an empty address list even if you query a dns label that does exist but has no a or aaaa ipv6 records a socketexception no such host is known will be thrown
156640
it fully supports exif as well as iptc xmp and many other types of metadata from file types including jpeg png gif png ico webp psd .
156675
if you re using jdk 1.6 you can use the callback methods gettimetolive and needsreload in resourcebundle.control to control if the bundle cache needs to be loaded with new values from the database
156684
can be used for security - pass in some kind of value to identify the client - from their the webserver will either deny or grant access to the client dependant on some criteria - maybe a lookup list
156695
this is necessary for .net framework 1.1 implementation of system.diagnostics
156718
you can set another order at any time and doing so will change all texts in the application then and there
156795
it s not the most elegant solution but you could use openrowset to put the stored proc results into a table then use sp_help to get a description of it
156798
i have a really strange problem with an quite simple asp.net .net 3.5 site and the ie6
156800
ps since i have a 2.0 app i m using the object tag approach to silverlight and it s contained in a div with height and width set in style
156863
whether an object grabs the global object and navigates its properties to get the interfaces it wants or gets passed the interfaces it uses via its constructor is a matter of taste and intuition
156863
any object you re implementing that you think might be reused in some other project should definately be passed data structures it should use via its constructor
156866
i wonder if there is a program available which would do lets say a benchmark of your hardware cpu speed memory performance harddisk speed analyze your database and come up with the optimal configuration for this specific environment
156880
i wish to make these services return bad request when the xml contains invalid elements
156912
when a mouse down is detected on the button i want to send a specific keyboard code to the application currently on focus
156916
i am using zsh but a bash solution is also welcome
156927
or you can extend klazz with mod giving the class klazz access to mod s methods
156941
now the problem arise when i want to restart the thin daemon because webuser can t sudo
156941
i am thinking if its possible to invoke two separate sessions- webuser for file deployment and then a special sudoer to restart the daemon
156970
if you re using ce 6 and .net compact framework 3.5 have you considered using the windows communication foundation wcf
157025
and when you are at a point of code you are sure about the type of the object being called you may make an inline call that will avoid the polymorphic system and enable inlining by the compiler
157028
show the window programatically hide it immediately programatically and click cancel on it well you guessed programmatically
157055
people were still building own frameworks with consistent object relational mapping to address their databases own techniques to dynamically extend classes and methods at runtime for customer to be able to customize application behaviour
157094
well you could do one list comprehension expression to get a set of tuples with that stat test in them and then reduce that down to get the sums
157109
using a standard like xsd or dtd allows you to have a well know and recognized language on how to describe the structure of a xml document
157144
for a project i built a custom datagridview column which contains numericupdown controls
157151
furthermore setting the icon of the form from a png is an unessecary performance hit it should have been an ico in the first place
157180
first create a directory inside your eclipse installation folder for example opt eclipse called links
157185
if you re using .net 3.0 or later i would encourage you to consider implementing your service using wcf
157185
with wcf you can make your service compatible with asmx services regular .net web services so other applications and other languages can consume the service as though it was a regular .net web service
157200
there should be an ant or maven or similar build script that will allow a developer to build and deploy from their working copy onto the development web server so they can see how it is
157211
are there any open-sourced fractal map creators available preferably in python or c c++
157215
so instead of using an ide which you ll probably do all your professional life get a taste of using old school editors like vim emacs
157215
object relational mapping take a look at ruby on rails cakephp django and sql alchemy and model view controller frameworks on various platforms
157238
consider using opengl use jogl of lwjgl
157238
jogl is more java-like whereas lwjgl provides more gaming functionality on top of opengl access
157244
one solution would be to use iis manager to configure the website created for your asp.net app by visual studio and add a virtual directory for each of the common folders so that by the virtual nature of the virtual directory they will appear to be in the same root folder as your asp.net app
157263
in c# there was a conscious decision to disallow changing the type when overloading properties even when they have only one of the getter setter pair because it would otherwise have very inconsistent behavior you mean i can change the type on the one with a getter but not one with both a getter and setter
157266
i think using the first form is probably the way to go since it s probably by far the most common loop structure in the known universe and since i don t believe the reverse loop saves you any time in reality still doing an increment decrement and a comparison on each iteration
157328
but if you really need to reduce your footprint then you need to use a non-dom api like sax or stax but that s considerably more work
157401
in about 99.8 of all cases it s just plus minus division and multiplication in some intelligent combinations - in most cases it s about algorithms not math
157451
it seems to combine all the best of nunit mbunit and mstest
157519
you get a coercion mechanism with allows you to define rules for max min and present value of the property
157524
using maven 1.x with just the bundled standard plugins what configuration is necessary to build an executable jar
157594
however it is possible to use a repository on another server with any combination of supported protocols including http ftp scp sftp and more
157603
i m using visualsvn server to host an svn repo and for some automation work i d like to be able to get specific versions via the http s layer
157624
the only way i managed it was to create an xml fragment containing the nodes in the node list and then passing in the children of the fragment
157636
you can programmatically build a select statement to see if any tuples point to more than one row
157696
change directory to mysql installation folder
157705
i need to do some sort of check around the xsl element in the template i think but i m not sure how to interrogate the output document to see if the element is already present
157718
in that case my advice would be to use stderr rather than stdout
157728
platform anycpu c windows microsoft.net framework v2.0.50727 microsoft.common.targets 490 9 crm_deploy
157740
personally i use media player classic if i have ac3 or acc track on the movie and prefer to enjoy full digital output i can easily switch from the sound filter settings
157770
i can set background-color width etc. but can t set the font-weight
157771
assuming you use lazy matches you can get a set of matches on a string which you can put into your array
157781
however there seems to be a bug in this method it returns all node names in uppercase and all attribute names in lowercase regardless of the capitalization i used to create the node
157785
the on error goto label syntax is supported by visual basic and visual basic for applications vba but vbscript doesn t support this language feature so you have to use on error resume next as described above
157801
but in short if you re using carbon use the gestalt call and if you re using cocoa there is a constant called nsappkitversionnumber which you can simply check against
157812
i have a field on a table in ms access tblmytable.someid and i want to set the default value as a user preference in tbluserpref.defaultsomeid
157812
i ve tried to set the default value of the field on the form but doesn t seem to accept a query either
157959
i want to update the scheme of terminal.app not know how i would do this in a pure linux unix env
157960
you could instrument the troublesome calls with trace logging via aop or even use its exception interception features to conditionally log without having to litter your code
157974
rot13 encode the string offline copy it into the source decode at point of transmission
157984
you can then open .bashrc in textedit or in textwrangler and add the previous commands
158057
so you see the following when editing lisp scheme
158104
in my troubleshooting i ve dumbed it down as much as i could so please don t mind where i concat plain text to plaintext.
158144
i bet if you put your send code in a for 1 100000 loop you would eventually get a write that succeeds with a value smaller than requested
158151
do i really have to open an image program like paint.net or photoshop simply to paste an image then save it
158175
anyone that s worked with engineering tools solidworks autocad etc. is familiar with this sort of relative positioning
158200
sets recognized properties for an ftp server to put and get xml input and a jms queue server that keeps track of jobs
158210
but more often on linux you would see python or perl being used
158256
i m looking for a good asp.net richtextbox component that integrates fairly easily with .net framework 3.5 ajax specifically one that can easily provide its values from inside an updatepanel
158277
i ve been following this tutorial lesson 6 in order to build and deploy a sample report with an embedded subreport which reads its parameters values from the parent report
158277
this subreport is embedded in one of the group rows of the report s table and both share the same datasource
158277
the report works great when i preview it at the business intelligence development studio by the way sql 2005 express edition but when i deploy it and try to see in the report manager the subreport is not shown
158292
the current working directory of the applicaiton will be c folder 1
158310
is there a tool preferably free which will translate oracle s pl sql stored procedure language into postgresql s pl pgsql stored procedure language
158319
can someone point me at some sample cross-browser code firefox opera safari ie that solves this problem
158319
i m familiar with firefox s pageshow event but unfortunately neither opera nor safari implement this
158343
use ado .net to open xls file using jet engine connection to locally uploaded file on web server
158379
does the subreport use the same data source as the parent report
158387
your script should have its own credentials and the account it uses should have no access other than exactly what is necessary
158401
it could also be a problem with your version of the bash shell not correctly executing your .profile
158427
you can create a plist file to tell it to launch your program on startup which can include arguments
158450
a create some kind of ceasar cipher function to encode decode just not rot13
158450
b the preferred method is to use an encryption key within reach of your program encode decode the password
158489
if your code is c++ then you might consider log4cxx in the apache project apt-get install liblog4cxx9-dev on ubuntu debian but it looks like you are using c
158505
python doesn t use statically defined types like c++
158509
as a .net developer i m asking whether jboss alternatives exist to be more suitable for .net development as an enterprise application platform
158514
according to the manual git dcommit will create a revision in svn for each commit in git. but is there a way to avoid multiple subversion revisions
158519
in other words how can i find records that match any of the flags in my mask that i m sending to the procedure
158525
a slight variation on the second report theme that i have used is to isolate the part of the report where you have an optional column into it s own subreport and then create two subreports one with and one without the column and then use conditions to determine which subreport to print
158548
ok i tried this and it works in firefox 3 safari 3.1.1 and ie7 but not in opera 9.52
158550
that way your function will be called whether the link is clicked or the submit button is pushed or the enter key is pressed and you can cancel the submission by returning false
158550
edit i would recommend always hooking form submission this way rather than calling submit on the form object
158603
thus the bigger problem might be that you rely on a certain speed you assume the processor can perform that many operations a second however when the core frequency is lowered it will behave like a slower cpu less operations per second and the core frequency doesn t jump to max just because the cpu is not 100 idle
158608
...as any bit being set to 1 will result in a non-zero value for the operator
158635
for a little gui app i would recommend tk either with tcl or as tkinter with python
158635
i ve not used odbc with tcl or python
158643
i think it would be easier to store a list of the nodes that the user has expanded assuming you can uniquely identify each one then re-load the data and re-bind it to the tree view and then expand all the nodes previously expanded
158648
i know this is not about the database but the db battle has cause ms to give away a lot in order to add value to their stack
158648
sql server doesn t run on unix or linux so they are automatically excluded from this market
158652
don t forget that nswindowcontroller and nsviewcontroller will release the top-level objects of the nib files they govern
158671
coming from someone who has just as much experience as you do haven t developed any eclipse based plugins or anything with gwt this is purely an opinion from another set of eyes on your problem
158686
however as recommended in this forum thread you can convert your silverlight app to a wpf application and profile that
158686
there is no tool as of now but as a workaround you can easily create a desktop wpf version of your silverlight client from the same code base and few tweaks refer scot s blog for an example on this -

this works well enough for screen media but when you switch to print media is there any guarantee that the 90 dpi i appear to get on my system i put the margins to 0.5in either side and for a text resized so that it fits just within that i get about 675 for clientwidth will be the same anywhere else
158711
by the solution you propose setting the digital output as default my pc would output pcm in games music etc

the trivial algorithm generating random numbers and before adding them to the sequence looking them up to see if they were already there is very expensive if k is large and near enough to n

i want the input-box to inherit the height width from the parent table-cell but when i look at the input-box in firebug it has an inline css height width already set causing the table-cell to scale when the td text is pressed

if you re looking for something a little more diy there s the itextsharp library - a port of java s itext - and pdfbox yes it says java - but they have a .net version by way of ikvm.net
158824
here s some codeproject articles on using itextsharp and pdfbox from c#
158856
here s the motivation i want to have the svn revision number inside my executable
158862
you can add an order by clause like this
158877
old school but a php + perl technique
158897
in my opinion the best easiest solution is to build a small flash widget that consists of an upload button and a progress bar
158904
once the text is submitted you could strip any all tags that don t match your predefined set using a regex in php
158908
how would i upload a file to a webserver using c++ and mfc
158943
i know that services like my.yahoo.com allow you to add content from rss feeds to your personal page but in general they are links which draw the user to the site which provided the feed
158959
i have to guess here since i could not find a public list of all ports available for openbsd but since there is a port for freebsd netbsd etc
158959
i guess that even though openbsd links to freebsd s porter s handbook freshports is not applicable for your system
158961
embedding svn revision number at compile time in a windows app
158997
that is rather than dealing with time and frames in flash one is dealing with describing where components should be placed with mxml and how those components work with actionscript
158997
actionscript is used to program behaviors components and other things outside or what mxml does
159002
so yes everything that can be done with mxml can be done with actionscript but not the other way around
159028
you agree to provide proper attribution to the associated press in reasonable proximity to your use of the rss feed s and you agree that you will not modify the format or branding of the headlines digests and other information provided in the rss feeds
159034
and by extension is it safe to validate an input by checking that it is your max value and leave out your min value assuming you started at 0 and incremented by 1
159052
as long as you make sure not to do that and you are not building a laser that requires 30 significant digits of precision just pick your favorite flavor between int double or whatever float s your boat
159054
the difference between what you are proposing and services like my.yahoo.com netvibes bloglines google reader etc is that you are the one choosing the feeds whereas with those other services the user is specifying the feed and is therefore aware of it s original source
159073
in short you cannot rely on an enum being either signed or unsigned
159081
usually when i need this kind of information i include in the enum a max and min value something like this
159137
for windows the wmi module can be used and the only method under linux i could find was to run ifconfig and run a regex across its output

i m working in .net 3.5sp1 in c# for an asp.net solution and i m wondering if there s any way to turn on the class name and method name drop-downs in the text editor that vb.net has at the top
159260
you can have a setinterval loop on document load that would search for the element in the update panel and if it didn t have the events it can re-attach them
159263
however if the distro is more than a few years old it may not exist and alternative mechanisms include browser older attempted standard gnome-open gnome kfmclient exec kde exo-open xfce or parsing mailcap yourself the text html handler will be likely be a browser

when you create a baseclassproxy object it needs to create a instance of it s base class so you need to call the base class constructor what you can doo is choose wich one to call like
159354
consider ruby as an alternative to perl
159354
additionally ruby s syntax may be more comfortable and easier to read or write than perl s or sed s
159354
in many cases when dealing with one-liners performance isn t enough of an issue to care whether you use lightweight sed or heavyweight perl or heaveier-weight ruby
159358
also need to call nodeswereinserted on the tree so the proper number of nodes will be displayed
159365
someone might write their array like this when writing char arrays in order to add space for the terminating 0
159395
imo however you want to be on a platform that you know will grow and in the highly competitive and consolidating bi environment that seems to be one of the four enterprise mega-vendors my opinion

my firm is at this stage using some of the etl capability offered by sql server integration services ssis and some alternate usage of the open source but in practice license requiring talend product in the data access layer a denormalized reporting structure implemented completely in the basic sql server database and sql server reporting services ssrs to largely automate based on your skill the production of pre-specified reports
159410
in the end everything is compiled down to actionscript check the -keep compiler option but mxml just saves you so much time
159419
for example assuming that you had a range object variable named xlrng a worksheet variable named xlsheet a workbook variable named xlbook and an excel application variable named xlapp then your cleanup code could look something like the following

currently when viewing output.txt all that is there is a 0 printed on every line 606 lines

jquery javascript is manipulating the dom and dynamically adding setting the widths of the input fields each time you doubleclick
159452
you can set this in httpd.conf or in an .htaccess file if you have access to one using the php_flag notation
159454
you need to listen for width changes on the content composite mparent compute the minimum height again given the new content width and call setminheight on the scrolled composite with new height
159454
this is because changes in the height of the content do not affect the minimum height of the content as long as the width is the same
159465
add fade effects for item addition and removal from a list
159470
i m using an expander inside a resizer a contentcontrol with a resize gripper and it expands collapses properly when the control initially comes up

sol6912 configuring an http profile to rewrite urls so that redirects from an http server specify the https protocol
159489
a clientssl virtual server is typically configured to accept https connections from a client decrypt the ssl session and send the unencrypted http request to the web server
159489
the redirect will be returned to the client in http mode rather than https causing the ssl session to fail
159489
following is an example of how an http 302 redirect response causes the ssl session to fail
159489
when the web server sends the http 302 redirect response it specifies http not https
159489
when the client receives the http 302 redirect response it sends a new request to the big-ip ltm virtual server that specifies http not https
159489
in big-ip ltm version 9.x you can configure an http profile to rewrite urls so that redirects from an http server specify the https protocol
159489
o choose all to rewrite any http 301 302 303 305 or 307 redirects to https
159491
i am trying to create a sortable image matrix 5x5 using scriptaculous javascript library by i can t make it work
159499
i would stay away from having a local webserver mainly because of security considerations
159507
to design guis in java you can use swt awt or swing widget toolkits
159508
codegear have also a c++ ide so you can have the bundle and put your hand dirty at delphi and c++
159511
but to be on the safe side your unhandled exception filter might get inadvertently overwritten you could put your code inside #95

raw t-sql is limited to charindex patindex replace and substring for string manipulation
159601
these functions include sorting paging grouping etc
159630
so if there is any chance any of the methods could return a null i d at least split the chain at those points and store in intermediate variables and break it up into individual lines so that a crash report would give me a line number to look at

we ve only got 3 ports open ftp http and https 21 80 443 on a cisco firewall

if you are running under vista then the system just redirects writes to the program files folder this is done so old program that keep their configuration in the program directory will continue to work when the user is not an admin or uac is enabled
159704
so serialization works but when you try to pass these objects the other way as a parameter for a web service call the deserialization breaks because they can t be the input is treated as a list of string object dictionaries which can t be converted to a list of whatever custom class the collection contains
159740
tell them to document their functions and interfaces with javadoc commments and then to run the code through doxygen to generate cool-looking html documentation for their code
159742
perl java or c c++ language doesn t matter
159749
a better solution might be - assuming you need to expose all of the parent properties up the tree at the child level - to go ahead and implement direct properties on the children
159756
the coding style is usually part of an organization s internal policy convention standards but i think in general the all_lower_case_underscore_separator style also called snake_case is most common in python
159760
with this example if you have a name with more than three parts then all the extra stuff will get put in the last_name field
159777
note if you have more than one recursive call inside and you want to preserve the order of the calls you have to add them in the reverse order to the stack

sql server 2005 offers a very useful pivot and unpivot operator which allow you to make this code maintenance-free using pivot and some code generation dynamic sql
159804
it feels like php in that regard it s bypassing python semantics in name behaviour and is very inefficient and i could imagine that it s hard to maintain
159804
what s wrong with django or pylons
159804
what does web2py do that you can t do with django in a few lines of code with a better performance code that s easier to read and on an established platform where tons of developers will jump in and fix problems in no time if they appear

if you really must do it it shouldn t be very hard to write a script that walks through the history of the svn repo getting each revision and committing it to cvs
159984
works on ff ie safari opera chrome
159990
i ve done some python but have just now starting to use ruby
159990
python methods receive self as an explicit argument whereas ruby does not
159993
so if you are doing real polymorphism you should always override
160017
in the constructor the self object is actually called a
160021
svn gives you atomic commits which while not quite up to the standard of perforce is miles in front of cvs
160027
call it in place of the object s constructor
160038
i would also argue that there is another level which contains precise analogues that carry from one to the other - for example the set theory behind relational databases which is all hidden by the sql semantics
160085
most of the commonly used engines ms sql server oracle db2 mysql etc. would not experience noticeable issues using a surrogate key system
160085
for example if you have customers with customer codes and invoices with invoice numbers both of which are natural keys and you want to retrieve all the invoice numbers for a specific customer code you can simply use

cakephp and zend look more popular but symfony seems interesting.
160212
i re-read some things that i had looked at before and discovered that svn externals don t just refer to using code in different repositories but can also be used to use multiple working copies in visualsvn
160260
my two reasons are i already know how to do this and i need my scripts to be portable across linux bsd solaris
160288
if i have to move this update function to service layer which only takes person in the request what would be the best way to assign my person request object into the datacontext without doing the deep copying again
160306
you can only call free 3 on pointers allocated on the heap with malloc 3 calloc 3 or realloc 3
160322
if its related to the maximum value you can try using the max function on that field
160323
note that you can not predict in what order the hash elements will be traversed unless you tie the hash via tie ixhash or similar again if you re going to go through that much work i recommend a tree module

putting actionscript in mxml is the same as putting css or javascript in html really bad

i ve looked at both ssdp and upnp for this type of functionality but i d recommend going with a custom udp multicast solution
160441
imho ssdp and upnp and bloated and overly complicated for resource discovery.

this ec2 stuff had me befuddled with most documentation oriented toward businessy applications and using c# or java but this slide show clarified much for me especially for using python

i ve always created a separate assembly that contains the enumerations and any interfaces the client server need to share

although we support the odd java php or python installation we re using perl for nearly all of our web applications and systems data marshalling tasks
160534
i do not have the ability to add a mouseover or onclick event to the td element so i need to add them with jquery

has anyone used csla in an application that has a wpf front end and a wcf wire for entities
160592
if you d be allowed to move to something java compatible yet has a syntax that s at least closer to perl than java check out groovy
160592
groovy is a dynamic language that compiles to java byte-code
160592
you can code in either java-ish class and functions or perl ruby s dynamic scripts .
160631
the reason is simple security cryptography in particular is very very complicated and pretty much impossible to get right
160631
i think you re confusing the roles of authentication and authorization a little which is easy to do.
160655
they ve got java .net perl ruby javascript php and python
160659
most of the file-based tools that we have vim emacs eclipse vs.net unix tools will have to be abandoned in favor of smalltalk s own tools
160676
i don t know much about csla but i have built application with wpf + linq + wcf this combination works well for one way databinding to wpf but we need to have an intermediate object class viewmodel for wpf to get the twoway working
160679
if you have a wide picture you want to set width to 100 and leave height
160679
if you have a long picture you want to set height to 100 and leave width
160717
here s a quick function that will adjust the height or width to 100 depending on which is bigger
160729
what you want to do is on page load walk through the dom and for every image or alterantively pass a function an image id if it s just a single image check if which attribute of the image is greater it s height or width
160729
once you got that then set the corresponding height width on the tag to 100 and the other to auto
160736
i don t believe it uses wcf but it certainly uses .net and has an sdk available that should allow you to create a p2p application with ease
160770
you need to calculate the ratio between the window width and height and the image width and height
160782
depends what language you re using but an ip address is usually stored as a 32-bit unsigned integer at least at the network layer making comparisons quite fast
160793
is there a place where i can upload my code and have it tested across a bunch of different systems like other linux flavors and things like solaris freebsd and other operating systems
160834
we have a couple of small subprojects in other languages java and ruby specifically as well as numerous python extensions that have to be compiled natively lxml mysql drivers etc
160834
that then does what zc.buildout virtualenv does copy symlink the python interpreter provide a clean space to install eggs then installs all required eggs including installing any native shared library dependencies installs the ruby project the java project etc
160841
there are bindings for c perl python php etc.
160876
i have a from what i can tell perfectly working linux setup ubuntu 8.04 where all tools nslookup curl wget firefox etc are able to resolve addresses
160881
so this is a question for anyone who has had to integrate the building compilation of legacy projects code in a team build msbuild environment - specifically visual basic 6 applications projects
160889
i was wondering if perl python can in some way do the same thing
160889
apart from perl or python can any language functional also do this
160913
it seems i can only adjust the height of the header cell but not the width
160935
finally the modulo version is guaranteed by the standard to work whether the integer is positive negative or zero regardless of the implementation s representation of signed integers

connect the scan lines together and you have converted your triangle into a long line
161121
once you get the 3 line segments converted into series of points you can put all points into a bucket and group all points by y
161127
we can fudge it by deliberately swallowing mouse and keyboard events but am i missing some fundamental property like setting isenabled to false without affecting its visual style that gives us what we want

processors do 1b things a second one if a frame is irrelevant pretty much the only relevant cpu operations are n 2 where n 100 and blowing your l2 cache and of course busy waiting for disk access

be aware that most of the options discussed in other answers are not standard on platforms that do not use the gnu utilities solaris aix hp-ux for instance
161182
tested the font-size with absolute measurements in firefox safari and ie6 so it should be pretty portable
161182
edit note that you may also need to play around with settings such as the letter-spacing property as well and experiment with what font you use since the font-size setting isn t really the width of the letters which will be different based on letter-spacing and font proportional to length
161193
for example do you use keyboard more than mouse
161222
i m considering switching back to a pure eclipse project with no ant and no maven involved
161227
a quick fix is to cast them to sorted tuples there could be a better solution but i cannot think of it now
161271
the closest that you can come is make the default constructor private and then provide a constructor that has parameters
161279
and if we look at the experience of people like the fpga designers we see that programming exclusively graphically just doesn t work - hence languages like verilog and vhdl
161292
one aspect of git has not been discussed when it has been brought to your attention in all these other answers git provides a cvs server emulation so that you might migrate to git svn to git is easy and well supported and later use a cvs server interface for accessing the repository in a centralized manner
161302
i would consider the lines of the triangle as single line which is cut into segments
161332
it aims to be totally compatible with .net so you d end up using c# and asp.net just the same
161343
serverxmlhttp is automatically following this redirect but this is causing an authentication failure as is not propagating the authorization header of the original request
161358
the important thing here is the difference between transient detached and persistent entities
161399
this works fine locally and on some developmentservers however when i put it live it stopped working because i don t get asp.foo_bar_aspx but _asp.foo_bar_aspx
161430
so i am wondering if maven 2 does the same thing if you are running ant task
161443
in kohana codeigniter i can have a url in this form
161445
in addition to jon skeet s comment make your account struct a class and override the equals and gethashcode method to get nice equality checking
161459
maven has the ability to run all your tests for you during the testing cycle of compilation this should stop the need for any ant tasks to run the tests
161459
however if you still need to have scripts for other tasks generation of code etc then be weary of maven s ability to generate code and not include it in the compiled binaries jar war though this may well be fixed for newer versions of maven
161491
the trick is to squirt the html into a dom element that is not currently attached to the document tree
161528
it gets x out of the condition clause scope of the while and puts it in a reference y which is available in the higher scope

i ve been reading skype4java java api for skype and noticed they use jni to access the skype client
161559
nowadays i prefer git over svn but it takes a while to get over the threshold if you come from cvs svn land
161564
the above three are the most likely causes especially if all fields are reset to their default initialized values
161568
although i tested not thouroughly on windows as i no longer use this system i m quite confident that all the major vcs svn git mercurial bazaar have proper windows-implementation now
161617
for completeness i think i m going to try one of the python implementations through jython to get it running in java and start replacing pieces as and when needed
161631
i suspect it s apache because i get the appropriate http 1.1 500 header at the top when i use webrick
161660
now set a breakpoint in the constructor and page load events and also any custom paint events that you may have in the form in the second instance and try to open the designer in the first instance the breakpoints should get hit and you should be able to see what s going on
161664
i just tried to run a test to compare a simple iteration the optimization i introduced and the reverse do while where the elements in an array was tested in every loop
161664
an array with 500 000 elements build outside the real test for every iteration the value of the specific array-element is revealed
161675
rather than lots of tests i simply add the squares of all three then subtract the square of the smallest one
161676
i m running zsh as the default shell on a ubuntu box and everything works fine using gnome-terminal which as far as i know emulates xterm
161678
if you take google for example i seem to remember that if you tend to systematically type your search term in and then click the search button with the mouse a message is displayed at the top of the search results that kindly hints to you that you can also just press enter
161680
for dom elements such as jquery and like frameworks give you a good method of iteration
161689
the status header is how rails php or whatever tells apache there was an error please return this code instead of 200 ok. the fact there is a blank line means something extra is going on and ruby is outputting a blank line before the error output for whatever reason
161717
if i create a function with jquery that adds an empty div performs some animation inside the blank space created by the div then removes the div the browser never makes room for the empty div height and width are set
161719
update this is nothing to do with your question but the example you posted does not call dispose on the disposable objects it uses
161733
they are as plug and play as a mouse keyboard or flash drive
161746
here is a table supporting sorting and filtering
161746
look at this example in the incubator which supports multi-column sorting and fixed header but unfortunately no filtering
161772
if you spread the parameters over multiple lines but have several on each line it makes it more difficult to find particular parameters when reading the code
161778
sql mysql mssql 2000 mssql 7 ingres interbase 6 oracle sybase
161812
this will give you the capability to write and debug any ajax work you do as well as provide you some documentation and access to other dynamic languages like php rails python as well as a basic html editor
161821
i am really comfortable with svn but for the current e-commerce project i am doing on django i decided to work on git i am using git in svn-mode that is with a centralised repo that i push to and pull from in order to collaborate with at least one other developer
161849
out or ref point calculatedvalue
161849
out or ref list calculatedvalues
161860
another way around this is to use 2 separate images e.g a gif and a transparent png and target your css accordingly
161873
tabs from line of input and to delete entirely blank lines
161935
by returning the line length you can eliminate blank lines by testing for non-zero length lines
161947
this will recursively add up the rendered height not just the styled height for each child element and any associated margin and padding and return an accurate figure for element height
161953
i d recommend trying or reading the documentation of at least mercurial git and bazaar
161985
you can make perl behave more like awk or fortran if you really want to
161994
assuming i have an open source web server or proxy i can enhance let s say apache or squid
162002
int main void
162014
with apache or squid you hardly can detect the time a user spends on your page
162034
by measuring the size of your browser window along with the scroll positions of the document they were able to determine exactly how long each element was on the screen
162083
there s openc ruby py60 python web programming and of course the various flavours of java
162107
first off the selenium ide is rather limited you should consider switching to selenium rc which can be driven by java or perl or ruby or some other languages
162108
but if you are concerned about portability of the application wfstream wchar_t is maybe not the best solution because there is no standard how wide wchar_t is on windows wchar_t is 16bit on many unix linux systems it is 32bit
162149
anybody has experience with hotmail yahoo web.de gmx.net and similar webmail companies blocking your emails because too many from the same source in a period of time have been sent to them
162154
example if i am here typing in this textarea i would like to be able to get the text same way if i were in the subject textbox in my outlook
162181
the result i expect is a dom object where the javascript that executes on-load is already executed
162181
also in some forums i ve seen instructions not to use the webkit interface for crawlers but directly the dom and javascript inner packages
162182
maybe it would be a good idea to look at pull media instead of push media for your application
162206
they come from awk but work differently in perl because it is not record-based
162211
oh and if you don t always hack just on php it s designed as a multi-language editor and rocks for ruby and python too
162225
i ve got an xml document containing news stories and the body element of a news story contains p tags amongst the plain text
162234
you can use an asp updatepanel and insert the gridview in there
162290
investigate jsf wicket struts 2 stripes - whichever one you use depends on your specific needs as they all have different strengths
162304
i ve been using remote desktop connection to get into a workstation but i m not able to use the shutdown restart function in the start menu while doing this
162305
shutdown -t xx where xx is number of seconds to wait till shutdown restart logoff
162311
whenever an object depends on another it will receive an instance of it only through its constructor no new keyword in your class
162315
by default yui manages the z-index of anything that extends yahoo.widget.overlay and uses an overlay panel
162319
you can also use other languages python ruby etc on the jvm for that matter
162319
for some of the java-only technologies investigate jsp servlets struts struts2 which is the updated version of webwork spring mvc tapestry web4j wicket

using where an aggregate when grouping by solved by using having
162458
on an aspx page this takes care of properly indenting all of your markup and ensures that everything is xhtml compliant adds quotes to attributes corrects capitalization closes self-closing tags
162497
edit i have solved this with a custom validation annotation which checks if the selected value is no selection
162534
so can you advice me how to deal with iprincipal and iidentity
162560
if asp.net is not an option i d go with php or ruby
162564
i need a way to update the month value on a datetime field in my db
162577
windows command lines differently from unix mac os x and gnu linux
162577
on windows the process receives the input text as is after the executeable name and space
162579
for example if they enter an invalid email address and move to the next field you can show an error message immediately
162587
theres a mathematical proof of this well this is a special case of a more general theorem
162601
perl allows you to break up large numbers into groups of three digits and still get a parsable integer out of it
162603
i would get a trustworthy developer off the floor and have them bring a laptop to the next interview and show a little of the code
162606
the sequence may be arbitrarily large so storing the array and using factoradic numbers is impractical
162628
we use fogbugz for our project management which keeps track of when things were committed to our svn repository by revision number
162663
a client comes in over http https with an xml payload
162664
on java the popular component frameworks are jsf a standard and wicket
162664
none of these frameworks directly address persistence but many have extension modules or idioms that work tightly with jpa ejb3 or hibernate
162667
just substitute the correct types iprincipal iidentity if needed
162777
you might assume c and c++ are being phased out and that java .net python whatever is an advance or the next stop
162793
the last version is based on gecko 1.7.12 and i believe gecko is currently up to 1.9.x used in firefox 3
162797
it must work in ie6 ie7 firefox for windows macosx linux and safari
162809
you may have to watch out if the end of the lines aren t padded out with spaces to fill the field your substring won t work without a bit of fiddling to work out how much more of the line there is to read
162842
before perl 5.10 perl didn t have a pretty print say like python
162864
you can use the xsd tool built into visual studio to create a datatable out of the xml data and it easily serializes back into the file when needed
162866
you should write 5 lines of simple code people can follow instead of one line they cannot understand
162874
the problem is that my custom jar is being excluded from the war file
162894
ruby python dynamic-c# .
162900
you can t have one property like that but you could create two properties which both manipulated the same underlying field - just like height width size in windows forms
162901
if you happen to be using gnu autotools or perl s makemaker systems i think this exists for you automatically
162904
it processes an entire project or a specific file and shows various unused dead code methods as well as suggesting visibility changes a public method that could be protected or private
162907
enter the keyboard mouse preference pane
162962
before even after i clicked on the close button the debugger was still running the stop button was not selected so it must have been because the thread was still active
162974
if you want to do dynamic storage allocation such as for a linked-list you must use pointers because they re the only way to grab memory from the heap
162991
once created those widgets will be integrated with swt swing or qtjambi framework
162991
i will probably choose swt swing or qtjambi for the ui controls but i am wondering what to do with the graphical part of the simulation
162996
pretty much any modern version control system will allow this subversion perforce vault git mercurial tfs etc.
163029
check out pdfbox or itext
163034
i would suggest using a maven proxy like archiva artifactory or nexus and defining your repo list on the server side
163034
the order matters only to the extent that the proxy server tries the proxied repos one by one and specifying a fringe repository as first will slow down the resolution of uncached artifacts artifactory allows you to specify whitelist and blacklist expressions for each proxied repo which solves this problem
163051
mysql lets you to have columns not included in grouping or aggregate in which case they ve got random values
163055
if you get 10 lines really quickly and you update the screen all at once you might save on some of the overhead of doing it line by line
163072
you can use an swt canvas or swing canvas or opengl canvas via jogl ... and set it up as an observer of your simulation and whenever the simulation state changes you can redraw the new state
163092
php equivalent of a ruby assignment idiom
163149
you could use a tool similar to fxcop to review code and general warnings or errors in a nant script
163185
haven t had time to get to my computer and clean up the code for posting but my current solution has been to use yahoo pipes to get my query results from google data as directly to the browser as json instead of xml through a server
163188
first do the division and the multiplication then subtract the result from the original number
163188
we could leave them out since the priority is higher for division and multiplication than of subtraction but this gives us more readable code
163201
it covers everything you ask about and is focused specifically on wpf silverlight
163232
especial since these comments relevancy is very short lived and they tend to build up littering the code base
163234
i like opendiff -- git also supports vimdiff gvimdiff kdiff3 tkdiff meld xxdiff emerge out of the box and you can install others git config merge.tool your.tool will set your chosen tool and then git mergetool after a failed merge will show you the diffs in context
163235
it s so tightly coupled to a standard von neumann cpu architecture that no standard library or runtime is required to implement most of its features pointers character strings automatic variables on the stack integer arithmetic etc
163254
on a 32-bit cpu an integer is 4 bytes and a short integer is 2 bytes
163254
if i am writing a c c++ application that uses many numeric values that will always fit within the provided range of a short integer is it more efficient to use 4 byte integers or 2 byte integers
163280
if you have more than 6 lines wihtout a blank line then that group is probably not a cohesive thought idea operation
163292
emma and eclemma will give you nice reports of what percentage of what classes are run for any given run of the code
163302
how do i get modrewrite to entirely ignore the vip directory so that all requests pass directly to the folder
163321
coalesce function same isnull function
163341
you can find out which one you are using a profiler that will measure both cpu and l2 misses like intel s vtune
163351
libraries for reading feeds typically read all the data in the feed but feeds typically only contain recent data - you need a source of data that includes older items not a better library for reading the data you have
163359
most rss feeds are only written to deliver a relatively short period of time - all items in a feed generally need you to have created your own archive over time
163365
now the way i most often see macros written is to enclose them in curly braces like this
163395
it s not perfect and it s most definitely a hack but i got it to work pretty well on winxp ie ff safari chrome and opera
163395
when you don t set a font mozilla uses monospace by default ie uses courier new opera courier new with quotes safari lucida grand with single quotes
163395
when you do set the font to monospace mozilla and ie take what you give them safari comes out as -webkit-monospace and opera stays with courier new
163416
the single line change has no impact on its surrounding lines
163417
any compiler worth its salt should be capable of inlining a small function as if it were a macro and an inline function will respect namespaces and other scopes as well as evaluating all the arguments once
163419
what we have settled on is using a top level category name to differentiate between broad categories operation relates to anything the user might care about internal relates to things only the developer will care about audit is used for tracking interesting events
163455
i second the http basic suggestion and can testify that it integrates fairly well with spring security which i implemented on top of a legacy application that rolled its own db-based authentication authorization logic
163460
there is no value that makes sense for that field
163460
an error has occurred causing the field to have a null value when it really shouldn t
163461
so yes if you need to allow for the possibility of a field not having any value at all then allowing nulls on the column is perfectly acceptable
163492
think of it like a tree where the nodes with no children are final outcomes and every branch between a node and it s parents or children is a state each one keyed differently
163492
so while there are only 8 leaves or final outcomes of the process there could be many states depending on how deep the logic goes down the tree before running out of children
163507
lines giving the problem specifically line 4 htxtbox.text ...
163518
don t know what the nant equivalent would be although you could run an msbuild script before your nant script that changed it
163523
if you don t use coalesce if any column contains a null value you get null returned
163524
is htxtbox.text a property that does any computation on a set that could be throwing the nullreferenceexception
163544
using malloc calloc or similar
163551
now when i try to refer to an image from the list directly before i get the name of the image put inside imagelocation
163615
if your table has a column perhaps even the rowid column that is numeric in the general sense like integer floating point or sql numeric please try the following
163620
so i changed strcpy to strncpy and it got rid of the garbage
163654
lgpl type code is ok but i can t use anything that is straight gpl
163659
you can install one of the following tools to use it instead meld opendiff kdiff3 tkdiff xxdiff tortoisemerge gvimdiff diffuse ecmerge p4merge araxis vimdiff emerge
163689
just loop through each of the arrays in that you ve created and create a new listviewitem object there is a constructor that takes an array of strings i believe
163707
in cvs i would just go to the attic to find it how do i find a file in svn without having to go back to a revision where it existed especially annoying since i have no idea really when i deleted -- one week ago two weeks ago...
163711
i ve read thrift files which can then be compiled down to language-specific interfaces for a wide variety of different programming platforms java php c c++ cocoa perl c# ruby etc. .
163722
as of writing this question 2008-10-02 jprofiler was at 5.1.4 and yourkit was 7.5
163726
browse the svn log of the directory it was in find the revision where you deleted it
163727
i use the maven-buildnumber-plugin to generate my version number for jar war ear packages
163730
you could write a script that checks the crc or md5 hash of each file from the source and target folders and only perform the overwrite if the file has changed
163737
i don t think there s an easy way to query for the most recent revision where a file existed but you should be able to find it easily enough using svn ls -r rev
163738
a set is a collection that contains no duplicate elements and whose elements are in no particular order.
163738
the class is based on the model of mathematical sets and provides high-performance set operations similar to accessing the keys of the or hashtable collections
163754
it is included in the standard emacs distribution and in emacs21-common or emacs22-common on ubuntu and debian at least
163762
you can update an individual element in a page where frames give you control of blocks that aren t even really in the same document
163765
if i wanted to publish the results as a doctoral thesis i would make a bigger deal about this and i would probably compare gcc tendra ten15 llvm watcom borland visual c++ digital mars icc and other compilers
163777
findcontrol might not be able to see the textbox - is it in a databound control listview formview etc.
163805
the constructor is private or protected so that it cannot be used just anywhere
163850
you may also want to debug the x y width height values of each of your components to make sure they re what you expect - something i find helpful with doing layout is to draw the layout on paper and start writing sizes and coordinates so that i can see that my calculations are right
163962
for the next project i am considering to switch from std string to std wstring for unicode support
163998
is there any built-in functionality for classical set operations on the java.util.collection class
163998
in the event that nobody knows of any built-in functionality perhaps we could use this as a repository for standard practice java set operation code
164002
i expect fread to read 30 000 bytes and the file position to be 30054 when eof is reached
164004
you will undoubtedly hear about git and cvs as well and there are good reasons to look at them
164047
csv - csv2xml - xslt - xml
164072
a reference to bz1722 vs fb3101 would tell you what tracking tool to check bugzilla or fogbugz for example
164073
i know with myisam tables you can get the table def update time but thats not so true with innodb and i ve found its not even reliable to look at the .frm file for an idea of when the definition might have been modified..
164081
if reverse dns is your issue this will resolve remember to restart nscd daemon - etc init.d nscd restart so that the change will take effect.
164117
you could set up an odbc data source for the fixed format file and then access it as any other database table
164136
one point that people sometimes seem to forget is that callers should be able to set properties in any order
164147
there are methods to create extend and compare ranges so it would be possible to write an algorithm to calculate the character offset but i feel i must be missing something
164182
i use unsigned long int for my timer counters 32-bit since that is the native sized integer on my hardware platform and that gives me elapsed times from 1 ms to about 49.7 days
164197
slight margin variations can be adjusted by adjusting the margins on the page setup dialog but the harder problem is that the inter-label spacing can be off by a tiny fraction of an inch so that if the first label is pretty well centered by the end of the page the label text and images have crawled off the top or bottom of the labels
164198
std wstring is a good choice for holding unicode strings on windows but not on most other platforms and ceirtanly not for a portable code
164224
and i put 7 rows with score 23 to get a large number of decimal places and then changed one row with score 43 to generate a second number with a large number of decimal places
164245
one reason for building stack-based vms is that that actual vm opcodes can be smaller and simpler no need to encode decode operands
164293
in addition the tcptimedwaitdelay is usually set to 240 seconds so any sockets that are used cannot be reused for four minutes
164296
we ll discuss what all this crap at the top of the file is for later but for now concentrate on the lines between int main void and the return statement which is where all the useful work is accomplished
164329
group by lets you use aggregate functions like avg max min sum and count
164368
i ve used yourkit and it is a very nice profiler the best i ve ever used in java i ve used a variety of others over the years
164388
my advice is to find a project that s small enough to not be completely burdened by legacy code and select a methodology you believe will help clean your system and just do it
164400
i will try the login with sql authentication
164407
intellij seems to switch their recommendation back and forth between yourkit and jprofiler so i would guess their feature sets are similar
164414
edit i ll write the program that uses this regex i don t know yet if in python or php i m doing this thing first to learn some regex there are different types of line i wanted to use regex to select the type i m interested in
164416
you can add public members are run time with no additional code and can affect protected private members using the magical overloading methods __get __set
164417
you can actually go into the microsoft.csharp.targets or microsoft.visualbasic.targets file located in the framework directory usually c windows microsoft.net framework v3.5 and modify the csc or vbc task parameters to include additional reference dependencies
164423
an object passed to the stl could definitely raise an exception copy constructor but that would be an issue regardless of the use of stl
164437
i ve used both jprofiler 4 and yourkit 7.5 and yourkit wins hands down
164437
it s so much less invasive than jprofile in that i ll happy run production servers with the yourkit agent installed which i would never do with jprofiler
164443
linux unix were ascii based so it just made makes sense
164460
if it makes any difference it looks like flashplayer is a gtk application and i have python with pygtk installed
164500
use const when you have a variable of a type you can know at runtime string literal int double enums ... that you want all instances or consumers of a class to have access to where the value should not change
164509
i am a c++ and java developer and had never touched perl until my current job
164542
if you are using firebug and need to support ie safari or opera as well firebug lite adds console.log support to these browsers
164553
note that a type s properties should be able to be set and retrieved in any order
164566
i could see these being potential enhancements to the extension but for now i can work around them with a bash zsh shell function in my starup file
164595
of course if you re writing both the producer and consumer of the rss and your goal is that the feed always contains the full set of assigned tasks just updating the pubdate will work just fine
164597
i recursively set permissions on the server directory to richard developers using sudo chown -r richard developers server
164652
there are more things can go wrong other than divide by zero like integer x y is too big or x is nan
164652
exception is for exceptional case and divide by zero or nan are definitely exceptional cases
164670
if the users work in a directory with the setgid attribute set then any files created in the directory by any of the users will have the permission of the group
164672
they have strictly defined lengths for byte short int long and single double precision floats equal on every system
164683
persistence ignorance poco adapter for entity framework v1
164691
the endless getters and setters that java requires aren t as often used in python
164691
python introspection is more flexible you have access to an object s internal dictionary of attribute values and you have first class functions like getattr and setattr
164719
there are lots of tools for creating installers on windows installshield innosetup nsis just to name a few
164724
every try needs to record a lot of information stack pointers values of cpu register etc
164752
the two functional states of show and hide along with the meta data of publish draft and archive are intermixed in the same column of status
164774
it will also have extremely low-level operations more similar to java s than the medium-level ops of perl and python and the like
164798
sun studio includes a full ide plus a very high performance compiler and is available for red hat or centos and suse linux platforms as well as solaris
164819
at the point that you decide your business logic needs additional data to make the decision whether to show or hide an article perhaps an isapproved flag then you can store that data
164830
assuming that contains a sequence of document nodes that you want to scan you want to create one line for each element that appears in the documents
164830
average minimum and maximum can be calculated with the avg min and max functions
164830
java -jar path to saxon.jar -it main -o report.txt dir file path to your directory
164848
once you ve sorted the set into the 3 buckets then i would select two images from the same bucket and go with the which is nicer
164854
in my experience you need to put your link inside a onrelease handler or mouseevent.click in as3 for it to not get blocked
164865
if you have sugestions on a more efficient awk script then i would be glad to hear those too but my main focus is the perl script
164865
the awk pipes foo bar.com|reason for bounce to the perl script
164892
that said if you re going to pipe it into perl why bother with the grep and awk in the first place
164893
why not forgo the grep and awk and go straight to perl
164899
when someone gives a positive comparison increment the count when someone gives a negative comparison decrement the count
164909
this will generate more than two entries in list if you have extra pipe symbols in the tail of the line
164962
an option if you re stuck on windows is to have virtual servers running linux bsd what-have-you
164990
should i simply reference the dll in the build artifacts directory or should i implement another nant task that copies these to a thirdparty libs folder
165000
if files don t exist in the source directory the variable has the drive dir
165025
maybe i need to add some styling or something to strip out padding or margins
165093
labview and simulink are two graphical programming environments
165167
if you can t get away from windows use vmware and run some form of linux ubuntu is popular
165170
i want to display dates in the format short day of week short month day of month without leading zero but including th st nd or rd suffix
165174
i really enjoy kate part of kde
165174
on a project with make or scons or bjam or something else set up very easy to write a short bjam file for your project you can just issue the build command directly
165188
this needs to be portable to both linux and solaris
165188
on linux we use ju but there does not appear to be any equivalent on solaris
165209
i get the impression swing swt seem to more like winforms
165238
where pri is for the printf family scn is for the scanf family d and i for signed integral types
165238
o u x x are for unsigned integral types as octal decimal hex and hex
165262
you can draw a cgimage into a uiview using it s drawrect method
165284
i have a flowlayout panel and on a resize event i resize all the controls inside the flowlayout panel so they fit the width of the flowlayoutpanel - padding - scroll bar width
165291
and hide show it using the steps above
165310
that actually sounds like a bug in the browser -- you could file at if it s in safari or for firefox
165331
i set the remember me property to true but it doesnt seem to triger any events where i could read the cookie and auto login the user
165342
the issue is that i can t find any way to attempt to validate credentials without doing something querying wmi with impersonation which isn t useful as the account may or may not have the ability to connect via wmi in the first place
165349
in that login page you tell forms authentication to create the authentication ticket for you once you authenticate them
165349
the point is once authenticated asp.net will only redirect the user to the login page if the authentication ticket has expired and the user is on a protected page
165351
either an sta or the mta that thread

a probably-oversimplified version is that com objects tagged as sta must be run on an stathread and com objects marked mta must be run on an mta thread

how do i retrieve a listboxitem from a listbox that s displaying grouped items
165425
in other words it doesn t matter what methodology is being used - scrum xp agile rational waterfall home-grown or whatever - if the project is properly planned and executed then you should already know what everyone is doing because it was planned in advance
165426
the reason i ask is that netmsmqbinding was really created to support the scenario in which both the sending and receiving endpoints are both wcf applications so at that point you might as well just stick any out-of-band data you need in the message headers.
165448
if you are only changing a couple of variables and you know ahead of time which variables are going to be defined in the include declare them as global in the doinclude function
165575
another example which may be more meaningful is that i need to call some method when a setter or getter is used
165578
or you could make it possible to have a persistent entity have many nodes in a category tree
165581
if you add your own getter setter logic the compiler will use your code instead of its auto-generated code but as far as the users of that property are concerned nothing has changed
165588
when using automatic properties you don t get direct access to the underlying backing variable and you don t get access to the actual logic that gets implemented in the property getter and setter
165588
you would then implement the appropriate logic in the getter setter
165611
the webkit web inspector also supports firebug s console api just a minor addition to dan s answer
165641
if you could call a function that returns a number indicating what cpu the thread is running on without using affinity the answer would often be wrong as soon as the function returned
165659
if no implicit transactions has been set then each iteration in your loop committed the changes
165659
it is possible for any sql server to be set with implicit transactions
165659
either way if this was the case you would still need to execute an explicit commit rollback regardless of interruption of the query execution

i ve inherited this really weird codebase where they ve built an external web service over a bunch of internal web services just to add authentication authorization using ws-security ws-encryption et al
165748
which will show mybox hide the specified children and then blink the box
165760
in c++ an object is not constructed until its constructor completes
165764
in c++ controlled lifetime is achieved by stack variables or smart pointers

i need something like this a collection of elements which contains no duplicates of any element
165783
it seems pretty common to want to let your javascript know a particular dom node corresponds to a record in the database
165817
question and i m not interested in text editors no matter how awesome they may be and i don t consider either vim or emacs to be an ide so.
165843
most people in .net land use nant or msbuild scripts to have automated builds that they can later hook up to their ci server
165846
some of the other questions and answers here on so extol the virtues of using an enterprise repository tool like archiva artifactory or nexus
165896
python does not need to define accessors right from the beginning since converting attributes into properties is quick and painless
165916
authentication means that an identity is known and is distinct from authorization which determines what that identity is allowed to do
165923
they require always an explicit commit rollback
165938
the thing is i have a build script which calls a lot of other scripts and i would like to see what is the order in which they are called so that i may know where exactly i have to go about and add my modifications
165943
also if you put a date t and time t in the beginning and in the end of that batch file you will get the times it was at that point and you can map your script running time and order
165951
i was kind of sure that there was an easy way to do this - a generic service wrapper that can be configured with a log file for stdout and stderr
165957
the post is centered around writing a dsl for runtime expression evaluation but the tools are all the same
165958
it combines a software stack with a code generation engine to build services that work efficiently and seamlessly between c++ java python php ruby erlang perl haskell c# cocoa smalltalk and ocaml
165958
it can work over tcp sockets and the serialization deserialization is already built-in
165972
when you got that running you can use the process class to start the application and configure it so that you can handle stdout stderr yourself processstartinfo is your friend
166046
time complexity is o n 2 space complexity has an overhead of copy of n log n bits an iteration variable log n bits keeping track of n-i log n bits copy of current value log n bits copy of p n log n bits creation of next value log n bits and a bit set of used values n bits
166048
however java knows only a few primitive types among them int double boolean and char along with enums which behave in this manner
166062
among other uses it is the foundation on which cocoa bindings are built. if you care about a change in state that isn t represented by a property then notifications are more appropriate
166101
the fact that you cannot change the key of an entry can of course be rectified by simply replacing the entire entry by a new instance of keyvaluepair
166113
if i want to call bar instead of foo does bar return me a copy additional overhead of what foo returns or it returns the same object which foo places on the temporary stack
166135
maybe this is a good time to learn python ruby perl windows script host

the app is currently written in vb6 and while its going to go to vb.net c# in the future i need to find a way to pick up vb6 now

i ve learned a lot by looking at a specific subject like the fat driver implementation and filesystems abstraction
166158
according to wikipedia xmlhttprequest first appeared in internet explorer 5 as an activex object but has since been made into a standard and has been included for use in javascript in the mozilla family since 1.0 apple safari 1.2 opera 8.0 and ie 7.0
166158
the open method on the object takes the http method as an argument - and is specified as taking any valid http method see the item number 5 of the link - including get post head put and delete as specified by rfc 2616
166158
as a side note ie 7 8 only permit the following http methods get post head put delete move propfind proppatch mkcol copy lock unlock and options
166159
might have been the rowcount count property for which i read this. the difference is one of them disregards datarow.rowstate and the other respects uses it
166160
how can i scale the content of an iframe in my example it is an html page and is not a popup in a page of my web site
166190
using datatable.clear will fail if there are any constraints applied that would be violated but using datatable.reset will get rid of anything and everything that has been put in place since the datatable was created
166194
folk should be aware that the set function max min count etc can be omitted so that they can understand the coder s intent when it is
166196
i know you said you don t care about how secure it is but if you chose des you might as well take aes it is the more up-to-date encryption method
166197
you could look at java s velocity or python s mako to generate source for your assertion condition
166213
it s a c++ example but you can surely translate to python easily
166218
in progamming there s something to be said for case sensitivity for instance having a public property foo and a corresponding private protected field foo
166231
can anyone give a nice example with a button and a text widget
166231
when the button is pressed should a shell command be executed and the output piped to the text widget
166269
the nice thing is if you implement your restful resources using jax-rs then the jersey client can reuse the entity providers such as for jaxb xml json atom and so forth - so you can reuse the same objects on the server side as you use on the client side unit test
166284
php plain fails but you can use perl or apache modifications to get around it
166307
look at the three different numbering schemes for sunos solaris or the two numbering schemes for java
166334
currently i m deploying the packages with capistrano installing the packages into a virtualenv with bash and configuring the servers with puppet but i would like to go for a more python based solution
166336
apart from the multiple- single-namespace issue and guaranteed tail-call elimination which some cl implementations support as well depending on the compiler settings there isn t much that makes scheme as a language more suited to functional programming than common lisp and still most lispers wouldn t call cl a functional language
166336
likewise scheme is very much an imperative language as compared to haskell
166337
public surface visible from an external assembly public protected and internal protected
166360
and here i noticed that just int matrix is not good if i occasionally want to use it with decimal or double
166452
when i checked the msdn page of system.io.file class in the sample code ms is using streamreader streamwriter for file operations
166501
however get post put and delete are supported by the implementations of xmlhttprequest ajax calls in all the major web browsers ie firefox safari chrome opera
166512
actually there is also a linux version of wtk from sun and i am using it every day on ubuntu
166522
in other words for an editor which you intend to remain usable when editing gigabyte size files you want some design with streamreader streamwriter and seeking so you load only the part of the file that is visible
166522
they just use the same streamreader writer pattern internally as you d code by hand anyway as aku shows
166534
you may wish to use ceil or round instead of floor
166536
clarification if you are doing a readall followed by a string.split r to get an array of all the lines in the file and the using a for loop to process each line that s code which will generally result in worse performance than reading the file line by line and performing your process on each line
166562
1 i like a statusline with the filename ascii value decimal hex value and the standard lines cols and
166572
scene nodes might need to be organized in a hierarchy this one can be easy - just add parent children pointers to the node
166572
before any node is rendered matrices would need to be set
166600
which is based on the iso 8601 whereas java date is based on the rfc 822 standard
166626
if you tend to develop in classes and objects with vb you probably will find python c# or java are good alternatives
166664
the biz objects have a private constructor to force the use of factory methods and an internal constructor which looks like this
166673
the size method from std vector should be inlined by the compiler meaning that every call to size is replaced by its actual body see the question why should i ever use inline code for more information about inlining
166684
another thing to watch for is pasting multiline text you will have to choose whether to just paste the first line or all lines adding the prompt on all lines after the first
166693
then you can translate it into visio or dia or a uml tool that generates both the sql schema and your object model.
166703
wxwidgets - open source gui library can use c++ or python wxpython
166729
so c# and .net are really too narrow here the clr is a cool piece of technology but could they please release it for linux host so that it would be as prevalent as say the jvm python erlang or any other portable language
166750
let s say a particular table has a name field for which no two rows will be allowed to have the same value
166754
if you are a linux beginner i would start with ubuntu linux server
166754
i installed mono on a gentoo server a couple of weeks ago just to find out that it can t run precompiled asp.net sites you be warned linux ain t made for .net
166760
but also works great on ubuntu and ubuntu seems to appeal more to linux newcomers
166766
sealed won t work because it s abstract for a reason other classes in that assembly do inherit from it
166767
the other answers here mix volatile and synchronization and it is clear from some other answers than this that volatile is not a sync primitive credit where credit is due
166768
i m using sifr in a page that s being popped up in a nyromodal lightbox but when the page is displayed the sifr objects aren t being shown
166787
of course if you stop using var then you get around the whole problem and your code becomes more readable ok thats subjective but for something like this it s more readable by other people
166793
scalability isn t a big problem for us but reliability and availability is
166817
i got introduced to dramatis at oscon 2008 it is an agent based framework for ruby and python
166843
this is a vb6 access app that i inherited and am currently re-writing in vb.net and sql server
166865
despite the title hardcore visual basic is the best and the fastest way to learn vb6 if you are coming from another programming language
166874
use reflection to load and examine these assemblies at runtime and present the user with functions
166883
additionally not all of the types of the properties may be serializable in which case you need to go further by manually writing serialization routines for those types and possibly those type s properties
166897
i ve tried using but that seems to be applied on the value from the inputtext that is sent to the server and not on the initial value in the input field
166918
it can also interface with the zend platform if you have that for online profiling and debugging
166933
if your structure grows dynamically and constant-time access to any element isn t required such as dynamic stacks and queues linked lists are a good choice
166944
i don t want to go through the minor trouble of installing mod_python or mod_wsgi on my mac so i was just going to do a system or popen from php to call the python script
166945
i m developing a pos application that is used in about 200 locations as of right now using .net 2.0 wcf and syncfusion components for the gui
166945
the computer at that location has a slightly different hardware setup including a splitter on the lpt out that is meant to be used for both printing to the pos printer and displaying the output on a video monitor
166954
it would need to be a subclass that implements all abstract methods
167004
any nmake gurus out there that can set me straight
167007
how do i make next annotation then show tooltip description a macro bound to a single keystroke
167018
i like that it tends to use my cpu to its fullest 2 cores and would theoretically scale to any number of processors available
167035
just check to see if the output of p4 sync -n contains any informaiton
167042
i tend to use it with team coverage which lets me see the coverage directly in the editor even though the tests are nunit not mstest based
167043
this will allow entry to be right-justified and at least in firefox 3 ie 7 and safari will even appear to flow from the right
167049
our rebex file transfer pack includes both sftp and ftp ssl
167075
you could come up with some way to serialize your structure whether with xml yaml json etc
167129
or could i do this in just the first var assignment append each result to the previous
167159
this question looks close to what i m looking for but i need an os x linux unix solution
167200
use popen if you want to write data to the python script s standard input or read data from the python script s standard output in php
167232
is there a way to configure a visual studio 2005 web deployment project to install an application into a named application pool rather than the default app pool for a given web site
167247
how do i stop a function procedure in a superclass from been overridden in a subclass in delphi 2007
167249
this is just a shot in the dark but if the function is manipulating the height css property of your element s according to this site you have to separate the padding and display none in your css to keep it from jumping
167254
i have a table that an external program updates very often and clients can watch for this new data as it arrive how can i make that without having to set a fixed period of repeatable select statements
167262
if i have to do it with python ruby i know where to go django or rails but if i want to make a web application in clojure not because i m forced to live in a java world but because i like the language and i want to give it a try what libraries and frameworks should i use
167276
i ve got some triggers set up for the table insert delete update and those triggers increment a counter in another table
167278
slightly longer answer the usual shells sh ksh csh tcsh bash do not have any hooks for you to hang actions on ok so bash2 has context sensitive tab-completion
167284
a profile element contains both an optional activation a profile trigger and the set of changes to be made to the pom if that profile has been activated
167288
you could try resetting the margins padding and borders to see if that helps
167341
valgrind --tool memcheck --leak-check full . a.out
167367
which locks all the rows returned by the select until either a commit or rollback are issued
167367
mysql innodb and oracle are two databases that support this
167413
we are migrationg from cvs to svn and embracing some kind of revision management in order to enforce order to development testing release cycle
167423
databases are typically pull sources and not push so you ll still need to programmatically probe for changes no matter what
167434
but even then it s most likely you would be using plain stl containers and not boost
167435
as kaboing mentioned maxdop n actually controls the number of cpu cores that are being used in the query processor
167439
in a normal bash shell pressing shift-3 types a as expected
167471
if this is the best way is there any way around having to set each parameter twice in jdbc
167484
subversion makes it easier to branch than cvs in git branches are even cheaper
167498
that doesn t mean i comment every line of code but method class etc summaries are mandatory and additional lines for difficult code parts are helping too
167539
value is the integere value you want to add or subtract if you provide a negative number

search boss - the first looks more like an aggregator meaning i d need a different registration for each feed and the second should give more access to yahoo s data but i can find no mention of feeds
167577
thanks to lou franco bloglines sync api - besides the problem of needing an account and being designed more as an aggregator it does not have a way to add feeds to the account
167582
you are right in that 3.5 runs on the 2.0 clr but 3.5 contains libraries and if you have used any of those you re out of luck unless you install 3.5 on that server
167605
it sounds like there shouldn t be any issues with doing this but rick wasn t clear on why the default is set that way
167628
we are managing our development with subversion over https bugzilla and mediawiki
167628
for both the wiki and bugzilla we would need to either migrate the existing data into trac or a way to integrate with trac
167630
you can construct the ssis packages so they pick up all of their configuration from an xml file and the location can be supplied exernally in an environment variable
167681
for bugzilla trac has a script bugzilla2trac.py that will automate the process of importing bugzilla bugs to trac tickets for you
167730
i have no good reason other then imoho are difficult to get to do what you want - if what you want if something other than a docking toolbar
167735
most generators i have seen so far assume you set seed once and then generate a long sequence of numbers
167764
seems like you re asking for a hash-function rather than a prng
167791
as a programmer i found it very hard to use my laptop and workstation with two different input devices can anyone suggest a good solution to use single mouse and keyboard to control my two machines
167793
synergy lets you easily share a single mouse and keyboard between
167793
redirecting the mouse and keyboard is
167810
there s no direct idiomatic way to repeat strings in c++ equivalent to the operator in python or the x operator in perl
167811
synergy is great but also give something like vnc a try it consolidates not only the keyboard and mouse but also the screen
167813
what you want is a small gadget called a kvm switch keyboard video and mouse switch
167841
a page refresh would not affect your ajax call but when the button is outside the panel it s doing a regular postback so you would be sending the add request again
167871
the next release of eclipse should be based on cocoa rather than carbon which is the current but that won t be until next june
167871
i can start with a download and get a fully-functional jdt cdt mylyn environment up and running within five minutes of installation assuming a reliable internet connection
167878
what you would need to do is merge the feeds together before handing the resulting feed to google maps
167894
if registration is required in order to interact with the site ie add comments posts etc then chances are most people would rather create their own account than use one that has been made public
167922
usb interfaces will also get put to sleep randomly
167922
the net effect of this was that it was very difficult to get two machines to boot up and work on the kvm switch and the switch would lose keyboard or mouse input on one or both machines every few days
167922
these have two dvi inputs and i used one of my older belkin ps 2 switches to switch the keyboard and mouse
167922
the keyboard and mouse are switched off the kvm switch
167923
needs to find patterns write the first line which matches and then add a summary message for remaining consecutive lines which match pattern and return modified string
167983
i used xslt to sort elements and attributes because sometimes they would appear in a different order and i didn t care about that and filter out attributes i didn t want to compare and then either used the xml diff or xml semanticdiff perl module or pretty printed each document with every element and attribute on a separate line and using unix command line diff on the results
168002
i m not fluent enough in php to give an answer in that but here s a perl solution
168012
for example mysql and oracle allow multiple nulls in a unique column or set of columns because null is not a value and cannot be considered unique null
168046
sometimes the executable has been compiled for solaris sometimes as a 32bit linux application sometimes its a 64bit linux application
168056
many libraries use cglib bcel javasist or janino to generate bytecode for new classes at runtime and then load them from controlled classloader
168056
you can catch these with a decent profiler i use yourkit - search for multiple classloader instances with the same retained size
168060
7.2 6 for an enumeration where e min is the smallest enumerator and e max is the largest the values of the enumeration are the values of the underlying type in the range b min to b max where b min and b max are respectively the smallest and largest values of the smallest bitfield that can store e min and e max
168060
defines an enumerated type where e min is 1 and e max is 4
168086
use strtotime to convert the all dates to a timestamp before you add them to the array then you can sort the array into ascending also chronological order
168114
not required but very helpful some method of communicating when all traffic except http or https is blocked
168129
update plt scheme is now called racket
168186
these are configuration options that are provided to the extconf.rb ruby file during the installation of the gem
168208
now you can change the property s implementation maybe fetching the value from a database instead of storing it in a field
168225
uname -s gives you the kernel name eg linux sunos
168232
xsd cxx xml initialize void
168232
initialize xml cxx xsd yaxxz
168282
you will probably have to wrap accesses to the map in another mutex in order to ensure that no other thread is inserting at the same time and remember to perform the check again after the mutex is locked to ensure that another thread didn t add the key while waiting on the mutex
168283
i know that some people swear against using a language-specific ide ever vim emacs or die
168284
you didn t mention which rdmbs you re using if the information schema views are available in your rdbms and if you can reference both schemas from the same host you can query the information schema views to identify differences in

any ideas for getting the smartclient app to recognize the shutdown restart event from windows and gracefully kill itself
168355
as a programmer working in c++ and especially in c is good experience for helping you understand something just a tad closer to the machine than say .net java or a scripting language like vbscript python perl etc
168358
this version uses doubled quotes to escape -- hence a a b generates a field value a b which ain t perfect but could be fixed afterwards easily enough
168361
it has a great python binding too so you can easily prototype in python and when if you need extra performance porting to c++ is a mostly 1 1 translation
168366
i have a form that submits just fine in firefox safari chrome - but does absolutely nothing in ie or opera
168366
if i attach an onclick handler to the submit button i can see that the button is being clicked - but if i attach an onsubmit handler to the form i get nothing
168366
if i make the button onclick handler submit the form through javascript it works fine - it s just the direct submission that s not working
168366
so ie and opera were ignoring the nested form correctly i assume but firefox et al were being more forgiving and allowing the form to submit
168371
i use notepad++ or vim for anything in the lamp stack - i ve never found anything particularly useful in the ides for those technologies unless you could the mysql client tools as an ide which i use when i am able to
168371
i work in php in the lamp stack so i don t have to handle bunches of external libraries the way i probably would if i was using perl and the projects i develop on lamp are usually simpler than my windows development
168413
you still have to use a windowing framework specific to the os you run on mfc win32 motif gtk qt etc.
168431
but if you keep in mind that you probably had a reason for wanting to go to the definition the ctrl -click workflow saves you an instance of moving between the keyboard and mouse
168434
if what you are trying to do is make the value of the input text field change on screen to correct user input you should probably look into using one of the jsf ajax frameworks like rich faces
168463
what about the stl or boost data structures specifically pointer containter doesn t work for you
168477
max and min inclusive exclusive limit the range of the numbers
168480
i also use cygwin s bash in 3 shell windows for executing ant tasks searching etc
168485
php perl javascript bash or most other languages notepad++ on windows scite on linux
168509
can you not have a root container class that contains elements
168522
i m not certain i ve understood the problem but i think you re asking to insert a value in the field that is drawn from a different table based on some runtime information such as the user name
168524
you cannot add a new interface for int or double
168539
vba which is really a dialect of vb6 is slow for these kind of applications
168539
this has an example of how to do what you want zipping using windows built-in zip capabilities from vb.net it shouldn t be much different from vba or vb6
168539
this one has a sample application on vb6 using windows built-in capabilities to zip in zip rather than gzip format of course using windows xp compressed folder shell extension to work with .zip files
168542
one thing i would like to see is the ability to create named types with simple declarations which would generate the properties and constructor in the same way as for anonymous types as well as overriding equals gethashcode tostring in the same useful way
168575
ultimately once the data is downloaded it is passed to javascript which displays in on the page using the html dom
168583
this method can now take any child of container that contains any class implementing icomparable so it would be extremely flexible
168603
how about just redirecting the output of find into a file since all you re wanting to do is cat all the files into one large file
168608
it describes the concurrency and control runtime from microsoft s robotics studio which allows you to apply all sorts of rules on a set of asynchronous events for example you can wait for any number of them to complete cancel if one event fails etc
168611
glib is the underlying platform independence library that gnome via gtk uses
168611
here s the function that prints the stack trace written for an environment that uses the gnu toolchain gcc
168628
another thing to consider - getting your data in json format will be faster than xml and web services
168628
json becomes a javascript object pretty quickly and doesn t have to be parsed like xml does

on linux you have several choices gtk-based gnome company qt-based kde company if you re a sucker for punishment you can go for pure x and then you are more-or-less in for an interesting time both gnome and kde have ide s you can use
168662
regex uses the backslash character to escape a literal
168676
now i need to start using listeners and observers to handle messages between the views and the controller
168676
update arguabley it shouldn t matter much but i m using swt not swing
168678
there s also a php extension pip - python in php which i ve never tried but had it bookmarked for just such an occasion
168710
the login registration change password and edit profile forms all were bound to this class
168720
our team is looking to switch from using mbunit to mstest but there appears to be some disconnect between the two
168720
does anyone know how to simulate the combinatorialtest and factory attributes from mbunit when using mstest
168752
assuming that doesn t result in too many files for the shell to handle these will all be passed as arguments to cat and the output will be written to out.txt
168827
i m not very experienced at using asp.net but i ve used built in membership providers for simple webforms application and i found them pita when trying to extend the way they work add remove few fields and redo controls accordingly
168845
btw change all getter and setter methods into properties...no need to have the c# library function just the same as the java library unless you are going for perfect interface compatibility
168875
n a is used for when there can t be a value as the field property does not apply in the context of the data item
168875
usually when the field property applies in the context of the data item but it does not have a value people either leave it blank
168878
if you get a string from the client you should look it up in the business layer using the service layer and put the id of the found object in the vo
168887
wcf integrates web services .net remoting distributed transactions and message queuing into a common communications model
168896
if you have an encryption key you could also consider running the text through des or aes or similar
168907
writing a script ruby or perl might be a good candidate to do the conversion for you - at least the monotonous stuff
168914
that s why java has treemap in addition to treeset treelist arraylist and linkedlist implementations of a list.
168914
however for some reason the java implementation of treeset is quite a bit slower than using an arraylist and a sort
168991
i cannot add an order by clause to a view because of sql standards as referred to in this wikipedia entry
168996
here s a sample that will print the location of every mouse click
169007
the select shows a 2px border 0 padding and a width of 996px and height of 18px
169007
the input shows a 2px border 1px 0 padding and a width of 1000px and height of 16px
169016
create an interface that you use for reading config and have an implementation of that interface get passed in as a constructor parameter or set on the object as a property as you would using dependency injection inversion of control
169016
in the production environment pass in an implementation that really reads from configuration
169044
my development environment is running in jdk1.6 and i need to compile some classes so they are compatible with a client running jdk1.5
169059
i first created a simple solution one that tracks the min max for the previous n entries using a circular buffer and a test harness to measure the speed
169059
in the simple solution each data value is compared against the set of min max values so that s about window_size count tests where window size in the original question is 1000 and count is 3600000
169059
first off i created a solution that used a fifo queue to store window_size values and a linked list to store the values in ascending order where each node in the linked list was also a node in the queue
169059
to process a data value the item at the end of the fifo was removed from the linked list and the queue
169059
the min and max values could then be read from the start and end of the linked list
169078
since silverlight can handle json and xml based services the format of the response is totally irrelevant
169078
3 silverlight has linq to xml and linq to json which makes parsing both pox and json a breeze
169083
instead of testing the width see if the height of the element is more than one line measured in ems since you ll be changing the font size around
169094
i ve always held onto the belief that a classic waterfall or hybrid waterfall iterative prototyping is the best approach for medium to large projects
169107
sql 2005 s management studio may handle the objects as well but the database is in an environment where there is no way for me to connect an installation of management studio to it
169113
to obtain this sort of information we override new delete and malloc free providing our own heap implementations that store stacktraces on allocation and produce a report when the heap is destroyed as well as adding sentinels to detect buffer overruns
169131
making daily scrums too large of a process -- not sticking to a certain time limit we prefer 15 min max
169170
the scenario is for both udp and tcp
169234
mono can be run on linux bsd unix mac os x solaris and windows operating systems
169245
in java there is this.foo in python there is self.foo and other languages have similar things so i don t see a need for naming something in a special way when i can already use a language construct
169271
don t get distracted by phones co-workers lunch etc when in the middle of updates or you ll find everyone else is locked up until you commit or rollback
169278
how do i get modrewrite to entirely ignore the vip directory so that all requests pass directly to the folder
169303
i could run each function in its own virtual machine using some sort of os virtualization software like vmware or xen or something
169314
it can also use this information to implicitly add a dependency between the projects so it builds then in the right order
169324
well obviously there s the classic make make gmake nmake utilities there s also i think some build systems written in ruby or maybe python
169329
all modules need to be separate unit of deployments ideally a war or jar file
169353
probably somewhere in your render method you show or hide dropdown control based on the property value
169397
i converted from ant to maven 2 and have not looked back since
169397
ant and maven 2 different ways of building.with ant you are giving instructions on how to build things
169397
if you have an existing ant build xml you can take a first step in refactoring you build by wrapping that in an maven 2 pom.xml
169401
you are writing sql instead of using a mapping technology nhibernate linq to sql ef subsonic llblgenpro etc.
169405
ant and maven are definitely the two standards
169405
if you re already familiar with ant and want the dependency management that comes with maven you might take a look at ivy
169405
one thing both ant and maven lack is true control structures in your build scripts
169420
or by putting matching code in the setter getter and use a custom list implementation
169459
should i lock the table and in the lock make sure that the name doesn t exist or should i rely on the server giving an error to one of the processes that try to insert a value that already exists in the unique indexed field
169495
long answer to my knowledge unlike postgresql mysql ms-sql there is no native driver to connect php to sql server compact edition
169501
the grid is going to be roughly 100 rows by 40 columns and each cell in the grid is going to update between 1 and 2 times a second some cells possibly more
169529
i need to be able to filter these items using a textbox s textchanged event
169538
this is how i d set up a machine without any other details about what you re building
169556
so add all your items the first time around and then later on you just hide the ones no longer needed and show the ones that are
169582
you don t have to move from ant to maven just for the dependency goodies
169590
the mousedown and mouseenter event handlers do not work together very well
169590
for instance once a mouse button is clicked and held down c# will fire the mousedown event handler but when the cursor moves over the picturebox the mouseenter event does not fire until the mouse button is realeased
169602
since i ve never read the whole man page for bash like i ve done with the korn shell ksh man page and that was a long time ago i missed that
169604
use the mousedown event to just detect a down press of a mouse button and set this.capture to true so that you then get other mouse events even when the mouse leaves the control you won t get a mouseleave event because you captured the mouse
169605
wasn t there a qa test website service which would let you specify a web page that you wanted to be rendered in a certain browser ie firefox safari version x y z and they would mail the snapshot back to you
169620
i ve used everything from apache + modperl to php to ruby and rails
169623
i can leave it on all night without huge power bills it uses 50w under load so it can back itself up to a remote site with a little script i can connect to it from outside via ssh so i can always scp anything i need
169632
and add the dynamic order by columns to it in the application code
169646
be sure to initialize pathdeppcopy using memset of calloc
169661
we use a combination of asp.net and websphere as well as sap isa which is also a java ee solution for different sections of our site there is absolutely no way the lamp stack could handle this kind of load without scaling to massive amounts of hardware....the .net stack section handles the majority of the load and runs on only 32 servers
169677
that said one of the most important problems programmers not-so-competent with javascript make is that most pieces of code accessing dom elements tend to create memory leaks which is the highway case for most web developers
169716
top left height and width can differ between
169743
three days plus before i discovered by single stepping in the debugger at a machine code level over simple and obviously correct code that i was putting a 16-bit integer on the call stack for a function expecting 32-bit or some such mismatch
169754
if it isn t ok you need to subtract the amount of time it took to ran
169758
jsr 295 doesn t have the synchronizer instead they have a binding strategy specified as an enum - plus jsr 295 works only with property- property binding trying to bind a field value of one object to that object s list membership in another object is not even on the table for them
169764
now z-8000 cpus have 16 16-bit registers r0 r1 r2 ...r15 which can also be addressed as 8 32-bit registers named rr0 rr2 rr4..rr14 etc
169813
though not strictly functional it s a mix of functional and object-oriented and it is not strictly for java there is a .net version of scala that would be the closest analog to f# in the jvm
169825
it should play well with wxpython or at least i seem to recall posts to the mailing list about wxpython and pyglet being used together
169828
what are the most compelling features as opposed to alternative schema management options or tools like redgate s sqlcompare etc
169870
the first thing that came to my mind was scala but really ocaml-java comes closer as f# is a variant of ocaml
169897
i tried to package a twisted program with py2exe but once i run the exe file i built i got a no module named resource error
169902
given two image buffers assume it s an array of ints of size width height with each element a color value how can i map an area defined by a quadrilateral from one image buffer into the other always square image buffer
169914
an alternative to this would be running nginx as a normal user say on port 8080 then using iptables to redirect requests from port 80 to port 8080 from memory
169926
i believe the ruby version was based on an earlier library for perl but i can t vouch for the perl version it i ve not used it
169994
on the api level usage both of them are pretty much the same since both implement same set of interfaces such as icollection ienumerable etc
169996
i generally shy away from using iframes because of padding margin and sizing issues between browsers
170008
here s an example of how you can get that information using python and here s an example of it being put to use as a django form field which allows you to easily validate an image s existence filesize dimensions and format given its url
170036
preferably something akin to shark on macos although i am willing to accept that i am going to have to pay for such a profiler on windows
170038
there is an inproc com server which contains sta activex control aka control and mta com object aka object
170038
this implementation allows to switch apartments when event fires from mta apartment of the object to sta delphi forms apartment
170041
seriously it s so small that both oracle xe and mysql will be more than sufficient to manage it
170054
just look at the sorting filtering functionality in the new swing jtable
170060
after getting sick of looking at completely useless and unhelpful errors when attempting to do the simplest things like ftp a war file to a server maven was thrown away and ant dusted off
170061
above code is the itemtemplate of my itemscontrol i want all the radiobuttons instantiated should behave as if it is in a group i know the reason because the generated radiobuttons are not adjacent in the visualtree
170080
my company currently uses subversion cvs mercurial and git
170080
mercurial and cvs both work well for us with developers using a mix of windows linux and solaris and i ve noticed no problems with timezones
170086
if the order of tests is important then add testnr msg. and you want to eliminate redundancies
170127
the default hash is non-deterministic so if used for objects in a hashmap the ordering of entries in that map can change from run to run
170134
swing awt components generally have to have a layout before you add things to them - otherwise the ui won t know where to place the subcomponents
170134
a bit like those html tables we used to see with bizarre combinations of rowspan colspan width and height attributes - which never seemed to look quite how you wanted them
170192
what do i need to put in a build.xml file to get ant to build it and make a war file
170209
accounts with email addresses from free webmail services gmail etc.
170258
in general development licensing schemes tie the license to a particular machine using the mac address and or hard drive serial number or sometimes just with an activation key which is usually just a hash of the hardware info
170272
but the problem is that such a constructor would only specify key and value but not t directly but t is just keyvaluepair
170282
i ve been starting to use the new inbuilt ribbon controls in delphi 2009 and use the custom frame so the application button and mini-toolbar slide up onto the window frame but i m wondering if on vista it should use the glass effect like office 2007 does and if so how i would enable this setting
170292
i suspect that what you are after are the additional features that aren t specifically about debugging javascript but analysing the html dom that has been modified by the javascript and the monitoring of the conversation with the server
170327
is there a mode some switch or a programmatic way that i can ask msbuild to display or output it s calculated dependencies for a given build file
170327
not all of the information is contained in the build file itself as some sub-projects are referenced by their vcproj or csproj files
170355
including mouse clicks selecting copying navigating with the keyboard changing worksheets .
170355
i had kind of hoped there would be keyup and mouseup events these two would probably have been enough
170368
or from others who have already reverse engineered the protocol in order to support the device on linux or bsd
170392
you could look at capturing the jeditorpane the jdic webbrowser control or the swt browser via the awt embedding support
170398
something that might be helpful especially if you want to reuse your service for new applications that don t require the form fields is to create a channel that deconstructs your stream and repackages it to xml json soap whatever and have your form clients communicate with the service through that while clients that don t use forms can use another channel stack
170399
the boost thread constructor uses templates to allow you to pass a function pointer or callable function object so it doesn t have the same restrictions as mfc
170415
i am interested in browsers ie 7 firefox 3 safari 3
170419
so you get a requirement change request bugfix etc you put it in there
170419
you get used to this very quickly and it isn t that onerous - you ll need to say i changed this config value and you need to put this file in this directory or add this config file to the system
170447
in ie dom elements are com based reference counting objects that the javascript gc can t cleanup
170452
a lexical encoding would encode each word not each letter and encapsulate them within a sentence
170474
you re dealing with 2 kinds of objects and 2 garbage collectors javascript and dom objects which can reference each other the circular reference and then neither gc can take care of all its objects even when the page unloads
170478
i tested this in opera 9.5 ie7 ff3 and safari and it works in all of them
170479
the problem is you can t really tell the user how many characters are allowed in the field because the escaped value obviously has more characters than the unescaped one
170492
i don t care if either one is null by itself just as long as the other field has a non-null value
170500
a relation is a set of tuples with the same domain such that the range of any tuple is uniqe in the set
170509
in this unlikely set up asp would build a template that would be cached however whether that template contains compilied opcode etc would be up to php
170511
if they exceed that extra 34 field space for the buffer then the input probably should not be accepted
170512
decode first do your stuff then apply any encoding you need to store output etc
170540
i don t think you want parentdiv.children 0 children is not a valid property in ff3 anyway instead you want parentdiv.childnodes 0 but note that this includes text nodes that may have no height
170606
or with collaborative applications we may want to pass along resources as part of a workflow or share custody of a document for editing purposes
170624
i have tried to modify the dom adding attributes height width on the fly but seems did not work on ie6
170630
to convert that number into a readable date time just paste the decimal value in the field unix timestamp of this unix time conversion online tool
170632
instead of modifying the height and width attributes of the image try modifying the css height and width
170632
one common gotcha is that the height and width styles are strings that include a unit like px in the example above
170632
edit - i think that setting the height and width directly instead of using style.height and style.width should work
170636
to modify an image proportionally simply only alter one of the width height css properties leave the other set to auto
170651
to be more robust you could then add timing data from keyboard and mouse usage hard disk response times motherboard sensor data eg temperature etc
170669
apache itself can be configured to function this way although if you are on linux or unix squid is the better option as it is specifically designed to do this very job
170720
tested both myisam and innodb
170720
the only problem is that mysql triggers have no way of raising an error or aborting an insert operation
170764
apc memcached db etc

codesynthesis xsd is an xml data binding compiler for c++ developed by code synthesis and dual-licensed under the gnu gpl and a proprietary license
170912
one of the unique features of codesynthesis xsd is its support for two different xml schema to c++ mappings in-memory c++ tree and stream-oriented c++ parser
170948
here is a solution in scheme because i know that better than common lisp and have an interpreter for checking my work
170957
most rss feeds will have a date with each story - so make a query to pull the latest story s date from the database pull all of the latest stories from the rss feed and compare dates
170957
it also depends on whether this is for one particular feed or if you are writing something that will work for many feeds
170986
changes from matdumsa s 1 removed the close tag for the option inside append and 2 moved the properties attributes into an map as the second parameter of append
171002
have you considered using dao instead of ado to manipulate jet data
171013
even huge standards like ansi x12 and edifact were problematic because even when two partners exchanged documents using an agreed standard there were usually enough differences in the way the documents were utilized that it required custom coding to process them
171033
wxwidgets lets developers create applications for win32 mac os x gtk+ x11 motif wince and more using one codebase
171033
it can be used from languages such as c++ python perl and c# .net

i m trying to lightbox a page containing a swf via the nifty ajax feature in facebox for jquery
171099
in my case i m looking to set sensible timeout values when making post requests in php however this applies to any language
171108
the other one is integer vs int this goes for any primitive version of an object
171115
i know there are many pear pecl and other php libraries classes out there that can fit my description - but which ones are maintained used and have proven to be bug-free and efficient
171121
i ve been writing php web applications for some time and have come across very nice javascript frameworks such as jquery extjs scriptaculous etc
171157
but we have also copied features such as prepare execute from pear db
171185
by this i mean you would have to rewrite all urls not only in http headers but in your html content as well do a regex search replace on the html and decode rewrite and resend all get post put data too
171198
the executable jar will be available at target stackoverflow-autostart-spring-app-0.1.jar when running mvn package
171213
if it cannot be done platform-independently linux unix is a priority for me
171237
i m about to deal with managing and running my first internet connected apache webserver and i was wondering if there are any sys admins and developers out there that would like to share some of their knowledge regarding security and optimization tips for running apache webserver
171245
if you re running a standard lamp linux apache mysql php pearl python environment put mysql on another machine than apache
171255
if apache is serving web apps php perl rails be sure the requests are handled by the right module in the right order
171277
does anyone know if this is possible in .net perl python are there any libraries available that will help me do this
171280
ipython python and rush ruby are shells that are designed for more advanced languages
171289
the array only contains 7280 elements
171303
as an aside if he can access the api directly how do you ensure that the money goes into the site owner s bank account
171309
i don t know if it s faster but if you want to use a bitwise operator to perform binary division you can use the shift and subtract method described at this page
171333
notice that every line call has to open and close a new path whereas with the canvas api you can draw all the lines within a single beginpath endpath block improving performance significantly
171336
you re talking about an authentication service not an authorization service
171372
lspci -n will give you pci ids that you can search for on the linux kernel driver database
171388
when you build any assembly in .net asp.net windows forms command line class library etc a number of meta-data definition tables are also created within the assembly storing information about methods fields and types corresponding to the types fields and methods you wrote in your code
171388
the classes in system.reflection namespace in .net allow you to enumerate and interate over these tables providing an object model for you to query and access items in these tables
171416
if matching the exact serialization format of firefox is not your aim you could use one of the javascript json serialization deserialization libraries listed at
171435
i know that the #warning directive is not standard c c++ but several compilers support it including gcc g++
171436
that is the timeout between trying to connect to the remote server and the timeout after sending the request that they should wait for a response
171436
as for the read timeout that is trickier you need it to be low so you don t exhaust your pool of workers who are waiting for the remote service to return but you also don t want it so low that it closes the connection before reading a response
171445
other factors dwarf the difference in performance between mysql and mysqli
171453
are you aware of can you name a compiler other than gcc g++ that provides #warning
171474
obviously ms visio and omnigraffle come to mind but they both feel so bloated and also tend to emphasize the document formatting printing side and less on helping to organize the actual logic
171495
all of the above implement prepare and execute
171510
i m working on a e-commerce system and i would like to track the product page views but i m not sure of the best way to do that.
171518
i think you can do this by calculating the height and width you want with javascript via document.body.clientwidth etc. and then injecting the iframe into your html like this
171518
element.innerhtml + iframe src height 200 width + document.body.clientwidth 0.8 +
171537
classnotfoundexception --- you know that the class is in the classpath but you are not sure why the class is not getting loaded
171542
i m trying to set the width and height of an element with javascript to cover the entire browser viewport and i m successful using document.body.clientheight but in ie6 it seems that i always get horizontal and vertical scrollbars because the element must be slightly too big
171587
so everytime we got over 1024 descriptors each os has its own limit linux vanilla kernels have 1024 the actual value is defined as fd_setsize the fd_set macro would happily overwrite its bit field and write garbage into the next structure in memory
171588
if i modify or add an environment variable i have to restart the command prompt
171593
if you modify or add a new environment variable outside of the scope of an existing open command prompt you either need to restart the command prompt or manually add using set in the existing command prompt
171600
in fact in the last ten years 90 of my work was either on the hardware or doing low-level embedded code
171627
that only contains the base elements
171631
now this is working great however the min max and close buttons still are xp default theme
171642
however the vast majority will be using vanilla ie firefox safari
171655
something with minimal configuration and installation effort
171664
i am building a simple expression parser that then needs to evaluate the simple binary operations such as addition subtraction etc
171709
the windows driver kit includes a non-instrumenting user kernel sampling profiler called kernrate
171752
rush is a replacement for the unix shell bash zsh etc which uses pure ruby syntax
171764
if you can bypass that iirc i booted from the cd and downloaded the normal server kernel and it all worked fine then you end up with an absolutely minimal linux system but backed by the full ubuntu repositories so it s an excellent base for a server
171827
i need a complete object pascal syntax preferably delphi 2009
171827
for the real purists it also contains the full assembler code which does not support the full 100 of the intel set but only a few instructions are missed.
171828
i the case of releasing java jar ear jar rar war files i would like to be able to look in at the jar and switch to the same branch version or tag that was the source of the released jar
171833
from svn to http or from http to https
171835
python for unix and linux system administration is aimed at sysadmins
171857
once you know this from what i heard python for unix and linux system administration you mentioned is a very good and sufficient one
171865
seems a load easier than looking in the war ear jar etc easy time
171873
i know that i have do this in a nick of time in perl python even in awk
171880
each node records in stable storage that it was able to commit or rollback the transaction so that it will be able to do as commanded even across crashes
171931
consider setting the hidden field _eventtarget value before initiating the event with javascript
171934
memset memcpy and memcmp
171942
though not related to programming exactly the use of xml parsers that come from multiple sources like xerces jdom
171953
and if i misunderstood and you re talking about a dialog box made via css rather than a pop-up browser window then all the ways of closing that window are elements you could register click handers for.
172037
check std uncaught_exception - if true rollback else commit - these are the most likely desired actions unless you have a policy that says otherwise before actually closing the connection.

172164
the linux.com article talks about using lighttpd with apache
172169
for manual commit or rollback transactions when got errors
172177
the benefit of both apache is more powerful and extensible useless if you don t need that power but anyway... and lighttpd is faster at static content
172189
there are currently 1421 characters in just the lu letter uppercase category alone and i need to match many different categories very specifically and would rather not hand-write the character sets necessary for it
172223
in essence the iframe document sends messages with json thru the window element
172269
as a distributed version control system through its push pull system it helps developers to create a source code eco-system which helps to manage a large pool of developers working on a single project
172272
all web clients that i know of are read only meaning that you can only browse the files make diffs set up rss feeds but you can not modify the repository in any way
172279
the default output path for any project is visual studio is bin debug but i have noticed that obj folder is also generated which again contains dll and pdb files
172362
does your document contains any doctype declaration
172363
you can match any number of nested parens through brute force but you can t ever match an arbitrarily long set of nested brackets

log4net is a richer and more flexible way of tracing or logging than the in-built trace or even asp health monitoring
172573
i m particularly interested in scp file transfer and issuing commands to a remote linux box programmatically via the ssh protocol
172585
no multiplies or divides only addition subtraction and shifts
172587
what is the difference between g++ and gcc
172592
gcc and g++ are compiler-drivers of the gnu compiler collection which was once upon a time just the gnu c compiler
172592
according to 1 and 2 g++ is equivalent to gcc -xc++ -lstdc++ -shared-libgcc the 1st is a compiler option the 2nd two are linker options
172597
gcc or g++ just choose a different front-end with different default options
172598
you have to put interface declaring your private category in the begin of myclass.m file otherwise xcode complains with a message like self may not respond to message privatefoo
172613
the only notable difference is that i you pass a .c to gcc it will compile as c whereas g++ will always treat it as c++
172621
objective-c is compiled to native code by either gcc or llvm
172639
that said as per my comment on collin s post the ability to perform things like basic arithmetic increment int32 division etc on for example a matrix t for t in decimal float int double etc is often highly valuable
172665
in general if the lines are not of fixed length you have to read through a file line by
172672
you either need to wrap it in an enclosing document element whose markup will still be escaped or use a properly-initialized xmlreader to process the value once you ve retrieved it from the configuration
172692
the thing with learning asp.net is that you should first gain an understanding of the .net framework and how it works as there is a lot more going on behind the scenes than in the other interpreted languages you re familiar with
172706
if you re coding in the microsoft stack you ll go with sqlserver in the linux world the default is mysql and for corporate in-house project most shops have decided on some default like oracle or ibm db2
172718
i still use mysql for web sites but for in-house projects i rather choose firebird or postgres
172721
i think a title is such a fundamental part of the communication of a document that it should always be in element content
172721
attributes are designed for expressing simple properties of the information represented in an element
172728
people using linux are used to install mysql sqlite or postgresql in a second and maybe that s beacuse they don t need windows to run a dbms
172734
i had a nice 4 processor machine that wouldn t use more than 1.2 processors at a time
172756
use screen.availwidth and screen.availheight to calculate a suitable size for the height and width parameters in window.open
172793
1- the homepage points to another page at codeplex the homepage should be clean and just point the advantages of ironpython take the ironruby page as an example its that hides language-developent stuff from the user even though the user has to access ironruby s svn prior using it
172794
i m surprised no one mentioned shedskin it automagically converts your python program to c++ and in some benchmarks yields better improvements than psyco in speed
172798
i have experimented with lisp actually scheme and found it to be a very beautiful language that i am interested in learning more about
172804
i guess i am still unclear about what it is you are trying to do but jscript.net might be worth looking into though managed jscript seems like it may be more appropriate for your needs it is more like javascript than jscript.net
172824
rick strahl also has some posts on embedding js as runtime engine for expression evaluation
172833
this has scaling problems selecting from really large datasets but so do all the less-normalized schemas sorting and filtering by a text field will probably always be slower than using an integer for example
172841
i think what is happening is that after the value changes the caret moves to the rightmost position and this deselects the field
172843
use calloc instead of malloc
172853
when a tag field is added or changed that kicks off a background thread that selects all bugids and their tags parses the text building a map where the key is the tag and the value is a list of all the ids that have that tag
172871
i ve tried various folder organizations a top level project directory then broken down by department or person or application but no matter what i try it s still too time consuming to find what i m looking for
172899
if you need to expand the site later on and add different functionality like forums gallery polls etc. you better go for a proper cms solution like joomla drupal and likewise
172918
both should take 100 width and 100 height within the container
172921
note you will need mpfr tested with 2.3.2 installed with the correct paths change the makefile for libs and header files along with those from gmp to successfully compile this
172928
i m toying with sdl or allegro but i have no experience in either so i m open to the best and ideally easiest toolkit out there
172929
although the gcc and g++ commands do very similar things g++ is designed to be the command you d invoke to compile a c++ program
172943
go ahead and figure out how to write the assembly to replace a few simple stdlib routines like strcpy memmove etc
172961
i then configured apache to act as a proxy to my port 80 requests transparently forwarding them to my local website on port 8081
172992
it s benefit is shared with most any balanced tree consistent access to the nodes plus all the leaf nodes are linked so you can easily traverse from node to node in key order
173007
also if you use g++ to link the object files it automatically links in the std c++ libraries gcc does not do this
173007
gcc compiling .cpp and g++ compiling .c .cpp files has a few extra macros
173055
note that many crucial data-processing libraries have c-versions be it xml json or whatnot
173080
wpf silverlight libraries
173096
the subquery inside the not in statement can be evaluated at the beginning of the execution and the temporary table can be checked against each value in the outer select rather than re-running the subselect every time as would be required with the not exists statement
173104
oracle or mysql have their flaws but odds are if you have a problem 100 other people have had the same problem and can tell you how to solve it
173123
your seeing a rounding up with certain numbers is due to the fact the javascript engine can t handle decimal digits beyond a certain precision and therefore your number ends up getting rounded up to the next integer
173133
how can i reinterpret cast a float to an int or a double to a long
173139
the bitconverter class can retrieve the bytes for any primitive type which you can then use to create an int
173147
syntax wise it is closer to c# with a lot of sugar syntax so it kind of look like c# blend in with ruby python
173163
also if you aren t using firefox you can use firebug lite in ie safari or opera
173165
you can do some things with reflection to select the overload at runtime but that will be very slow and has severe issues if anything satisfies both overloads
173168
on top of that we use things like mantis bug tracking built in php mediawiki and phpmyadmin
173181
apparently c data in the heap is left alone by ghc in basically all cases except code that uses the ffi to access gmp or any c library that relies on gmp like mpfr that i wanted to use
173205
my data series are grouped into several categories and i assign the numeric color index based on that category
173213
one clocks in at 42 000 lines of code using a physical line count and one at 68 000 lines
173228
you never hear them argue about python over .net over java over c because they just don t care
173229
you might also want to take a look at any startup scripts that might launch the fastcgi daemon
173230
i use it to mean the value in this field is unknown at this time
173241
other gdi functions such as bitblt link as expected and the compilers compiles with out error or warning
173246
the server runs centos 5.2 and has php perl python installed
173249
gmp which the ghc runtime uses and mpfr having some weird interaction
173276
for example if i have a single-bit field isready it may make perfect sense for this field to have a default value of false and null not be allowed but this implicitly asserts that we know that the whatever is not ready when in fact we may have no such knowledge
173352
3. cygwin shell installable complete with perl gcc gprof gcov gdb and related tools bash vim development debugging tools
173354
if you want to install binaries add reg keys and even run custom actions have your own code execure during install you should have a look at it
173365
doesnt mysql postgresql oracle and so on and so on allow you to do that
173390
the winforms-app is running on the client the running instance should display the new set of meta data as quickly as possible without any click-once update check or whatever
173481
i can t yet vote so i ll just say i agree with the suggestion of a hash of the file path and timestamp or the table name + primary field value + timestamp if being represented by db content
173485
wpf leverages xaml for the design visual experience this is the same technology that silverlight uses and in the future will be leveraged heavily by other aspects of .net 4.0 specifically wcf web services and wf workflow
173490
either use a profiler man gprof as another poster suggested or - quick dirty - put a loop around the offending section of code to execute it many times and use clock
173523
it s python web framework similar to django or turbogears but it doesn t have the overhead of those frameworks
173543
in myeclipse server configuration you find the field optional shutdown argument which is filled with the default value
173548
we evaluated it alongside with plastic scm svn and clearcase-ucm that we already owned and used and decided to dump clearcase and svn both were used in two different groups and to purchase accurev
173548
accurev integrates with so many tools to give you alm bundle - bug tracking tools like jira clearquest ides testing tools quality center and if you can t find one you can write your own they provide java perl xml cli sdks
173586
that works note the addition of case double in the switch but there may be a better way to do the int float check as they would only work with standard uk us numbers
173602
maybe you just need an keyboard mouse hook
173616
second what strategy do you use for managing those tests that are long-running or require special environment configuration
173632
learning wpf will mean you ll also learn silverlight at the same time
173637
now for generic fractions which work in html but also work in plain text use the super- and subscript digits see unicode codepoint chart search for superscripts separated by the fraction slash character
173654
intercepting the ctrl+v in keydown or keyup of your form
173701
the other thing you need is some kind of revision control - cvs rcs svn git clearcase.
173706
i am having the problem that i cannot select a specific xml node which needs to be deleted
173706
does anybody know a freeware tool which can load a xml file so that the user can select a specific node and receives the accurate xpath without having an enumeration in the path
173744
for some databases it does not matter for example ms sql does know the proper join order most of the time
173770
i know how to draw basic objects using jogl or lwjgl to connect to opengl
173775
i m already using svn 1.5 both sever visualsvn 1.5.1 and client-side tortoisesvn 1.5.1 but we are using a fairly lengthy svn branch-merge dance
173784
in a document library sometimes the element is a folder
173799
you might have to set a width and height on your as well
173819
if you are using asp.net 2.0+ you can try calling the focus method of your textbox once the postback occurs preferably in the textchanged event of the textbox
173822
once you have set this property you can then use full xpath to access any elements you want
173829
in css file set the width of .ui-datepicker-cover to 220px height to 200px
173887
although not exhaustive the possible return values include aolserver apache apache2filter apache2handler caudium cgi until php 5.3 cgi-fcgi cli cli-server continuity embed isapi litespeed milter nsapi phttpd pi3web roxen thttpd tux and webjames
173932
to represent the number accurately in base 10 you would need an infinite number of decimal digits
173959
support for vb c++ delphi other languages
174008
so with that said and with attempting to adhere to the kiss principle when a set of functions are providing a suitable solution to a problem are there any other reasons worth considering to convert my code into an object-oriented design
174047
if a normalized schema causes joins to hit the disk a lot but the equivalent denormalized schema would not have to hit the disk then denormalization wins a performance competition
174049
using an iframe works and don t cause rendering problems as long as you take care that there s no margin or padding inside the iframe
174069
how can i in java or using some other programming language add a new program group in the applications menu in both kde and gnome
174106
it has quite a few independent components applications written in different languages mainly c++ and php some perl
174107
what worked great for me was a combination of manual reset event + atomic interlocked counter as a much faster alternative
174119
i see this often in the build scripts of projects that use autotools autoconf automake
174153
compiler error the operand of an increment or decrement operator must be a variable property or indexer.
174170
i am trying to use py2exe for converting a script into an exe
174175
you are running one of the operands on the result of the other the result of a increment decrement is a value - and you can not use increment decrement on a value it has to be a variable that can be set
174208
i don t think ie supports the use of auto for setting height width so you could try giving this a numeric value like jarett suggests
174212
make sure that you re not inadvertantly resetting this count before checking it though bol this variable is set to 0 by any statement that does not return rows such as an if statement
174240
has anyone had any experience targetting wsh in the way that vbscript jscript perlscript xbscript and forthscript among other do such that the language can be used from the command line and embedded in server-side web pages
174294
you can increment a global variable everytime a user session is created and decrement it when it is destroyed
174295
link to external images don t embed them in the document
174331
will work fine in bash if you re aiming for portability across various unix environments where you can t be sure that the default shell will be bash and whether it supports the -z test condition it s safer to use the form if x some_var x since that will always have the intended effect
174341
obviously if you have a login authentication requirement you can capture when a person signs on and as part of your data access code you can log when a person hits the database
174351
for any non-trivial set of cuts it would take forever to calculate them all
174356
christian thanks for the quick response i m interested on a c non-boost environment answer too because this is driver kernel code
174363
if you see traffic going back and forth to the remote server but then it stops you ll need to dig into those packets and see what low-level error codes might be present in the traffic
174365
my visual studio team system vsts integration with team foundation server tfs doesn t seem to pick it up
174365
is this a feature that isn t part of vsts tfs
174396
there s no definitive collection afaik but these links all have useful collections of owl and rdfs ontologies
174396
in addition there are some general-purpose rdf rdfs owl search engines you may find helpful
174430
and put everything dealing with log4net in that file but i still get the same messages
174454
aptana studio is the best in my opinion it s based on eclipse and subsequently java so it will run on pretty much anything and has design views supporting firefox opera and safari on os x and windows i assume it does other browsers as well if they are installed
174459
has anyone had any experience with 3rd party controls that can make a windows mobile app look like a wpf silverlight iphone - like interface
174467
however i think that in this case i would almost always buy and use stl - or a better solution something from boost perhaps before rolling my own
174485
by default web browsers should cache content over https the same as over http unless explicitly told otherwise via the http headers received
174498
also is there an equivalent to emma eclemma free yet powerful code coverage tool for visual studio and c# code
174534
you should be able to fix this by copying the log4net xsd into c program files microsoft visual studio 8 xml schemas or wherever your visual studio is installed
174535
ideally this server side script would take the kml the map s lat lon center and the map zoom level and appropriately merge all of the visible place markers into a single gif or png overlay
174541
are you using sed awk perl or something else to solve this problem
174546
either way since deploy seems to be the last step previous steps probably clear the directory and deploy is failing to run leaving your folder empty at the end of the steps
174552
you may also want to check the error-codes for fseek ftell and fread
174559
if you are completely new to kernel development i would suggest not starting with hardware development and going to some software-only kernel modules like proc file sysfs or for more complex examples filesystem network development developing on a uml vmware virtualbox .
174577
i would highly recommend gallio formally mbunit for unit testing and unfortunately not free ncover for code coverage
174602
in another test i m trying to locate any spfolder that has a custom metadata property set to a specific value
174612
on a cross platform c c++ project win32 linux osx i need to use the printf functions to print some variables of type size_t
174632
on postgresql and many other rdbms you can do it with regular alter table statement
174682
for dynamic languages like python ruby and many interpreted languages an eval function is a natural element
174697
with listeners and models you can specify a component to use an instance of your custom listener model instead of the default behavior
174704
ogre3d is an open source game engine that fully supports lighting as well as sound and game controls
174718
if any are filled cells or if you have only one light source cells that have already been tested and found to be in shadow your cell is in shadow
174718
an easy optimisation to this is to set the state of any cells you encounter along the line to whatever the final outcome is
174725
although visual basic for applications supports the screen printer app debug err and clipboard objects vbscript supports only the err object
174728
you may also choose not to use stl for a particular case because more applicable containers exist that are not in the current standard such as boost array or boost unordered_map
174746
if that line strikes an obstruction then mark all pixels from the edge to just beyond the obstruction as being in shadow
174748
i have a table with one field that can point to a foreign key in one of 3 other tables based on what the descriminator value is project timekeep or costcenter
174761
not sure why you want to go to a gif png overlay you can do this directly in kml
174788
in addition i have a .bash_hostconfig in the linux and solaris directories with host-specific path configuration and such because i have a very different setup at work than i do at home fc5-8 and rhel3-5 depending on where i am
174828
my common library has grown to include code by others mostly things like libjpeg libpng ffmpeg mysql and a few others and i would rather keep the amount of external code in it to a minimum
174839
is there an easy way of cloning entire installed debian ubuntu system
174841
even when i put a break point in the converter code the debugger just doesn t get there when an update is done to the underlying data -
174867
not sure if this is your answer but this may get you in the right direction it s scott hanselman msft showing how to get asp.net webforms asp.net mvc and asp.net dynamic data -- oh and ajax to work together in harmony
174869
it is possible to prevent scroll bars from appearing when you drag a mdichild outside the bounds of the mdiparent in vb.net
174905
i have typically seen triggers used to insert some relational data which should be done from the business logic for insert data into reporting table ie denormalizing the data which can be done with a process outside the transaction or for transforming the data in some way
174915
so is anyone aware of any other database abstraction libraries or database access drivers that i could easily extend with our current set of functionality that takes named parameters like pdo does
174920
are you sure the frame fits completely within the screen and contentsize s width is not greater than the scroll view s width
174937
it tells maven a bit more explicitly what you are doing and i ve found that m2eclipse and q4e both like it better
174948
every time i see ruby or python discussed in the context of web development it s always with a framework rails for ruby django for python
174948
if not is there a reason why these languages are often used within a framework while perl and php are not
174958
however only the application components within that war or ear will use the new jar which may be a problem or an advantage depending on how you ve set up your deployments
174959
you do need a ruby enabled server such as apache running eruby erb
174965
python wasn t designed like php was for example as a direct web scripting language so common web-ish things like connecting to databases isn t native and frameworks are handy
174979
the most plausible thing i can think of is that perl and php were developed before the notion of using frameworks for web apps became popular
174979
ruby and python became popular after frameworks became popular hence they developed together
174990
in php there are definitely frameworks that get used like cakephp and in perl there are many as well like mason and catalyst
175004
in this scene only the diagonal line would be considered. for each such line project it into a trapezoid whose front edge is the original line whose sides lie on lines from the light source through each end point and whose back is far away past the whole scene
175008
i don t know too much about rails or perl frameworks but php frameworks such as zend symfony code igniter cakephp etc are used widely
175013
in ruby you have .erb templates that can be used in a similar way as you use php pages
175013
you can write a site in ruby or python using several technologies rails-like frameworks templates or even talking directly with the http library and building the page cgi-style
175013
web frameworks like python s django or ruby s rails there are many just raise the level of abstraction from the php s or asp s and automate several process like login database interaction rest api s which is always a good thing
175025
if you want to use inputstream and outputstream concurrently with socketchannel from looking at the source it appears that you need to call socketchannel.socket and use the streams from that which behave slightly differently
175101
the implementation seems to work with both elementtree and celementtree
175109
i found that this can be set up in the xml configuration file by reading the manual but it didn t give me any hints about programmatically adding these
175115
i got the tips to show when you stop and hide if you move
175129
i want to put that sql command dump text into this email when i get a sqlexception which will save me the time of digging through trace logs when a page blows up because of a query
175137
hence the first gig-e port on a router will quite often have a hostname that includes ge0 or similar
175161
in visual studio open your project s properties and go to the signing tab select sign the clickonce manifests and create test certificate
175161
always edit sign the application manifest before editing signing the deployment manifest
175186
so checking if it is in there is easy enough contains and adding to the set is easy too
175228
in brief is it better to have a single setvisible bool method or a pair of show and hide methods
175233
in the example you gave show and hide make a lot of sense at least to me
175239
implicitly the show and hide functions you list are both setters
175266
in this case i would argue that using functions to perform the action and update the state is better than having a setter getter that performs an action as a side-effect of updating the property
175267
i prefer the show and hide methods because they explicitly tell what you are going
175267
plus show and hide are better-named method for an interface imho
175280
if switching misvisible really turns visibility of the object on and off immediately than use the show hide scenario
175307
svn cvs git mecruial anything that doesn t lock files and doesn t leave your source in a proprietary file sytem
175317
contains will very probably go wrong when you have a hashset implementation of set as the hashset uses the hashcode of object to locate the bucket a number which has nothing to do with business logic and only equals the elements within that bucket
175319
hibernate is an object relational persistence service
175325
probably the one that will get you farthest is posix after all every unix like system tries to support at least some posix the more the better very little can call themselves really being 100 posix-compliant platforms a ux aix hp-ux irix mac os x 10.5 minix qnx solaris unixware vxworks .
175325
however there are quite a couple of platforms that offer at least some posix support some more some less and some are almost posix-compliant freebsd linux netbsd beos openbsd .
175337
i would go with the isvisible show hide set
175337
show and hide make the side effects clear
175346
i d like to set up a webserver where i can upload my xml file or just the data and add it to the server ignoring duplicate entries already on the server
175364
we started out with the build number being simply incremented but that required that the version file be checked in for every build and caused conflicts when merging
175372
i use kate kde advanced text editor for most of my development including django
175393
otoh operations like show and hide can be easily overridden with different implementations without revealing anything about the internal state

you can in fact point tfs to a different wss or moss server if you want but bear in mind that in tfs2008 the project sites all have to live as
175511
that said sometimes it s difficult to get around--i have had to go back and edit in the null when it made sense as a default but i never put it in on the first pass any more
175517
i then copy the data over from the old database using insert into x select from y and then apply all indexes constraints and triggers
175528
the site will support several file formarts from plain text to office documents doc xls ppt ... videos mpeg avi ... images jpg gif png ... pdf s open office etc
175612
or is it run in a more batch manner - you put in requests then get told later if you can have your slot
175676
so the solution i came up with is the use the svnadmin dump load functions
175676
the thought is that by using this method i can ensure that the code that is currently in production is reflective of the most recent revision in the servers svn repo
175686
i don t think you can make it any easier than using remove add if you are using a set
175700
use the uialertview class to display an alert message to the user
175700
use the properties and methods defined in this class to set the title message and delegate of an alert view and configure the buttons

the reason that you call gc.supressfinalize is that if your object has a finalizer your object will actually get promoted to the next gc generation because it has to call finalize the first time the gc runs around and can t release your object until finalization is finished and therefore the memory is actually not released until the 2nd run through by the gc

i assume you can find some mysql tool that has the same logging feature like flamerobin does for firebird
175892
make its width height 50 the width of the browser window or something
175892
that means when i click on the edge of the pdf and drag when the mouse enters the display box of the pdf the resize operation continues
175905
finally there should be a very specific customer request to invest the time and money making support for the other browsers like opera safari e.t.c
175925
or better yet -- disable magic quotes in php.ini and any .htaccess files it may be set in

however when powerbuilder was upgraded from 16-bit to 32-bit the menu code stopped working
176043
the arrays module is more like a thin wrapper over c arrays which give you kind of strongly typed containers see docs with access to more c-like types such as signed unsigned short or double which are not part of the built-in types
176071
highly recommended to fully support opera and safari no missing functionality slightly degraded interfaces are acceptable but only if absolutely necessary
176071
interface degradation is acceptable with ie6 and firefox 2 as long as it is still usable i consider these as end of life browsers and frankly rarely worth the effort also here are older versions of opera and safari but i rarely see significant problems with these
176093
i basically draw the line and when i reach the end i redraw it but this time subtract the line width from y-coordinate
176106
is there any regex or an enumerator object out there that i could use to quickly do this the most efficient way possible
176110
for a more complicated answer there is such a thing as sample counting clipping detectors that require x consecutive samples to be at the max min value for them to be considered clipping where x may be as high as 7

i ll second richfaces but also point out icefaces which isn t free but is also very nice
176116
others firefox opera safari chrome if you strive to write standards-compliant html css and javascript what works in either of these browsers will most probably work with the rest
176137
does anyone know of a way in java to convert an earth surface position from lat lon to utm say in wgs84
176143
long story short is that it is not a completely managed code base but simply a .net wrapper around their com version
176144
second safari has the greatest standards support combined with a marketshare which isn t negligible opera is just hard to justify for cost benefit reasons
176144
third in my experience going from safari to firefox is usually less problematic than the other way around
176155
freedesktop.org standards are followed by gnome kde and xfce so it should work on any distribution

there is a next and previous button to navigate through the results gotten for the selected date
176220
these users most likely will not be trying to put in text that would get sanitized but by protecting against it you are protecting their users
176225
the reason for this mode is that while everything is ok you don t want to be bothered by extra output and certainly if there is a failure you don t want to miss it because of the noise of other output
176258
if all you want to do is conditionally show or hide a div then you could declare it as an asp panel renders to html as a div tag and set it s .visible property
176287
if neither of these situations applies every packet has to be received by every node and the packet timing is unpredictable so recipients can t detect missed packets on their own then your options include

i think it s funny when you hear people typing away on the keyboard in crime dramas doing photoshop-type stuff that really requires a mouse
176308
have a look at cargo and its maven plugin
176342
the registry change would cause the search order to start with the current working directory which you could set to the desired folder in a shortcut
176345
the cargo maven plugin is a good way to go if you re doing servlet development and want to deploy the resulting war for integration testing
176347
i read some of the answers on here re testing views and controllers and mocking but i still can t figure out how to test an asp.net mvc controller that reads and sets session values or any other context based variables.

i typically use method #1 so i can put that html any where in a template file that contains static html
176459
the int and double work fine and get stored in the table...but i can t figure out how to get the strings to store.
176465
that being said output buffering might be just a tiny bit faster as the space allocated for the input is fairly large by default 40k according to this

i was able to upgrade the tfs installation at my company by using these resources
176479
i have a image upload form that should take image types png jpeg gif resize it and then save it to a path
176479
for some reason i can t get the png file types to work it works fine with jpeg gif and the file is copied so it looks like it s something to do with how i m creating the png
176481
you may want to look at what companies like teradata netezza greenplum vertica asterdata etc are doing
176481
if you don t need the strict transactionality and consistency guarantees you can get from rdbms it is often far easier to denormalize and not do joins
176512
one particular example i m working on which could be a case all by itself is whether it s necessary to call fclose again when it returns eof with errno eintr

the de-facto open source rcs is subversion svn
176548
in general mixing workflows imperative programming with rest declarative programming is very problematic
176555
examples darcs git mercurial bazaar
176558
since you state you are new to programming in general i ll volunteer a recommendation grab visualsvn server and tortoise svn a client
176569
this has some flaws what if one of the entries in the row was my var instead of myvar
176627
but as soon as i change the page from http to https secure mode i get the this page contains both secure and nonsecure items. error
176669
resource-orientation is about explicitly modeling state data limiting function to predefined verbs with universal semantics in the case of http get put post delete and leaving the rest of the processing to the client
176677
if you know the absolute top of value that tool top can have you can create a div that is the height of the content + the highest distance the tool tip will display in
176682
well you could use a lot of dateadd datepart etc but it will be slow if you have a lot of data as it can t really use an index here

the contenteditable property is what you want -- it s supported by ie safari and by chrome as a byproduct and i think firefox 3 alas not ffx2
176700
edit olliej so yes the contenteditable attribute in the linked demo works fine in ie firefox and safari
176714
every line of code has about 10-20 lines of documentation along with tests full revision history etc
176724
all that does is encode the contents of the string to a byte array and decode it again reproducing the original string--an expensive no-op
176764
i have an opendocument spreadsheet with macros in starbasic ooobasic that i want to convert into an excel spreadsheet with the starbasic macros translated to vba
176764
while openoffice.org claims to have the ability to translate vba macros to starbasic and back my attempts to have ooo convert these original starbasic macros to vba have all failed
176764
is there any guaranteed way to get these macros moved to vba and excel without completely rewriting them
176764
it seems that ooo will only turn starbasic macros to vba if they originated in that form

yes it is possible to reliably run set up and tear down methods before and after any tests in a test suite
177076
when an item is selected and they click a go button i want it to update a gridview that is also on the page
177100
the documentation for mysql 5.0 numeric types states that the maximum size of a numeric is 64 or 65 digits
177100
remember that your language of choice has to be able to work with those digits so you may be limited to a 64-bit integer anyway
177103
as a side note i don t know about ruby but in php you can use phpdoc tags to hint the ide eclipse pdt about the data types returned by a certain method
177118
the duplicate problem boils down to testing to see if the array contains duplicates in o n time o 1 space
177122
i asked this about python earlier and i figured it might be good to do it for other languages i m especially curious if there are corollaries to psycho and pyrex for perl
177125
then export and check the size report for any large pieces of content that you didn t mean to be exporting
177126
i also don t know if any of them are capable of producing a distinct number for a given set of numbers
177126
if you want an example that has the proper min and max values too try this one of length 8
177139
don t muck about with object identity after you leave the constructor - doing so greatly increases your chances of having really difficult-to-figure out bugs down the road
177216
difference between udp and tcp
177230
this isn t an area i m an expert in but if you don t have a library handy that does it for you easily then you might be better of just creating a lookup table map which contains the utf-8 - ascii values
177234
the routines were used as wrappers around malloc and free
177234
when a buffer of a specific type was allocated we d malloc the memory in blocks if a list of free buffers was empty
177234
we also maintained a list of the blocks of buffers so that we could do a simple cleanup by calling free on each of the actual malloc d buffers
177234
we had replacement routines for malloc and free that did pointer arithmetic to get the buffer size and then to put the buffer into the free list
177236
linux variant when writing a daemon what are the basic building blocks forking a child and killing the parent closing stdin stdout stderr etc.
177248
by default no sharing of data between processes but using inter-process communication techniques such as socket pipes rpc etc..you can share the data
177287
is it possible to produce an alert similar to javascript s alert message in python with an application running as a daemon
177337
i don t know what your whole environment is but you might consider wrapping the calls to malloc realloc free on just the vm so that you can pass it off to a handler designed for small pools
177342
i ve been toying with extjs and flex and the development experience is a lot like building a desktop app only without the fancy drag-and-drop ide s
177346
however slapping labels on methods is faster than building logic to show hide buttons or do security validation in code
177350
on a unix or linux system copy dev hello_world foo.c main 2 into the current directory
177350
so maybe than by piping the result to a cat or type in windows you can then do something with the output of said cat type command
177363
i ve chosen to go with an md5 hash and it fits fine for my purpose
177369
you could use an elf hash - c code included or some other simple hash function like that instead of md5 or sha-x
177375
most of the stuff can be done in interop but you need a driver to get the filename cause it lives in the kernel s address space
177376
personally i d use md5 if you need to store in text or a 256b 32b hash such as sha256 if you can store in binary in this situation
177386
now whether you d be better off truncating the sha-1 hash or using a shorter hash such as md5 i don t know
177386
i think i d be more generally confident when keeping the whole of a hash but md5 has known vulnerabilities which may or may not be a problem for your particular application
177393
- if it has arithmetic type it is initialized to positive or unsigned zero
177450
it is easiest to implement a queue fifo rather than a deque or linked list
177451
whether it s private or not doesn t affect the fact that one variable is shared by multiple instances
177468
i have other classes that subclass qpushbutton and qobject respectively but they compile ok
177485
i want to display some information in a listview using the gridview
177532
do you prefer vhdl or verilog and why
177565
buy a cheap starter kit from xilinx or altera the two big fpga players
177565
vhdl is more popular in europe and verilog is dominating in the us
177584
if you keep your view detached from specific controllers and put the knowledge about which view to call from your controller you re well on your way
177605
not counting the space required by the input array and its loop
177613
my account model has the following two associations
177624
apache ant and maven are both build tools which will run on any platform which has java available for it
177636
in this case it is easy to set up some sort of read-only state on data model which will notify model to ignore any event coming from observed objects
177649
take regular breaks from using the mouse and learn keyboard shortcuts
177680
if she doesn t like ruby then python would probably be my next choice but the documentation can be a little dry in places
177682
perl seems like one natrual fit python sounds like a good option
177702
for starters give her a text editor with regex search and replace like notepad++ or scite
177725
i use a javascript to update that value and when posting back the page i want to read the value of that htmlinputhidden field
177725
the value property of that htmlinputhidden field is on postback the default value the value it had when the page got created not the value reflected through the javascript
177725
i also tried to register the htmlinputhidden field with scriptmanager.registerhiddenfield page myhtmlimputhiddenfield initialvalue but it still only lets me read the initialvalue even though i through javascript can inspect that the value has changed
177737
they can handle going one level deep if the top level is not selectable see the optgroup element 1 but beyond that i suggest taking a regular list ordered or unordered with as much nesting as you need remember sublists go inside list items in their parent list and including a checkbox or radio button with each selectable list item
177740
you might now recognize the partial sums problem you enhance the tree so that nodes contain letter distance sum
177744
his monitor is shown briefly while he is working on the code which in fact is not code at all but a makefile.in produced by gnu automake
177795
additionally internal nodes of the tree should keep sets of letters if the alphabet is small and fixed they could be bitmaps that occur in the subtree rooted at a particular node
177798
otherwise you could also add event listeners for appropriate ui events keydown mousedown and prevent their default behavior return false or event.returnvalue false
177804
i am specifically interested in software like mcafee entercept or certain antivirus scanners that patch the kernel
177807
what the question is asking is in statistical terms is whether or not the sequence of numbers form a discrete uniform distribution
177844
also check out opencores.org - there are some articles and a lot of open source code in both verilog and vhdl you can learn from
177844
as far as i can tell vhdl vs verilog gets just as religious as ruby vs python or java vs c#
177854
unless the driver is your core busyness in this case find the person with kernel experience i would strongly suggest outsourcing this work
177874
i have an ibm websphere mq queue running on windows containing many items of varying priority
177887
it s unlikely to do so however and making the inheritance protected or public would avoid this possible trap
177908
ruby fapper perl php fapp
177911
is there any way to set the focus on entering a page the second time
177922
i don t know why anyone would want to call it wisc as these people are essentially saying we will never ever use vb.net ironpython ironruby f# or any other .net language
177922
also calling it .net wisn sounds a bit weird as well since asp.net is the web-technology of .net
177927
i am currently thinking of doing some base methods with generics and reflection to get some generic query methods to reduce the duplication issue 2 i will put a prototype up for review later
177930
if you use logic directly on a bit field it will behave like any other value variable - the logic will be true if it has a value any value and false otherwise
177932
you don t have to use jsf for seam to be useful
177956
what is the best way to convert an int or null to boolean value in an sql query such that
177965
i ve got some code that uses the component categories manager to load all of the classes that implement a particular category
177981
i d personally go with either python perl or ruby since all of them have good support for regular expressions different encodings and xml although i m not so sure about ruby in the unicode department
177993
the listview in comtl32.dll v6.0 does multiple selection when using shift key as follows x means selected
178003
use ssl https
178016
i m trying to select a specific html element in a document for firefox i just use
178023
you could also try sproutcore or cappuccino js frameworks
178032
the problems you would need to solve would be serialization of html into valid xml syncing result of xmldom xpath query with original htmldom
178083
to really be thread-safe every access to the boolean needs to be locked by a nslock object from either thread using such a lock also makes volatile obsolete as variables protected by a lock are implicit volatile according to posix standard
178095
be careful about the dom name of the control control.clientid on the client side ie when you are accessing from javascript as it may change depending where on the page you have declared the control
178111
but by the looks of things this particular issue has already been corrected in the subtext svn revision 3290
178122
if the data import that happened yesterday was one insert of several records you may see a sequence of numbers in the timestamp column like e.g
178182
this code redirects all requests made to files in image folder by nokia symbian iphone and blackberry to a blank image file
178197
it uses boolean values to represent the bits in terms of the api but under the hood i believe it uses an int
178213
this sounds like the php array using named indices is very similar to a python dict
178224
php arrays are actually maps which is equivalent to dicts in python
178239
to assist future googling these are usually called associative arrays in php and dictionaries in python
178274
also you might consider using secured https instead of http
178317
just a piece of general advice your low level class should probably not be using the message boxes itself but should allow an intermediate closer to the interface class to handle cases where you might want a messagebox
178341
and the base functionality between svn git mercurial bazaar all use essentially identical commands to commit view diffs and so on
178341
the small difference in the way git requires changes to be explicitly added before they re committed as opposed to svn s commit everything policy is conceptually simple and unless i m mistaken not even an issue when using mercurial or bazaar
178346
you could have one abstract base class that implements both ifirst and isecond and then inherit from just that base
178395
edit note mercurials biggest difference i ve noted vs git that makes mercurial harder to use for newbies is mercurials default behavior for push pull is like doing git push --all git pull --all which can propagate private branches and add lots of confusion especially as when a new branch turns up mercurial freezes in fear and asks you how to handle it instead of just keeping on trucking as well as the default merge conflict resolution tool on mac just clobbering one set of changes blindly
178414
and those will get put into ppt s for presentation internally and externally
178424
if cross-platform testing is central to your company s business a full size intel-based mac running both os x and windows with parallels bootcamp or vmware for testing may be a better option
178434
in c you can work around these by not linking directly to the library instead you load the library at runtime using dlopen then find the symbol you are looking for using dlsym and assign it to a global symbol that you can name any way you like and then access it through this global symbol
178439
so in your example you can have the login controls on the upper right of the master page and then have the authentication logic in the code page for the master page not your content page
178474
this is to maintain compatibility with legacy code that expects 32-bit semantics for these registers as i understand it
178482
since the user can choose basically any fields from any combination of tables i need to find a way to map the tables in order to make a join and not have extraneous data this may lead to incoherent reports but we re willing to live with that
178494
i use wamp server which is an excellent way of getting apache mysql and php installed and configured without any hassle on windows
178494
one great thing you can do with wamp is add and remove php extensions via a gui pretty much on-the-fly and pgsql is one of them
178503
other than that start your worker thread and make it wait on some manualresetevent or autoresetevent
178546
it also helps connect the dots between javascript and the dom
178551
what about ceil and floor
178551
ceil floor and a number of other mathematical and trigonometric
178555
once you re ready to choose an hdl i heartily recommend verilog having learned vhdl first
178555
yes vhdl was once much more feature-rich than verilog but later revisions of the language verilog 2001 verilog 2005 systemverilog etc.. have cherry-picked most of the interesting features and there is far more robust toolchain support for verilog and its variant these days in addition to it being the dominant language in use in the us in my experience vhdl is only used here when dealing with extreme legacy blocks and in academic contexts partially due to the tools support mentioned previously
178576
implements ceil floor and a number of other mathematical
178580
we are trying to bind a linux machine debian 4.0 to w2k3 ad
178581
however i only have that experience with mysql and postgresql - not with sql server
178602
it would seem you can create a listenermanager which you place as your one and only listener and have it contain the other listeners
178618
the other option is to launch ghostscript which should be free for your needs check the licensing as they have a few different version some gnu some gpl etc. and either use it s built in print function or simply convert to postscript and send to the device
178620
if the creation of orders customers will always be centralized an unsigned integer would be fine
178655
i would bind the background of the textbox instead so that whatever background brush the user set on the user control would flow property value inheritance to the button

indeed chr 0 is used to terminate a string if you want a newline character you can use environment.newline in vb.net or vbnewline in vb6
178841
there is no short answer to this but wikipedia has very good coverage of your options including coverage on mathml math markup language
178860
i m trying to use a microsoft access database for a demo project that i m thinking of doing in either codeigniter or cakephp
178889
here the alert box will popup with the message message and have a single button titled ok which will close the popup when clicked
178907
if i have a complex xml file is there a cheap or free way to get a rough approximation of an xsd from it
178913
note the stickeyness - the set 6 12 13 doesn t have a shared element with 1 2 3 but they get put in the same group because of 5 2 6
178926
there are tools that can analyse your xml and provide an xsd
178926
however note that it can only deduce the xsd from your provided xml so the xsd may only validate that one file correctly
178926
once you ve created your xsd you should consider refactoring it against other xml files to ensure it properly fits the format you want to validate
178937
i choose it because i wanted to move from php to python to have a more object-oriented approch because of the language featrues of python
178948
i m using asp.net 2.0 webforms unfortunately and i can use jquery if it would be useful for this i have very little experience with it
178963
how can i rewrite the identifier rule to use the digit and valid definitions
178966
a lot of problems people have with the prototype library is that their associative arrays break because prototype adds a few useful prototype functions to the array object and for i in x loops pick up those additional methods
178981
this test script ran fine for me in ie firefox and opera
179002
logging behavior can be controlled by editing a configuration file without touching the application binary
179021
you can do this in onkeydown and onchange
179054
there s only one javascript file which has over 719 lines and line 719 is a blank line in this case
179054
none of the html or other files involved in the project have 719 or more lines but the resulting html it s sort of a server-side-include thing at least as ie shows from view source does have 719 or more lines - but line 719 in this case is a closing table row tag no javascript in other words
179076
the best way i found to debug javascript was to add several response.write or alert message near the place i believed the code broke
179107
it s the absolute worst of the mainstream browsers i try to use firefox with firebug or chrome safari to handle most issues
179116
if you re using subversion for all your projects you can simply use svn externals this allows one repository to reference another repository optionally fixed at a particular revision
179120
here the cost is the actual evaluation of the string expression making the message
179121
object will fail the constructor will
179186
-i c gtk include cairo
179218
when using smart pointers or any allocation management object you are counting on the behaviors defined in the constructor destructor to manage refs derefs locks unlocks
179251
you can actually use this same technology to set dynamic values for any variable in your struts.xml using ognl
179291
mechanisms to do this by exec ing through an alternate scripting language python perl etc or a c wrapper which open tmp foobar.pipe with the o_nonblock flag are obvious
179299
i m fairly new at programming but i ve wondered how shell text editors such as vim emacs nano etc are able to control the command-line window
179318
implementation is new curses ncurses and is the approved replacement
179386
as far as i know there s no way to do a blanket delete of any cookie set on the domain
179390
we still prototype things in vb6 and vbscript because they re good at it
179401
put .parent before .hide or .show to show or hide the parent div
179403
javascript has ways to modify other frames using window.frames and using dom traversal just like for elements in the local frame
179403
this basically means that javascript in a frame loaded from example.com can not access the dom in a frame loaded from foo.com
179415
i haven t seen it cause any problems yet and to my understanding the graphics class is legacy code but the java designers didn t want to change the interfaces for swing and awt classes in order to preserver backwards compatibility
179433
add the outputcache attribute to your controller action in order to tell the framework to cache the output for you
179441
none of the various encoding techniques described in the perldoc tutorials encode encoding open are used in the code so i m a little confused as to how the document is actually being encoded
179458
the complications come in with regards to what constitutes the reset value for each field
179468
what i want to do is set the focus to a specific control specifically a textbox on a tab page when that tab page is selected
179470
you can do this using a richtextbox control which will allow you to set the underline style and underline color on any portion of text
179493
in that way index.php works as the front controller it routes all requests to the right location in your application
179515
for example i remember reading that apple put a lot of work in safari to get apple-style font rendering there and i doubt google duplicated that effort
179604
many language tools have separate java c# python versions - but they have a single c c++ version that works for c and c++ due to the strong similarities
179611
let me set the sceen i have never done any substantial system software design before due to the fact that all the projects i have worked on haven t been at that stage
179614
if an idiomatic answer is important they can always specify c c++ c++ with stl c++ with boost etc
179626
visualstudio offers or at least offered a wizard to do a conversion from vb6 to vb.net which could then be converted to c# with a bit of work possibly helped by #develop s vb.net - c# converter but when last i used it for anything non-trivial there was a lot of manual work needing to be done so i suspect you re probably better rewriting or porting by hand if this is a large and or important application
179653
i want to take the value stored in a 32 bit unsigned int put it into four chars and then store the integer value of each of these chars in a string
179657
if you re using annotations i d suggest marking the status if that s the field s name as transient so that hibernate knows it has to get this value from the database every time
179662
then you create a quadtree or octree to hierarchically divide the mesh data
179676
what is the best way to get a file in this case a .pdf but any file will do from a webresponse and put it into a memorystream
179680
each add-in should add a own register-tab to a given container with their own content buttons textfields ... and methods to extend the host-application
179681
the engine also supported multiple output types for the audio and had a client-server mode available
179691
consider that an unsigned 32-bit integer stores over 4 billion values
179698
it doesn t increment or decrement the smart pointer and as such - and more importantly - calls to interlockedincrement decrement are avoided which in turns avoids a memory fence and all the things that go with that bus locking cache invalidation .
179707
without any coding you can set up intellij to run all tests just the quick ones or just the slow ones
179738
just find the max and min datetimes take the difference and divide by the number of datetimes you looked at
179739
if you don t like vba btw you can do the same using vb.net or c#
179739
edit dbb makes a very good point about the selectionchange event not picking up a click when the user clicks within the currently selected cell
179745
i asked this about python and perl earlier
179748
per the specification hibernate or any other jpa provider looks for the persistence.xml file in any meta-inf folder that s on the classpath but i haven t been able to make this work with an uberjar
179749
i admit i haven t learned ironruby ironpython f# or any other .net language yet but i m seriously considering it just to increase my programming arsenal
179750
you can think of the function keyword as a constructor creating a new object a closure each time
179768
also does ms access support db transactions commit and rollback
179782
if it s a gui app switch from swing to awt or maybe eclipse s toolkit it s supposed to be pretty quick
179786
in particular i abhor having to set paths machine-wide #include directories in order to be able to compile because every little additional step you add to the set-up phase in buildign a development machine just makes it harder easier to mess up and it takes longer to get a new machine up to speed generating code
179789
for large ones ie ones beyond just something you and a couple-few people are using you should be looking at a real rdbms like sql server oracle db2 mysql etc
179813
altera and xilinx have simulators build into their free tool sets
179813
for hdl choice verilog is to c as vhdl is to ada
179815
you ll need to push in code from the server to call this function upon page load and assign the return value to a hidden field that can be accessed by the server on post back
179838
extended attributes are supported some filesystems particularly xfs and i think jfs
179849
the tools need to be accessed from windows linux various unix s vms and solaris
179871
provide installation and configuration service
179925
index intersection operators resolve the predicate by calculating the set of rows hit by each of the predicates before any i o is done on the fact table
179946
however if i m not mistake the wizard only migrates vb6 to vb.net
179976
differences between source code and executable version even vanish if you write your application in a language like perl ruby python etc
179997
i wrote an order processing expert system see dsl answer as well converted 100k lines of customer specific perl into about 10k lines of ruby handling dozens of customers
180039
using groovy would you expect better performance in terms of speed and memory overhead to read and query json vs xml
180044
upon selecting a change settings button the program would change the background color of the cells white to indicate to the user that the cell text could be changed
180097
those calls will include methods that have arguments that are primitive types int double etc.
180099
json is smaller and simpler than xml
180103
what is correct way if any to set the title of the document
180112
xml has a bit more overhead than json because of the angle brackets and extra information and what not
180112
any good parser should be able to parse json faster than xml for this reason
180119
i ll also be removing most of the constructors and will have just one constructor because all of the arguments after modelresource aren t necessary to create the object and they can all be changed later through method calls
180149
a lot of folks have been aggressively using a combination of puppet and capistrano even non-rails developers for deployment automation tools to pretty good effect
180162
yes everything that you do between the begin transaction and commit or rollback is part of the transaction
180172
is there any good reason that an empty set of round brackets parentheses isn t valid for calling the default constructor in c++
180196
is a constructor call or a function prototype declaring a function named object with return type myobject and no parameters
180218
you can t checkout a single directory of a repository because the entire repository is handled by the single .git folder in the root of the project instead of subversion s myriad of .svn directories
180239
edit - to clarify i am not looking for authentication authorization or non-repudiation aspects of security here
180302
microsoft access 2000 or later does support the identity property to retrieve the value of an autonumber field after an insert
180353
c++ templates are kind of like lisp macros not c macros in that they operate on the already parsed version of the code and they let you generate arbitrary code at compile time
180358
i like the vcl gui stuff delphi seems more suited to windows api calls than vb6 i really like the fact that it s much better at oo than vb6 and i like the unit-testing framework that comes with the ide
180358
i can handle delphi but i m wondering if c++ builder 2009 might be a better choice for me
180358
i know very little about c++ builder and c++ but then i know very little about delphi either
180358
so for a java programmer that s new to both delphi and c++ builder which would you consider to be a better choice for productive development of win32 exes and dlls and why
180363
in this control there are several child controls like a label a picturebox and a linklabel
180363
this is because there is no mouseenter and mouseleave events on the child control
180399
any aggregation function used during a join to retrieve the max or min or avg value from a joined table will cause the error
180411
of course java sintax is more like c++ than like delphi but i think that the object model is more similar to delphi
180440
while you can put any sql you like in the conditions of a named scope if you then call find_by_sql then the scopes get thrown away
180493
this means that it could log the message in a file and or open a messagebox with the message and a button to continue and another to launch a debug session as per .ini file config
180497
even if you don t use that garbage collecting memory manager i would still recommend delphi over c++
180497
granted c++ builder has the whole delphi vcl and rtl so it isn t as bad as visual c++ but i still think delphi would be a better choice
180497
for excel add-ins as you mentioned in your comment i would recommend delphi over c++ builder because it has better com support which i believe you need for excel add-ins
180513
you might impress your friends to have a spring shale jsf struts project using hibernate along with some other framework you developed yourself but it is really just complexity for the sake of complexity
180514
saying that you know how to program in c c++ is like saying you know how to program in perl php .
180528
python has for example a wonderful solution with jpype that automatizes the process although the same solution cannot be applied to c++ due to c++ and python different natures
180529
but there are still a good set of gems in there to utilize and try when the profiler has found something you can t do any other way ie change algorithmically
180532
the way you would do this is to save off the iterators pointing to the elements you want to erase then erase them all after the iteration is over
180543
use a profiler jprofiler netbeans profiler visual vm eclipse profiler etc
180557
once you know c you might never drop it java uses jni to call c routines for low level stuff python lua etc
180564
which creates a record element that contains name and value elements which in turn contain the values of the name and value variables
180608
if you need at some point to compare some hacked version with some official version you will just pull out from svn the appropriate hacked version number unzip-it and compare-it with the official and externally stored version with winmerge for instance
180626
ideally i d like the hosting process to get the connection string from the config file and pass it to a constructor for my service object documentinfoservice which would hold onto it and use it to pass to business objects as needed
180626
however the servicehost constructor takes a system.type object -- so instances of documentinfoservice are created via the default constructor
180626
i did note that there is another constructor method for servicehost that takes an object instance -- but the docs indicate that is for use with singletons
180630
it isn t quite irrelevant - some version 6 unix stuff escaped into bsd but these days you d be extremely hard pressed to find anything that ancient in current use
180634
probably due to a delphi background and i always make it private to avoid the problem when the inherited is erroneously omitted from a class but a subclass tries to use it
180636
there are 2 main unit test frameworks -- junit and testng
180659
it may be useful to turn padding and margin off on all elements
180674
in particular i don t know if it works with the clang frontend from the llvm project though it should work with llvm-gcc llvm using the gcc frontend
180695
in order to trap repeated clicks on the same cell you need to move the focus to a different cell so that each time you click you are in fact moving the selection
180698
this is portable but nowhere near as inefficient as using printf scanf
180701
under the views i seperate them into namespaces relevant to the controllers if i have a controller to handle inventory transactions i might have it as
180724
i haven t used the c++ builder ide but i d be really surprised if it has a gui builder that s as nice as delphi
180724
although superficially the syntax of c++ looks more like that of java delphi s object model is actually closer to that of java
180739
what you could do is add code to your service object constructor to read the relevant configuration values itself through the configurationmanager class
180782
i did though have a background in basic pascal logo and lisp.
180784
i ve had success with python s win32 extensions and groovy s scriptom libraries on other projects but need to do this is pure java this time if possible
180826
i assume selection of excel file or html report is done in some html control like a radio button or a checkbox
180832
i replaced it with a tiny ultra compact base64 encoder written entirely as one c function i copied the function body into the method body method took nsdata as input and returned nsstring as output however inside the function everything was c
180832
we replaced all nsarray s with normal c arrays objects with structs after all graph coordinate information is nothing you must have in objects enumerator access with simple for loops and started moving data between the arrays with memcopy instead of taking data from one array to the other one index for index
180833
you can use your choice of languages to write scripts jscript vbscript even python
180839
your parameters or commands would be base price local tax city tax state tax ground shipping and coupon discount
180849
by the way if the popup doesn t contain any useful output what you may want to do is submit your form into a small iframe within the page
180873
in addition you could change key change speed add effects etc
180898
markup returned from an ajax call isn t present when you set up the page so it doesn t have any onclick handlers associated with it
180906
it s not identical but vbscript has a dictionary object which behaves like java s map or hashtable
180920
var str this is
180974
in languages like java and python exceptions are very common especially in certain situations
180996
java ee can be a bit daunting with the acronym soup of technologies available but concentrate on the basics ejb3 jndi jms data access like hibernate jdo and container basics

how to debug windows script host vbscript and jscript files
181070
add your ruby bin directory to your path environment variable go to control panel - system - advanced system settings then go to the advanced tab environment variables then edit your path variable and append the path to the ruby binaries install
181081
i m not sure what the support is for chrome but i ve had good luck with it for ie and firefox and allegedly it works with safari
181085
if you re trying to do something which is not a crud web app like twitter which is actually a messaging system or if you are insane and want to use a model like asp.net webforms then you will also encounter problems
181093
use a after_save filter to recalculate the field on anything that can modify that value
181113
if you want an onclick event why don t you use a linkbutton which has the onclientclick event
181132
via mootools i get these anchor elements by id so that once they re clicked a flashy div will popup below them that contains the login or signup form with methods to stop the propagation of events of course
181153
edit olliej sigh nevermind this only works in safari and ie and i can t be bothered downloading a firefox nightly to see if it exists in trunk -
181158
i have a databound gridview in asp.net 2.0 with a row-selection link
181158
when a row is selected i want to programmatically add a table row below the selected row in order to nest another grid et al
181170
will cause its md5 hash to also
181170
change the md5 hash is commonly used
181170
in most unix linux and unix-like
181215
i had to set the height and width to percentages just shy of the full amount 99.99 59.99 39.99 to keep the floats from wrapping probably due to the borders on the divs
181222
btw i run it from a bash shell like so
181224
while the platform sdk comes with command files to set up the correct paths they wipe out any other paths
181226
i am using an authentication attribute on some of my actions in an asp.net mvc page to refer people to a login screen if they have not authenticated
181237
it is messy and every now and then we d build the wrong project configuration for the environment which always took a while to sort out
181245
it serves as a good warning to those of us that don t use bash as our shell because we we ll forget that a feature that s in our day-to-day shell isn t going to be available when this code is run at the appointed time
181252
if you wish to get around that message have at run a script that calls a specified environment be it ksh bash csh zsh perl etc
181291
accept attribute was introduced in the rfc 1867 intending to enable file-type filtering based on mime type for the file-select control
181293
sctp is an alternative to tcp which attempts to address these shortcomings among others
181313
is there a command within the bash shell of fedora that will give me the currently assigned ip address
181341
sucky terminal emulation lack of port forwarding my browser leaks memory at an amazing rate... i tried setting up mod_proxy_connect on top of mod_ssl with the idea that i could send a connect localhost 22 http 1.1 request through https and then i d be all set
181341
http goes through a proxy -- i m not too concerned about my traffic being sniffed as it s ssh that ll be going plaintext through the tunnel -- but it s a lot more likely to be mangled than https which fundamentally cannot be proxied
181341
dag tunnelling ssh over http s has been pointed out to me but it doesn t help at the end of the article they mention bug 29744 - connect does not work over existing ssl connection preventing tunnelling over https exactly the problem i was running into
181348
i d like to instantiate a date object using the following standard constructor
181374
in some cases every field on the form textboxes labels picturebox etc has its value changed
181388
have you refactored from an activerecord to a datamapper pattern
181395
what about mail 25 110 143 telnet 23 ftp 21 dns 53 or even whois 43
181401
go into window - preferences then select java - installed jres clone the jre used by tomcat and add the following to the default vm arguments
181426
i m making a stored procedure that basically concatenates a long string with data from many records
181450
also you can make your code simpler by using isnull or coalesce to handle columns which contain nulls
181492
lots of engineers turn to pre and post processing in python or perl
181492
granted for saving money i d either use octave or skimp on ease and learn to work with sparse matrices in perl or python
181505
is there any way i can push a new record to sqldatareader after i pull a table down
181523
i tested this out in internet explorer 7 firefox 3 and safari google chrome
181563
so it s possible to just create a shortcut on the desktop that opens a browser making use of another account s credentials
181576
but in wss session state is not used by default in moss it is used by infopath form services
181579
list comprehension is a very useful code mechanism that is found in several languages such as haskell python and ruby just to name a few off the top of my head
181597
i am talking about our good friends label textbox button etc
181636
to get help on commands this .bat file will put all commands help into a nice html page
181641
i suggest moving the and keyword to the second line and indenting all lines containing conditions with two spaces instead of four
181692
you can join both t1 and t2 in either order then run task3 after the join
181698
then the easiest way seems to be to move the focus off the selected cell so that clicking it will trigger a select event
181698
another option is to extend the selection by one cell left right up down because this permits editing of the original cell but will trigger a select event if that cell is clicked again on its own
181698
if you only wanted to trap selection of a single column of cells you could insert a hidden column to the right extend the selection to include the hidden cell to the right when the user clicked and this gives you an editable cell which can be trapped every time it is clicked
181754
and forget wpf as there is no support at this time and there may never be although they are working on moonlight aka silverlight for linux
181769
use yourkit or any other good profiler to find out the hotspots in your application
181784
how would you design the remote database access and data serialization deserialization
181801
with regards to mysql in particular there are even slight indexing differences between innodb and myisam tables which are the two most commonly used table types
181811
absolute paths start with and refer to a location from the root of the current site or virtual host
181829
the code used a string as parameter and option strict was off and the developers mainly let vb do its own conversion thing
181839
this isn t going to be fast using mysql innodb it s not going to be fast in oracle or anything else
181861
is there some way to cache a generated report in the reporting services so that i could later export it to some other format
181861
i m currious how is the export button implemented in the report viewer control - does it actually regenerate the report or does it somehow export it
181898
in order to lighten apache s load people often suggest using lighttpd to serve up static content
181898
in this setup apache passes requests for static content back to lighttpd via mod_proxy while serving dynamic requests itself
181898
from what i can see the size of the apache process proxying its request through lighttpd is as large as it would be if it were serving the file itself
181912
there is a long running habit here where i work that the connection string lives in the web.config a sql connection object is instantiated in a using block with that connection string and passed to the dataobjects constructor via a createinstance method as the constructor is private
181919
you don t have an apache process spawned for each request - static files images and the like are fetched directly by lighttpd
181920
there s windows sharepoint services wss and then there is microsoft office sharepoint server moss
181920
moss considerably more expensive than wss which ships as part of microsoft server licensing
181920
edit the feature comparision page is helpful in illustrating the numerous features that moss has and wss does not
181920
how would you describe the differences or additional benefits of moss over wss in a couple of sentences
181920
in essence what are the big ticket items in moss and not in wss
181955
maybe it does reduce the load of apache because it doesn t have to do io to the disk but it will increase the load of lighttpd on the same machine and thus reducing the available load to apache .
181955
maybe lighttpd io access is lighter than that of apache 1.3 but why not just switch to apache 2 or lighttpd completely
181957
there is a lot built in to wss but moss has a ton of extra stuff as referenced in the other answer
181963
and once you are doing that it may be worth considering mixed-mode authentication and use sql login pw for this specific situation
181973
happily you can use sql dcl begin transaction commit transaction rollback transaction etc to acomplish things not possible with dao nested transactions
181988
although the method could change in a future version of the .net framework it doesn t seem likely asp.net heavily depends on it though it s possible they could move it from mscorlib to system.web which is the only assembly that i know of from where the method is referred to
182008
yes lighttpd can also be used as frontend to apache and or fastcgi
182018
i want to put random output from my result set about 1.5 mil rows in a file in a sorted manner
182018
can you tell me is there any algorithm for writing result set rows in a file so the content would be sorted in the end and can i gain in performance with this
182023
in short you write some descriptions about your structures and it compiles to a specialized oop library in java c++ or python that you include in your client and server
182057
most web development frameworks django turbogears etc come with a built-in webserver command that runs on the local computer without apache
182082
what i want to do is to databind object a to a gridview with one of the columns being databound to classb._someproperty
182088
if all the fields validate i create a new table row to show the task and the hide it
182088
next i call the web service again to add the task to the db and on success i show the new row and enable it for deletion editing
182153
do you need to use canvas what you re describing could be done with just javascript and the dom
182180
i would prefer a python or php solution but anything will work
182184
one other option might be to get the data yourself webclient webrequest etc and simply push that html into the webbrowser - but this will mess up external links etc
182185
personally while lighttpd is ok i would go with nginx + fastcgi if you end up going with a lightweight webserver + fastcgi solution
182185
fastcgi the issue here and it doesn t matter if your webserver is apache lighttpd or nginx is figuring out how many fcgi child processes you let each user leave running because each process eats memory equal to the size of the php interpreter in linux not all of it is wired of course but i digress
182185
i do sympathize with the desire to do something interesting like lighttpd + fcgi instead of the standard apache + cgi + suexec but i deep down i really can t recommend it
182199
native drivers for most proprietary and open-source databases such as mysql and postgresql also exist
182246
it is when you start using sharepoint for enterprise level applications and as a primary platform for development that you should consider moss
182253
i have always been using happily the os.path module to deal with file path but recently i ended up with unexpected results on python 2.5 under ubuntu linux while dealing with string that represent windows file paths
182254
there seems to be a library in mono called dataconvert that was written to provide facilities similar to perl s pack unpack
182318
the new office formats docx xlsx etc are zip files that contain a collection of xml files
182324
if you want to access protected methods you could create a subclass of the class you want to use that exposes the methods you want to use as public or internal to the namespace to be safer and have an instance of that class in your class use it as a proxy
182333
it also had the feature to drop the link occasionally as wan links were less reliable for us than local traffic
182344
about wss vs moss
182344
moss allows you to use user profils not wss
182344
search functionalities are cheap in wss compare to moss but you can extend them using search server express
182373
it is basically a listbox that contains a fixed number of elements that are subject to move

are there any tools available for validating a database schema against a set of design rules naming conventions etc
182447
additionally if your app is used either at multiple sites with different server and component configuration or has a changing configuration on the live environment you can use the later stages of testing to verify that the app will handle those changes
182447
as a developer you don t and should not have control of the production environment in particular when your app is being distributed to multiple customers or seperate sites this to me is the real benefit of using both an ioc and external configuration as it is up to the infrastructure production support to tweak and adjust the live environment without having to go back to developers and through test higher cost when all they want to do is move a component
182447
in practice i ve found that even when developing something that you do have control over the environment it will be run on over time it is better to give someone else the capabilities to change the configuration
182454
the likes of monotone git and bazaar have really raised the bar in terms of productivity
182456
or use cmake and a toolchain file to manage the build

because of this i m having rounding problems when comparing two currency values returning different results depending on the machine
182489
written in c++ scriptable in lua has a dedicated editor for scripting
182525
now if you want to just not see it you can use at time 2 dev null to send it off to oblivion but unfortunately the at prompts are printed to stderr for some reason a bug imo - they really should go to stdout so they re also hidden by this
182527
it s certainly easier effort-wise to add the order by to the query
182527
the easiest way is to chunk the data in a sorted collection treeset treemap using a comparator to sort on the column you need
182533
the short answer is that vb6 and vb.net and consequently c# are separate language but related languages
182533
how to switch a large app from vb6 to vb.net
182555
i don t know sql server but i can imagine a microsoft program with its nice gui management would be vastly different to managing db2 z for example although you can use the fancy db2 luw linux unix window tools if you re that way inclined
182563
you also may want to set the id property of each textbox so you can access any specific on you may be looking for down the road
182572
it might need quite a lot of memory for sorting it s not in-place but the performance is much better on sorted arrays and almost identical on random ones the initial sort took almost the same time for both quicksort was only slightly faster
182591
my own docbook pipeline includes python java xerces xalan apache fop and pdf-sam

i want to be able to have both linux probably ubuntu and windows vista on my home computer
182649
you can pass in javascript that registers events on controls after the page has loaded when the html controls on the page are all present in the dom
182654
in c++ i have used sdl and glfw
182654
as far as languages are concerned if you use c++ then i would definitely recommend looking into using something like squirrel lua or python for scripting though writing the entire game in something like python would also be good and should performance start becoming an issue later you can write just the modules that are causing problems in c++ - after profiling of course
182678
it s well supported in linux especially ubuntu
182722
we do it with the entity repository pattern
182722
if you implement row-level view security on a certain entity type via the repository pattern then you must consider other means by which a client could access the same entities
182724
not even ssl https
182724
faster easier registration and login
182744
the identity can be a numeric or an integer in ase12+
182763
i ve tried both vmware and virtualbox both free and i like virtualbox a little better because you can use it with the .iso straight

add one month to the current date and then subtract the value returned by the day function applied to the current date using the functions day and dateadd
182822
however if you are multiplying your currency numbers by floating-point types or dividing your currency values the rounding does need to be worked out one way or the other

often i found outofmemoryexception on ibm websphere application server
182893
it s really a nice python web framework if you don t require everything django and turbogears offers
182897
i would recommend you not bind the width height property of each individual image but rather you bind a layouttransform on the listbox s itemspanel
182899
1 if you are dealing with small data on the client side use a result set implementation that lets you set the cursor to the end of the set get its row offset then reset the cursor to before first

dozer is a bean mapper you can use it to convert say a personejb to an object of the same class
182983
the design review gives a good opportunity to show them how to improve the design so hopefully they will do a better job the next time
182999
you can use the vb6 to vb.net tool as stated in this answer and then use either reflector or sharpdevelop to convert to c#
183033
this has previously been asked for python perl and java
183047
if you d rather go the vm route vmware player works well and i ve heard good things about virtualbox
183056
basically this will dump a backup of the specified source svn repo to a file create a new repo load the backup into it check out the files get a list of files that contain the string to search for perform a regex on each of those files storing the new version in a temp location and then moving the temp file back to the original location and finally checking the changes back into the new repo
183091
i ve looked at ant and maven and they don t seem to be well geared towards remote administration the way capistrano is - they seem much more focused on simply building and packaging applications
183173
specific performance tuning methods vary by database but in general avoid returning more records or fields than you actually need make sure all join fields are indexed as well as common where clause fields avoid cursors although i think this is less true in oracle than sql server i don t know about mysql
183179
the datalist is in an updatepanel so the item smoothly disappears after a half of a second or maybe a little more but what i d really like is for the row to slide out up as soon as they hit the delete button and then have it delete the item on the post back
183205
rules like margin and padding float and clear and so on can all have unexpected consequences on other elements
183209
anyone have pointers for properly handling this situation so that the resources in unmanaged code can be cleaned up and a usable exception can be thrown out to the managed code which initiated the whole call stack

pipe character should be escaped with a single backslash in a perl regex
183280
but when the loop variable equals the limit rather than multiplying by the fraction i subtract the subtotal variable from the total cost and put that in the last department
183290
as you ve already said ant is more a replacement for gnu make while maven is primary a buildout dependency-management application
183290
but if you require additional steps fabric has worked very well for me so far and i assume that capistrano also offers generic shell-command put and get operations
183306
and given the size of the .net landscape it s pretty much meaningless to talk about c# optimization are we talking about winforms asp.net biztalk workflow sql-clr

available languages being ruby groovy java perl or powershell since i d be writing it
183401
i haven t used jpa annotations so i don t know how good they are but i would argue that leaving the mapping of beans to the database in xml is also good as the object shouldn t care where its information came from it should just care what it can do with its information
183422
for example i usually list margins padding height width border fonts display float other in that order allowing for easier readability in my next tip
183462
while groovy is pretty straight-forward since it s basically java i can t say i grok grails
183517
if you create any disposable objects you should either dispose them yourself or make sure you re handing them off to another class which will take responsibility for that
183579
i m working on a seam project which also uses spring and i usually deploy it to different development and test servers
183621
it is generally ok to read the session from your views to hide and show data links
183636
so with the virtualization enabled node selection won t do anything until the treeview is scrolled enough and then it jumps magically to the selected node when the event is finally raised
183636
i d really like to use virtualization because i have thousands of nodes in my tree and i ve already seen quite impressive performance improvements when the virtualization has been enabled
183644
you ll have to hide it before you can use fadein
183658
that can be quite a lot of lines to document a function whose prototype is a single line no just choosing good names for functions and their parameters isn t enough - it can be but often isn t
183658
three lines of comment for every line of code would not be excessive
183660
the only reliable devices are the video the mouse and keyboard
183682
the first sequence will generate only odd numbers the second only even numbers
183685
i know that you can somewhat mimic a set using a dictionary or a hashtable by populating but ignoring the values but that s not a very elegant way
183691
a set is a collection that contains no duplicate elements and whose elements are in no particular order.
183691
the hashset of t class is based on the model of mathematical sets and provides high-performance set operations similar to accessing the keys of the dictionary of tkey tvalue or hashtable collections
183692
hash.to_a creates an array of key-value arrays so the first map gets you
183715
apart from set and orderedset it has a few other usefull collection types such as deque multidictionary bag orderedbag ordereddictionary and orderedmultidictionary
183731
the dom has ways of doing this for us when you re talking about element objects in a document but it looks like you re talking about vanilla objects
183750
look at the documentation for nsarray nsmutablearray and uiimage for more information
183774
i would probably just knock something up in python or perl or awk
183779
the finally tries to close from the outside of any decorated stream first so if you had a bufferedwriter wrapping a filewriter we try to close the buffereredwriter first and if that fails still try to close the filewriter itself
183785
if however you expect to read work on mutate just a few nodes without reading in most of the tree the difference in performance between walking the directory structure and doing multiple seeks reads to traverse a tree stored in a single file will be much smaller and it may well become worth doing the former for simplicity clarity avoiding reinventing wheels
183831
jpeg gif and png can be displayed with the img tag and will work in all browsers the object element can be use for displaying images specifying its mime type but what other graphic formats are supported by img or object tag in most browsers without installing plugins
183851
the file types you listed jpg gif and png seem to be the main formats supported by nearly every browser albeit with certain caveats
183892
i usually spend some time with delphi programming on vacation and most of the other time i use only c++ and masm

about midway through the semester we flipped to parser scanner generators like lex yacc or flex bison
184049
i want the power to do things like run scp and ftp client functions with stable libraries i only picked those two because they re not web-related but at the same time represent pretty common network protocols that any larger app might use
184049
at this point the choices for language are php cake symfony zend python django ruby merb
184056
i find it most disturbing to see so few people around here are actually using maven or at least ant though i prefer maven for the dependency handling.
184059
in operating system theory and afaik this applies to operating systems such as windows linux bsd ... a process is defined as a thread with its own page table its own virtual memory space
184060
i ve got a stand-alone application that consists of several files jar files data files etc and would need to do some pretty standard installation tasks like asking the user for target directories have them locate some parts of their system - choose some of the per-machine or per-user configuration options and possibly try to detect some of the machine settings for them
184060
it would be ideal if it were cross-platform capable linux mac osx and windows
184067
pass the object as a parameter to the second form constructor which can populate the instance fields and return that instance to the calling form
184122
an easy way to give tab controls different labels depending on a field value is to change the caption itself
184127
you can fake it somewhat by doing something like you have suggested basically creating a closure object that maintains the execution environment state
184151
even the margin and padding information is saved in clear ascii
184157
i see that you want some administration tools scp ftp client and ruby has it net sftp and net ftp libraries

184265
the value of the field encryption contains the name of a key possibly also denoting the algorithm used
184285
but that s not how object destruction works in .net when an object goes out of scope it gets put in the finalizer s queue and its destructor doesn t get called until the finalizer gets around to it
184323
you can easily generate them using the diff command and you can apply them using the patch command on linux unix systems these commands are standard
184344
perforce has python wrappers around their c c++ tools available in binary form for windows and source for other platforms
184358
.net is a platform consisting of an execution environment the clr virtual machine and a set of libraries
184358
it s exactly analogous to java or perl or python none of which are ever referred to as frameworks
184358
in most cases the word framework is used for projects like spring or struts or qt which sit on top of a platform ie providing no execution environment of their own like a library
184360
if you are using enterprise library in your data access layer you can create the transaction in .net iterate through your procedure calls then commit rollback all from .net
184364
look into helping the shed skin project which compiles python to c++
184364
determining ways to improve the compilation to c++ would provide phenomenal optimization to python programs
184376
with all of that said i m a freelance php symfony and ruby rails developer
184390
mantain a hashmap from command names to color instances and look up the command name in the map
184403
examples would be base 64 encoding being a hash algorithm where md5 being an encryption algorithm

your ability to do that is more dependent on the structure of the xml than anything else a document with a navigable hierarchy of elements is generally going to be a lot faster to query than one whose elements are all children of the document element

there are a lot of weird serial ports these days usb serial cables bluetooth cell phone modems with gps .
184522
i have a listbox that when in focus and when i have an item selected returns a valid selectedindex
184537
i see in c++ there are multiple ways to allocate and free data and i understand that when you call malloc you should call free and when you use the new operator you should pair with delete and it is a mistake to mix the two calling free on something that was created with the new operator but i m not clear on when i should use malloc free and when i should use new delete in my real world programs
184540
it is worth mentioning that you cannot mix new free and malloc delete
184548
use malloc and free only for allocating memory that is going to be managed by c-centric libraries and apis
184552
ages ago i wanted to do the same and istr that it simply wasn t possible from ddl sql - but you can do it from vba by locating the field table.fields and setting allowzerolength to the required value
184554
i tested it on a blank project with one listbox one textbox and one label used to display the listbox s selectedindex
184554
under both the listbox s selectedindexchanged and the textbox s textchanged events i updated the label with the listbox s selectedindex
184569
note your mysql tables assuming mysql must be of a type that supports transactions innodb does myisam does not
184661
and not the fact that they are slower any ideas on how to make them faster are much appreciated but the fact that the environment must be set up which is much slower atm 1000 sec
184695
then we take long running tests and put them in a nightlycategory so that they only get run during nightly builds and not in the continuous builds that we want to run fast

after reading martin fowler s mocks aren t stubs i ve discovered i ve been practicing tdd in the mockist fashion
184729
but i m wondering if even in mockist tdd if one can take mocking too far

public static void main string args
184798
the new and delete operators can operate on classes and structures whereas malloc and free only work with blocks of memory that need to be cast
184848
i d probably do this with a fairly standard listview - allow multiple selection - and when you change a field in any selected record drop down with more than one item selected it updates all of the items to the same value
184862
messages would work as long as the communication is very simple and the overhead in setting it up is minimal
184881
join the temp table to my list of words and if any rows are returned i know the password contains a dictionary word and i know what substrings matched
184895
unmanaged c++ and managed c# code is perfectly capable of operating in the same process and with a small layer of managed c++ cli you could replace the complexity of interprocess communication with simple function calls

184931
regarding your edit about new lines you can use this template to recursively replace one string within another string and you can use it for line breaks
185051
that means that when the mta thread creates the component it s put into the main sta if one already exists which for asp.net worker processes it won t or a new thread is created specifically for the sta
185051
it doesn t matter which mta thread creates the component the same sta is always used for the components that can t handle the mta model

if you do the above properly your read operations will complete before the connection is closed or a timeout happens and you will have read exactly the response the server sent
185294
from there we modified the logins into various products we use mediawiki wordpress sugarcrm etc. so that if the user is authenticated in the intranet they are automatically logged into these other products as well

it has some nice features like web accessibility with delegation scheduled operation with retry propagation to other things using accounts services com+ apps etc. system account discovery linux unix account management etc
185329
they have a very basic text-format file that you can send to a translator and some preprocessor macros to retrieve the values from the files
185365
to determine whether it s an https request or an ssh request you need to try to read some data with a small timeout this is because tls ssl handshakes start with the client sending some data whereas the ssh handshake starts with the server sending some data
185365
if the http proxy in your company is smart it ll actually eavesdrop on the expected tls ssl handshake when you connect to port 443 and when it detects that it s not an tls ssl handshake it might terminate the ssh connection attempt
185409
so the initialization of b causes an exception in static constructor a and lefts field a with the default value null

i haven t used libusb in quite some time -- but the sysfs error indicates that this is likely to be a kernel problem rather than a libusb one so i d start by trying to track that one down

i couldn t really find this in rails documentation but it seems like mattr_accessor is the module corollary for attr_accessor getter setter in a normal ruby class
185584
i m not aware of anything in python or ruby although a compiler compiler might very well be effective in such a language.
185624
i fixed that by making the function inline but i m afraid that this is a fragile solution because as far as i know the compiler doesn t guarantee inlining even when you specify the inline keyword
185631
running lighttpd behind apache to serve static files certainly seems braindead to me
185631
apache still has to unpack the http packets and parse the request through its parse tree send proxy requests and then lighttpd has to re-unpack hit the filesystem and send the files back through apache
185631
what you will see is people using a lightweight webserver like nginx as a frontend server to serve static files and proxy dynamic urls to apache
185631
i probably could come up with a nightmare configuration for apache that would make it actually slower serving static files than proxying those requests to a backend lighttpd but it would involve enabling expensive features like .htaccess in apache that are disabled in lighttpd so it wouldn t really be fair
185632
as ruby s attr_accessor generates getter setter methods for instances cattr mattr_accessor provide getter setter methods at the class or module level
185642
thus you can call any public protected instance method on templatecontrol
185652
i have a uiimageview and the objective is to scale it down proportionally by giving it either a height or width
185662
i ve also read that scheme or haskell could be better languages to achieve this task

is it possible for you to override an existing control such as a listview or gridview
185673
i don t see anything in the sdk that directly addresses data synchronization nor can i find anything that allows my to hook into the itunes sync process
185673
i could use webdav or http to get put data to a server but it makes the application more complicated
185687
i suppose the most difficult part i m concerned with is being able to template any number of a given set of user controls inside my user control
185693
i don t need anything fancy - just basic http https but a gui is very much preferred over a command line client
185693
i just verified that both smartsvn and rapidsvn mentioned previously require administrator access to insatll on windows just like tortoisesvn

i can see how one could argue that the robot is in the abstract just a data repository -- put left turn put travel 100 meters get outside temperature
185770
using indexof to support getelementsbyclassname in ie can really make a difference because there are no faster alternatives and the classname property s underlying getter setter conveniently replace tabs and linefeeds with spaces
185775
a safe and idempotent method like get though is good for tracking the state of the robot and polling its sensor data
185775
the absolute state of any resources can be set using something like put where multiple messages will not change things any more than just a single message point to north pole or dim front lights to 10 brightness
185781
i m most familiar with python c c++ and perl but any language you prefer is welcome
185812
public static void main string args
185824
if you run both algorithms side by side you will get what i m pretty sure is an asymptotically optimal o min m n lg k algorithm but mine should be faster on average because it doesn t involve hashing or sorting
185825
in flex and many other languages a function method of a class can be declared private or protected or public
185829
thus visibility increases as you go from private to protected to public
185829
in c++ you can control how the visibility of members should be inherited to the descendants by prepending the base class name with the private protected or public keywords meaning you want the visibility of the base class members to be at most at that level
185829
in each of the cases above the descendant classes are of course able to introduce their own private protected and public members
185862
if i don t write it in perl i will write it in c++
185862
speed and compilation aside why should i use c++ over perl
185864
you have to have a line int foo i some where in your code to tell the compiler where to put it otherwise you get a link error
185892
your constructor can accept the object you want but call their constructor in an unaffected fashion
185912
visualsvn automatically creates svn ignore rules for binary and user-specific folders as soon as you add a solution to subversion
185913
i d suggest a lua c++ or a python c++ combo i m not sure how well a perl c++ combo works but that may be a good option too
185913
personally i ve done a bunch with the lua c++ combo and it s pretty fantastic
185943
if you re at least as experienced in perl as in c++ development in perl should be faster
185954
yes you need to create an nsautoreleasepool in your method unless you are creating a concurrent slightly unfortunate nomenclature nsoperation subclass and your overridden method creates the nsautoreleasepool before calling nsoperation main
185978
3 use javascript ajax calls to manipulate the dom if you need to change the title after the load event
185997
any symlink to the file in bin would be broken by this but a hardlink being a link directly to the inode for the file wouldn t care
186008
serialization deserialization
186035
when a h3 is clicked the div directly below after is revealed with jquery s slidedown function while all other divs are hidden with the slideup function
186037
is there any way to validate the width and height of image when uploaded
186060
relative positioning is nice if you can pull a totally fluid layout because it will look reasonable on a large range of screen resolutions
186076
i personally recommend the python option though it may not be relevant if you know perl but not python
186107
easily add email support to your visual basic 6 vb6 asp asp.net vb.net c++ c# foxpro access powerbuilder or delphi application
186109
many decent text editors have the option as well vim emacs editplus and so on
186140
one of the most classic ones is the comment made by pierre de fermat about his well-known last theorem the margin of this page is a bit too small to write down the proof
186175
others have mentioned sed and awk and it s no surprise that perl was inspired by them
186193
the new backup will not take up any extra space apart from any changes you ve made since all the incremental backups will point to the same set of inodes for files which haven t changed
186208
creating your own style is often not really an option because it requires you to dig quite deep into the very advanced features of tex latex and fighting your way against possible incompatibilities with document classes packages whatnot
186237
through caveman debugging ie nasty printf messages all over the place i have determined the test method where the code is crashing though unfortunately the actual crash seems to happen in some destructor since the last trace messages i see are in other destructors which execute cleanly
186245
visual basic 5 control creation edition might be suitable to tide you over until you can get hold of a full version of vb6
186253
i just check out the project which contains only source and no dependencies and if i want to import it into eclipse all i have to do is run mvn eclipse eclipse and all is set up for me
186254
i m both a c++ and perl programmer
186254
c++ is a nice language but whenever i have the choice i go with perl since development simply proceeds so much more quickly
186254
more so in c++ than in perl but it really always comes down to discipline and being able to test on many platforms
186265
first both virtualbox and vmware server are great products and since both are free each is worth evaluating
186265
also there is a vmware scripting interface called vix which one can use to directly install files to the vm without needing to install ssh or sftp which is a big advantage
186278
the next time i would probably try izpack because it seems to support ant as well but has nicer guis
186294
you could use combination of a bug tracker jira mantis bugzilla and test case management tool like testlink
186297
just like vmware gives support for vmware server sun gives support for virtualbox
186313
once it is put in there it gets replaced with a new div which is both draggable because you can junk it by moving it back to the palette and droppable because you can add ingredients to it
186376
in some cases though the compiler will replace foreach with a for-loop i believe when iterating over arrays
186399
if you build your web app into a rpm debian pkg etc then it can drop the files into etc cron.d and have the jobs run
186428
i didn t find out how to export a constructor so i went with using a factory method static which will return new instances of an object
186473
assuming the request goes through jquery put a debug statement in the jquery source get function that kicks in if the url is
186489
while evaluating some of the web control suites for a decent grid i noticed some of them had export to xls csv pdf built in
186521
also keep in mind that what you need to test is the public api of an object not it s protected private methods
186521
so as long as the public methods fulfill tests the protected methods will be covered too
186534
when i use the scroll button on my mouse and then click a cell and click the escape button or select another cell the grid will reposition it self
186553
can i send a mouse click event to it programmatically
186561
edit to elaborate a little the problem here is that hibernate keeps a persistence context which is the objects being monitored as part of each session
186569
unix linux
186583
vba is quite different from python so you should read at least the microsoft visual basic help as provided by the application you are going to use excel access
186641
there s something about vb6 vba that makes them feel unnatural to me
186661
jobs consist of a series of steps to be executed in order and when you add a new step to your job you can choose various types of step including transact-sql script
186668
no matter if you use safari or firefox or possibly another browser it is standard or mac that browsers search their plugins in that folder
186687
i ve found it extremely easy to use and there are tips for integrating it with vi m emacs and even textmate if you use that
186690
then assuming you are using an xunit-style test library cppunit googletest unittest++ or whatever you can add various testxxx functions to a single class to test out associated groups of functionality
186788
if all you want to do is put a bullet point on your resume to get past the agents just add it that will get you past the agents and give you a chance to get your foot in the door
186811
i ve only used it in oracle 9i against mysql and found that in our cases it didn t work very well as it ended up using up massive amounts of ram we still use it but now just use it for syncing to a local table rather than doing live queries against it
186842
tcp and udp are still addressed as they are under ipv4
186845
the only thing that changed between the two versions is the addressing scheme dhcp dhcpv6 and icmp icmpv6
186845
so basically anything tcp udp related including the port range 0-65535 remains unchanged
186846
i m pretty certain that ports only have a part in tcp and udp
186850
the tcp and udp layer is the same structure
186850
ipv6 as the name implies is about the ip layer being enhanced not the tcp or udp layers
186865
i find the xml markup very easily readable therefore i don t think that advantages of json or yaml make a difference here
186868
as you already require java 1.4 you should consider some small changes to take into use swing gui instead it solved our applet refresh issues with awt
186871
use a content-disposition attachment header but stick with the correct content-type
186907
but when the parameter type is a primitive value int then if this parameter is assigned to within the method the value of the argument that was passed in will be changed after the method returns
186911
in many ways it s the same as using the out keyword but with the minor difference that there s no guarantee that the method will actually assign anything to the ref ed parameter
186922
i m looking for a log viewer with similar capablilties as chainsaw in which i can tail glassfish log files over for instance ssh scp
186972
for a given seed the same sequence of numbers should be produced
186972
test your prng by generating a large sequence say 10 6 numbers and perform several statistical tests on the sequence particularly the chi-squared test if the distribution is normal
186990
i ve heard that configobj is easier to work with than configparser
187003
a json or yaml seems to have a cleaner syntax than creating something with xml
187009
i have routes like x path where the path parameter is used by the controller to navigate a tree structure to end up with a resource which is served to the client
187009
it should be possible to add these other controllers so that the main controller does not have to be aware of their existence
187009
i could use a constraint to only match my additional routes if the path parameter ends in y for example but then the controller would have to be aware of the extension added to be able to remove it when parsing the path - this is not acceptable
187021
i don t have experience with visualvm -- but jrockit s profiler does provide this information
187024
i think if you go with delphi you will find it more easier after few times of using also it has more third party support and some of the features introduced in delphi before c++ builder
187032
the only impact on your php would be in the self-facing links you re publishing which you d want to switch from to there s a _server https variable you could use to trigger this change if you ll be accepting both ssl and non-ssl connections
187043
more complicated scenario when security is a concerm would require the use of scp or sftp over and ssl connection
187052
the date data type is based on the double data type with range checking min max date values plus a considered epoch
187059
in total there are 10 tabs and about 150 controls in a page controls like drop down list textbox radiobutton listbox only
187079
it seems that you are expecting internal classes used in the wcf service which you have marked as datacontracts to be exported as .net objects to your client code the silverlight ui
187083
if not you could do far fewer updates but only updating the most recent rows moving them into gaps
187091
the first step identifies all lines which have a new line followed by a numeric value
187108
so if you actually want logging to use v2 instead of v1 you will need to modify configuration files to say that a reference to v1 should be pointed on to v2
187146
why is the order of tables important when combining an outer an inner join
187153
another reason for wondering about the role of a dba in this type of application is that the bulk of our performance issues are most likely above the persistence layer it s not that the database hibernate or jackrabbit are too slow it s that the way we have structured our data and push it around is not very good
187169
usually in regards to installation customization upgrade paths etc
187185
then you can just put and get whichever files you like betwen the current directory on the linux box and your windows server
187198
this might though lead to a lot of duplicated nodes on the tree to cope up with all the possible sequences ending on that specific move with different effects which might be a pain to maintain but i am not sure
187199
the google ajax approach is very clean and easy to use and would be perfect i think but my major knowledge comes in asp.net and windows forms .net
187206
perhaps using octal or binary to store your format types as a bitmask
187224
for an inner join the order of the tables is not important
187227
from memory solaris kept the mtoolkit as the default longer than on linux
187241
i ve also modified configuration stuff to fit my environment
187305
the rows from the sqldatasource display fine in the formview and i can edit them
187384
so i changed the field control base type to spfieldmultichoice and the fld_types to multichoice and still get the same result which is only the first value that s selected writing to the sharepoint list
187414
while they ve been around since the days of algol i didn t start hearing about them until fairly recently when python and ruby became very popular
187418
before calling render set the for a tag that contains a large chunk of the page you don t need the layout manager to manage
187473
number of commented out lines per line of production code
187537
is there a case insensitive version of the contains jquery selector or should i do the work manually by looping over all elements and comparing their .text to my string
187569
a daemon under linux typically listens to signals like the kill signal but there are others that allow it to do things like a soft restart reads back in configuration and so forth
187593
we are trying to get our .net devs to use the asp.net development server vs2008 for web development instead of a local instance of iis
187601
if you want to use win32 ports of some unix utilities rather than installing cygwin i recommend gnu utilities for win32
187675
however if you need the accurate size of the list when the reader needs to know it you ll have to put a critical section around every size call in addition to the one you have around the add and erase calls
187679
that s why ssl on vhosts doesn t work too well - you need a dedicated ip address because the host header is encrypted
187693
i d go with the default arguments especially since c++ doesn t let you chain constructors so you end up having to duplicate the initialiser list and possibly more for each overload
187693
that said there are some gotchas with default arguments including the fact that constants may be inlined and thereby become part of your class binary interface
187693
another to watch out for is that adding default arguments can turn an explicit multi-argument constructor into an implicit one-argument constructor
187707
there are similar issues in perl and c++ in getting a dropdown in the right place filling it with the right values making the proper change in the program state from user input
187707
if perl isn t getting it done on certain platforms transform the code to c++
187713
the integer part can be represented by a signed or unsigned integer data type
187713
the fractional part is represented by an unsigned data integer data type
187713
if a 8-bit unsigned integer were to be used for fixed-point math then the fractional part would be split into 256 evenly divisible parts
187717
https http over ssl sends all http content over a ssl tunel so http content and headers are encrypted as well
187718
i assume your using hibernate jpa as a persistence provider
187736
the script will run on a unix like system linux or mac
187742
how can i determine if there s a public set not just any set
187780
write your core functionality in c++ then write the front-end for your application in the tool for the platform in question cocoa for mac os x .net delphi mfc for windows etc
187790
cruisecontrol.net rather than normal cruisecontrol is what i d recommend although i have limited experience here
187795
my page actually looks like this where query advancedsearchfields is basically including a flex form into the page and i want it to show hide the custom view below after the search is complete
187816
perhaps try a scaled-integer approach use a 32 or 64 bit integer and programmatically allocate the last say 6 digits to what s on the right hand side of the decimal point
187909
however before you embark on creating classes that look like your data i wonder if you couldn t simply use gzip or pk zip to compress the data and transfer it as is
187917
if you have permission to read but not write a file the buffer you get when you visit the file c-x c-f or find-file will be put in read-only mode automatically
187939
if creating constructors with arguments is bad as many would argue then making them with default arguments is even worse
187939
the use of default arguments is bad for two reasons
187939
when other programmers see that the majority of the calls don t contain any arguments they will do the same remaining blissfully unaware of the default behavior your default arguments impose on them
187939
also it s worth noting that the google c++ style guide shuns both ctor arguments unless absolutely necessary and default arguments to functions or methods
187946
you can see it in action at works in ie ff safari opera
187949
can you post the rewrite rule here
187969
if you find yourself writing similar functionality in all of your controller classes make a base controller class that has the functionality and then inherit from it or move the functionality into another class and call it from there instead of repeating it in all the controllers
187987
i inherited an nhibernate site written in asp.net 1.1 using nhibernate 0.6 and .net remoting to the dal layer residing on the database server
187990
i m not a c++ developer but i ve always been interested in compilers and i m interested in tinkering with some of the gcc stuff particularly llvm
188016
matter of style but as matt said definitely consider marking constructors with default arguments which would allow implicit conversion as explicit to avoid unintended automatic conversion
188046
getprefferedsize used to return the same object that you gave with setpreferredsize everything also goes for min max size so what we would do is call setprefferedsize on every scaling component with a particular subclass of java.awt.dimension then we would walk the component hierarchy and update each scaling component whenever the resolution changed
188084
i this example i did twoway binding with textbox es on each node but when it comes to editing just one node at a time in a separate single textbox or other control you would be binding it to the currently selected item of the treeview
188086
if so i got this awhile ago just type resize and use the arrow keys to adjust width and height
188153
what we did was create a datacontext object that inherited from the generated datacontext and overrode the default constructor with the correct connection string from our web.config
188172
plus add in any conversions from hex to decimal etc
188206
sam s answer gives the reason that default arguments are preferable for constructors rather than overloading
188208
there seem to be two bash idioms for redirecting stdout and stderr to a file
188227
it was nice for vb6 vbscript which were loosely typed but .net is strongly typed making the warts well wart-ugly
188230
might be useful for cases where you aren t redirecting stdout to somewhere else but rather you just want stderr to be sent to the same place such as the console as stdout perhaps if the command you are running is already sending stderr somewhere else other than the console
188242
i can understand why not all data types would be supported from mysql oracle postgre sql and so forth
188278
where sends both stdout and stderr to wherever 2 1 sends stderr to where stdout is currently going at that point in the command line
188278
where the former is redirecting both stdout and stderr to file the latter redirects stderr to where stdout is going before it is redirected to the file in this case probably the terminal. this is useful if you wanted to do something like
188278
where you want to use less to page through the output of stderr and store the output of stdout to a file
188281
i m wondering if this is a bug but at the same time i think it s rather likely that i m simply not understanding something very basic about how you re supposed to work with tthreads in delphi
188320
so with you can write something like and get stdout and stderr output appended to the log file
188365
however svn svnadmin provides hot copy and dump commands that are as easy to run as your copy command and they are guaranteed safe
188380
to get the average of the minimum values for each incnum you could write this sql
188415
the situation where the two lines have different behavior is when your script is not running in bash but some simpler shell in the sh family dash which i believe is used as bin sh in some linux distros because it is more lightweight than bash
188463
is it possible to direct subdomains to either php or ruby in the individual v-host definitions
188526
also be aware of systems that may have multiple processor groups which is often seen on computers with a large number of processors
188532
additionally is there a way to specify default values for the arguments to this function typedef
188536
instead store the password in a configuration file such as web.config app.config etc or the windows registry or a file in etc or any other place which developers don t have access to on the production environment but you do
188559
as for your new question added 20 oct 08 additionally is there a way to specify default values for the arguments to this function typedef
188560
log in to the ws as a regular user no root allowed all external ports locked down print a document with 24blank lines - which rotated the paper feed knob and the ruler pressed over the reset on the super special hardware
188562
i will throw up the perl and python code i have as well as soon as i find it
188563
i believe you need to replace the jlist with a single column jtable
188588
if you update to java 1.6u7 or better you ll get access to the visualvm tool that is essentially the same as the netbeans profiler
188595
assume you only want functions of the signature unsigned short id_for_allowed_functions int x char y
188658
is it a folder which exists outside of website directory
188660
on your local development machine perhaps everything gets loaded so quickly that the dom tree is complete by the type your javascript is called but on the production server perhaps things are not yet complete
188672
you could display a div with an animated gif image as a loading prompt
188677
any time i ve needed something like this i replace the element that will be loaded with a simple centered animated gif of some sort that says loading please wait or a similar message
188678
fire the jquery load mechanism on the animation s onload event so you re certain the animation has loaded first and use a callback at the end of your loading sequence to disable hide the animated gif
188708
a couple i found for jquery are jqmodal and simplemodal
188720
is there any way to in one query subtract 2 cars from bob and add 2 to john
188728
if the constructor doesn t finish executing the object doesn t exist so there s nothing to destruct
188734
i ve had good results using jqmodal a plugin for the jquery framework that lets you define modal dialogs but it s by no means the only option
188761
you can define them outside of the self object but then you get a mismash everywhere in your object where you re trying to figure out if size_of is a private method or defined globally somewhere else
188785
u ll need sftp or ftps to avoid transmitting clear text
188807
take a look here base64 encode decode files with vbscript
188837
gnu grep which is included in cygwin supports two syntaxes for regular expressions basic and extended
188843
so much can get done quickly when you put the right people in a room and hammer out things on a whiteboard
188845
this ability or the lack of it is built into the various testrunners console awt swing ant maven or the one built into eclipse etc
188871
it generates random words sentences using determinated rule you choose the site contains very funny things but in italian only the rules can be written in any language.
188882
while an object destructor won t be called if its constructor throws the object never existed the destructors of its internal objects could be called
188882
thus you ll have to write this this way using stl or even boost
188896
this happened with the previous version of perl 5.8 and windows 2003 and iis 5. anyway basically i put in a carp or a warn and i get an error message and then some garbage text
188917
now it s also supported in firefox 3 and safari i m not sure which version but at least 3.1 and highter but not the iphone
188947
somebody mentioned adobe distiller server -- check your docs for acrobat i know it comes with basic distiller and you may be able to set up distiller to run in a similar mode where it watches directory a and spits out pdf versions of any files that show up in directory b
188986
you project then only needs to pass the users credentials through as it does anyway and you can then let sql server security handle the issue
188990
security features authentication authorization and encryption
188999
macros we do not have any macro to compare as we only have the autoexec macro with one line launching the main vba procedure
189003
we are using ibm websphere transformation extender which has lots of other problems too and the mapping tool of biztalk is a joke in comparison to wtx
189004
as a trivial example compare quicksort implementations in java and ocaml or better still haskell on this page
189012
disclaimer once a php coldfusion and perl developer

is there any way to set the same icon to all my forms without having to change one by one
189071
each comparer has a case-sensitive as well as a case-insensitive version
189111
edit dzinx s timings actually show that the impact of the extra check for b_item isn t really significant next to the performance penalty of re-looking up by index so the above using izip seems to be fastest
189116
perl developers are learning python
189128
i have an app that currently has about 7000 machines calling a .net web service using wcf
189162
declaring it inline makes it a candidate for inlining it does not mean a lot nowadays in c++ as the compiler will inline or not sometimes ignoring the fact the keyword inline is present or absent
189164
my guess is that most of the message classes have about zero difference
189170
implementations of the html5 parsing algorithm html5lib python ruby validator.nu html parser java javascript
189188
my experience with various soap stacks on different platforms java .net ruby php is that in this case you re probably looking at an order of magnitude difference in processing such a simple message
189190
no sed awk grep perl whatever
189228
however it starts to get messy when you have two put methods because although the method returns void you seemingly have to cast it to a strongly typed delegate to end the invocation
189228
any ideas on how to end the invocation without a cascading set of is checks
189236
consider technologies like sproutcore gwt or extjs which put the layouting code fully on the client making the server responsible only for data marshalling and processing and easily replaced
189244
the recommendations should have some sort of direct relationship with either xaml or silverlight wpf and not the common .net utilities
189248
the architecture of smalltalk is somewhat insular whereas python and ruby were built from the ground up to facilitate integration
189248
smalltalk never really gained a body of hybrid application support in the way that python and ruby have so the concept of smalltalk as embedded scripting language never caught on
189248
ruby and python are much easier to learn and to bring new programmers up to speed with
189248
ruby and python work in a more conventional toolchain and are not tightly coupled to a specific development environment
189248
testing code with highlight and show it is still a very nice feature that i have never seen in a python ide although i can t speak for ruby
189259
in your initial in query the notation would be valid whether or not othertable contains a column nameid and indeed whether otherdesc exists as a column in table or othertable - which is not clear in any of your examples but presumably is a column of othertable
189261
i think the best we can hope for is to break open the nunit jar file that comes with teamcity and writing a custom task that integrates nunit2 and ncover
189277
since in c++ when an exception is thrown in a constructor the destructor does not get called but dtors for the object s members that have been constructed do get called this is a primary reason to use smart pointer objects over raw pointers - they are a good way to prevent memory leaks in a situation like this
189288
i m having to 3 times daily login to this website we have at work select a few form elements and then click on submit to get a report printed out

http version 1.1 added a special http method connect - intended to create the ssl tunnel including the necessary protocol handshake and cryptographic setup
189399
prepare execute it for each value and union the results client-side
189399
prepare and execute it
189400
you can call a system command if you re under linux unix file if you like
189403
edit alternatively you can assign a weight like function points or story points to each story as a measure of complexity then add up the points for each completed feature and compute velocity in points iteration
189410
imagecreatefromstring to read an image in from a stream but i m not sure whether you can get the size of the resulting object as required by s3- inputresource above - getimagesize returns the height width etc but not the size of the image resource
189486
you may want to set up a global ajax event to show hide the loading icon
189509
on windows the .emacs file may be called _emacs for backward compatibility with dos and fat filesystems where filenames could not start with a dot
189526
if you do i would recommend mono which is a .net free implementation or java both platforms work well in windows osx linux
189526
of course there are many other alternatives remember osx is a unix operative system you could easily develop with python perl ruby and many other scripting languages and development technologies just be sure to know what platforms are you going to target
189534
my question is i am required to also use commit tran and rollback tran is each of my stored procedures if i am using the transactionscope class in my .net class library
189578
safari nightlies and is already supported in firefox 3
189584
well back in 2005 i used gentoo linux and i used a lot a small program called genlop to show me the history of what i ve emerged installed on my gentoo box
189585
the easiest way to handle it across a variety of platforms is to use http basic authentication and https for the transport layer
189627
if you have built your models in a way that follows those conventions of rails you can take advantage of rails associations by saying that the group model has_many people and that the person model belongs_to group
189644
i already know that i ll need to develop a plugin architecture for authentication authorization will be handled internally and to derive demographic data from an external directory
189661
gizmo s comment states that safari and opera support
189668
i also suggest you reading the section emacs startup strategy in usr share doc emacsen-common debian-emacs-policy.gz for more ubuntu debian specific information
189679
it has excellent support for both bugzilla and trac
189778
if you refer to classic vxworks rtos kernel they define three mechanisms
189811
if the factory is just populating objects with data then that is an appropriate use however if it is populating objects with data in addition to doing other things then it is best not to add the data stuff
189817
specifically i m looking for a framework that support dynamic distribution across the grid cloud but replaces the transient agent with a more persistent service
189830
when trying to do export of csv file using the following codes
189835
in your example you could simply pull merge your change into the integration upstream repository and push it directly up to the remote server
189842
when you use a null filehandle it actually reads from the magical argv filehandle which has special semantics it reads from all the files named in argv or stdin if argv is empty
189853
assume i need to do all sorts of funky queries min max group etc. with the datasets as describe from above would it be slow or not to the point that it makes better sense to have multiple database strategy eg
189854
then you could use that code to show or hide a textbox to display a message
189855
particulary i want to implement an n-ary tree not self-ballancing with an unbound number of children in each node in which each node holds an already defined struct like this for example
189888
setup up server combination of your choice apache lighttpd nginx thin etc.
189918
if you want to reset to the default simply right click the property and select reset
189976
i am building a tool that displays business objects in various ways ie tree nodes list view items combo boxes text fields etc
189987
you will be tempted to try and write some magic dal that can support oracle mysql vistadb sql server etc
189988
an idiom commonly used in oo languages like python and ruby is instantiating an object and chaining methods that return a reference to the object itself such as
189993
when i use apachebench to test https the error is returned ssl handshake failed
189996
often you can find at least one field which is never 0 null for normal elements and if not you can use some other special end value
190015
david is correct stopping a service is accomplished via a unix signal and you should use a signal handler to catch it
190052
and of course you could always move to ruby or python
190089
groovy accepts the vast majority of java syntax
190112
for primitive types arguments int boolean float ... or string every combinations of limit values for a string xxx null
190112
for non-primitive types build an instance of those to be passed to the constructor of the object to test meaning you recursively have to consider the constructor parameters of that parameter primitive types or not
190117
you can move this code into module mixin this module in all controllers you need and use self.class variable inside module to figure out concrete controller name
190123
i think vonc s on the right track but i would even settle for something less sophisticated such as a parameterized test that takes in the .class object for which the object methods are being tested followed by a variable number of constructor args
190134
install this tool on each tier and watch the http traffic and packets
190149
once they re used up you can shuffle again - since the prng is so large you ll be able to go through the 10k numbers many times before duplicating a sequence
190158
all the fuzzy copies of your original element get a class of .dropshadow and get grouped into a container element which also has a class of .dropshadow and gets stuck into the document right after the original element thus the + selector
190198
i m guessing it is an encoding problem but i ve tried about 8 different variations of methods for calculating an md5 hash in .net and none of them match what i have obtained in javascript or from the web site
190199
in my hobby work i have the locale-specific strings stored in a simple external json file xml or even a simple ini would work just as well anything that can give you key-value pairs
190245
but mainly it is controlled by the inline keyword and compiler switches for example you can have it auto inline small functions even without the keyword. its important to note that debug compilations should never be inlining as the callstack will not be preserved to mirror the calls you created in code
190270
to access the features of asp.net iis with the latest security updates must be installed prior to installing the .net framework
190306
the derived table s class contains only the different elements
190316
you can apply compiler theory here and generate your scanner and parser using flex bison lex yacc or whatever tools
190376
we came across some code that is using hashcode as a salt source for md5 encryption but this raises the question will hashcode return the same value for the same object on different vms different jdk versions and operating systems
190393
linked lists provide o 1 addition and deletion but o n lookup whereas arraylists provide o 1 lookup but o n arbitrary add and delete
190394
in python and ruby it is only possible to use multiple cores is to spawn new heavyweight processes
190405
i wrote my url actually iri internationalized pattern to comply with rfc 3987
190405
you ll need to double-escape backslashes except where the backslash has a special meaning in regex
190434
incday - add a or subtract a number of days
190434

190443
btw have you tried migrating control arrays from vb6 to vb.net
190462
there s a good article here which talks about enabling cookies and other authentication methods to get you an authorised login and allow your screen scrape to get you behind the log-in wall
190463
for a site that does form-based authentication you usually need to visit the login page accept and store the cookie then submit the cookie information with any http requests you make
190464
how much of an operating system could be written in a language like python ruby perl or lisp haskell etc
190470
jeffrey richter documents an almost identical case in clr via c#. when a hash does need to be stored i d prefer it to be calculated in a way which is always guaranteed to be stable - md5 or a custom interface implemented by your types with a guarantee of stability
190481
oses have been done in java jnode .net mosa singularity sharpos cosmos haskell house python unununium etc
190482
higher level languages like python perl etc could handle it fine but it d be alot slower and would take alot more memory for instances of interpreters
190488
if your protocol runs over http you can do this in a standard way by using https
190493
also with my old 1.x firmware way it required me to capture touch events and hide show the control myself
190514
for growing arrays malloc realloc free is the way to go in c and std vector or any other generic stl container is the way to go in c++
190531
in particular i want to cast a decimal int to hex and then output as a string.
190587
i realize that pushing files out with the build scripts is easy but i d like to minimize changes to the ant nant files since i m looking at scaling this to 100 apps
190593
i ve put the findcontrol instruction in the page load method after the code which creates them but get an error
190603
lines longer than 200 characters will appear in more than one line
190622
actually there is a possible approach- if you just want to run asp.net programs with ssl you can use cassini + apache http proxy nginx for windows
190632
so what you have to do is to open that main document part identify the w headerreference elemnt inside the section w sectpr element
190666
the shipment table contains n record per order and any record shipment entry can be changed before the customer accepts th order after which it is frozen
190686
perhaps you d benefit from switching to a distributed version control system like git or bazaar
190701
update 2 i put the formula for two mutually exclusive events above instead of 2 independent ones as getting an a the first time doesn t mean you can t get an a the second time
190744
it somehow feels to me you should strcpy instead of memcpy
190750
the obvious fix is to use strcpy or strncpy
190772
i know the files exists in the places that it is looking and there is obviously no username and password to an xml xsd file
190819
for a new project with flash i was looking for something along the lines of standard libraries for basic programming needs along the lines of python or ruby standard libraries
190843
given that you don t know which packets contain a password and which don t you d have to decrypt all encrypted traffic to find the right one
190885
if my body of source text uses communities more often than community then map communiti - communities. a dictionary-based approach will be more accurate in general and building it based on the stemmer input will provide results customized to your texts with the primary drawback being the space required which is generally not an issue these days
190912
i ve run into a problem where i m getting two printouts of my etc motd file on gentoo linux
190912
i m running the bash shell for what it s worth
190912
i don t think it s bash as when i change etc passwd to use bin ksh for my shell i still get the motd displayed
190966
if you have the resources as the question implies you do you get the users to supply copy and designs in what they do know powerpoint word fireworks etc and get the people who can do a correct implementation but who might not be able to write decent prose etc to put it into the html cms magicthing
190971
if you got used to procedural programming c java perl php etc you are going to miss a lot of common structs or you will wonder about things that just luck cubersome and sometimes not really readable by an untrained eye
190988
i didn t find any property or method to set the character set of data i have to send
191017
i tested firefox 3.0.3 and safari 3.1.2.
191048
it helps to use software such as rally and basecamp to manage the process
191051
manually unwinding loops might be innefficient on newer processors but they can still be useful on gpus and light architectures such as arm as they are not as good as current generation cpus processor at predicting and because tests and jumps actually waste cycles on those processors
191062
the three i ve heard of are cherrypy turbogears and pylons
191062
however i m confused because turbogears seems to use cherrypy as the controller although isn t cherrypy a framework in in it s own right
191069
worlds of ruby python and perl
191069
engine works with mysql postgresql
191069
handle html xml rss atom csv rtf
191083
note this is the way it works in linux it could work completely differently in solaris
191100
you could start your onchange method with you may have to modify this for your language of choice you ll probably get a flicker but it should put it back quickly enough
191167
as you can imagine the database has to trust the webserver to do no evil or this could be an extremely dangerous security hole
191209
by default copying from the command prompt will prompt you to overwrite files that already exist in the target location
191228
although for some reason the setlineedit function is protected on qabstractspinbox but public on qlineedit
191242
i ask because sometimes ssms is a little heavy weight when i just want to look through the database and find one record and sqlcmd doesn t really seem like a good choice when browsing through a lot of different records or a lot of large records
191266
player framework to play a movie
191267
no need to explicitly set smartindent since vim s included perl syntax file will set it and any other perl-specific customizations automatically
191306
i want to force the current execution line to a specific line in the same function possibly skipping intermediate lines
191318
all of the common javascript libraries prototype extjs dojo jquery yui etc
191336
cherrypy is not a full-stack web framework like django for example in fact it isn t a web framework but a http framework
191386
the account contains a profile object which can be set in the constructor of each polymorphic account type
191425
as for tool recommendations i ve used finalbuilder visual build pro msbuild team build nant cruisecontrol and cifactory plus and good old fashioned batch files
191429
is there any way to use the shim technique to set a min-width to the wrapper so both columns stop resizing
191465
on my dev machine i use a quad core cpu and although our project has more than 1200 files it is still easily processor limited during compile time although a faster hard drive would still help speed things up
191498
also try your method to get a random id between min id and max id and then
191536
in a nutshell how should we convert xml to json using python
191558
however in a budget-constrained environment here is a decent basic configuration for someone who wants to approximate the ideal
191601
in opera the event target for window.onload and body onload and even window.addeventlistener load func false will be the window instead of the document like in safari and firefox
191617
there is no one-to-one mapping between xml and json so converting one to the other necessarily requires some understanding of what you want to do with the results
191653
update also works with java c# c cobol ruby jsp asp html xml visual basic groovy source code and even plain text files
191656
you can do the isnull or nvl stuff but it s just going to make the engine do more work
191744
forget all that python just allocates more memory as needed there is not a myriad of comandline arguments for the vm as in java just let it run
191746
how do i grab the string displayed text 1 using javascript the dom
191799
your solution is quite similar to the unix linux gettext solution
191813
the difference between included objects and just encapsulated objects is that you don t have to create the delegation forwards yourself and they don t exist as independent objects that you can pass around they are part of your object and live and die together with your object or more technically spoken the memory for your object and all included ones is created with a single alloc call same memory block you just need to init them in your constructor call while when using real delegates each of these objects causes an own alloc call has an own memory block and lives completely independently of your object
191823
my understanding a feature i searched myself is that you want to skip a number of lines when stepping in code and set the program counter to take assembly vocabulary to the given line
191823
the run to line command execute of course all lines between the current execution position and the designated one
191929
public private protected virtual abstract override new static internal sealed and any others i m forgetting
191942
i usually start off with the access modifier first then virtual abstract sealed then override new etc
191966
everything that is required to rebuild the solution should be checked in
191990
java for language or scala if you want to be bleeding edge depending on how you plan to support it and what your developers are like it might be better but also worse
191991
the fckeditor should work with php and it s a solid wysiwyg editor
191993
edit definitely there are a lot of others languages that have run-times for both linux windows including php ruby python etc
192156
other rdbms would prefer coalesce instead of isnull
192160
i wrote a small javascript utility that walks the dom for whatever page it has been included on and then stubs out a valid css skeleton so that i can immediately start writing styles without having to do the repetitive task for every site i work on
192170
if you need shortcuts that won t be available on the menus then you ll have to handle that your self via the keyup or keydown events either on the form or the control
192179
the main difference between traits and default interface implementations which java now has is that traits can contain private or protected methods unlike traditional interface methods that must be public
192188
i ask only because using the zend debugger with zendstudio has proven to be much easier fewer steps to start stop debugging from the browser but i really like some of the profiling tools available that only work with xdebug
192222
enumerates source and yields elements until count elements have been yielded or source contains no more elements
192230
most fortune 500 companies now use mysql or postgresql or another open source rdbms somewhere in their organization even if they also use one of the commercial closed-source rdbms brands
192230
i realize that both mysql and postgresql were available as early as 1995 but i would argue that they weren t mainstream for several years after that
192254
assign the property to an initial value which can be distinguished from any other value that it might be set to null for reference types
192254
also make sure this is prominently described in the documentation on the class on the property and on any methods that will throw the exception if the property is not set
192263
i must trace each line to the root node in order to know which level in the nested array to insert into
192271
now xpart contains only those elements of x which lie in the specified range
192278
there s definitely utility in having a build or revision number there too for troubleshooting although if you ve got really rigorous cm you might not need to include it
192329
static void main string args
192396
if you look at c++ for each class you specify after the colon in the class declaration the kind of inheritance you get is determined by the access modifier private protected or public
192409
if you don t support this in the base class you ll run into major problems when you try to implement anything more complex than a textbox and a button
192416
firefox also supports ntlm as does opera and chrome
192464
there are two databases behind it an oracle and a postgresql one
192489
nunit is supported by default in cruise control.net and you have to do a little extra work to get mbunit to work in ccnet
192489
testdriven.net allows you to right click and run tests in the ide and it supports mbunit and nunit and others
192489
i have not used any others so i could not compare and contrast them with you but nbehave is supported by gallio from the mbunit team which means you can run your bdd tests just as you would your unit tests with testdriven.net
192558
i had it set simply to the path to kdiff3.exe and hoped the default arguments passed from tortoisesvn would be enough
192570
rv 1.8.1.17 gecko 20080829 firefox 2.0.0.17
192603
further more if your strings all have the same lenght and your maximum number of children are known say in a binary tree you can do it using a single string character array
192603
very fast and efficient tough our tree rarely had empty nodes but we could searh gigabytes of data in a jiffy
192608
i m looking to utilize jquery to handle a few very common requests we get for data tables of varying sizes scrolling sorting and dynamic filtering
192621
finally in each of your projects there should be a meta-inf manifest.mf file that just has the name of the jars that jar war depends on
192633
but for parsing rss feeds i d recommend universal feed parser which can also parse atom
192648
the guitar object contains an attribute called name and i d like to be able to set that as the pagetitle for the individual page views
192656
it turns out that in most versions of the 386 and later there actually was a cpu id but it was only visible at one specific time right after the processor was reset in the edx register
192672
anecdotes i have heard say that the solaris and bsd virtual memory systems may show better performance improvements than the vm system of linux--but i have no empirical data to back this up
192694
in general monkey patching is less used in python than in ruby
192737
the value set in the view will override any value that may have already been set in the controller
192786
if is the root element you might try removing the leading . item media content dcterms valid. if there is a series of items you might try adding another slash at the beginning item media content dcterms valid. that will select all the items in the document that match that criteria no matter where in the document structure they are located
192806
if you want a keyboard shortcut to be used from any control on the form without using a toolbar set
192806
this will allow all keypress events to get filtered by the keypress keydown and keyup events at the form level which will allow a single keyboard shortcut to be handled in one location instead of duplicating the functionality in all user controls
192846
you write your assembly code in the excel cells and your memory layout in the other worksheet and then at the bottom the machine code binary strings will be calculated
192852
in this case there is the possibility that your setter getter may inadvertently make direct or indirect assumptions about the state of the object
192870
some other language interpreters do that too i m thinking of lisp and scheme implementations mostly
192872
also you may want to consider modifying an existing class that s already inside media print or building up the new css using something other than innerhtml which i ll admit smells awful to me but seems to work in opera 9.6 safari for windows 3.1.2 ie 6 and firefox 2.0.0.17 i didn t test any other browsers
192876
is there any way to set a system wide memory limit a process can use in windows xp
192885
if i set the anchor property to opposing ends say left and right when the designer file gets compiled it sets the width height of the control to the width height of the container
192888
i have some nested tables that i want to hide show upon a click on one of the top-level rows
192935
unlike the pointer the reference makes the manipulation of the data as easy as it would be with a primitive like int or bool without using the operator all the time
192950
if you want distinct values from only two fields plus return other fields with them then the other fields must have some kind of aggregation on them sum min max etc. and the two columns you want distinct must appear in the group by clause
192960
the selection is not cleared so dragging is ok but the user cannot clear the selection by clicking on one of the selected items
192960
this really causes a problem if all the items are selected or the next item the user wants to select was part of the current selection
192993
is there a way to see via hex editor or otherwise if data in a binary file is aligned or packed specifically for an hpux system
193025
the regular expressions are converted into a single non deterministic automata nfa and possibily transformed in a deterministic automata dfa
193047
the client will be run from remote locations using a wan or vpn hence the idea of using a web service rather than direct database access
193055
which amusingly is written in python and not java
193101
you ll effectively have to do rpm for fedora debs for ubuntu and debian etc
193129
use virtual server or vmware and build a virtual machine with your configuration then upgrade that and test test test
193138
however i don t work on visio wpf clr or silverlight team
193138
silverlight is related to wpf in the sense that they share xaml and the corresponding clr types
193138
silverlight supports only a subset of what wpf offers though as it is not targeting windows os only and thus is limited by the fact that it has to be portable
193138
with silverlight 3 shipped sl and wpf are getting even closer and sharing bigger set of supported features
193138
and no i still don t work on the wpf or silverlight team
193140
if you want to output the tree using indenting rather than nested elements you can simply skip the print statements to print the divs and print a number of spaces equal to some multiple of the size of the stack before each item
193176
wpf is being used as a replacement for winforms and as a competitor to flash in the form of silverlight
193176
i have moved away from wpf and am doing a lot of silverlight 3 development
193176
there are wpf and silverlight versions
193176
take a look at mvvm and prism if you are going to be doing wpf or silverlight development
193181
python doesn t have a distinction between src lib and bin like java or c has
193194
seriously though you get back what you put in
193198
the std ostringstream is a good method but sometimes this additional trick might get handy transforming the formatting to a one-liner
193248
you design your application logic also known as controllers when bob submits an invoice the system does x y and z and then shows bob the list of invoices
193249
it could add subtract multiply and divide
193260
is it possible to configure visualsvn server to drop the svn
193278
in the case of #1 the standard unit test entails creating two instances of the same object with the same data passed to the constructor and verifying equal hash codes
193282
note that this is all hidden away in a private framework so don t try to put this in code you submit to the app store and be prepared for some hackery to get it to work
193287
alternatively use a jcomponent that overrides paintcomponent to draw as you wish
193292
as i ve already got ruby lisp haskell and erlang under my belt i m interested specifically in what kiss-violating features i should look out for in ocaml
193293
given a filename i need to be able to access certain metadata in an image for a closed source project i m currently developing without regard to how the metadata is stored that is exif iptc or xmp
193314
if you re going to need more performance than that i would set up a trigger-based system for updating the balance to the main account table then update the view behind the scenes so you don t need to change any other code
193336
the visual studio command prompt isn t near as nice as the linux osx terminals
193379
the docs are for asp.net ajax 1.0 but it s the same .net 3.5
193382
try it in scheme or ruby or erlang as well
193390
you get most of your classic linux unix commands shell scripting etc
193398
the language i am working with is limited to 64-bit unsigned integer length maximum integer size of 18446744073709551615
193420
i ve been combining putty cygwin screen and zsh not bash lately
193446
the dal should be there to take a poco and persist it - in your case that means mapping it to and persisting an ef entity
193456
with a nested transaction if t1 issues rollback after t1 commit counter returns to it s original value because it also undoes t2 s commit
193458
it uses only compile time reflection introspection so that it can work with structs which unlike full-blown classes have no runtime reflection introspection capabiities in d because they re supposed to be lightweight
193483
when using maven to build an executable jar how do i specify the jvm arguments that are used when the jar is executed
193483
edit follow-up it seems that it might not be possible to specify jvm arguments for an executable jar according to this and this post

i have managed to create an ext.tree.treepanel that loads child nodes dynamically but i m having a difficult time clearing the tree and loading it with new data

and you can ignore the argument about deleting a single directory to uninstall your program - windows vista won t let you modify files in the program files directory so your config will need to go in a different folder anyway
193621
your integer method is fine as is using a decimal numeric or money type where available
193622
you could compile the regex into a hybrid dfa bucchi automata where each time the ba enters an accept state you flag which regex rule hit
193623
create a service.xml in the meta-inf directory of your jar file and put this into it
193626
once upon a long time ago 1987 or so i wrote a program odx octal dump in hex - weird that i continue to use - it gives me a hex dump 16 bytes per line plus an image of the printable characters

finally walk through and convert the large integer into digits which will require a divide large number by a single word routine

because i need to be able to use the api in very different settings i m currently planning to have a version in php for web applications and a second version in python for desktop applications and long running processes
193713
i know this from personal experience having ported a library from python to php

if you have authentication page where you allow a user to login i would suggest not to include the master file for the form

it was behaving properly in firefox but not safari

there are several other linq to x implementations around including linq to nhibernate and linq to llblgenpro that offer or mapping and supporting frameworks in a broadly similar fashion to the entity framework
193809
i mean scala groovy and jruby have closures and produce valid bytecode
193869
delphi or c++ builder - it s a difficult choice
193869
for c++ may look better on a cv than delphi
193869
a few years back i considered a switch from c++ to delphi but the lack of raii idiom was the one thing that i found difficult to come to terms with
193873
in .net 3.5 i m going to be working with system.reflection to use aop probably in the context of castle s windsor interceptors to do things like define which security actions need to be performed at the method level etc
193882
note an operation architecture team has the role to make operational an execution environment meaning to have
193887
i think the biggest difference is that ruby is much more similar to perl in terms of useage
193887
ruby got all the advantages of perl and the oop is much more similar to smalltalk than perl s oop hack

as an example php may not be the best language ever but i would still consider using it over ruby on rails a better tool for creating websites because it is so widespread

and they complain that their genius built the set of apps in a period of weeks it can t take us months to rewrite them in java python vb c#
194001
for asp.net apps i ve often seen them placed on a separate disk from the application under a folder structure that mimics the virtual directory structure
194005
i had to prepare everything i could debug output messages soiling the code trace tools remote debugging tools on the camera and the list goes on
194015
or should i implement my own login and registration mechanism for my users
194031
if you use nested sets sometimes referred to as modified pre-order tree traversal you can extract the entire tree structure or any subtree within it in tree order with a single query at the cost of inserts being more expensive as you need to manage columns which describe an in-order path through thee tree structure
194034
you need to either add an extension to your routes controller .mvc action id and map that extension to asp.net or map all requests to asp.net
194061
no you should not use xhtml if you can t guarantee well-formedness and in practice you can t guarantee it if you don t use xml serializer to generate markup
194061
xhtml with just one markup error ceases to be xhtml
194068
i started to use ruby at work because we needed some scripting language that behaved more-or-less equally under solaris linux and windows 98 2000 xp
194068
and when were at the lisp land try to replace lisp with smalltalk
194117
if you want to use xhtml just so you can close certain elements with where html-compatible just use html5 markup so the browser is in full standards mode
194117
html5 allows the use of in an html-compatible way the same html-compatible way you have to do it when using xhtml 1.0 markup with text html
194120
as for the dhcp problem if the other computer is on the same subnet you can look it up by mac address using net arp
194130
it is much better than ant because for most common tasks you don t have to write a complicated build.xml maven has very good defaults and it s all convention over configuration
194154
is there any way to cache the last item that was found and shortcut the lookup if the cursor is in the same place
194173
so if you were to pass a string that was allocated by visual basic to a dll written in delphi you would end up in big trouble because both would now try to manage the string and would get into each other s hair
194180
is there anything particularly compelling about visualsvn over and above a normal svn installation
194184
using precompiled headers this is quite useful for stl and boost
194191
if your application is running 32-bit you can just use the programfiles environment variable whose value will actually be program files x86
194194
we re talking about thousands of lines of data with 15 columns of information per line

the question was originally written in the context of a delphi dll+typelib reimplementation of a vb6 original
194197
i actually prefer lxml as it has api like elementtree but has also nice additional features and performs well
194204
with sql queries your properties are in the class the database the select statements the insert statements the update statements the delete statements and all the marshalling and unmarshalling code supporting your sql queries
194206
one thing about distributing the filenames into different directories if you consider splitting your md5 filenames into different subdirectories which is generally a good idea i would suggest keeping the complete hash as filename and duplicate the first few chars as directory names
194262
then capture each subclasses type and show or hide a different loader graphic
194277
if you are using normal insert operations and want a significant performance improvement i suggest using some sort of a bulk load api if h2 supports it like oracle sqlldr sybase bcp mysql load data infile
194282
you might want to take a look at this pure bash implementation if keeping it all in shell script is that important
194282
that said other scripting languages such as python and perl are also highly portable and will make your life a lot easier
194289
edit in response to a request for clarity -- consider that i will have a server written in python one client written in c# and another client written in java
194306
since it will take a while to work out the nuances you ll probably be happier with a dynamic language like python or ruby than with a static language like java or c#
194306
for example python tcl and javascript are lightweight interpreters that you can call from c or c# programs
194306
your java and c# clients can talk with a python subprocess
194318
use iron python to interface that to the c# client and jython for the java client
194320
writing a stack trace to a log file is all well and good but it s very rarely enough to be able to diagnose the problem - consider logging things like the value of method parameters in a catch
194334
on the other hand if you really need to use the io support in the jdk ioutils contains a set of closequietly methods that close readers writers streams etc
194347
supports ie 6+ firefox 2+ safari 3+ and presumably opera but i did not test
194368
j2se executable jar file very simple use user.home system property to find home-dir
194369
in terms of database design put as few constraints indexes and triggers on the table s you re inserting into as possible as these will all slow down the insert
194378
codebehind is the controller for asp.net standard files - but in asp.net mvc you have far more powerful controllers
194402
given that maven s advantages are not too much compared to ant
194402
then again if you want some of maven s features ant folks have ivy for the dependencies feature

i m a fairly green software developer and focus mainly on the web python php but am pretty well experienced with java applications and as an electrical engineering student looking forward to dive into some c c++

you can simply ssh into the linux unix system and run x11 programs direct to your mac screen ssh -x user host_or_ipaddress login and just run the x11 programs you want and the x11 apps will appear on the mac display
194426
same solution works with any linux unix system remote or virtual
194432
assuming that you allocated the memory dynamically using malloc or another memory allocator you free it using free
194444
when it s about runtime memory allocation you can use your trusty malloc and free
194460
i can parse csv or xml files just fine but an xfa one has come along and i m not familar with the format
194489
if you decide to roll your own xml configuration i d recommend using xstream with customized serialization options or if you just need to parse some xml take a look at xom
194489
package most of your xml files inside application s jar either in the root or under meta-inf directory
194489
you can also use an app_home var directory to store any other mutable data which is specific to this application instance as opposed to the user
194489
you can implement them using different libraries and tools starting from raw jre adding spring guice or going for a full j2ee container possibly with embedded spring
194490
the second argument against eav i have heard is that it requires table joins that get into low double digits but it was commented that using innodb over myisam improved the performance some or it could be vice-versa but i can t remember totally
194514
in c# 3 constructor calls are able to set fields properties in a compact manner with object initializer expressions
194517
these usually use some sort of introspection on the class to determine what properties to read off the xml or they will have some static class properties that map instance properties to xml tags or attributes
194526
something curious about the logfiles is that i have noticed numerous udp packets in fact it constitutes basically all of my incoming traffic that don t have my host as destination or source showing up in the logs
194526
i thought this might be a implementation detail for udp the packets are hopping over my computer in the subnet but wikipedia ing udp didn t enlighten me any more and i don t see why my computer should be forwarding these packets in the first place
194540
i write a static method and make the constructor private if creating the instance does something that you wouldn t ordinarily expect a constructor to do
194575
the packets addressed to ips starting with 239 and 224 are multicast packets
194585
the working set stuff is good job objects also control working sets but that s not total memory usage only real memory usage paged in at any one time
194596
why support your own vm when someone else will support java or python for you
194596
is your own dsl and vm better than java or python
194633
if you plan to develop on linux then this is all the more likely to occur as you get used to thinks like working with build tools and scripts that are common on unix platforms
194633
install something like virtualbox virtualpc or vmware player to run linux in a virtual environment
194633
virtualization or a live cd version of linux such as the ubuntu live cd is a fantastic way to get used to linux without having to throw out the safety blanket of windows right away
194636
if you re not happy with say ubuntu you can just nuke it and install something else say opensuse centos or fedora
194636
it s so popular that you often get better results in google by replacing linux with ubuntu
194646
you create your movie player like normal and then do the following
194646
doing this makes it so your custom overlay will show and hide with the normal overlays as they are now one in the same
194667
compute the size of the file to search with fopen fseek file end fclose

i would recommend implementing and httphandler or an httpmodule for this type of scenario
194820
you can embed svg files with and in cutting-edge browsers opera safari also and css background-image
194844
create a png pnm pseudo gif svg
194880
you could also use svg + css background-image in opera 9.5 and safari
194884
why not use sudo for the deployment routine and then chown -r on the rails_root
194889
the truth is that like the tostring clone equals methods are for java quasi-standard-like c++ operator overloading is so much part of c++ that it becomes as natural as the original c operators or the before mentioned java methods
194889
do not subtract in a + operator as in do not subtract in a add function or return crap in a clone method
194889
despite all the fud against used defined operator overloading the following languages support it scala dart python f# c# d algol 68 smalltalk groovy perl 6 c++ ruby haskell matlab eiffel lua clojure fortran 90 swift ada delphi 2005 .

one caveat with this and i m sure there s an option somewhere to control it but it s been my experience that once you put an xml comment anywhere in a project you ll get a compile warning for every public item that isn t commented if you don t use them everywhere in the project
194986
the basic driving force behind the visitor pattern is that by using interfaces on the concrete nodes every operation that needs to be added to a composite data structure must change every node
194987
you can use ssrs with any database server for which ado.net drivers are available including oracle and mysql
194994
be aware that there a shared libraries that get loaded unconditionally at program startup and dynamically loaded libraries bundles iirc that are loaded on demand and the two are somewhat different on macos x from the equivalents on linux or solaris
195003
i can think of several ways to make objects specific to a particular request depends on what you want to do for you could instantiate the object in application.beginrequest and then store it in httprequest object so that it can be accessed by all objects in the request processing pipeline
195032
if the algorithms you re working on are standard encryption algorithms like 3des and aes there is definitely hardware available
195047
and from there you can layer in all sorts of things to front controllers passing request objects down a filter chain to a page controller which reroutes to the appropriate model which grabs data via your db abstraction layer filters it back up to the controller and on to the view which constructs the appropriate response all the while firing off random event hooks
195070
i would like the fastest and most accurate function boolean isreachable string host int port that passes the following junit tests under the conditions below
195073
then you can intercept the selectionchanged event in the onmousedown and do the selection in the onmouseup instead
195092
a front controller is the gateway for your application - all http requests go through it and it routes to the appropriate controller action
195102
i don t use setup install because i want to support multiple versions of the app also i have some control of the runtime environment so i don t package python with my deployment but should be easy to add python into the deployment package if it s needed
195128
btw instead of setting enabled in mousehover you should do it in mouseenter
195128
mouseenter and mouseleave is a pair which indicate whether is the mouse is within the button or not and it s fired once per entry exit
195131
for many queries it is much faster than mysql especially for grouping and sorting and can query remote systems in parallel and aggregate the results - which make it very useful in use with sharding
195190
since i hadn t find any open-source library maybe open-source program that can read and set itunes-style metadata tags in mpeg-4 files will help you

how does it compare to trac bugzilla
195331
for that reason you should always implement a timeout in your receive routines even if there is a party listening at the other end there is no guarantee it has received your message or that its response will reach you intact
195338
the advantage of own project management software like trac or redmine is that you have the power of everything
195353
the other databases we considered were ms sql-server and mysql
195382
this causes incorrect display of whitespace in elements that ought to preserve formatting such as pre and textarea
195383
in any case the exact answer to your question is that any sqlexception should mean a rollback happened when the end of transaction command is sent that is when a commit or rollback or end is issued
195398
the most mentioned difference between mysql and postgresql is about your reading writing ratios
195398
but if you do a lot of heavy updates to a table as often as other threads have to read then the default locking in mysql is not the best and postgresql can be a better choice performance-wise
195398
that s why it s usually said that mysql is best for webapps while postgresql is more enterprisey
195398
at the load levels where postgresql s better locks overtake mysql s other parts of your platform could be the bottlenecks
195417
a nice malloc calloc and reallloc replacement is rmdebug it s pretty simple to use
195425
code that s associated with and triggered by the occurrence of a specific event like an incoming message a thrown exception a signal sent to a process a network i o request completing or a mouse click on a user interface element
195426
as many have shown it is not a big deal to handle one row cases but when dealing with large datasets one needs a cursor with all the performance problems that come along
195429
in order to do this you must modify or duplicate the metrowerks startup code that loads globals and then call this modified code when you receive a non-global launch
195451
i use public boolean mousedown event ev int x int y to detect a click of the mouse
195477
when you equip or unequip an item add or subtract from the effective stats where appropriate
195485
using either vim or emacs you come to understand that the interface exposes the code s representation of the state of the file you are editing in the buffer the file is the on-disk storage you can fill a buffer from or write a buffer to
195485
vim and emacs are our two oldest editors in common use today and they share this behavior
195533
you don t need to wrap e in another exception e you can just throw e as you have declared the enclosing method also throws exception
195535
you ve been pointed to gnu gettext which allows you to replace literal strings with localized versions at run time - one aspect of localization which is what happens after you ve done the internationalization when someone actually uses your internationalized code in a specific locale
195549
reason being - if there is one line of text i want it to display in the center of the canvas but if there are two or three lines of text i want the text control to show those two or three lines of text
195549
caveat the canvas height and width is set by the component that instantiates it this is all wrapped up in a custom component so i can t explicitly set the width or height of the text control.
195567
hence emacs s basic unit of work is a buffer and not a file and the same logic holds for vim
195567
more capable applications like emacs and vim are a lot more flexible in that respect
195590
does anybody know how to determine the location of a file that s in one of the folders specified by the path environmental variable other than doing a dir filename.exe s from the root folder
195600
if you don t set the owner then the user can click something else or even close the owner while the message box is open then when the message box closes and the code after the call to messagebox.show runs your program can be in an unknown state - or if the owner was closed you are now running code inside a window that no longer exists and any calls to methods of winforms or wpf or for that matter also winapi and any other framework are likely to cause a crash
195618
if you haven t yet and you care about performance you must run your code through a good profiler personally i like kcachegrind valgrind on linux or shark on mac os x

in addition to the which ms windows and where unix linux utilities i have written my own utility which i call findinpath

195693
this is the section of code that describes how the object should be instantiated on deserialization - it sets the constructor arguments to three string values
195696
to prevent confusion in the future i d like to point out that the answer suggesting that the problem lies with the use of malloc free to manage the buffers being played is simply wrong

what would be the most significant conflicts in creating a scripting language that permitted all the native syntax and library functions of python ruby php perl shell and javascript such that you could freely intermix code blocks and function names between languages
195735
any chance you ve got open_basedir restrictions set
195752
it sounds like getting ruby s behavior to coexist with javascript s or python s would require some kind of ugly disambiguation
195780
just use xstream for xml or you could give a try to json
195795
for example is 0xbac0 an unsigned short expressed in hex
195795
for example if the integer is less than shrt_max you can assume it s a short
195795
you might also have to take arbitrary decisions for example 54321 can only be an unsigned short but 12345 could be a signed short or an unsigned short

the extensible hypertext markup language or xhtml is a markup language that has the same depth of expression as html but also conforms to xml syntax
195868
if you keep your html document well-formed close every opened element keep things nested in the tree-form you re getting the best out of xhtml xml world and can still be using the html format declaring your documents to be html but still keeping them clean well-formed

which library better for faster java application swt or swing
196027
although this isn t a huge amount of time when using it to hide show ui elements the time can be visibly noticeable
196038
very roughly a library is a set of tools designed for a specific task whilst a framework generally contains multiple libraries and performs a complete set of duties.
196048
i have a system which generates a large number of xml documents every day of the order of 1 million and i would like to be able to store and index these so that i can for example search for all documents with a certain field set to a given value
196061
you can however already mix svg and xhtml markup
196091
dan from my experience that includes implementation of smil2.1 language in javascript where time management is in subject i can assure you that you actually never need high precision of settimeout or setinterval
196091
what does however matter is the order in which settimeout setinterval gets executed when queued - and that always works perfectly
196136
so i suppose my real question is other than malloc free which handles getting and freeing pages for itself etc does a program need the os to provide anything else
196146
then it s up to malloc to dole out memory in a way that doesn t fragment the free memory too much
196154
most often c programs have their own malloc free functionality
196155
i don t know of any easy way to do it but there are a few systems out there which generate the aspnet markup on the fly then send it to the aspnet runtime from a memory stream or similar
196179
please limit your solution to yacc bison parsers
196191
the job of malloc and free is to manage those pages of memory which are fixed in size typically 4 kb but sometimes bigger and to slice and dice them into pieces that applications can use
196227
you can also create xml columns that conform to a schema using xsd
196233
i only use it for bringing up smarttag on things like gridview detailsview and datasource rather than generating all the tedious boundfield and template controls by hand
196252
several years ago swing was slow so swt was developed to make native api calls on systems
196252
swt is non-standard while swing is officially part of the java spec
196252
javafx will also be built on top of swing
196309
i ve been doing more reading including a micorosft research paper on functional programming with catamorphisms bananas and it seems that catamorphism just refers to any function that takes a list and typically breaks it down to a single value like max min and in the general case aggregate would all be a catamorphisms for lists

when the user presses the button hide the button and show the progress bar
196349
then hide the progress bar and show the button again
196357
in bash shell with emacs key-binding you can use key combination like m-f m-b to move one word forward or backward on the shell prompt respectively
196357
the key-binding i m talking about is for bash shell not in emacs
196357
it just happens that by default bash shell also use the same key-binding as emacs
196361
rather you d run into the difficulty that any good memalign implementation will be an integral part of the heap-manager codebase not simply layered on top of malloc free
196368
do you need transactional semantics commit rollback for the data
196421
this presupposes that you can have only one weapon of each category but many categories simultaneously
196487
any object whose reference count gets set to zero is considered dead
196496
you may have to dynamically bind unbind models in order to prevent those friends from getting their friends although that in practice may not be too much of a problem
196499
the datediff on max min date values you suggested should work another option is to just count records for each submitted within each date range
196548
basically the idea is to take everything that you can find out about the computer person and then generate a md5 hash of this information
196551
the only thing i can think of you could do is write a proxy class where one of your private fields is the class you d want to extend and you implement all it s methods and proxy their calls
196571
you ll have to play around with the padding and margin to make it look good but those two attributes will get you on your way
196576
yeah using display block it would be impossible to make them sit beside each other unless if you d try to specify a width for each of them
196591
for example with a length of 4 digits the output of the integer 4 is 0004 instead of 4
196616
run the test with a testrunner nunit mstest etc
196647
layne you described the problem as happening when your controller class implements an interface but in the code sample you provided the problem occurs when your controller class extends another class of yours validatingcontroller
196660
you build the model and the application once and it works on gae but also witl sqlite mysql posgres oracle mssql firebird
196705
in fact web2py is the only framework that allows you to write code once and the same code will run on gae sqlite mysql postgresql oracle mssql and firebird with the limitations imposed by gae
196705
nothing is wrong with django or pylons
196705
the django orm does not do migrations natively see south web2py does
196705
the django orm does not allow partial sums count field and group by web2py does
196705
web2py can connect to multiple databases at once django and pylons need to be hacked to do that and
196705
webp2y logs all tracebacks server side for the administrator django and pylons do not
196705
anyway the most important issue is that web2py is easier than django pylons php and rails
196707
just by calling snapurl and saveimage you can take a snapshot of a webpage into various images such as bmp jpg jpeg gif png tif tga and pcx
196707
support jpeg compression level compression method selection of tiff and gif
196707
more than 30 samples written in vc c- delphi vb c++ builder java jscript perl vbscript asp asp.net and php are provided
196726
the platform uses php python with isam w mysql
196737
i ve been working with the joomla framework and i have noticed that they use a convention to designate private or protected methods they put an underscore _ in front of the method name but they do not explicitly declare any methods public private or protected
196737
are the public private or protected keywords not available in older versions of php
196739
public private and protected are php5 keywords
196745
google code has one or you can install your own such as mediawiki or trac
196771
i have a php application which needs to output a python script more specifically a bunch of variable assignment statements eg
196771
this was for integration between a web-app written in php and mailman written in python
196776
i need to be able to send encrypted data between a ruby client and a python server and vice versa and have been having trouble with the ruby-aes gem library
196798
web2py is 265kbytes of source code and 1.2mb all inclusive compare with 4.6mb of django
196798
yet web2py will do everything you need manage session cookies request response cache internationalization errors tickets database abstraction for gae sqlite mssql mysql postgres oracle firebird etc. it does not need installation - just unzip and click on it - and you can do development in your browser
196810
using this information you can render the table using your own border padding and margin values
196836
if you want a way to control stack size and your goal is a really controlled and efficient environment but do not care about programming in the same style as linux etc. go for a single-shot execution model where a task is started each time a relevant event is detected runs to completion and then stores any persistent data in its task data structure
196838
it sounds like what you really want is mouseenter mouseleave ie proprietary events but easy to emulate
196838
alternatively patch prototype.js and use mouseenter and mouseleave with confidence
196857
what i want is the ability to find which revision was responsible for a certain line or lines in a text file
196859
i need to change color of textbox whenever its required field validator is fired on clicking the submit button
196894
and attributes properties
196896
if i were you i d check that in your python and ruby programs
196904
i think linux unix doesn t use the same locking mechanics because they are built from the ground up as a multi-user system - which would expect the possibility of multiple users using the same file maybe even for different purposes
196918
is there any open source ocr library written in .net or written in any language but can be used in an asp.net application
196933
i ve successfully tested it in firefox 3 msie 7 opera 9 and google chrome
196964
there s a package for python to encode and decode json python-json 3.4
197035
also try to redirect the output but stdout and stderr to a file so that you can see the error messages that are generated
197113
non-functional attributes product properties other than work it performs
197123
is there any way to automatically rename accessor mutator when a variable they get set gets refactored - renamed eclipse 3.4
197160
like internet explorer opera safari on windows
197188
again check the getter setter checkboxes
197202
the next safari version will probably also include one since its rendering engine webkit now has one as part of its web inspector
197210
this will not remove the key binding from vmware but you could set the option to grab keyboard and mouse intput on key press in the vmware preferences
197229
the basic configuration is complaining that the default web site we select for the bam portal installation is not validated due to iis is not 32-bit enabled. despite setting the apppool classic mode 32-bit property to true biztalk configuration wizard is still complaining
197243
there are templates in the svn distrib for different hooks located in the hooks subdirectory .tmpl that you have to edit and rename depending on your os to activate
197247
purpose of the class a dictionary where a key can map to multiple values
197267
if you want to avoid apache it is possible to deploy a mongrel cluster with an alternative web server such as nginx or lighttpd and a load balancer of some variety such as pound or a hardware-based solution
197276
the redirects stderr to stdout so any error messages will be captured in
197282
the malloc calloc valloc
197291
given a table mytable containing a numeric field mynum how would one go about writing an sql query which summarizes the table s data based on ranges of values in that field rather than each distinct value
197300
the idea is to compute some function of the field that has constant value within each group you want
197310
c# java and python are all likely to get used though
197316
at first i was going to propose to get rid of the divs and move the formatting width and height directly on the td but i tried that and doesn t seem to solve the problem
197317
other bits css width height values require units presumably px
197322
with message passing rather than method calling as your object communication mechanism then operations such as calling a method that didn t exist when you wrote the code becomes sensible as the object can do something sensible with the message anyway check for a remote procedure return a value for a field with the same name from a database etc or throw a method not found exception or anything else you could think of
197346
as eric said a lot of big websites don t validate however if you start with a validating website that works perfectly in for example firefox safari chrome or opera chances are it will be right or mostly right in the other 3 and will only require minor adjustments for them to be right
197346
ie6 and 7 have html hacks that don t require any extra work to load specific stylesheets for them but there isn t anything available for the gecko webkit or presto browsers firefox safari chrome or opera so an alternate method is needed for anything specific to these browsers
197362
i have a products table that contains a fk for a category the categories table is created in a way that each category can have a parent category example
197362
i thought about creating some sort of cache that will store all the categories in the hierarchy for every category in the db and include the in in the where clause
197372
i d like to parametrize the entire testcase including the fixture
197373
i have done similar things in the past first querying for the category ids then querying for the products in those categories
197382
if you want to be able to compile this code in gcc or g++ you will need to create an iterator and use a standard for loop
197389
i suppose there s no limitation to the category hierarchy depth so you can t formulate a single sql query which finds all categories
197418
check here for how to base64 encode and decode
197437
thus suppose you wanted a coupon for user 23 worth 200 you might build up a string like 23_200 and calculate an md5 hash with a secret salt of billthelizard to get 2671519131e974ee6fc746151e98f4a8 thus the complete code you give the customer is 200_23_2671519131e974ee6fc746151e98f4a8
197441
undefined function or method divrat for input arguments of type double

the framework offers already a lot of valid exception classes like argumentexception argumentnullexception invalidoperationexception formatexception overflowexception etc.
197509
the j2ee page on dao introduces a dto in addition to the dao
197513
in windows 2000 there are no built-in principals with the required privileges and you ll need to use a regular user account for this purpose it does need to have the run as a service privilege enabled of course but that s handled automagically when entering the account credentials through the service control manager user interface
197520
test both sides independantly encode some information and check that ruby and python endoded it identically
197567
you could subclass or superclass one of these controls to implement infinite functionality
197567
create a single child window draw it yourself handle all the mouse and keyboard input yourself and implement the scroll bar messages yourself
197595
it s based around a tree structure and each node can contain a text document and have child nodes
197622
is there a visual studio plugin tool snippet for .net that is similar to commonclipse for the java eclipse platform that automatically generates the tostring equals gethashcode methods for you
197649
while working on svg implementation for internet explorer to be based on its own vml format i came to a problem of translation of an svg elliptical arc to an vml elliptical arc
197655
for any bit set 10010011 etc you want to generate a mask that pulls only the bits you want to see
197671
work out if a point lies on the ellipse and matches the angle and iterate through every point in the bounding box
197686
though this will set all bytes in a char it will also work for any other variable type since any one bit being set in a variable makes it true
197706
in microsoft s runtime the new operator uses malloc and the delete operator uses free
197753
therefore does anyone know how i can change the value of the associated field table2.foriegnid
197760
i m not overly concerned with the core-language of the package unless i d need to hack on the code for the system itself in which case i m reasonably comfortable with php perl and .net though i could probably pickup an other language s as needed
197765
there are dinosaur vendors like telerik syncfusion devexpress infragistics which offer gui with good quality and support but they are not very cheap because the brand costs money
197786
essentially you would have to separate strings into chunks with a consistent encoding and decode those and append them to the strings that followed them
197793
the function requestbeheerderslist does nothing is not reached i put a alert as first statement in the function but that is not displayed when i login after a fresh load of the swf but when i logout and login again then the function is reached and the alert is displayed and the list is filled with the data from the server
197799
you might also try wrapping the content of your row s cells in an href and using css to push the href height width to the internal bounds of each cell
197799
the row itself wouldn t be clickable unless you added additional html to the row but most of the content space of the row would act like a normal link cursor status bar etc
197799
if you add display block css style tag to the anchor objects in the cells that you want to be clickable it will make the entire cell minus any padding act like a button
197806
there are a number of templating languages implemented for rails that give relatively simple syntax for markup
197811
like debian or rpm packages you can say you depend on other eggs and they ll be installed automatically through pypi.python.org
197845
i m trying to show hide a movieclip or graphic symbol that is on a layer of a button symbol using actionscript 2
197892
mark up your objects that are being used by the service with datacontract attributes and then put datamember on the public properties
197900
it may be possible to let c++ keep track of all the allocated arrays and their sizes if you are writing a word processor for a windows box running on the latest intel cpu but it may be completely infeasible when you are writing an embedded system running on a dsp
197940
i can t seem to find an easy to use .net native way to get comboboxes on .net winforms to display one value and return another based on the selection without creating my own helper class with the knowledge that winforms is going to display the tostring method on the object that you put in it
197958
in flash there seem to be two sets of mouse click events
197958
onmouseup onmousedown
197971
so even though it implements an interface the abstract methods of the interface can remain abstract
198032
the model never changes because it is independent of sql yaml json xml or some other serialization technique
198058
i d like to show a div that has a background-color with the height and width set to 100 but no content
198058
edit thanks to mark biek for pointing out that empty div with width and height styles shows how i d expect
198066
believe it or not the problem of at least loading the service through wcftestclient was solved when i re-registered the aspnet in iis with aspnet-regiis
198077
i program professionaly in delphi for the last 10 years and have a good knowledge of c++
198083
this seems to work in firefox safari ie6 ie7
198090
onmousedown and onmouseup are general events that anything can listen to via mouse.addlistener
198090
also important is onreleaseoutside...for the case where you click down on a movieclip then drag the mouse outside then release the mouse
198096
it looks like the mouseup mousedown events will trigger even when the mouse is outside the movie clip while onpress release will automatically check to see if the mouse is within the clip before being handled
198104
the login page is mapped to the restful route login but the page redirection was using sessions new rick olson s restful authentication module
198113
you can setup another worksheet in your excel file and use spreadsheet style functions to do the necessary transforms referencing the data from the raw data sheet
198115
since you ve not done any dml i suspect there d be no difference between a commit and rollback in oracle
198118
in this case the cell containing the number of the last row to include is b14 remember row first when referring to the cells object
198125
what jquery and other frameworks ends up doing is using a special asynchronous request called xmlhttprequest and then parse the server response can be anything pure html json xml etc and process it
198136
sortedlist like a hashtable but the entries are always returned in sorted-by-key order

i was going to create a temporary table copy the data in recreate the indexes and the delete the rows i need
198148
in general a commit is much faster than a rollback but in the case where you have done nothing they are effectively the same
198160
this paragraph is here to make sure the next two lines show up as code
198221
i agree with the previous answers that there s no difference between commit and rollback in this case
198221
there might be a negligible difference in the cpu time needed to determine that there s nothing to commit versus the cpu time needed to determine that there s nothing to rollback
198224
i am building a menu and have it set up so that i use a stadard ssi tag to include my xml document
198227
std istream is a class not an operator
198229
on the other hand the commit is more-or-less the expected outcome and i suspect that discarding the rollback area might be slightly faster
198252
i have a form that contains a gridview control which is databound to an objectdatasource control
198252
when i use the selectedvalue parameter of the listbox the objectdatasource is only seeing the first selected item in the list
198252
here s the question how can i get all the multi-select listbox values passed into my custom object mydataclass instead of just the first one selected
198280
in addition it s probably trying to connect using your windows account credentials
198282
a handy trick is if you specify s on dir you get recursion and the full path then if you specify the source directory fully on the xcopy the excludes will have to match from the beginning
198290
the drawback to this approach is that you lose the borders of your window as well as the titlebar
198290
you would need to deal with this by implementing your own form move resize logic in the form s mousedown and mousemove event handlers
198304
try to use stax instead of sax
198305
without min-width your div will take whole page width that is how display block elements behave

would it be wise of me to new up the linq to sql class in each of the methods or would a private variable holding the linq to sql class - new ed up by the constructor - be the way to go
198360
other than compiling the code as silverlight and wpf
198411
if for some reason this isn t an option though i think i would get a list of all unique words in your data and use that as a lookup table
198422
convert the smaller logo pdf to a tiff png whatever using for example imagemagick s convert or the gimp
198437
introspection or reflection on the other hand refer to the ability to find out what interfaces methods or attributes an object implements at runtime
198441
the flex mxml is mainly another syntax which eventually gets compiled to something you could have also written in actionscript
198450
what s really important to know about this question is the type of var

when i go back to school after thanksgiving i ll be taking a course in cs theory covering topics such as deterministic and nondeterministic finite state machines turing machines pushdown automata and a few other things
198470
this is why the equivalent of random.new.rand 20..30 would be 20 + random.rand 11 since random.rand int returns a random integer greater than or equal to zero and less than the argument . 20..30 includes 30 i need to come up with a random number between 0 and 11 excluding 11

the .net framework regular expression engine is a backtracking regular expression matcher that incorporates a traditional nondeterministic finite automaton nfa engine such as that used by perl python emacs and tcl
198592
matching behavior first paragraph this article also offers a rationale for the employment of an nfa rather than the more efficient dfa
198605
if you haven t check out the w3c specifications and see how much you really know

this works fine in cassini the built-in ad hoc web server for visual studio but gives me internet explorer cannot display the webpage when i try it on a live server running iis
198607
while that is most likely not an option for you since xna is not as slim as slimdx it certainly means that system.math is either actually missing something or the performance hit is not that big
198609
instantiating in the constructor and holding a datacontext in a private variable would make that impossible
198624
because representation of a given problem with a nfa is far easier than the equivalent dfa
198647
if you re talking about the datacontext object and your code is a class with a long lifetime or your program itself i believe it would be best to initialize it in the constructor
198669
if speed was really an issue i would rather use a java library to parse whatever i want than to rely on groovy s implementation
198679
given an inputstream called in which contains audio data in a compressed format such as mp3 or ogg i wish to create a byte array containing a wav conversion of the input data

lately when opening up a form in designer the common ui controls textbox button label etc etc... have vanished leaving only the controls defined within the project
198696
i see how to use mod_ssl to use the user s client certificates for authentication and i see how to use mod_auth_ldap and the like to use the username from basic or form based authentication to query the ldap store for authorization
198712
but if you are creating an ui more like a web application where the user stays at a single page for a long time think gmail google calendar etc then it probably is better to look at dojo extjs or gwt
198786
i m not sure what you mean by appending the output to a string but you can print to standard out using print or println
198806
i assume you are trying to call a wcf .net 3.5 service from a wse2 .net 1.1 client
198853
wcf .net 3.5 is said to be compatible with wse3 .net 2.0+ but not with wse2 .net 1.1+
198854
i used to use it religiously back in the vb6 days but stopped when vb.net came out because that s what the new vb guidelines said
198892
this works fine in firefox 3 but fails in ie7 because the image object being passed to the sizeimage function has a width and height of 0 for some reason -- maybe ie calls the function before it finishes loading
198928
how do i change the above imagemagick command so it takes the width and height from an existing image
198956
in order for this to work you ll have to join users to team_users to teams to coaches
198995
in the example on cpan use sock_raw rather than sock_dgram udp or sock_stream tcp
199001
i would strongly recommend you use paypal google checkout or worldpay or whatever payment processing system is provided recommended by your bank
199010
for example one might expect that my find regex above is broken because the backslash before the double-quote is not properly escaped but in reality putting a double-backslash there will break the expression not fix it

apparently email providers such as hotmail gmail yahoo drop all incoming email from widely used server providers such as amazon ec2
199045
i m looking for a library that has functionality similar to perl s www mechanize but for php
199045
the reason i m asking for a php solution is that i have no experience with perl and i could probably build what i need with a lot of work but it would be much quicker if i could do the above in php
199052
libcurl uses openssl for ssl support
199052
rebuilding the libcurl library i now got some errors about openssl include files not being found
199052
it complained about a struct typedef in one of the openssl headers
199052
after an hour of googling i broke my own principle and commented out the typedef from the openssl header and luckily libcurl wasn t using that symbol so it built fine
199070
this is called multi-query. the mysql extension in php does not have any means to enable multi-query

once you narrow elements and attributes to innocent ones the pitfalls are in attribute content javascript pseudo-urls ie allows tab characters in protocol name - still works and css properties that trigger js
199127
when i access this window my javascript functions can access the fields via the dom with the getelementbyid method and when i postpack to the server i am receiving the updates made by the client
199141
another workflow engines worth taking a look are jbpm bonita and shark
199146
i always thought the asp.net architecture was more about pushing .net than improving the overall structure of we application so in that sense mvc is a step forward
199159
then your constructor can just initialize a private member madtastic.datacontext and set your private member madtastic.entities.comment to the result of the linq query on it
199159
but it doesn t make sense to submit changes yet because you haven t set any values for this new object anyway
199159
in your submitchanges all you should have to do is call submitchanges on the datacontext
199174
note however that your application has to be prepared for a failure during the smtp session to the mailserver on your host due to syntactically invalid email addresses for example. but if you decide that you ll receive mail for example.com on your host then you need to worry about dealing with retry messages bounce messages double bounce messages and a whole lot of other general mail server administration
199186
nasty hack around this might be to execute javascript from the applet to call a dom method to do a mock resize of the window or perhaps call focus on the body in an attempt to cause an external re-drawing of the canvas
199217
oracle recommends that you explicitly end every transaction in your application programs with a commit or rollback statement including the last transaction before disconnecting from oracle database
199222
it does look like mixing lightweight usually swing and heavyweight awt components together
199222
moving to swing you need to replace every last awt component swing equivalents hint avoid import java.awt
199223
we ve been using mule and cxf a bit and so we ve had to download from both legacy maven1 and standard maven2 repositories - these are straightforward to set up and require little if any administration
199233
use a language where an embedable interpreter exists for the target languages lua python
199235
in scenarios where an orchestration invokes the send adapter the biztalk messaging engine sends the message to the messagebox database
199235
when the adapter receives this message from the messagebox database the adapter calls the redeemticket method with the encrypted ticket to retrieve the back-end credentials from the sso store
199236
for me ironpython has been the more robust choice and much of what i ve written in cpython ports without changes
199246
when i add a new ipsec filter rule the only options for esp i get are des and 3des so the faq is correct - there is no support for aes prior to windows vista
199255
once you have cpython understanding ironpython will be a lot easier to understand
199262
this happens all the time if you are not programming carefully in awt swing
199262
third and this is an extension of first if you get a callback that is not already on the awt worker thread be sure to put it on the awt thread before doing anything with the gui
199275
i write code for cpython and ironpython but tip should work for jython as well
199289
if you re using an oo language then i d suggest it s essential to validate the arguments to public methods but less important with private and protected methods
199290
decoding nullpointerexception is going to take a bit longer than illegalargumentexception filepath must be supplied or whatever
199291
basically i inject the proper platform-specific directory value into the main checkstyle configuration file by configuring a checkstyle properties file with an ant build script
199291
the checkstyle properties file is not static it is generated by an ant build script from a properties file template called template-checkstyle.properties
199291
then i call the checkstyle ant task like this
199292
yes it s good practice to validate all arguments at the beginning of a method and throw appropriate exceptions like argumentexception argumentnullexception or argumentoutofrangeexception
199325
use at most max-lines nonblank input lines per command line
199327
the exception s message property should contain info on where the error occurred row col numbers and i suspect it d be easier to use a regular expression to extract those error messages and the related positional info
199340
i used perl as my primary scripting language for a number of years and eventually started to pick up bits of bash sed and awk and i think they re all worth knowing
199340
essentially anything you can do in perl you can probably do in sed awk or bash and with enough fancy codework the inverse is probably also true
199342
even if you don t end up using it much yourself you ll also be able to read the many bash scripts that are key parts of most unix linux systems
199344
you need the fflush stdout because normally stdout is buffered until you output a newline
199347
to put it straight using sed awk and friends is fine but you will find you can do the same job in perl in a cleaner way which is more consistent to what you know already
199357
to change the current menu item you can just assign the corresponding id to an element higher in the document s structure
199359
if you know how to code in perl python ruby don t bother learning bash
199362
if you look at kate the text editor and kdevelop the ide the main difference is that kdevelop supports project management cvs subversion and build scripts whereas kate does not
199368
all i use bash ksh for is as a shell - the scripting side is not useful - simple stuff is done with awk and pipes and complex stuff requires c
199371
curses# uses pdcurses on windows and ncurses on linux
199380
in dos windows console the standard-ish way to do it is with conio.h while under unix linux the accepted library for this purpose is ncurses ncurses basically encapsulates the control-character behavior that mbcook describes in a terminal-independent way
199391
since they all run debian linux i ve set up a debian package repository on my server and the all the customer has to do is type apt-get upgrade and they get the latest version
199403
i am aware of imagemagick and it s c++ binding magick++ but i think it s an overkill for this project since i am currently not interested in other file formats or platforms
199418
i m using gnu tool chain gcc glibc etc so language and architecture support are not an issue
199427
sometimes just pack and unpack and maybe vec is enough
199427
if you re writing an unusual packet processor such as an active hostile attack tool a man-in-the-middle process or a traffic shaping device then would be more likely to be building packets and using pcap
199450
this is because you may need to control the ids which get put in this table because your application is going to have to look for specific ids
199453
if you compile this program example name so199260.c and run it on a utf-8 environment a linux installation in this case
199481
for example checkstyle has stronger support for checking javadoc and finding magic numbers to name a couple
199516
ls | awk system svn mv 0 toupper substr 0 1 1 substr 0 2
199520
i d make a ruby perl script that does the renaming
199521
to make matters worse in order to recursively clear controls inside sub-containers a group box within the panel i have to repeat the whole monster with an overloaded groupbox version
199526
using gdi calls rather than gdi+ for the bitblt this is often a good idea - graphics drawimage can be very slow
199526
i ve even found the normal gdi bitblt call to be faster on some systems
199540
the only change i might suggest would be instead of overloading the method just make the passed in type a control and you can use the same version for groupbox panel or any other container control that provides a .controls property
199554
for example an exception filter that catches argumentexception will also catch exceptions derived from argumentexception such as argumentnullexception invalidenumargumentexception duplicatewaitobjectexception and argumentoutofrangeexception
199576
i am planning to move my vmware s virtual machines from a windows host to a linux host ubuntu
199593
you ll only get an improvement in programming efficiency after you ve put in the effort to re-implement the web app -- which due to the time required for the reimplementation may or may not result in an improvement overall
199602
canvas is an awt component so you ll need to wrap it in a swing component to which you can set the border
199607
an alternative approach is to turn your business logic layer into a set of services available over a standard rpc mechanisim - rest soap xml-rpc or some other simple xml yaml or json over http protocol see also dwr so that the front end can make these rpc calls to your business logic
199621
for example the forms 2.0 library groups commonly-used controls together textbox checkbox combobox label etc. into a single library
199624
it seems i may be able to perform this via jsse jsch or the bouncy castle java libraries
199633
i use an error provider to show a red exclamation mark next to the field however this is only visible after they have clicked the save button
199634
gtk+ you can use almost in all programming languages in c++ using gtkmm in c gtk+ in c# with gtk# in python pygtk
199651
i really need an all-purpose row picker where you can populate something a table divs etc with some rows of data say a list of timezones
199661
i ve used bash csh and tcsh
199665
the client works fine over ssl with a python soap server but not with the ruby version
199668
note this catches integer addition subtraction overflows and i realized that your question involves multiplication
199672
i usually stick to bash because it s more friendly than straight-up sh and it s the default on every distro i ve used semi-regularly suse rhel ubuntu slackware
199673
the most common shell by far on linux is bash
199673
unless you have a good reason to use an alternative i d suggest that sticking with bash or the most commonly used shell by your project team or that the bulk of the shell scripts you have to work with uses
199687
is there a way of sending mouse and keyboard input so that llmhf_injected is not set
199699
you can do off line caching of static data using isolated storage today - just serialize your data to json or xml and save it locally
199699
dockpanel wrappanel viewbox label headeredcontentcontrol expander treeview numericupdown autocomplete accordion
199711
however gtk+ has bindings for many many other languages perl python c++ .net etc so it s not a huge issue
199721
and windows with safari firefox
199735
add an onclick or onmousedown handler to the anchor tag
199762
examples include portaudio rtaudio and sdl
199835
since i believe i m the person who suggested that you should use something other than c shell perhaps i should should qualify my remarks slightly and then support those who said bash on linux korn shell on other platforms unless bash is installed there too
199835
rather like editors do you prefer vim or emacs choice of shell is partly a question of familiarity and partly a question of preference
199835
if you decide that you want to use something other than c shell then you are basically in the bourne shell camp for which the posix standard more or less specifies the expected behaviour and then the different shells -- that is the bourne korn or born again shells -- add or in the case of the classic bourne shell subtract a few features
199835
if your code might ever need to move off linux to hp-ux solaris or aix the surviving trio of the classic at t-derived unix variants then you should consider ensuring you write your shell scripts in classic bourne shell though korn shell is also pretty safe
199835
bin sh and get bash on the other platforms you will get bourne shell
199835
i switch between korn shell and bash without major problems - and seldom with minor problems
199835
another problem for those using linux is that the gnu tools have more options than the classic unix versions and you can lose portability not because of the shell programming constructs that you use but because of the command options you use
199867
for a while i was the maintainer of the freebsd port of the bash tab-completion scripts but abandoned it as soon as i tried zsh for the first time
199867
bash and zsh and other shells have nice extensions that you ll miss but those tie you to a specific setup
199869
i have an application running in tomcat that has a bunch of configuration files that are different for each environment it runs in dev testing and production
199870
i use ffmpeg also known as libavformat which is a cross-platform api
199870
update ffmpeg is open source and distributed under both the gpl and lgpl licenses which means you are allowed to use it in proprietary commercial products
199872
i ll be using .net 3.5 asp.net maybe mvc havent started yet i know jquery has great support but from what i have seen it doesnt have this type of widget feature
199879
i have a div that contains several child elements one of which is a flash movie
199879
my problem is that the mouseover and mouseout javascript events don t always trigger especially if the user moves the mouse over the flash element too quickly
199882
if you aren t a javascript programmer and you re interested in a more-elaborate modal box there are jquery plugins offering the modal lightbox effect

i dabble at processing ruby and python
199979
one thing i ve done frequently is to create frames in the mc called show and hide followed by short animations and a stop command and then done something like this
199987
firebird and postgresql seem to have from my brief wikipedia excursion the most in common w sql server plus they are free
199987
be for firebird postgresql and ms sql server
