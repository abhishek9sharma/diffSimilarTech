portrait	landscape
the app supports portrait and landscape display orientations

7900032
portrait	landscape
the subview appears in portrait mode sometimes even if the mode is landscape

7900048
google-chrome	firefox
now in firefox google-chrome the search box is rendered as in the image

7900048
google-chrome	firefox
if i remove the height attribute the searchdiv gets collapsed within the search box and this is in firefox google-chrome

7900064
int	chars	int	double	int	boolean
it is integer.valueof int similarly for boolean byte chars long float and double

7900065
dbcontext	objectcontext
system.data.entity.dll version 4.2.0.0 june ctp 2011 contains everything from efv4.0 and efv4.1 both objectcontext api and dbcontext api + new features but it is probably the only version for a long time which will combine these two apis in the same assembly

7900073
subtraction	addition
i feel like there should be some way to union two resultsets without a lot of extra work because set addition and subtraction are such a core part of sql

7900100
pop-up	dialog
here s the code that shows up the pop-up dialog to get started

7900129
for-loop	arrays
you can iterate over the arrays with a for-loop over splitted.length querying your list with

7900139
google-chrome	firefox
then will works in google-chrome firefox and ie9 but still not in safari.

7900140
versioning	upgrade
if i remember correctly they merged with another company apex and changed name to componentone so you may be eligible for an upgrade versioning instead of a full new license

7900157
accessor	properties
aaa and bbb are properties each is a pair of accessor methods which are synthesized and use the instance variables _aaa and _bbb respectively

7900173
vpn	lan
my suggestion would be to see if they have vpn access to their lan and get them to set you up an account on the domain

7900178
flac	ogg
and i want those flac files to be converted to ogg in the same directory basically i want to automate

7900180
jquery	jqmodal
or the jquery plugin jqmodal

7900191
opera	google-chrome
will work as intended in latest google-chrome for example - won t work in latest opera

7900205
folder	directory
if you are pointing to a folder outside your root path you could get into trouble when someone decides to move the physical location of your app and use a virtual directory for it

7900230
post	get
i set post type as post but data always get send using get method

7900262
setinterval	settimeout
so i know that there are differences between settimeout and setinterval but consider these two code examples

7900268
int	double
but i do not want to loose the jaxb marshallers for all the others objects int double etc .

7900293
setinterval	settimeout
another difference is that with the settimeout you ll get a new handle every time whereas with setinterval you get one handle

7900293
setinterval	settimeout
another difference with your examples as given is that in the settimeout example you re firing up a javascript parser compiler every time whereas with setinterval you re only firing up the parser compiler once

7900293
setinterval	settimeout
side note it s not best practice to pass strings into either settimeout or setinterval

7900318
children	parent
and children can be removed from the canvas to another parent

7900318
children	parent
so that i apply the transformation delta on all children to place them in the new parent directly without being inside the transformed canvas

7900320
width	height
the issue with just fixing width and height is the listbox keeps the same position even if the user resizes the window

7900320
width	height
this is why i created this tiny behavior which fixes width and height but listens to the parent element s sizechanged event to let the listbox resize itself when the container s size changes

7900320
width	height
when the parent element is resized i restore width and height to double.nan so the control can resize itself and i queue the bit of code which fixes the size properties to actual values in the dispatcher for later execution

7900335
unsigned	short
mapping corresponds to an implicit conversion unsigned short to

7900335
unsigned	short
that the unsigned short

7900395
int	double
i have array of double and array of int

7900465
hide	show
when you click next you can use jquery to hide the current ul and show the next ul

7900482

maybe that s a noob question but is there a way to have an yellow tooltip alike web alt while using web browser in winform application controls such as checkbox or button

7900492
button	checkbox
i have a problem with my html button and checkbox

7900492
button	checkbox
whenever i resize page especially making it very small my button and checkbox goes at the bottom

7900492
button	checkbox
i want the button and checkbox to stay on the same line with the textbox

7900517
nsmutablestring	nsstring
as well that optimization makes physically subclassing concrete immutable types nsstring difficult for mutable variants nsmutablestring in some cases

7900530
hash	salt
hash the password with a salt

7900588
hide	show
how can i hide those underlines which are show in the textbox by default

7900622
hash	salt
the salt for hashing the password should needs to be unique and can be stored in the database in fact it can be part of the hash itself

7900633
folder	directory
i wanna create a batch file that could do something to all folder in the current directory

7900670
tabs	tabpanel
i have created a formpanel with a tabpanel with several tabs

7900670
background-color	transparency
bodystyle background-color transparency

7900670
google-chrome	firefox	tabs	tabpanel
to the form tabpanel and tabs and it works in ie9 and google-chrome but not in firefox

7900684
viewdidload	viewwillappear
loadview viewdidload and viewwillappear not being called in my uiviewcontroller

7900684
viewdidload	viewwillappear
and obviously since loadview didn t get called viewdidload viewwillappear won t get called either as there was no view that got loaded am not using any nib..creating the view programmatically

7900728
move	drag
the correct solution to this problem is probably to implement a kind of handle on top of the table or something that users could grab drag drop to securely move the whole table at once

7900780
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
the images display fine when viewed in google-chrome firefox safari and opera

7900780
width	height
however when the same page is viewed in internet explorer 7 8 and 9 sometimes well 50 of the time when the page is first loaded the image appears at the correct width but the height is really really small

7900832

a major upgrade will automatically uninstall the old versioning before installing the current one

7900849
mktime	strtotime
always use date functions like strtotime or mktime to increment the date

7900853
free	malloc
there if a big array can t be allocated contiguously even if there s enough free memory you will get either the std bad_alloc exception in c++ or null from malloc -like functions in c c++ or nonthrowing operator new in c++

7900853
disk	ram
the ram is effectively extended by the free disk space at the expense of lower performance because the os has to exchange data between the ram and disk when there s memory pressure

7900860
move	drag
i d like to achieve the exact opposite if the viewpager inside a list row starts reacting to a horizontal drag then it should trap that action and this drag should stop affecting the listview no matter how the user move his her finger vertically

7900868
width	height
document.ready potentially occurs before all of the images have been loaded on a page so the reported height and width can be 0 or as in your case 100

7900886
maven	pom.xml
i got failed to build elasticsearch by maven i wrote pom.xml

7900888
accelerometer	gyroscope
do someone know for each property of cmmotionmanager.devicemotion and their subproperties on what kind of hardware they are based on magnetometer accelerometer gyroscope ...

7900908
hash	salt
password only the hash of a password should be stored together with a user specific salt

7900908
rainbowtable	salt
the salt can be stored plaintext the reason for the salt is that an attacker cannot use one single rainbowtable for all users building a rainbowtable is expensive

7900937
spweb	splist
since both spweb and splist inherit from spsecurableobject all you have to do is load the splist object for that list you want to alter the permissions

7900951
getter	setter
i tried making a class to represent an answer ischecked note etc with getter and setter

7900955
int	double
the table has unknown dimensions and each column has values of one unknown type string double or int

7900975
int	boolean
however if the int is being used to represent a boolean type which c does not have a builtin type for then this form is ok

7900982
hide	show
i would like if i click red .button then green .show show me over the red button and if i click outside green .show then this hide

7901013
inherited	subclassing
or should i subclassing uitableviewcell and all cells inherited from here

7901124
google-chrome	firefox
so the code beneath works perfect in google-chrome but not in firefox and op

7901129
width	height
the consequence of this is that in viewdidappear the width and height of the view are still incorrect width 768 height 1024

7901129
width	height
only viewdidappear will be triggered and the width 768 the height 1024 - as expected

7901158
min	max
other functions from list util like max min sum also may be useful for you

7901237
int	double
if i understand correctly you are trying to do a summation reduction of the double precision array a by the int keys held in b

7901256
int	double
c++ convert vector int to vector double

7901257
firefox	safari
script with the developer tools in safari or firefox but when i download the html page all tags after script

7901282
width	margin
you have the width of the content which corresponds to the width you set then the padding then the border the box then the margin

7901302
viewdidload	viewwillappear
due to the keywords did and will in uiviewcontroller i have am unsure where to put the code before after calling super in viewdidload and viewwillappear in order to make the code run effectively

7901309
int	double
the implementation assigns double from int which basically is not different to your other solution

7901316
rss	feed
google want a feed file to be a customised version of either rss or atom with an additional namespace attached for the tags google product search uses

7901329

7901333
onresume	onpause
for stopping the music you can stop it on onpause and restart in onresume

7901409
hide	show
if the user hits emit it should show the toggles and hide the label readouts

7901417
temporary	tablespace
sharding the data with commits between blocks should reduce the amount of temporary table space usage so it would likely be a lot more reliable if temp tablespace is limited

7901418
setinterval	settimeout
this works fine for most common apis except settimeout setinterval

7901418
setinterval	settimeout
i tested it in ie 6-9 settimeout doesn t work at all and setinterval causes memory exhausted in some cases

7901427
stdout	stderr
so what is the purpose of redirecting stderr to stdout if stderr gets printed to terminal by default

7901428
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
home currently uiviewcontroller using homeviewcontroller convert to uinavigationcontroller

7901432
ubuntu	debian

7901454
stdout	stderr
by default both stdout and stderr are directed to the terminal

7901454
stdout	stderr
if you redirect stderr to stdout then it also goes to the terminal

7901456
free	malloc
you must call free exactly once per call to malloc

7901456
free	malloc
if you want to be able to call free only once you ll need to make sure to allocate all the required memory in a single call to malloc

7901460
stdout	stderr
stderr and stdout are by default both displayed on the controlling terminal

7901481
hide	show
aside from that you ll probably want to look at the show and hide methods

7901517
stdout	stderr
is there any way i can output the stderr to the error file and output stdout to the output file in the same line of bash

7901556
hide	show
so basicly run a check on domready what value is selected hide all divs show the right one

7901575
min	max
in the select and order by clause of a sql statement with group by you can only use the columns expression used in the group by or aggregate functions min max avg .. of other columns

7901578
listadapter	simplecursoradapter
i would expect listadapter listadapter new simplecursoradapter ... to hold the values that are binded to a listview until we activity is destroyed.

7901579
inherited	subclassing
but this raises many questions to me specially regarding to activemodel product shouldnt have its own table but i would want some fields in its subclassing hotel restaurant etc to inherited those fields from it

7901580
width	height
you can extend a layout which will be your top layout which will be set to fill_parent width and height and override the onsizechange int width int height int oldwidth int oldheight

7901580
width	height
the width and height is the real width and height of your display

7901596
mkmapview	mkannotationview
you can subclass mkannotationview add uiimageviews and whatever else then implement the mkmapview delegate method

7901607
aggregate-functions	sum
group by in oracle implies that you are trying to run an aggregate-functions sum count etc. on one of the columns

7901672
ssl	https
the problem is if a ssl https url exists i tried all suggestions in the above threads and while they work fine on normal http urls none of them work on a https file

7901707
membase	couchbase
for adding persistence to this later couchbase formerly membase is worth a look and used in production for very large game platforms

7901716
portrait	landscape
this does work when the device currently the 7in galaxy tab running 2.2 is in portrait mode but when rotated to landscape the layout does not adjust size and the keyboard hides half the screen

7901748
apache	nginx
depending on the webserver the error_log nginx apache apache2 directive and where it is logging errors to will help you understand where the problem is happening

7901834
portrait	landscape
my uialertview has a message and 3 buttons my problem is the alert view display normally in portrait but it hides message in landscape mode as below screenshots

7901839
apache	nginx
if you re using passenger then one reason for the slowdown is that all assets are now served by the asset pipeline instead of the webserver apache nginx

union	distinct
you have to properly manage cases when a user is part of two distinct groups and always choose the one with most permissions or the union of all permissions

7901972
vlan	packets
every igmp packets must have an ip ttl 1 that means that igmp will never cross a routed boundary such as a vlan

i have 2 radio buttons that i currently check their value if is 6 or 12 and hide show the relevant div in my table

7901983
rvm	bundler
other information i m using rvm ree and bundler

7902001
rss	feed
in any case i m sure you already tried to retrieve the rss feed with www but did you try with a relative path

7902013
try-catch	exception-handling
using a try-catch block at the caller doesn t help catching the exception-handling as it is thrown on another thread

7902015
fadein	fadeout
if the event is targeted on your elements do something fadein else do something else fadeout

7902030
ms-access	ms-jet-ace
for the ace database available since ms access 2007 use the ms-access tag and the ms-jet-ace tag

7902031
ms-access	ms-jet-ace
for the ace database available since ms access 2007 use an ms-access tag and the ms-jet-ace tag

7902038
free	malloc
you have two malloc s so you need two free s

7902054
folder	directory
and put that in a .htaccess file in your folder directory assuming you can alter apache s settings meaning you have the option allowoverride all in that virtual host

7902082
free	malloc
heap allocated memory allocated by malloc is not reclaimed until explicitly free by calling free

7902103
width	height
minimum width and height are some of the settings that can be defined there along with the extension icon for instance

7902142
hide	show
create a boolean parameter to hide show details section named hide details

7902151
stdout	stderr
or if you like to mix outputs stdout stderr in one single file you may want to use

7902155
free	malloc
one thread can malloc something and another can free it

7902192
inherited	subclassing	superclass	subclassing
in this and almost any situation where i find myself tempted to have a subclassing extend multiple superclass i try to find a way to model the situation with delegation rather than inherited

7902232
fastcgi	scgi
you could also make your file server application a fastcgi or scgi client of your web server the one running django

7902246
free	malloc
use malloc in a loop and of course remember to free

7902255
hide	show
on each of this childs are two labels show hide

7902287
switching	screens
you get several real interactions switching screens orientations simulating memory warning adding a second display to your device

7902287
accelerometer	airplane
ios simulator doesnâ t simulate accelerometer camera hardware and airplane mode

7902288
mouse	keyboard
this application provides several ways of interacting with it by using the keyboard and mouse to simulate taps device rotation and other user actions

7902291
width	height
set the width and height ot the iframefix so that the handle for the resize can be visible and make the other necessary css staff as you need them to be

7902292
apache	lighttpd	apache	cherokee	apache	nginx	nginx	lighttpd	nginx	cherokee	cherokee	lighttpd
apache2 supports it since version 2.2.12 apache with backport patch nginx lighttpd and cherokee are supporting it off the bat

7902327
mouse	keyboard
indeed both when i change the selection by keyboard and when i change the selection by mouse the handler is executed

7902327
mouse	keyboard
the problem is when i change the selection with keyboard and then i move on to the next field either by mouse or keyboard in the form

7902368
post	get
if you can post some code we can get to the bottom on the problem

7902377
ubuntu	linux
i m currently developing an app on my ubuntu linux machine

7902389
salt	md5
i am trying to append a randomly generated salt along with my md5 generated password

7902394
mouse	keyboard
see how to simulate mouse and keyboard events in code for examples of using sendkeys to send keystrokes to a different application

7902396
versioning	upgrade
otherwise better upgrade tomcat and align everything based on the tomcat versioning

7902408
mouse	keyboard
another option would be to use inputsimulator which is a very flexible and reliable wrapper that is capable of simulating keyboard and mouse events

7902425
capistrano	bundler
after i added the require bundler capistrano at the top of the deploy.rb file and after i run the cap deploy migrations command i get the following error

7902432
hash	salt
you could do this in a salt field or in the hash itself see phpass for a good implementation example

7902457
hash	salt
the point of a salt is to avoid rainbow table attacks or precomputed password hash

7902457
hash	salt
in order to check the old password you ll need to use the same salt you hash it with so you do need to store it in the db

7902457
hash	md5
md5 isn t a strong crypto hash and you are probably best using bcrypt

7902489
hash	salt
you could as well just store the date and time of the last login and use it as the salt - this way you don t explicitly store the salt and it changes with each new login naturally this also means the password hash is always different

7902489
salt	md5
you could actually have several salt - perhaps one or more coming from the database md5 last_login sha1 username ... and another one hardcoded in your php application

7902538
jstl	taglib
for this particular simple purpose i d just use the jstl functions taglib

7902541
put	get
not exactly sure how you managed to get an _id field in the indexes collection but both shell and morphia originated ensureindex calls for compound indexes do not put an _id field in the index object

7902541
versioning	upgrade
upgrade to 2.x if you re running an older versioning to avoid running into now resolved issues

7902544
profiling	debugging
i have used eclipse tptp to debugging some threading and profiling issues in the past

7902552
width	height
the width is first animated followed by the height after a 1 second delay

7902552
width	height
height first then width

7902661
width	text-align	width	margin	margin	text-align
give that a background color use css to set text-align center or give a child element a fixed width and a margin 0 auto to center it within the edge to edge block element

7902666
capistrano	bundler
make sure you are including the bundler capistrano recipes in your deploy.rb file

7902745
g++	gcc
you could also code a gcc plugin assuming your g++ is a 4.6 version or a gcc melt extension for that

7902819
for-loop	loops
a for-loop i that loops from 1-x

7902819
for-loop	loops
in it a for-loop j that loops from 1-x

7902876

you should not use this read the manual that is for manual login usually ajax based one this will get any post data everytime you enter and do the login for all actions.

7902966
validationsummary	customvalidator
i have a validationsummary on client side which should be called by asp linkbutton that check my requiredfieldvalidator and customvalidator

7902976
width	height	getter	setter
then i tried changing layoutparams.width turns out width and height are the only public properties in java history and objectanimator needs getter and setter

7902978
min	max
i know how to remove duplicates or how to replace them by max or min but couldn t find a way how to calculate a mean

7903033
hide	show
method 1 - show hide specific columns

7903033
hide	show
so the most direct way and this will work if there are only a handful of things you want to show hide is just to create a boolean column for every thing you need to show hide

7903033
hide	show
method 2 - show hide whole sections

7903033
hide	show
the next level that you might need is rather than showing hiding particular columns have your show hide boolean columns something like show_contact_info show_photos etc

7903033
hide	show
for each logical section that a user would show or hide

7903033
hide	show
method 3 - show hide sections based on who is viewing it

7903038
portrait	landscape
i m working on a photo view controller to display some photos in portrait and landscape view as well

7903046
post	get
on my wordpress web site i have two fields where the customer enters to and from post codes and upon entering these they are provided with suggestions a bit like sat nav where uyou enter the post code and in return get the full address the problem i have i this is working but not fully i am being shown suggestions but it wont show the name of the street and i cannot work out why instead i get the area whitch is not specific enough

7903083
int	double
unfortunately c++ does implicit casts from double to int so suddenly my first code snippet will compile

7903087
opera	google-chrome
google-chrome and opera both look at the file s contents detect that it s a png and display it as an image

7903162
firefox	safari
hybi-00 hixie-76 firefox 5.0 safari 5.1.1 use this old protocol with sec-websocket-key1 key2..

7903162
google-chrome	firefox
hybi-06 firefox 7.0 google-chrome 14 are using the last protocol with sec-websocket-key

7903186
versioning	upgrade
you can consider this something to think about when you upgrade to a new versioning of python which actually removes this module

7903197
public	protected
does object has to do any thing with public private or protected apart from the fact that if some thing is defined as public then objects too will be able to access irespective of the scope

7903219
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
in ie firefox google-chrome and safari my checkboxes looks like this

7903237
portrait	landscape
i am developing an html and javascript catalogue pageslider for ipad which shows one page in portrait and two pages in landscape

7903299
width	height
it seems that this function doesn t pass the actual width and height of the device screen

7903332
uiview	subviews
property accessoryview is just a usual uiview so you can add any subviews to it

7903336
put	get
but when i put notpersistent don t get fields from view and fields stay empty

7903337
width	height
you can use .actualheight and .actualwidth to get the rendered height width of a control

7903340
ant	maven
when using a decent tool for creating a web app like an ide ant with ivy or maven or a combination of these then handling and bundling dependencies should be no problem

7903384
width	height	actualheight	actualwidth
the thing is the width and height properties let you express the desired size whereas what you want is the rendered size - which can be accessed but not set using the actualwidth and actualheight properties

7903384
actualheight	actualwidth
because actualheight actualwidth is a calculated value you should be aware that

7903400
qapplication	qobject
qapplication is already a qobject so you should simply write

7903419
post	get
finally the case you re describing relates more to updating a specific post so post can get different image set for example

7903433
folder	directory
i believe windows phone does not have a current directory so the application probably looks in the root folder

7903456
width	height
i get unspecified dimension exceptions unless i specify the width and height of the drawer in dip which isn t ideal for supporting large small screen devices

7903471

7905453
integer	unsigned
as returns an unsigned integer this value will wrap round to max int - 2

7905494

interestingly i had to subtract the min of the status bar s height and width

7905540
portrait	landscape
i ve looked at this in the past and it similarly reports the same dimensions in both portrait and landscape except it reports having a rotate transform

7905540
width	height
not sure how your app works but if you aren t using a navigation controller of some kind you could have a uiview under your main view with the max height width of parent and grows shrinks with parent

7905540
uialertview	uiapplication	uialertview	uiwindow	uiapplication	uiwindow
start messing with uiwindows and you ll find out weird stuff like showing a uialertview will change uiapplication s keywindow to point at a new uiwindow that the uialertview created

7905962
multicastdelegate	delegation
all enum types for example inherit from system.enum which in turn inherits from system.valuetype which inherits from system.object all reference types. however i think the fact that fundamentally all delegation in fact inherit not just from delegation but from multicastdelegate is the critical realization here

7906022
width	height
in this solution boogaart came up with an implementation defining a new attached property similar to dockpanel.dock top which allows any element to provide its width and height for observation

7906023
min	max
you need to either aggregate max min avg or group by every field in the select statement

7906025
hide	show
and finally at some point after detecting the mouse click show hide the popover

7906026
kerberos	ldap
for that you might be better off just staying completely within ldap and don t venture into the kerberos

hide	show
i think this can be a starting point for what you re trying to do you use the div s display property to show hide it depending on what s selected in the dropdown

7906073
public	protected

i need to numerically calculate the first and second derivative of a function for which i ve attempted to use both splrep and univariatespline to create splines for the purpose of interpolation the function to take the derivatives

7906126
interpolation	splines
clearly the interpolation function created by the splines is totally incorrect

7906130
switching	screens
i m not sure if you have thought about doing this but one of the things you can do is check for the width of the screens resolution with javascript and then if the resolution is less than some number i use 480 because at that point that site looks bad then switching the css templates from the default to the mobile themed template

7906416
post	get
various developer tools fireug etc can convert get forms to post forms but generally a form is what is required

7906418
post	get
whether you use get or post the parameters will appear in

7906418
post	get
to use post instead of get simply produce in the document

division	subtract
case 2 the code could potentially return an error since f could subtract 1 from x and assign it back to the x in the parent environment where any x element equal to 1 could then be set to zero and the third line would return a division by zero error

7906903
width	height
if you know the height width or can calculate it somehow then you can use

if you instead make them popup controls you can show or hide them at any time on first navigation

7907157
put	get
if it does then you should then be able to do click on the appropriate link most likely selecting by the text in the link. you will also likely have to put a sleep of a second or so after the mouseover to give the client side code time to render the menu and get the objects inside it into a state where they can be seen and clicked

7907342
equals	gethashcode
won t use your implementation of gethashcode but you should implement it in line with your equals method anyway...

7907383
width	height
before set the width to 300px but no height and add the class ui-widget

7907383
width	height
after the dialog is created set the new width for the dialog wrapper and start an animate if the current height is lower then the calculated

7907501
ienumerable	ilist
in this case you might be safe to declare the controlslist as ienumerable rather than ilist assuming .net 4.0 because ienumerable is declared as covariant ienumerable

7907544
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
i tried this in safari google-chrome firefox all return the same thing

7907546
equals	gethashcode
then the comparison of these is done with the overriden equals and gethashcode methods

7907567
put	get
here s a weird behavior at least to my minunderstanding brain if i put two of these controls on the page and try and bind one of the datatables to the other i get data..

i have a python script that takes manages the stdin stdout and stderr of any application and allows for readline to be inserted gracefully

7907847
public	protected
i think the helpfulness of the public protected and private keywords is just to make the code more clear

7907847
public	protected
so you would use public for the api of a class private to make it clear how to do not extend a class and protected in every other case

7907847
public	protected
a common pragmatic approach is never use private and to use just public or protected

7907850

7908122
getter	setter
it s a little confusing that the getter setter for day-of-month have the names they do.

7908155
min	max
so i guess that is the answer that if you don t have a decimal portion to your min or max i d also assume you need to add one

children	parent
i m using a radtreeview to display some data and i need to be able to enable disable parent and children within the control independent of each other

7908805
children	parent
i m finding however that disabling the parent always disables the children no matter what the children are set as and i ve not had any luck finding a way around this

7908805
children	parent
i have a sneaking suspicion that because the children are visual children of the parent within the layout they will always enable disable along with the parent no matter what i do

7908817
put	get
if you want to simplify querying so you don t have to remember to get only the completed items or only the todo list then put the queries in a view and use the views instead of directly querying the table

7908819

7909151
firefox	safari
we reproduced this in safari mac firefox windows internet explorer

7909156
put	get
if #containershow is not doing anything except providing a place to put the content back you could get rid of it and just use show instead

7909163
children	parent
if you d like the toggled div to show up inside it s parent you can position the div_menu_button as relative and it s children as absolute

7909164
free	malloc
basically you replace every malloc in your source code with gc_malloc etc... and you don t bother calling free

7909164
free	malloc
boehm s gc don t allocate memory more quickly than malloc it is about the same or can be 30 slower but it has the advantage to deal with useless memory zones automatically which might improve your program and certainly eases coding since you don t care any more about free

7909164
profiling	benchmarking
but don t forget that premature optimization is evil and please benchmarking profiling your application to understand exactly where time is lost

7909194
stdout	fflush

7909445
ssl	https
make sure you use ssl https for transmitting the information from your web server to the client

7909487

but it looks like the richeditabletext component will autosize if you set its width and leave its height undefined

7909491
cakephp	lithium
some early blogging systems used that cakephp and lithium use output buffers to generate page caches

7909498
config	ini
if you are afraid your ini files parse too long maybe you could slice your config file and and not always load all settings

7909504
hide	show
the way i would do this is to set up an interval loop which periodically hide the last show element and displays the next one

7909563
width	height
for example a picturebox with height 0 and width 0 if you are going to use the image in a program

7909592
width	height
i ve tried changing width height using weights in a horizontal linearlayout setting width height programatically - all to no avail

7909639
portrait	landscape
this annoying behaviour only happened if the previous activity is in portrait mode if the previous one is landscape it is just fine

7909639
portrait	landscape
so what happened behind the scenes when back button is clicked currnet videoview activity landscape is destroyed a new videoview activity portrait is created due screenorientation configuration has been changed and destoryed immidiately where you can see the effects on screen last activity in stack is shown

7909711
avr	microcontroller
unless you re doing microcontroller arduino avr etc or firmware development python s high-level-ness won t be an issue at all

7909728
setinterval	settimeout
since there s no synchronous sleep function in javascript the only way to achieve this is to use settimeout or setinterval with a little bit more complicate logic to delay the execution of every loop of your complex calculations

7909956
margin	height
the div s margin will then collapse and the actual height of that div will be 70px

width	height
i assume from the docs for each rectangle then create a buffer to that rectangles height and width

7910651
width	height
the first rectangle always has a header and within that header the requested width and height

7910651
width	height
i m guessing i haven t received all of the first rectangles data even though i have set the sockets buffer size to width height bytes

7910661
hide	show
the logic will be show both images start the timer and when the timer ticks after 2 or 3 seconds or whatever you set the delay to be hide the images inside of the timer s actionlistener

rsa	dsa	ecdsa	rsa
i made a list of candidate algorithms - dsa ecdsa rsa for which there are crypto providers in java

7911156
rsa	dsa
comparing dsa vs rsa

7911156
rsa	dsa
dsa has signature that is independent of key strength and is much smaller than rsa signature for equivalent security rsa 1024 1568 vs dsa 192

7911156
rsa	dsa
however dsa verification expect verification calls to be 100x issue is about 10x slower than rsa verification

7911156
rsa	dsa
a review of dsa vs rsa also brought out other esoteric issues - secrecy of private key in dsa is very reliant on how random the k parameter is dsa does not support firewalled hashes which is not an issue for us

7911176
calloc	malloc
with regard to __nano_init being called twice you ve declared the function as a constructor so it s called when the library is loaded and it s called a second time explicitly when your malloc and calloc implementations are first called

grails expects the min and max values to be the same datatype as the associated property while the scale value is always required to be an integer

7911685
getter	setter
assuming you intend to use key-value coding to modify the array either directly or through bindings you need to implement both the getter and the setter for this object to be kvc-compliant for this property

7911685
accessor	properties
once you meet the minimum requirements for kvc compliance then kvc will recognize the properties and use its accessor including any array accessor you implement

7911709
for-loop	arrays
i trying to use contact form using j query php ajax but here in the below code the form information is gathered and send it to the server using for-loop and arrays of inouts of ofrm is created

7911726
accessor	properties
alternatively if you re not using kvc to access this properties then you need to make sure you re using the array accessor to access it

7911726
accessor	properties
you implemented undo support in your accessor at least the two whose implementations you showed and if anything is observing the properties via kvo that is another side effect

7911767

now if you recompile this assembly sign it using a strong name and redeploy it inplace without chaning the serializable data the assembly identity will not be considered the same and the deserialization code will not be able to use it for deserialization hence the error

i solved this by checking out the project using idea into a new folder and not letting tortoisesvn to upgrade working copy versioning

7913106

if you have any uncommited changes in the old folder you d probably have to either commit them first via tortoisesvn and then perform svn update on the new folder or to copy them into a new directory by hand

7913123
getter	setter
2 properties implement getter and setter you don t have to write javastyle getter and setter methods and pretend they belong together

7913130
versioning	upgrade
the solution might be either to switch to later 1.9 versioning ruby-1.9.2 s minitest does include that fix or to upgrade local ruby-1.9.1 minitest either manually or hopefully just by installing latest minitest gem

7914134
hide	show
if the functionality or the need to show or hide is affected by the absence of javascript then its a good idea to cope with the scenario

7914134
hide	show
which you can then apply to the element depending if you want to show or hide the element initially - regardless of whether javascript is available

7914134
hide	show
show is js is unavailable hide if js is available

7914509
children	parent

multiplying	subtract	multiplying	modulo
i need to optimize some code where i multiplying a vector of ints 32 bit by a scalar modulo p where p is the prime number 2 32 -5 and then subtract that vector from another vector modulo p

7914637
subtraction	multiplication
the mod p operation is what s taking up most of the execution time so one way to optimize this could to somehow not do modp after the multiplication and only do it after the subtraction

7914641
doc	rtf
i know we can display rtf doc and pdf formats in web view but that is a readonly view and is of no use in my case

7914758
division	modulo
i know of two ways to do this without using division or modulo

7914758
division	multiplication
the basic idea here is to pre-compute and approximation of the reciprocal of the p which allows you do an integer division using just a couple of integer multiplication

7914758
multiplying	modulo
then you can multiplying back and obtain your modulo

7914758
floating-point	integer
both approaches here involve no divisions aside from a pre-computation of the reciprocal either in integer or floating-point

7914759

idictionary	icollection
idictionary is for key- value maps icollection is for sets of similar objects

7914854
idictionary	icollection
both icollection and idictionary are unordered meaning that although you can retrieve the elements in some order with the copyto method or a foreach loop that order has no special meaning and it might change for no apparent reason

7914854
ilist	icollection
thatâ s the main difference between icollection and ilist a list lets you put items in specific positions just like an array and they stay there until you move them

7914862
tlabel	tpanel
i need to create a simple tpanel with some child controls like tedit or tlabel but this controls must be locked

7914862
tlabel	tpanel
when user click on tedit or tlabel the click mu be reflected to tpanel

implements	extends
the idea is to extends the flowpanel or indeed simplepanel to implements the relevant handler interfaces which is a much neater option for situations where you do not require the full functionality and focus capabilities of the focuspanel

add display block to your span element because inline elements ignore width and height properties

7914987

swt	swing
as for the issue that you don t see it in java style it is not only because it s a fairly new feature not that new since 2005 but because you don t override method that much in java at least not in swing or swt most commonly you will find them in tablemodel or when it s servlet in the extended httpservlet classes

min	max
google s formula creates numbers between min and max

7923059
int	double
for machines that support sse2 the cvttsd2si instruction is used by .net to convert the double into an int where overflow is mapped to 0x80000000 int.minvalue

google-chrome	firefox
some browsers such as firefox and google-chrome come with packages that will allow the browser to talk to sqlite dbs but they are not written in javascript and can do things that javascript cannot which is why they are included as browser-specific packages instead of as js scripts

7923929

why don t you show an actual element and hide it with js

7923979
post	put
i guess you can access post also if you put global post

7924017
int	chars
you could add a calculated column with year-month data using a chars 6 like 201104 for april 2011 that column can be updated using insert and update triggers or an int like 24136 24136 2011 12 + 4

7924036
notepad++	gedit
i was wondering if there was a relatively straightforward way to simulate this behavior in other programs such as notepad++ or gedit where users can set up scripts to compile programs

7924074
int	boolean
the same thing is happening in your example the int â boolean that you ve passed to takewhile isn t going to get fed any elements beyond the head of the stream until something like your foreach makes that necessary

7924397
hide	show
have a text field show up exactly on top of the password field hide is on focus and focus on the password field.

7924430
disk	ram
then run your program in the ram disk

7924445
profiler	yourkit
i haven t looked at yourkit in a very long time but i would be surprised if its profiler wasn t able to exclude packages or restrict profiled packages

i can t get a handle on how to put the pieces together

7924590
int	chars
indeed i agree that it would be nice from a convenience standpoint if java allowed arrays to be indexed by chars or even an enum rather than just int

7924645
int	chars
you can not mix different datatypes in an array like int and chars or jpanel and jframe or int and jbutton

7924645
int	chars	int	boolean
only if you abstract over the difference and use an jcomponent for jpanel and jframe as common parent but this will not work for the build-in types int chars boolean and so on because they aren t objects

7924645
int	chars
but can t you use autoboxing and use int instead of int chars instead of chars and then use object as common parent class

7924645
int	chars
if your base-types arrays of int byte chars string jpanel ... are of equal length then you have something like a hidden object a database-row

7924653

the pattern delimiter at either end mean the regex engine should know where the pattern ends so the engine shouldn t be confused by a spaces

7924891
int	chars
yes you can store chars in int data types

7924891
int	chars
a chars is just a int data type like int but with a narrower guaranteed range

7924891
int	chars
in fact it is sometimes the right thing to do to use int rather than chars to store a chars - for example if you are reading chars from a file you can use

7924891
int	chars
in this case you must use int rather than chars for the type of c in order to be able to distinguish eof from a valid chars

7924893
ant	maven
any java ide or command-line build tool ant maven gradle whatever understands this and behaves accordingly

google-chrome	safari
for some reason google-chrome does not re-antialias images once they ve been scaled up using a transform whereas safari seems to do so

in pre-2009 delphi ansi land you could use ord and chr to convert a character to a byte and vice versa

7926735
mockito	easymock
typically you should be fine with using a mocking framework like easymock or mockito in which case the number of additional classes required solely for testing purposes should be pretty less

7926763
ord	chr
carry on using ord and chr exactly as before

7926763
ord	chr
although the documentation for chr and ord implies that these function use byte as the integral type don t believe the documentation

7926765
for-loop	loops
also i found that this is not nearly as fast as the for-loop on my computer 0.35s for deal versus 0.05s for loops presumably because of the call to mat2cell

you won t be able to override the default browser behaviour of how it displays tooltips containing the title attribute text but you could follow the steps on this other question to show and hide a div containing the relevant text the approach uses jquery and deals with hover but adding a click handler isn t much of a stretch

7928216

hash	md5
as a professional cryptographer myself i would raise a suspicious eyebrow at the use of simple concatenation in md5 or even sha-256 these are merkleâ damgã rd hash functions which is fine for collision resistance but does not provide a random oracle there is the so-called length extension attack

7928642

in pbkdf2 the hash function is not used directly but through hmac

and some example code to add children to the parent

7931862
int	chars
however i am surprised how chars here is understood as 3 int because substring take two int

7931893
int	chars
this goes all the way back to c where chars is in essence a narrow int type and gets implicitly converted to int whenever necessary

7931898
sorting	grouping
the dataset is returning both the detail and summary rows - detail first then summary for each grouping - grouping and sorting being done in the stored procedure no grouping in the report

7931902
int	chars
now when you pass chars it is automatically promoted to int endindex and hence treated as int

7931943
filtering	grouping
it s basically and outer join between the agencies table and the rentals grouping by agency following your search filtering

7931945
int	double
the same occurs if you assign an int value to a double

7931945
int	double
1 is an int but it is implicitly cast to double 1.0

7931957
division	modulo
this kind of conversion is done using integer division and the modulo

7931957
division	modulo
with integer division you find out how many of the large unit you have and with modulo you find out how many of the small unit are left over

7931961
dependencyobject	freezable
didnt work for some reason i ended with exception the provided dependencyobject is not a context for this freezable but oddly only in some cases

7932000
versioning	upgrade
this could be due to a badly installed versioning of wmi wmi repository upgrade failure insufficient disk space or insufficient memory.

7932040
gridview	repeater
i have a repeater nested inside of a gridview

7932040
gridview	rowdatabound	gridview	repeater
on the rowdatabound event for the gridview i set the datasource based on one of the row s columns and then bind the repeater

7932045
post	get
you should use post instead get since get is meant to retrieve information more info

7932077
put	get
the response from the get is sacramento | ca | united states i can easily put the responses into input boxes but i can t figure out how to select an option based on the response

7932086
post	get
i have also read this blog post that says that it s not possible anymore but i know there are sites that still custom css - i just cannot get mine to work

7932088
int	chars
use int to store chars code points instead

7932092
put	get
my org has some silly requirements that you must put admin at the end of every svn commit message in order to get around some decision made by the svn gatekeepers that every commit should have an associated bug number

7932095
superclass	subclassing
i m trying to set up a parent class that extends a subclassing but whenever i attempt to reference this.element in the subclassing when called from the superclass it s undefined

7932116
keydown	keyup
i m not familiar with sendkeys enough to be sure about this but i d imagine what it is doing is saying shift keydown followed immediately by shift keyup so that you aren t getting time to click before the keyup event

7932121
int	chars
now you re storing the chars 3 an ascii value of 51 and if you tried using it as in int you would get 51

7932141
inherited	properties
actually what i found that was very helpful to me was going to properties manager - select the properties pages that all my projects inherited - double click to open the properties pages editor - click user macros - add a macro and define it s name and value

7932147
folder	directory
create a widgets folder under example module directory and create your widget there

7932184
puts	gets
i can see what is going on sort of i can get an js alert on ajax success for the form as a remote form that puts to the server and the update on the controller works -- the basic text gets changed but i need to refresh the page to see the changes

7932211
post	get
i ve tried various joins and subselects and i have managed to get a list of categories their post count and their first post i need the last

7932211
post	get
i have also managed to get a list of categories and their last post but not the post count

7932232
post	get
if you have no such field but you have for example post_date that is not unique you may get two rows for some categories in rare cases where two post have exactly the same timestamp

7932232
post	get
to also get categories without post use a left join

7932248
gridview	repeater
edit i suspect it might have something to do where you might need to rebind your gridview and not just the repeater

7932273
caliburn.micro	mef
i am currently getting into wpf and caliburn.micro for now without something like mef or autofac

7932287

ant	maven
running of the ant or maven before tests start is not supported

7932329
onmousedown	onkeydown
my preference is to not compromise the user experience just for analytics and i do this for a living. so my solution is to use onmousedown and onkeydown as substitutes together i refer to them as preclick

7932340
subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition	addition	multiplication
how do we check if any arithmetic operation like addition multiplication or subtraction could result in an overflow

7932348
children	parent
then child.parent works fine and if you want to remove children you d tell the parent which ones to remove

7932362
put	get
if you put the device a on the desk in stationary position then b on a perfectly horizontal turntable rotating slowly you will get the same qualitative sensor readings

7932369
google-chrome	firefox
the closing function works on ie and firefox but not on google-chrome

7932396
folder	directory
i would first try accessing that directory location or it s parent and make sure that your account has the proper permissions to create folder in that location

7932421
dynamicmethod	reflection.emit
wp7 does not support reflection.emit and therefore cannot use il generation and dynamicmethod

7932425
width	height
is it possible to set the width and height of a canvas element and have the existing content scale to fit these new dimensions

7932425
width	height
the canvas height and width are set to 800 x 600 and the image content scales appropriately and then is displayed

7932425
width	height
right now if i set the canvas width and height it just crops the image at those dimension not resizing as i would like

7932466
rss	feed
i m writing an android app that is parsing rss feed from different sources

7932466
rss	feed
what i m doing is on a remote server i m consolidating all of the rss feed into one big xml file then parsing that on the device using a sax parser instead of going to each site individually

7932466
rss	feed
so i m basically caching the rss feed for performance and it works pretty well

7932489
getter	setter
the suggested solution was to duplicate the date object in both getter and setter like

7932518
oncreate	setcontentview
the activity uses a standard oncreate call which set s up the content view from an xml resource via setcontentview r.layout.main

7932575
width	height
where dx dy dw dh are the destination x y width and height

7932576
width	height
ie8 has multiple issues with float and specific width height values on tags

the height width of the outer box this is static at 200px

7932701
unsigned	short
i need to read a byte array of 16 bits as unsigned short number and java doesn t support unsigned short type

7932710

simply put it does not need to reload the whole page to get new information

7932711
width	height
the height width of the outer box this is static at 200px

7932723
cos	sin
newx cos angle oldx - sin angle oldy

7932723
cos	sin
newy sin angle oldx + cos angle oldy

7932725
hash	md5
you need to store the combined resources in an application wide variable along an unique name based on the combination of the resources a md5 hash maybe

7932729
put	get
the path method wizard_path is ambiguous it can either refer to the delete clause in which case it needs an id argument wizard_path 22 or it can refer to the get and put clauses in which case it doesn t take an id argument

7932746
unsigned	short
i don t know if you have to use an unsigned short but in case you don t you can always use a char to hold an unsigned short

7932755
width	height
you should replace 200 by width height constant

7932771
createobject	activexobject
what can activexobject do that createobject cannot and vice-versa

7932774
unsigned	short
you cannot represent all values of an unsigned short in a short but in an int you can

7932815
folder	directory
you can publish to a folder that you ve already set up as a virtual directory

7932817
min	max
min max values are

7932820
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in firefox and google-chrome but it doesn t in ie

7932834
width	height
with xcode 4.2 and the llvm compiler when compiling for armv6 there are some very weird bugs in the generated application such as width property of cgsize returning the height instead

7932892
profiling	debugging
incorrect provisioning - verify that you have specified the correct provisioning profiling in debugging in the build settings for both the project and the target

7932921
google-chrome	firefox
it works perfectly in google-chrome but in firefox and internet explorer the css file does not render

7932930
int	boolean
you can leave off the astype int call if you re happy with an array of boolean rather than an array of int

7932937
hash	salt
ok so i understand the value of the salt in my hash passwords.

7932952
portrait	landscape
droid and flash often break after changing back and forth between landscape and portrait while in fullscreen. by break i mean freeze where you can hear the video and use the controls but everything is just a still frozen image the redrawing fails

7932975
superclass	subclassing
you can call the superclass s method from within the subclassing

7932986
wmi	managementeventwatcher
i m using a managementeventwatcher in c# to monitor wmi pnpentity events

7933007
ant	maven
note that the defaults depends on the build engine you use so if you use something else than eclipse ant or maven and you live supports-screens undefined in you manifest the defaults can be different then this

7933011
g++	gcc
or if there is a way for gcc or g++ to be able see these files in a location i specify when compiling

7933060
typedef	struct
i have typedef struct in my c++ code

7933080

heights seem tricky since the value is so different in portrait and landscape modes on a single device much less across devices

7933122
subtraction	add
but when i add a subtraction as follows

7933220
ubuntu	linux
vnc server vnc4server on a ubuntu linux host

7933229
int	chars
technically this is because chars is a subtype of int

7933229
int	chars
to determine whether substring int int is applicable to argument int chars we first try 15.12.2.2 phase 1 identify matching arity methods applicable by subtyping we need to test whether chars is a subtype of int

7933229
int	chars
then to assign the chars argument to the int parameter per 15.12.4.5 create frame synchronize transfer control we apply 5.3 method invocation conversion which converts chars to int per 5.1.2 widening primitive conversion

7933283
hash	md5
are there any programs out there that will scour a hard drive for a specific md5 hash

7933292
gridview	repeater
as for your problem i would suggest either rebinding the gridview when new items are added to the repeater or find the repeater in the event that saves the new record and rebind it there

7933381
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome and firefox when i log in and persist cookie then close the browser and then bring up the same page i am already logged in

7933421
getter	setter
these classes has some additional internal logic inside overriden property setter and getter

7933437
google-chrome	safari
while this would appear to work it doesn t since the temp file is cleared from memory before safari google-chrome can actually read the data system returns once the command open returns which does not take into account the amount of time needed for safari google-chrome etc

7933437
google-chrome	safari
if not is there a way to wait for safari google-chrome etc

7933522
box-shadow	box-sizing
whenever i use css3 style commands like box-shadow box-sizing background gradient etc in my visual studio 2010 projects and compiles it vs shows one or more errors regarding css3 styles

cocos2d-x	corona
i m not aware of any virtual joypad library that isn t built for cocos2d-x unity corona or some other engine

7933626
viewdidload	dealloc
would generate two viewdidload messages to the datainputviewcontroller followed by one viewwilldisappear and one dealloc

7933626
viewdidload	dealloc
i expected a single viewdidload with no viewdiddisappear or dealloc

7933641
children	parent
but the children property for each parent entity is null

7933657
post	get
the problem is passing the function this way sends it as undefined via post and if i enclose it in quotes then when i try to call it i get the error that it is not a function

7933701
public	protected
the rule of thumb is public is too weak and private is too strong you need some form of selected access either protected or friend

7933782
button	checkbox
user controls can be button checkbox input text boxes mice keyboards etc

7933783
button	checkbox
user controls can be button checkbox input text boxes mice keyboards etc

7933791
children	parent
you must either make both parent and children virtual to support lazy loading it can trigger really lot of queries to database or you must explicitly tell ef to load children by using eager loading

7933795
pop-up	dialog
my question is when i click the listpreferene it pop-up a dialog and when i click an entry that why the onresume or oncreate method of my preference activity is not called

7933813
xsl-fo	xslt
you definitely do not need to write custom fo s for every file write an xslt just once and use it on-the-fly to convert your xml to xsl-fo and then use a rendering engine to process xsl-fo to pdf

7933852
viewdidload	viewwillappear
move your code that depends upon the view being the right size to viewwillappear instead of viewdidload or an init method

7933858
hex	binary
if i have a binary executable containing compiled c code can i use a hex editor to edit that binary and change a specific instruction into another one such as nop or jmp

7933887
inherited	properties
the own properties are those that are not inherited from the prototype so by using that function on x you are explicitly excluding all the properties of object.prototype

7933938
ienumerable	iqueryable
the query can be executed in two ways either by implementing the getenumerator method defined in the ienumerable interface in the query class which inherits from iqueryable

7933951
xslt	xquery
you should pass a properties object as suggested by the documentation for getitemasstring which contains an indent key set to no as documented in the xslt 2.0 and xquery 1.0 serialization reference

7933962
children	parent
if this isn t how you intended you will have to switch the relationship so that parent can have multiple children by setting up a many to many relationship or by switching the direction of the many to one

7933965
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
works for me in google-chrome firefox and opera

now if i choose a table row from popover view and push a new screen for the master and detail view the navigation bar button disappears and wont appear until i rotate the device to landscape and then back to portrait

7934075
int	boolean
next sort by b.member not being null - mysql will coerce this boolean result into an int 1 or 0 which can be sorted so sort descending to make all the 1 s not null b.members sort first

7934088
width	height
element s metadata say x coordinate y coordinate height width

7934103
hide	show
one more option is hide webview and show it after webview loading is complete in webview delegate method

7934107
hide	show
i probably should add that i use .show and hide whenever i use cancel button to hide the form and show other stuff

7934129
spaces	linefeed
that said here is what is happeneing when you cave out memory in a buffer overflow you have a limited amount of spaces available for your exploit before you hit the stored stack frame instruction pointer the mpeg2 browser bug which you are trying to exploit allocates 1024 bytes on the stack which is thusly the limit of your payload as well it is terminated by the standard series x00 x09 x0a x0d thats null char stop carriage return and linefeed respectively which further limits you to any shellcode which is not written with this in mind

7934130
sms	tropo
tropo does not have an email gateway for receiving sms

7934130
sms	tropo
applications that send sms by email won t be able to send to tropo

7934130
sms	tropo
one thing you could do is built a small catcher application that receives the rest call from backpack and then makes a rest call to tropo to send the sms

7934186
outputstream	inputstream
also i can t use the method mentioned here as i want to pass the socket instance so that the request handler can get outputstream and inputstream on the socket

7934258
sms	tropo
tropo is a cloud api for sending and receiving phone calls sms and instant messaging

7934259
sms	tropo
tropo is a cloud communications service which provides web applications the opportunity to send and receive phone calls sms text messages and instant messages

7934288
crypt	md5
after hearing that md5 isn t safe for password storage mysql i decided to use php s crypt with blowfish tell me if you know any better algorithms

7934303
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in google-chrome firefox safari and ie9+

7934310
solaris	aix
therefore if we could just have a find binary for each solaris and aix platforms we have we would have an easy fix

7934338
put	get
as far as the api s they are mostly just get put operations for the files and the files are xml based

7934388
crypt	hash
check out example #3 using crypt with different hash types

7934400
swt	swing
your underpinnings options are pretty much swing or swt

7934400
swt	swing
swing is a pretty good gui framework architecturally although some prefer swt

7934418
entities	entitymanager
the entitymanager holds a references to all managed entities since the em is required to return the same instance on subsequent query and find calls to maintain identity

7934418
entities	entitymanager
if this is not done already will want to clear the entitymanager or obtain a new one at certain points to release the memory and managed entities

7934425
put	get
put in id get info

7934493
g++	gcc
you might perhaps extend gcc actually g++ assuming it is at least 4.6 with a plugin or a gcc melt extension melt is a high level domain specific language to extend gcc which does what you want for instance providing an additional builtin which encode the type of its arguments in some constant string etc... but that does require some work and is specific to gcc

7934504
jar	war
provided two maven projects j jar w war

7934507
postgresql	mysql
i would like to use massive with mysql and i see there are sql default postgresql oracle and sqllite providers for massive

7934513
timeago	datejs
it provides a lot of the things that datejs provides formatting parsing manipulation timeago i18n etc but it s smaller faster and doesn t ruin the native date prototype

7934576
rss	feed
i m trying to use java rome-fetcher to acquire rss feed for processing

7934577
jsonb	hstore
hstore json or jsonb fields in postgresql

7934577
jsonb	hstore
json jsonb fields support any json-encodable data type not just key value pairs but also tend to be faster and for jsonb more compact than hstore

7934577
int	boolean
it also supports types other than strings such as int boolean and nested dictionaries

7934675
post	put
this post claims that someone must simply put a message via rabbitmq and then the task shall be executed

7934723
folder	directory
the target directory contain the lib with dependencies but it is located in folder with the artifact name

7934736
width	height
it s set width and height on itself

7934744
width	height
if i hard-code the pixel dimensions of the player in the call it works but i want it to adjust based on the dimensions of the webview which uses android width fill_parent and android height wrap_content and change depending on screen orientation

7934744
oncreate	onstart
from what i ve read i ve tried waiting for oncreate to finish and calling getheight and getwidth in the onstart and onresume methods but they both still return 0

7934744
width	height	oncreate	onstart
for some reason i always get 0 as the height and width whether i call the method in oncreate onstart or onresume

7934748
post	get
what do i call to get the post content xml file into a variable to mess with it

7934757
postgresql	mysql
eventually we are planning on moving our current site from mysql to postgresql and i m also wondering the same question but also interms of postrgresql mono and dapper on linux

7934767
vim	emacs
many popular editors vim emacs will then read the tags file and let you quickly jump to definitions by name

7934767
ubuntu	debian
i m using exhuberant ctags which is what you get if you install ctags on a rhel-ish system but it s certainly available under debian ubuntu os x and so forth

7934777
int	double
the cost is not so high just a conversion to from int from to double and a multiplication modern processors will do it in a very little amount of time and since the accessed memory is less if the list contains a lot of values your code will be more friendly with processor cache

7934780
vmware	virtualbox
are there any objective-c compilers that run under windows 7 other than running ios under virtualbox or vmware

7934846
width	height
flexible width and height

7934846
width	height
fixed width and height

7934846
width	height
fixed width and height

7934846
portrait	landscape
position the views correctly in portrait mode in ib and everything should resize correctly for landscape mode and preserve the layout

7934853
uilabel	uitextview
i have a fixed-size uilabel and or uitextview and i need to fit variable multiline text in these views

7934854
for-loop	loops
if condition is set to false loops ends without having to break out of the for-loop

7934854
for-loop	loops
an extension of the above reasons methods with access to condition can end loops without going over all other items in the said list or implementing a special check in the for-loop

7934868
firefox	safari
but on the password field you needed to change the input type from text to password which works in browsers like safari or firefox but not ie ie doesn t support the setattribute function very well

7934868
width	height
one that is the correct width height etc

7934868
firefox	safari
works great should work in all browsers although only tested in safari on mac and ie firefox on windows

7934890
profiling	debugging
and i am looking for a simple solution even that would be acceptable if the profiling data was written out to the debugging window

7934902
istream	getline
this istream getline call reads up to the first newline which is the newline that follows jaws

7934917
uilabel	uifont	uilabel	uitextview	uifont	uitextview
you could use a for-loop that increases the size of the uifont until the size exceeds the uilabel or uitextview

7934925
client-side	server-side
change your server-side method to match the type of data you re passing in from the client-side

7934937
equals	gethashcode
i overwrote equals gethashcode and for the type to be compared

7934960
hash	md5
it also needs to be everything on that page including comments as i would like to create a md5 hash from it is this possible at all

7934964
width	height
the webview is a heavy component and its possible that it has not been fully rendered on the screen before you tried to get its width and height

7934964
width	height
the dimensions of the webview would always equal those of the framelayout as long as it is the only child and both its width and height are set to match_parent

7935025
propertychangelistener	listeners
swing listeners are based on the propertychangelistener interface and that utility class so if you are using it in ui code you ll find it more appropriate

7935028
hash	md5
so if you really need an md5 hash of the original html page and need it to be accurate you will have to request it again from the server it will probably end up coming from the browser cache and calculate your own md5 hash of what you download from that - you can t use innerhtml of the current document

7935064
vsts	tfs
so one of the most important reasons to use tfs as version control system is because it play this central role in vsts allows this traceability and simply does the job

7935079
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
this works fine on firefox google-chrome opera but any ie version

7935160
rss	feed
is there a way to create an rss feed that only customers who have logins to our customer portal would be able to see the content of the feed

7935160
rss	feed
i know i can secure the rss feed using standard asp.net authentication which would be fine for viewing while on our site.

7935170
hide	show
my goal is to switch between them hide all and show only the active form

pipe	file-descriptor
you re always suppose to read from file-descriptor 0 and write to file-descriptor 1 with pipe .

7935264
integer	unsigned
boost posix_time ptime and system.datetime are both very lightweight structs which just wrap an unsigned integer so they are good function return values

7935269
qstring	qtablewidgetitem
no matter what the qstring returned from qtablewidgetitem text is an empty string

7935283
rss	feed
what you could do though is secure it with basic authentication and let the users that are suppose to be able to access the rss feed include the username and password in the url

would list the files in the workspace dir in your home folder for you to open

7935324
bottle	flask
if you re looking for small implementations you might get better results with bottle or flask

7935358
try-catch	exception-handling
if it s a common exception-handling there may be even several hundreds of such try-catch blocks in a larger codebase

7935358
pop-up	dialog
now let s assume that we need to introduce pop-up dialog based exception handling instead of console logging or start to additionally send an e-mail to the development team

i haven t defined an explicit post function but i am using the get function instead

7935442
post	get
this part handles the post get requests

7935456
button	checkbox
i would normally use a checkbox or radio button for multiple options but i want to use an image to do this

7935457
cells	tablecell
if the tablecell is being reused by the tableview via reuse then it will remain available to be reused when a cells of the same type is needed

7935505
fastcgi	scgi
go for fastcgi or even scgi which is a much simpler protocol to implement than fastcgi if you don t want to use a library or if you have specific needs for such an implementation

7935554
google-chrome	firefox
i have html form for basic user login it works google-chrome firefox even ie8

7935558
phong	shading

7935616
inherited	properties
so how does charlie inherited the properties of cat if they are not defined in its prototype

7935616
inherited	properties
i was under the assumption that the whole point of the prototype object is to mirror or store the properties of the constructor that will be inherited by all instances of cat - is this wrong

7935616
inherited	properties
i guess it can t be object.getownpropertynames cat.prototype because that would not return inherited properties

7935618
system.data.oracleclient	odp.net
agreed that using odp.net is better than deprecated system.data.oracleclient

7935692
put	get
the prototype will never get the properties that you put in the object

7935697
inherited	properties
store the properties of the constructor that will be inherited by all instances of cat- is this wrong

7935722
width	height
the question is how can i have it to display the width height values while resizing the browser

7935724
division	multiplication
first of all multiplication is faster than division

7935724
division	multiplication
your compiler is usually smart enough to replace division with multiplication on constants if the results is the same but it will not do that with variables of course

7935724
division	multiplication
the first uses two multiplication and one division the second uses one division and one multiplication

7935728
versioning	upgrade
i would suggest to upgrade to maven 3.0.3 and the latest versioning of the assembly plugin first to see if that fixes it

7935739
mp3	wav
if you supply it wav and mp3 then the player will use wav or mp3 via html5 if it can or mp3 via flash as a last resort

7935744
width	height
for the same reason you want to make certain arrays have the size of pitch height where pitch is the width rounded up to the nearest multiple of whatever storage unit you are using

7935744
width	height
check that width and height are compatible with your gpu specifications for thread block size

7935745
primefaces	richfaces
the big mistake richfaces doesn t make that primefaces does make is that

7935776
min	max
the max and min aggregates come to mind

7935797
folder	directory
also if you install to the c program files or c program files x86 directory you will need to adjust the permissions on the tidy folder to allow non-administrator access

7935803
folder	directory
also if you install to the c program files or c program files x86 directory you will need to adjust the permissions on the tidy folder to allow non-administrator access

7935812
width	height
your dev_histogram will have an actual width equal to pitch and height equal to your specified height

7935812
width	height
width and height are the dimensions of your 2d array

7935844
stdout	stderr
will capture stdout and stderr in

post	get
i ll lay out the code that i m using in its entirety but what it boils down to is how do i get the content of a post from the wordpress database and replace the contents of an html with that content

7935849
cos	sin
i had to get the x and y coords of the arm based of angle then i got the sin cos of a number that was based of the same angle as the arm and subtraced from that

7935882
button	checkbox
to get around this i used checkbox with the definite argument true or false wrapped up in a button that changes the state

7935908
fpdf	fpdi
just a quick n dirty example using fpdf and the fpdi classes

7935924
disk	ram
to supplement the disk throw lots of ram at it so that the database is stored mostly in memory

7935958
cifs	smb
however i looked at some cifs smb traces i have saved from a few years back

7935967
post	get
1 what is the correct way to get this to post to my db

7935972
folder	directory
my goal is to have python write the file under file_name to a file in the address folder in the feed folder in the current directory ie where the python script is saved

7936008
for-loop	loops
whereas indexof is essentially a loops which runs on per character basis which probably means you have 3 loops within your main for-loop ofcourse indexof won t be as slow as a regular loops but still when the input size grows the time increases

7936022
int	chars
checks for non int for the first 3 chars and then only accept int

7936062
folder	directory
commands like os.mkdir don t actually require that you make the folder in your current directory

7936067
getter	setter
by supplying my own getter and setter i can see that both the getter and the setter are used in the process in that order like it was actually

7936133
jax-ws	jax-rs
solution is to use tomee plus which supports jax-ws in addition to some other technologies like jax-rs and jms

7936136
ready	each
i could call recv in each one in this case some calls shall fail or poll the list and later call recv on ready sockets

7936140
getter	setter
so you can either create a custom type that un marshals using an xmladapter or you can be mischievous with your getter setter logic

7936160
xamarin.ios	xamarin.mac
the xamarin.ios xamarin.mac and xamarin.android sdk are going open source

7936197
treeview	expander
i first thought you could modify both treeview and treeviewitem styles by removing all the left margin and make the header the same left margin as the expander button

7936198
hide	show
i have a spinner in my app the dropdown list of spinner have many items and have scroller so when pop the spinner the notification is show and then hide when i choice one item as pic i have read

7936211
tunnel	vpn
as we don t have office-side vpn hardware the simplest and free solution proved to be an ssh tunnel

7936231
getter	setter
as was already mentioned it seems rather odd to have two getter setter pairs for the same private variable

7936261
folder	directory
using the bucket sort via system directory it would be optimized to keep a separate folder for items that have yet to be sorted and sort the whole lot in batches

7936331
int	chars
the used with sscanf basically means to ignore a string any chars up until a whitespace and then after that you re telling it to read in an int d

7936367
codeigniter	cakephp
i am a newbie to drupal and have used cakephp and codeigniter frameworks earlier

7936370
avr	microcontroller
i m using an avr microcontroller to write to a programmable frequency divider chip via the i2c bus

7936372
post	get
this previous post gave an interesting example using union s to get around the 1000 record limit but it only works if each query returns less than 1000 records which at a large company would probably require lots of unions.

7936376
ceil	floor
these work because if x 0.5 floor x + 0.5 floor 1 1 and ceil x - 0.5 ceil 0 0

7936392
implements	extends
and either an abstract class or interface all operands extends implements

7936395
rss	feed
to get it done please see the following article that walks you through the whole process how to create a custom rss feed in wordpress in 12 lines of code

7936405
temp	tmp
- teamcity sets the temp and tmp environment vars to its own temp directory

7936407
pull	push
don t forget to push your update and pull other s back from github

7936415
int	chars
as auscbloke has said you need to read the all of the unwanted chars before the int into a std string

7936462
nsdateformatter	nscalendar	nsdateformatter	nsformatter	nscalendar	nsformatter
however the thread safety summary lists both nscalendar and nsformatter nsdateformatter s superclass as â œthread-unsafeâ saying

7936479
width	height
it s simply an iframe with 100 width and height but my main problem is that the full page ad is shown in a website that has a vertical scrollbar so if the iframe ad also has a scrollbar then two scrollbars are visible and it looks bad

7936498
uicontrol	uibutton
a good example of this is uicontrol s addtarget action forcontrolevents method you usually use when creating uibutton or some other control objects programmatically

7936502
int	chars
would it be easier to convert to an chars loop through it and convert back to int when needed

7936507
spaces	delimiter
tags being spaces delimiter

7936534
g++	gcc
both g++ and gcc programs are from the same free software project gcc

7936534
g++	gcc
however on ubuntu you have several different packages for them so install the g++-4.6 or the g++ package with gcc-4.6 or gcc one

7936536
width	height
two of which take up full width but not much height

7936671
width	height
if you want to avoid this you should give the boxes with a black border dimensions on the sides not having a border equal to the width of the border so add border none first then add dimensions like if normal height is 20 and border is 5 and you want a border on the right you would set height 30

7936684
webkit	gecko
to be clear i m aiming to use a rendering engine like gecko or webkit with .net

7936702
fgets	feof
i would also loop based on since feof will return a true value after fgets errors and hits eof so your last buffer-full will be printed twice

7936702
fgets	fread
also as others have stated while i took too long to answer fread may be a better alternative since fgets won t necessarily read 10 chars

7936777
haskell	scheme
on the other hand higher-level languages like c# or java ruby python perl haskell scheme etc have a more or less substantial underlying runtime support system

7936777
haskell	scheme
it s just a lot lighter weight than the one for ruby or haskell or scheme

7936799
uicontrol	uibutton
however if your accessory view inherits from uicontrol uibutton etc you may set a target and action through the addtarget action forcontrolevents method

7936818
int	double
don t use double to hold int

7936846
width	height
the other part should allow the iframe to use the full width height of the browser

7936860
google-chrome	firefox
this works in internet explorer and firefox however in google-chrome it appears that the max-width is being ignored when width is present

7936860
google-chrome	firefox
which again works in ie and firefox but the max-width is ignored in google-chrome

7936876
uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
the longer answer is to derive this view controller from uitabbarcontroller rather than from uiviewcontroller as i suggest in this answer

7936877
pull	push
usually one makes the developers merge in their changes and then push the the release manager pull from the developer s already merged repo

7936879
profiling	instrumentation
you can use the performance counter hardware on your cpu to get profiling data without adding instrumentation to the code itself

7936891
scheme	racket
by the way this code is in racket plt scheme a subset of scheme

7936924
getter	setter
some may only look at public variables in your classes or just call on public methods that look like getter setter

7936945
onresume	onpause
have a static boolean variable in your activity called isrunning that you set false when ever onpause is called and true whenever onresume is called

7936946
post	get
i m trying to get all post messages using restfb my code is as follows

7936946
post	get
is there anyway i can get a full list of post messages matching the search criteria without setting limit parameter

7936953
aggregate-functions	sum
by storing everything as varchar you make it harder to use aggregate-functions sum avg etc. and functions that work with specific data types like sql server s date time functions dateadd datediff etc.

7936986
folder	directory
the final folder structure of the app will be like this bin directory contains the compiled assemblies and in the same level as bin folder have the app_data folder and have the database inside this app_data folder

7936989
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
in opera google-chrome ie and safari the first checkbox makes the top row visible or invisible and the second checkbox makes the second row compressed invisible or extended visible

7937002
imagemagick	graphicsmagick
you can apparently install imagemagick graphicsmagick on a machine and dotcloud also has im available

7937011
width	height
fourth - if you want the buttons to have a specific size you could do so by replacing the values wrap_content by xxdp for the width and height

7937014
serializable	deserialization
i m facing an annoying situation where my serializable deserialization isn t as expected

7937014
serializable	deserialization
i m using the in-framework serializable deserialization helpers

7937073
screens	tablet
filtering out tablet by specifying compatible screens sizes makes no sense

7937205
post	get
this also means the user does not need to get and post an entire google maps link

7937208
hide	show
if you know the controls that you d like to appear on the page dynamically then i d approach the problem by including those controls in the xaml and using the visibility property on the controls to show and hide them

7937208
hide	show
you can show hide groups of controls by changing the visibility of their parent control such as stackpanel or custom control

7937215
multiplying	subtract
multiplying this my the denominator and subtract it from the numerator

7937239
post	get
either add a timestamp to your get request or use post instead

7937269
division	multiplication
to be able to easily do multiplication needed also for the division algorithm a reasonable choice for the base with 32-bit integers is 9999 because 9999 9999 is still less than 2 32 and so can be computed directly without overflows

7937298
prepare	execute
but when i execute the package it failed to run showing fail status for steps like prepare for execute pre-execute execute

7937311
inherited	properties
yes you have to re-apply the attribute because the reliabilitycontract has its inherited properties set to false and that means methods in derived classes won t have the attribute applied

7937361
post	get
this is not looking the javascript problem because after submitting the page get refreshed and you are validating on server side so you can use post global vars to return the value or you can ask me with more information

7937377
mp3	wav	mp3	aiff	wav	aiff

drills through the whole directory structure of the folder you want to

7937417
gridview	repeater
i have a repeater and three gridview s inside the repeater

7937417
gridview	repeater
each gridview has different columns than the others since i have a stored procedure and each gridview has different columns based on the value of a hiddenfield inside the repeater

7937418
width	height
if you want to keep the aspect ratio of the image while resizing it you can keep only one of the width or height as constant while other one you need to calculate based on the aspect ratio

7937458
google-chrome	firefox
robbrit s answer is very useful but i find the solution to just be ok for google-chrome and a failure under ie8 and firefox

7937466
ssms	sqlcmd
if sqlcmd mode is an option for your within ssms for example you can do this

7937512
shibboleth	simplesamlphp
if you want to stick with saml you can also look at shibboleth or even simplesamlphp simplesamlphp is a php server that acts as a saml identity provider among other things but you still need a service provider within your applications

7937516
google-chrome	firefox
in ie there is no problem but with google-chrome and firefox the upload fails

7937525
sysml	uml
it is therefore a standard language designed by the same group ho designed mof uml sysml and mda in general

7937536
g++	gcc
what is the equivalent of __declspec naked in gcc g++

7937542
equals	gethashcode
you need to override gethashcode and equals methods in your customer class

7937557
for-loop	loops
the while loops is equivalent to the for-loop

7937598
g++	gcc
on linux you should compile with both -g to get debugging information produced by the compiler and -wall to get all warnings passed to gcc or g++

7937610
udp	tcp
how should i manually open ports tcp 1554 and udp 2000-2006 for ip 192.168.0.1

7937610
udp	tcp
you have to manually open ports tcp 1554 and udp 2000-2006 for ip 192.168.0.1

7937637
submit	submission
lets say i proceed the submission like this first submit aa

7937638
g++	gcc
order of arguments to the compiler gcc or g++ are really important

7937638
ubuntu	linux
the advices above are not specific to ubuntu 11.10 they could apply to other linux distributions and other ubuntu versions

7937651
stdout	stderr
after some trial and error i ve been able to successfully send a pty-req followed by a shell request i can get the login preamble send commands and receive stdout but i m not exactly sure how to tell the ssh service i want to recieve stderr and status messages

7937656
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox and google-chrome i get no results

7937656
google-chrome	firefox
however if i change the datatype to html i get correct results in firefox and google-chrome and then get no results in ie .

7937664
int	double
rather than using double or bigdecimal i would use int values because this is the type you need at the end of the day and unless your screen has more than 2 billion pixels across or down you don t need long double or bigdecimal

7937679
portrait	landscape
i am trying to create a layout where when in portrait mode the layout_gravity should be center_vertical and when i am in landscape mode it should be top

7937684
portrait	landscape
if the user clicks the button in portrait mode and changes to landscape mode the activity restarts or refreshes again

7937687
lisp	sml	ocaml	sml	xlib	xcb
some implementations of some languages sml common lisp ocaml made that choice of implementing the x11 protocol without using the xlib or xcb c libraries

7937688
onmouseover	mouseout
some of those block elements have onmouseover mouseout events attached to them

7937699
g++	gcc
on the first steps of programming you should not use ide because you will better understand what happens backside gcc or g++ and stdlib will be sufficient

7937699
cvs	svn
you also should read about makefiles svn cvs git autotools or cmake to manage your projects

7937702
g++	gcc
if you are familiar with the command line you can use an editor like vim and gcc g++ to compile your code learning make svn git is also recommend

7937755
for-loop	loops
i would like my while loops to block at most 5 seconds for all threads it creates in the for-loop

7937771
onkeyup	onblur
note it may better to check them on onblur rather than onkeyup

7937786
postgresql	mysql
dummy mysql oracle postgresql postgresql_psycopg2 sqlite3 error was no module named django_mongodb_engine.base

7937809
portrait	landscape
when the activity goes from portrait to landscape the oncreate method is executed again thus creating the button again

7937836
onmouseover	onclick
on the subject of javascript jquery â you shouldn t really use inline event handlers such as onclick onmouseover

7937845
post	get
i will also post some code parts later when i get access to a computer

7937854
rss	feed
this is on the rss feed of my self hostet wordpress-blog within the section

7937859
verilog	vhdl
the xilinx documentation gives example vhdl and verilog that xst can use to infer the more efficient components

7937872
ienumerable	icollection
easiest way if you use c# 4 is to use ienumerable instead of icollection because ienumerable supports contravariance

7937921
rss	feed
for example there could be a module that handles rss feed

7937921
rss	feed
the module could return the content of a rss feed for urls such as example.com channel 1 and the partial content of a rss feed with urls similar to example.com subchannel 2 1

7937970
button	checkbox
name is used for grouping radio button and checkbox when it s the same name their are in a group so checking one will will uncheck the other

7937998
hide	show	backgrounding	multitasking
the reason for this is the double clicking exit button use case that actually does not hide your view or put you in the backgrounding state it just scrolls up a bit to show the multitasking menu at the bottom

7938069
typedef	struct
giving a name to the struct that is being typedef allows the programmer to use either person or struct person

7938069
typedef	struct
so a bit of flexibility not to mention you don t have to change already written code after typedef ing the struct

7938093
try-catch	exception-handling
but the problem is if this is the case the try-catch clause does not catch the exception-handling

width	height
i want to create a picturescrollfield using some images in blackberry.by default it is displayed on the top of the screen with the given width and height

7938147
serializable	deserialization
i think the problem is due to the serializable and deserialization of the amf body

7938152
instances	transient
transient that will create new instances each time you call resolve

7938206
uiview	subviews
to do this i have created a subviews called searchview which is represented by a uiviewcontroller and use a simple uiview for presentation

7938247
postgresql	mysql
are relational databases specifically mysql and postgresql appropriate as the datastore for such system

7938264
serializable	deserialization
if you do all the processing in a stored procedure and only send the small result this is faster but mainly because all processing stays inside the sql engine so there s no serializable deserialization nor sending back and forth of data

7938283
rubygems	rvm
i run on vagrant with rvm and ruby 1.8.7 rubygems 1.3.7

it works in ie7 ie8 ie9 firefox safari google-chrome but not on opera

7938308
width	height	width	margin	margin	height
this div need to occupy the total height and width of the screen window size with 5 px margin

7938356
width	height
first of all you probably need to set the css elements html and body to a height and width of 100

7938356
width	margin
if you fit a div element with a size equal to the screen and then gives it a 5px margin the width in total will be 100 + 5px

7938373
put	get
i don t get how to put the things together

7938433
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
priorityqueue is not sortedlist or sorteddictionary

7938437
hide	show
by using below function we can show and hide two different inputs

7938438
capitalize	uppercase
just stupid examples but i need to separate words that are full uppercase from words that are only capitalize

7938438
capitalize	uppercase
i could have uppercase words and capitalize words

7938471
width	height
you may add some calculations to the width height for a real scale of your avatar when copying into

7938495
postgresql	mysql
in the latter case you need to send login data through http or any other tcp based protocol and once data is on you application server you can insert it on any database it supports mysql postgresql oracle sqlserver sybase you name it

here typedef is used just to create a synonym alias for pointer to struct node

7941322

uint32 is a 32-bit 4-byte unsigned integer

7941907

i suppose they are some typedef respectively for a floating point type and an unsigned integer type guaranteed to be 32 bit wide

7941907
unsigned	short
on most platforms they will simply decay to float at least on any machine that uses the ieee 754 standard and on 32 bit machines to unsigned int on some 64 bit platforms it may decay to unsigned short

one option could be to ditch the button and just use the uiview touches to detect when to add the subviews you want to let the user drag.

7942031
post	put
you have to put post into div but you cannot put div into tr or table

7942036
uiview	uipangesturerecognizer
as daniel suggested ditch the button and just use a uiview but i believe you may need to have a uipangesturerecognizer in place to get your dragging

7942222
free	malloc
you have to keep track of every chunk of memory you malloc and free it when you re done using it

7942231
free	malloc
if you don t need the malloc ed space at the end of one iteration anymore you should free it right away

7942237
children	parent
this is roughly what i have been doing.since every children has only one parent then the path from root to one arbitrary node is unique as well.so i wanna set all the other paths as null in case that i could take advantage during recursion

in very simple cases for example all functions take only integer or floating-point arguments it s possible but as soon as pointers get involved you need to provide more information will the function read from the pointed-to value write to it or both

7946560
winpcap	jpcap
in windows in it is possible with use of winpcap and jpcap and i wonder if sth similar i may find on android

7946575
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome safari firefox background gradient is shown correctly however as page does not have content to fill the whole screen background just stops and a half of the screen is white

7946589
stateless	stateful
i m new to ejb and i m trying to understand the diference between stateless and stateful bean so i made a simple example to test them

7946649
google-chrome	firefox
i want compatibility with latest releases of modern browsers google-chrome firefox

7946649
opera	safari
safari mobile safari opera are desirable

7946649
width	height
i know width and height of whole page

7946649
width	height
i know width and height of image

7946649
width	height
i know width of inset but not its height since there is additional caption text there

7946649
google-chrome	firefox
if inset is in end of the text it is displayed in the right column at the bottom clipped from the left side to the column width in google-chrome and overflowing to the left column in firefox without pushing its text

7946678
move	drag
i want now to make them move on the canvas by a mouseevent in other words to drag them with the mouse and to move them on the canvas

7946684
tunnel	vpn
obviously you d need to set the firewall policies on your vpn tunnel correctly to allow this.

7946684
tunnel	vpn
i really would recommend using the vpn solution if you can but if you can t http tunnel is the most secure way to support connecting directly through the web server to the db server

7946718
rational-numbers	fractions
i haven t tested but you may try the fractions toolbox for exact rational-numbers arithmetics which should give an equality to above

7946729
sorting	grouping
i hope it help others to as it provides indexed sorting of a grouping table view using an array as the datasource

7946744
put	get
i have an application in which i need to send my location longitude and latitude to other person on receiving a sms from him.i ll somehow get my location longitude and latitude and put it as a text in reply sms and then send it to other person.but now i m facing a problem in how to get my location and put it as a text in reply sms.till now i have written a code which sends a reply message on receiving a sms from other person.can anyone tell me how to get my location and put it as text message

7946745
perl	tcl
being a linux administrator i used to write my scripts in bash tcl and less often in perl

7946775
children	parent
the equations for getting the indices of the parent left and right children are different in such a heap

7946780
post	get
you can then serialize these or otherwise create a data object and pass these to your asp page with get or post whatever you prefer

7946821
width	height
what i want to do in a view is have a textview and to the right of it have another custom view x with the same height as the textview and have width height

7946841
post	get
you can use json data in your javascript code and then pass it to asp page with get or post

7946862
udp	tcp
one of the things i d like to do is implement the server in both tcp and udp and allow the client to choose which protocol to use at runtime

7946862
udp	tcp
this is a noob question but how do i allow a user this option to choose tcp or udp protocols

7946882
put	get
is there any other way i can put the monitor to sleep or get the handle in wpf

7946885
profiling	debugging
anyone know what the problem might be or how to determine debugging what it is without using sql profiling which i do not have atm

7946944
udp	tcp
if you want to know how it is possible in the socket level you should be able to bind your tcp serversocket and udp serversocket in to the same port

7946974
websphere	ibm
10 different xml messages will be enqueued to an ibm websphere mq server

7946988
maven	pom.xml
i added the following dependency to my maven pom.xml file and it seems to have made the class available for use

7946999
rss	feed
the user can enter a simple rss feed into a text field by pressing enter psfeed gets the new feed url

7947026
websphere	ibm
as to scaling i can t speak for websphere mq or other ibm products but 40-50k messages per hour isn t particularly hard for msmq on windows server to handle so i d assume ibm can do that as well

7947042
mouse	keyboard
for now no way to find why auto-submit of the form after selection by mouse or by keyboard and the line don t deliver the value in array

7947082
qhash	qmap
i was wondering for how long the reference to a value inside a qt container especially a qhash or a qmap is valid

7947082
qhash	qmap
is the behavior the same for qmap and qhash or will one work and the other not

7947083
subtraction	addition
you might try simple xor encryption with some addition subtraction of values

7947083
hash	md5
how come md5 hash values are not reversible

7947094
filtering	grouping
actually you technically can with a filtering index sql 08 only but it s still wrong-headed because the isleader bit does not actually designate a relationship and if you accidentally update the groupid but forget about isleader then you ve suddenly just made this person the leader of an entirely different grouping and probably violated the at-most-one constraint

7947094
put	get
that is a better design conceptually but since you ll likely have a cascade from group to person you won t be able to put a two-way cascade on leader as well you ll get the multiple cascade paths error if you try

7947164
superclass	subclassing
for that matter superclass shouldn t call methods defined by subclassing in its ctor because the object hasn t been initialized yet

7947191
udp	tcp
for socket creation use datagramsocket for udp and serversocket for tcp

7947197
superclass	subclassing
the important thing to realize is the way that java loads classes first the superclass is loaded and then the subclassing

7947197
superclass	subclassing
one strategy for example would to embed some of the contract which your subclassing is fulfilling in the superclass using interfaces or inheritance..

7947222
post	get
why don t you get your post data from _post

7947242
explode	substr
an additional solution than using explode and substr as have been mentioned you can solve it using regex

7947284
scheme	racket
i tried mzscheme from plt scheme 4.2 and racket from both racket 5.1.1 and the development tree all compiled in 64-bit mode.

7947331
x86	64bit
i am running 32bit ubuntu on 64bit x86 processor intel

7947337
pull	push
just add a new commit to the branch used in the pull request and push the branch to github

7947407
post	get
i would assume this post s the data to login but all i can see happening is the details being attached to the url as if it s doing a get request to the page i m on rather than a post to my login page

7947421
mouse	keyboard
a touch based application doesn t really have the concept of focus the way a mouse keyboard based application does

7947447
subtract	add
i want to be able to subtract every field in each record from the current one then add them together and store the results

7947453
hash	salt
above that ensure that you never compare passwords directly rather you compare the hash of the passwords with the inclusion of a salt

7947470
post	get
the file you are post ing too is not called index.php or index.html so the browser finds nothing and again defaults to get

7947485
bazaar	git
you can use bazaar git or mercurial to do so or any other dvcs it s just the major ones

7947496
folder	directory
among the java dictionary info.plist keys expands into the path to the root directory of the application bundle. alternatively consider creating copies of your folder data in or preferences

7947498
int	boolean
basically i m looking for something similar to php oop and with type hinting for all data types in php you can t type-hint int strings floats nor boolean and they are not classes

7947520
mp3	ogg
i would really prefer not having to upload one mp3 file for each ogg vorbis file on the server

7947520
mp3	ogg
if i feed an ogg vorbis file to the mp3 parameter will the fallback flash player succeed at playing that ogg vorbis file

7947520
mp3	ogg
update i ended up uploading one mp3 for each ogg vorbis on the server because the above clearly does not work

7947548
for-loop	loops
use a background thread such as one provided by a swingworker to run a for-loop going from 1 to 10 with a thread.sleep inside of loops

7947575
versioning	upgrade
i ve often considered just using a cracked versioning as it provides a much simpler upgrade path which basically just involves installing the software

7947585
getter	setter
instead of using synthesize or such you use dynamic and apple takes care of the rest for you - hooking up those properties to getter setter which mimic what you would normally do with a bare nsmanagedobject

7947585
sorting	filtering
all of those things mentioned above could be tacked on to an nsmanagedobject subclass which was created for us by xcode we didn t create by hand - and they all revolve around dealing with the data directly formats conversions etc and or around pulling the data out of core data filtering sorting

7947604
post	get
post to get is often caused by you using a wrong url

7947604
post	get
according to specs this means that get must be issued instead of post

7947619
post	get
that way will take care of converting your data to the proper post or get or ... format and you don t have to worry about the details

7947630
preorder	postorder	preorder	inorder	postorder	inorder
problem k return of methods preorder inorder and postorder

7947681
xslt	xquery
probably xsom makes more sense if you want to do the subsequent processing in java saxon scm makes more sense if you want to do it in xslt or xquery

7947682
qhash	qmap
there is nothing wrong with using references at qmap qhash elements unless you delete the node you are referencing to

7947745
width	height
set width and height values for your control more then 0

7947750
ssl	https
you need the http https wrapper plus php built with ssl support

7947791
maven	pom.xml
using intellij 9 tomcat 6 maven project pom.xml based

7947819
post	get
simulate get and post requests on a url and observe the response -- everything from low-level http result headers and status codes to page content

7947870
asp.net-mvc	openrasta
in asp.net asp.net-mvc the configuration code is written against the routetable class while in openrasta it is done against a resourcespace class

7947871
hash	md5
i tried to use an md5 hash but it seems it s only a one way encryption

7947990
children	parent
now everytime you delete a parent folder all of it s children will be deleted

7947999
opera	google-chrome
this works in opera and google-chrome haven t tested in ie yet .

7948055
width	height
the first 4 numbers are the x y location of the top-left point and the height width of the bounding box

7948073
bmp	png
you need to provide a valid header for the supported formats bmp jpg or png

7948115
multiplying	add
i m looking to add up the columns am midday evening to see which ones contains the value yes and then take that total and multiplying it by the rate for each row for a client

7948115
multiplying	add
when i introduce the rate variable my query starts telling me i need the group_by clause and i don t think i m ready for that since i still need to add the am_total and the midday_total together first and then multiplying that by the rate

7948182
sorcery	clearance
when i try rails g clearance install or rails g sorcery install it fails and responds with

7948183
casting	autoboxing
sure you are casting what you pass into them as an int but java has a habit of autoboxing data

7948196
hide	show
not only use a focus event to show or hide the prompt but also look at the content of the textinput

7948216
folder	directory
i am trying to upload a file into a folder called directory

7948222
post	get
example at the following url you will see that the jsessionid is not a parameter like other post get parameters are

7948222
post	get
i can highly recommend using the firefox firebug together to examine your post request and headers so you get an idea for exactly what is being passed

7948253
getter	setter
also using breakpoints in the getter or setter does not tell you anything the binding engine does not use them they are just for your own convenience

7948261
for-loop	loops	int	chars
edit i know you ve already marked the question as answered but just wanted to suggest you have a function like printrepeatedly chars c int count to reduce the amount of loops that you re repeating it ll just be a for-loop and a print statement

7948276
fancybox	thickbox
off the top of my head i think the problem might be that you are initiating an alert dialogue box rather than a jquery fancybox thickbox type of overlay lightbox which accommodates the speed at which the it animates to open or close

7948276
fancybox	thickbox
so rather than to try and resolve that chunk of codes you have picked out from different sources and since the content that you wish to display is an inline one you might as well consider using thickbox or fancybox instead

7948288
pop-up	dialog
now when you click the edit link a jquery ui dialog pop-up and the edit form for that object is displayed

7948329
post	get
note i m planning to write a ui that uses ajax post or get methods to retrieve the terminal output from backend server

7948373
rss	feed
i would recommend using builder or some other xml generator for rss feed

7948383
realloc	malloc	realloc	calloc	calloc	malloc
so if you just test if the return is 0 but don t test the arguments to malloc calloc or realloc you might encounter a segfault much later

7948383
memset	malloc
an easy thing to check for return of malloc is to wrap it up with something like memset malloc n 0 1

7948390
unsigned	short
i understand that with a short you can have 65 536 possible ints but why can t you have 255 256 possible values 0 to 255 255 unsigned

7948443
width	height
edit i could also render each character and maintain a mapping of character font weight size - width height on the server since i m not dabbling in kerning or other inter-character relationships

7948492
hide	show
there is a checkbox that show hide all liked posts and another that does the same for disliked posts when selected

7948492
google-chrome	firefox
again it all works fine in google-chrome but not in ie and firefox

7948492
post	get
for example if my db already has values for post 1-3 all future decisions by the user to like dislike those post are sent and saved no problem but if i add a new post post4 and the user likes or dislikes it no values get sent.

7948533
freebsd	linux
gnu getopt is installed by default on linux but on mac os x and freebsd it needs to be installed separately

7948534
getter	setter
however this requires that i specify a custom getter setter which calls a custom method for every property

7948534
getter	setter
to avoid the extra typing i have been trying to find a way to override handle the property getter setter in an object and call the custom method instead of the generated getter setter

7948534
getter	setter
so i want to know if what i am trying to achieve is possible at all through .net reflection or some other mechanism also is there anyway to detect if the property setter getter has been defined in code

7948554
spaces	delimiter
scanner.next with the default delimiter is only parsing as far as the first spaces - so str is only the first word of the sentence

7948575
getter	setter
dynamic proxies should intercept calls to methods in form of get_propa and set_propa which are effectively getter and setter where you can add your additional logic

7948616
octal	hex
of course an alternative solution is to replace the single quotes in your regexp with the octal or hex codes 047 or x27 instead

7948631
single-quotes	backslash
you could wrap your string in single-quotes instead escaping the existing single-quotes in the text with a backslash

7948656
opera	safari
i know this works for opera but what about safari

7948667
keydown	keyup
i have traced the keyup keydown textinput textinputstart and textinputupdate events but they do not seem to be involved in the update of the text in the textbox object

7948715
width	height
the demo also shows a list of properties top left right bottom height and width

7948718
listboxitem	textbox
to get the datavalue of the selected listboxitem into your second textbox you use this code

7948755
post	get
i ve been able to get the post into wordpress with featured images categories tags and comments intact but i m hung up on custom fields

7948789
folder	directory
so i open a terminal and i think i am at what you called the home directory for when i do ls i see folder of desktop application movies music pictures documents and library

7948789
folder	directory
and when i ls a directory of data and nested in it a db folder do exist

7948795
width	height
i have a two column text layout of fixed width and height implemented with stuff text freely flows from one column to another

7948795
google-chrome	firefox
should work at least in latest google-chrome and latest firefox

7948870
ivar	subclassing
subclassing uitableviewcell and add a uislider to it s content view and keep a reference to it with an ivar

7948889
post	get
the issue i have is that when i save it is doing a post redirect get so the action i m saving in isn t the action i am returning a view from

7948889
post	get
i have attempted to use viewdata in the post action but due to the redirect it is across requests so by the time it s at the get the viewdata dictionary is cleared

7948903
portrait	landscape
suppose you have an image of a human face or of android that should fit the screen and keep its aspect ratio and you have another image of its eyes colored in a different color how would you put them one on top of the other probably using framelayout so that it would look the same scaled on all of the devices no matter if you are on landscape or portrait modes

7948905
trojan	virus
you are likely to have the same or similar code trojan virus duplicated elsewhere on your server even outside of your user account

7948923
super	self
despite super building self .save args kwargs first the building s id was not set

7948940
yacc	bison
i m building a compiler with flex lex and bison yacc and c

7948961
folder	directory
i am sure that it had something to do with how i did my folder configuration not properly set by me in the res directory

7948961
screens	tablet
thing is that in my case i am dealing with phones and tablet high and low resolutions and in some of them that setting presented an awful screens

7948964
folder	directory
your command will have created the directory structure in the current folder not the root directory of your computer which is what the missing is

7948964
folder	directory
the first command was right but because you are trying to create a folder in which is a protected directory you need to prefix it with sudo which is short for superuser do

7948983
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome and firefox the option is not properly selected a css selector won t find it so i can tell that it s not selected

7948983
google-chrome	firefox
here s a fiddle which verifies that i can tell the difference between the two cases in firefox and google-chrome but not in ie

7948994
post	get
mvc then looks at the http method was it a get or post

7949002
post	put	post	get	put	get
it is the thing that is currently doing your restful stuff get post put delete via the function as well

7949002
post	put	post	get	put	get
about 30 or so lines of code to map create update delete read to post put delete get in

7949014
getter	setter
all subsequent get set of array items should be done through the getter setter functions for safety

7949014
free	malloc
secondly a hidden nasty makeridmatrix has used malloc to allocate the memory - but it s going to be job of the calling function or its successors explciitly to free the allocated pointer when it s finished with

7949072
clang	llvm
i heartily recommend llvm for statical analysis see also clang static analyzer

7949080
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox 5 and google-chrome 14 the default state of the select is with selecteindex 0 and the first option s selected property true

7949099
post	get
and it s working pretty well except that whenever i hit gem to post a jquery call it just hangs at the loading icon i don t get any feedback in the console as to why the call is not going through and being processed as it should

7949128
portrait	landscape
i have a tabbar application that i would like to keep in portrait mode but when streaming video via uiwebview i would like to add support to rotate to landscape in order to go full screen

7949128
portrait	landscape
the layout of my app does not look too appealing in landscape hence the reason for wanting to stay in portrait mode

7949146
onmouseover	onclick
i have some onclick javascript functions onmouseover javascript functions

7949196
express	node.js
i m using ssh root to a vps ubuntu 10.04 server from linode that has node.js express mongodb etc

7949225
gif	png	tiff	png
also i ve using a middle man format - gif tiff png jpg - with similar results

7949237
versioning	upgrade
either downgrade or upgrade your gcc versioning or modify the package to build with just the gcc command

7949279
client-side	server-side
server-side or client-side controls makes no difference as far as javascript is concerned

7949286
cos	sin
the problem begins at the first step at certain angles the value of the cos or the sin is very close to zero

7949390
dictionary	map
a dummy variable of some sort like you would use in a dictionary or map iteration

7949404
post	get
you can only send ajax with post or get

7949471
cng	kdf
what i need to know is how exactly cng s kdf uses hashes in my case the secret agreement value

7949471
cng	kdf
i m using the sha-256 algorithm as kdf and trying to hash x and y of the secret agreement but result doesn t match to the one cng computes

7949493
clang	llvm
have a look at section 4 of automatic reference counting in the llvm clang documentation

7949501
integer	unsigned
this pretty much always means the maximum value of the unsigned integer type on the platform in question divided by the size of the type of elements to be stored in the container

7949503
margin	height
i don t think that your jquery solution will work because height doesn t take into account margin and padding

7949521
for-loop	loops
note my interpretation of the question is that it is not comparing a standard for-loop with the for..in variant it is just compared the different variable declaration methods with each other for a standard for-loop then doing the same again for a for..in loops

7949526
udp	tcp
i was told that for a high frequency trading hft system that requires low-latency tcp is used over udp

7949526
udp	tcp
i was told that with tcp you can make point to point connections whereas you cannot with udp however from my understanding you can send udp packets to specific ip port

7949526
udp	tcp
there are several arguments used in this article as to why udp tcp for gaming but i can see relevance for hft

7949529
atomic	interlocked
use interlocked lock etc for atomic

7949571
udp	tcp
there is no special difference between a tcp port and a udp port beyond the type of connection being used send the packet and forget it udp style or negotiate a connection and sustain it tcp style and the service listening on the server side

7949571
udp	tcp
tcp 25 would usually reveal a smtp server whereas udp 25 would not

7949573
udp	tcp
there s no reasons to expect a stream of data over an already-established tcp connection would be slower than the same data over udp plus you get checksumming retries and all the other tcp goodness

7949573
udp	tcp
udp mainly wins in cases where you can afford to discard the reliability or where the overhead of many tcp handshakes would be too expensive such as with common dns queries

7949574
disk	ram
also you could edit etc my.ini settings to give mysql more ram to play with since it appears to be writing to disk when building the indexes

7949580
udp	tcp
udp is superior to tcp if you don t need some of the features tcp provides

7949585
udp	tcp
basically modern tcp implementations are going to be just as fast as udp if you re keeping the connection alive

7949585
udp	tcp
if tcp is having to resend a packet you d need to resend it in udp too

7949585
udp	tcp
plus for udp you re going to end up implementing the same reliability code retransmission of dropped packets that tcp has already implemented

7949597
ienumerable	ilist
in your case if you have an ilist and you want to force chunk partitioning you can just make it look like a simple ienumerable instead of writing this

7949658
integer	unsigned
this means in effect that types cannot be demoted to a type with lesser precision by the integer promotions it is possible for uint64_t to be promoted to int or unsigned int but only if the range of the type is at least that of uint64_t

7949684
google-chrome	firefox
i was having the same output as you google-chrome says it was cancelled while firefox does it okay

7949684
google-chrome	firefox
apparently firefox and many others browsers are able to handle this situation correctly but google-chrome designers decided to do it as specified

7949690
post	get
you will probably get some automatic speedups by iterating pre and post directly and avoid doing so in a nested fashion

7949706
lxml	beautifulsoup
the book foundations of python network programming has a detailed comparison of what it looks like to scrape the same web page with beautifulsoup and with the lxml library

7949706
lxml	elementtree
but in general you will find that lxml is faster more effective and has an api which adheres closely to a python standard the elementtree which comes with the python standard library

7949706
lxml	beautifulsoup
see this blog post by the inimitable ian bicking for an idea of why you should be looking at lxml instead of the old-fashioned beautifulsoup library for parsing html

7949721
google-chrome	firefox
for example google-chrome uses webkittransition firefox uses moztransition and msie use mstransition

7949744
inherited	properties
you can handle the button control s click event in fact you can use all events with the following code because metro s hyperlink button only inherited the buttonbase class without any special properties or events such as navigateuri

7949756
qstring	qbytearray
it might be easier and clearer to use qbytearray instead of malloc arrays or qstring qstring are for user displayed strings which is not the case here

7949853
jobs	cron
launch via cron every 60 seconds and poll for new jobs spooled in some readable area

7949853
daemons	launchd	daemons	systemd
launchd as a daemons at systemd startup

7949855
ubuntu	linux
when you launch a new linux instance the public key is placed into the root .ssh authorized_keys file or home ubuntu .ssh authorized_keys for canonical ubuntu amis allowing your private key access to the instance

7949867
profiling	debugging
runing my web application worked well when clicking the profiling project however when i want to debugging again the project the jprofile is still being run when i just want to debugging clicking the debugging button instead of profiling

7949973
width	height
lastly set the expected width and height of the div

7949990
post	get
by attaching the post save signal to the through table itself we were basically able to catch all cases we needed to do post_saving for and being as the ids to the two connected tables for the manytomany relationship existed in the through table this was sufficient to get the job done

7950007
post	get
i thought i would post the code i needed to get this example to work here as the existing question and answer never really settle the issue

7950032
integer	unsigned
iã think the integer promotion should not happen because the type of both of a and b are unsigned int

7950055
integer	unsigned
there should be a compiler warning that you probably ignored or turned off but it s still possible to store -1 in an unsigned integer

7950117
hide	show
i thunk you can make a uitabbarcontroller then hide the tabbar then when you will switch the view controller then just remove the hidden property..then such problem will not be show i think so...

7950143
associativity	operator-precedence
see the c# language specification operator-precedence and associativity

now you just loop through all the rows in csv and prepare query dynamically and execute it for example assuming that column 0 has ids and column 1 has hasweb

7950242
hide	show
i give opportunity to switch between my events and all events through segment control first it show all events location and when user switch to my events it ll delete or hide all events location pins and show my events location pins on same map view

7950281
g++	gcc
another thing to try is to pass the full path and filename for the library as an input file to g++ with no options - gcc will figure out that it s a library file and a lib directory search will not be done for it

7950298
width	text-align
please create individual div for image give a style that text-align center and width 100

7950339
range	min	range	max	min	max

7950361
boost	stl
for those that only need 32bit stl s mingw distro has boost included with all the libs already built for it

by making the width 100 and removing any height attribute the image will scale perfectly to take up the full width whether you re in landscape or portrait orientation

7950384
nsstring	nsdata
i am gratefully thanks for the article convert nsdata bytes to nsstring

7950385
fast-forward	merge

7950470
folder	directory
i m having problems with file permissions that is my script is unable to create files and directory in the folder it resides within

int	chars
this is only sound if f is guaranteed to be injective otherwise we might legitimately have say f int f chars and then we would be able to conclude int chars which would be bad

7950662
profiling	debugging
debugging should not append the vm parameter for profiling -agentpath to the java command even if the jprofiler integration is installed so this sounds kind of strange

7950664
width	height
i m unable to change width and height of a button

7950674
width	height
instead of it give 100dp to layout_width and 20dp to layout_height and remove the width and height attributes

7950690
getter	setter
all of these pojos have public final fields with no getter or setter

7950710
rss	feed
i am trying to parse rss feed using feedzirra

7950760

7950771
put	get
when i put username and password in process.startinfo i still get the access denied error

7950773

free	malloc
you can use malloc to do the same sort of thing you just have to remember to free it when you re done

7950970
alloca	malloc
while alloca gives you automatic de-allocation on function exit the stack is usually a smaller resource than the malloc heap and if you exhaust the heap it gives you back null

7950975
disk	ram
enhancement of the previous version either use a 64 bit process to handle huge ram block welcome xe2 compiler or use a file for temporary storage then memory-map its content for processing it is how photoshop or other handle huge memory - if you have enough ram using a temporary file won t be necessary slower no data will be written on disk

7950980
firefox	safari
i have this java-code for safari with remotewebdriver i need it as i test in different systems in several browsers like safari firefox ie chrome.

7951033

7951047
tunnel	vpn
the strategy i employ is to have apache cassandra nodes communicate through a site to site vpn tunnel

7951047
tunnel	vpn
application servers sit on their own internal network and vpn network and communicate to the data layer via the vpn tunnel and between each other on the internal network

7951320
quicksort	timsort	quicksort	mergesort	mergesort	timsort
the java 6 se implementation uses a combination of mergesort and insertionsort which are both deterministic with non-transitive comparators but in java 7 the timsort algorithm gets used and other implementations might use quicksort or something else so you can t be sure that it will work with all implementations

7951348
xna	spritebatch
changing the render states that spritebatch uses in xna pre-4.0 is kind of tricky

7951348
xna	spritebatch
the states that spritebatch does manage need to be modified differently in xna pre-4.0

7951412
hide	show
do not change set targetsdkversion to a higher version if you are not able to test your app on this android version because i have misunderstood the existing answers regarding this admob topic i have also set the android targetsdkversion attribute of the element to api level 13 in my app which caused a fatal side effect as android 3 thought my app would natively support honeycomb it did no longer show the menu button in the soft button bar at the bottom border and as my app hide the native title bar to show it s own implementation the user did not have any possibility to access the menu any more on honeycomb

7952264
width	height
correct your scroll view width and height as

7952299
equals	gethashcode
i have overriden the equals and gethashcode method becuase in another article it said that when in a collection you need to override the equals to match on the key otherwise when you use selecteditem although all the values would be the same between the item in the collection and the selecteditem they would be two different instances and thus not match with the default implementation of equals

7952343
hide	show
the script is doing the show hide part correctly for the description but isn t swapping the main image

7952401
pop-up	dialog
however you can make browser to pop-up a dialog window allowing the user to pick the save location

7952426
dlsym	dlopen
on un x-like you could try using ld_preload to load a custom library of your own that does nothing than dlopen the library you wish to modify then dlsym to find the routine then substitute the code but never call dlclose to make sure the modified copy is kept around not unloaded instead of the original when later via dynamic linking the lib is accessed again

i just want to add html text to the famous image slider supersized

7953033
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this will work in ie google-chrome safari and firefox

7953063
width	height
just use display as block because you are floating left that way you would have to assign the width so they don t move out of position once the text is added the height will grow automatically min-height does not work on older browsers and will be treated as height which is terrible you have a beautiful css solution to your float left problem it s used on containers to keep the div natural â

7953102
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
so for example sites like google will always show up in english instead of portuguese as it appears in ie firefox google-chrome or opera

7953126
children	parent
but some of the time it will fail to override the default behavior and my parent process will output something like hangup and then terminate....leaving a bunch of children still executing

7953132
submit	submission
which ensure s any other handlers you ve got listening for the event to fire but it prevents the default behaviour being executed prevents a link opening for an anchor prevents a form submission on a submit button

7953467
profiling	debugging
you can check if you have the profiling installed by checking if you have start windows phone performance analysis not start performance analysis in your debugging menu

7953490
children	parent
my typical experience is that for reporting purposes any node in a tree should only have one parent but may have many children

7953490
children	parent
having many parent and many children makes a web rather than a tree

7953747
hex	binary
or you may want to convert the string to actual binary using hex2bin then echo the index of the string possibly converting back to hex for output

7953803

7954079
hide	show
or you could call show hide

7954134
put	get
what you could do is get your tag to put the queryset into a variable in the context and use that variable in the for-loop

7954155
put	get
but the cost is that it s generally harder to get put data into from the database

7954183
serializable	deserialization
i can deal with object serializable deserialization to from a file but don t know where it should be placed or if there s some registry where i can just save a couple of user s settings

7954201

7954207
portrait	landscape
but while i am running am running my camera application the camera preview is shown as landscape instead of the portrait

7954219
profiling	debugging
note about your screenshots the only issue i noticed is the code signing identity in debugging should use debugging provisioning profiling and not distribution one

7954246
folder	directory
the images folder shouldn t be in the classpath - the parent of the images folder should be so that then when the classloader looks for an images directory it will find it under its root

7954326
addslashes	htmlspecialchars
assume you have something like - then you need it htmlspecialchars -escaped and not addslashes etc. -escaped

7954389
post	get
there are other post regarding this but those solutions are not working for me as my form submits to a thickbox popup which requires a get method and certain variables to be passed

7954411
width	height
also the example is designed for images with size 150x113 so if different sizes are being utilized you should change the properties width height itemwidth itemheight accordingly

7954420
firefox	safari
the way i am doing it is to call firefox internet explorer or safari like this

7954491
button	checkbox
now when i select some checkbox and press the submit button only comment form text_area comes into params but the products checkbox values array didn t come how to solve it

7954520
mouse	trackpad	mouse	keyboard
the problem is that the client is not interested in seeing a mouse cursor on the screen this particular keyboard will have all except a few buttons covered up and will function as a remote control the trackpad is inaccessible so the pointer sits in the middle of the screen uselessly

7954552
implements	extends
instead of inheriting from gwttestcase extends the gwt-test-utils gwttest class and implements your click test with the browser class like shown in the getting starting guide

7954577
multiplying	subtract
i have to write a parser for the compiler and i ve already done adding subtract multiplying dividing and the assignment statement

7954599

7954606
lxml	libxml2
do you mean that you are using the lxml bindings for libxml2

7954607
put	get
this will get the file or even a part of it and put it into an element for you to work with

7954632
post	get
to further the answer based on your edited post you can use gettickcount onrequeststart.cfm and onrequestend.cfm to get the run time of the page

7954670
mongoid	activemodel
mongoid uses activemodel so works very similar to activerecord

7954687
pop-up	dialog
if you want the pop-up to be styled as the rest of your website then you could render your error message into a div element and use a jquery dialog to display it as a modal dialog within your page

7954692
cos	sin
however based on your edit you can precompute the sin and cos for a collection of angles you re interested in and store them in a lookup table

7954692
cos	sin
this will be faster than computing the sin and cos for general angles though will require some additional space and there will be an accuracy penalty as well

7954696
post	get
what i am trying to do is to get a list of users sorted by the number of post they have

7954713
versioning	upgrade
of course your free versioning can have fewer features but they don t like it when there are buttons that do nothing but prompt you to upgrade

7954825
memcpy	memmove
memcpy and memmove don t seem to be working as expected

7954825
unsigned	short
so first i needed to add brackets around the statement and second as the non-blocking method didn t work for some reason i am now checking whether the last two bytes that were transmitted translate to a 0 when read a unsigned short

7954831
post	get
i know you can t send both get and post in the same request but seeing as my form is submitting to using post shouldn t it work

7954856
textview	imageview
additionally in each row of the optionsmenu there have to be three entrys one imageview at the left and two textview on the right

7954856
simpleadapter	listactivity

sigkill	sigaction
so my solution is to use sigaction and not use sigkill for my own custom communication

7954927
width	height
as a texture with height 1 and width of my list then refresh the data using glcopytexsubimage2d

7954934
integer	unsigned
if you throw away the top-end bits of a number by the explicit cast to a 16 bit unsigned integer then you re going to have a result that is smaller within the range of 0 and 2 16-1 than before

7954955
serializable	deserialization
i can deal with object serializable deserialization to from a file but don t know where it should be placed

7954966
put	get
is there any way that we can put these extension methods in centralized location or some assembly cache where we can easily add using statement and get access to all static methods

7954978
onclick	onmousedown
as far as i can tell the whiteboard doesn t mimic the onmousedown capability and instead all touches are interpreted as onclick s

7954978
onmousedown	onmouseup
i can t think of a way to implement drag-and-drop without using onmouseup and onmousedown nor do i know of any way to make the whiteboard interpret the input differently

7955033
jcomponent	jdialog
create only one jframe as parent and for another top-level containers create only once jdialog put there jpanel as base and re-use that for another action then you only to remove all jcomponent from base jpanel and add there another jpanel

7955039
children	parent
i have a similar question to uncheck parent node if all children unchecked in jquery with this solution and have tried to modify it so that the children will also all uncheck if the parent is unchecked which the above below fails to do

7955039
children	parent
if the parent is checked unchecked its children should be checked unchecked as well as its parent

7955039
children	parent
if the children are checked then its parent and grandparent should be checked if no children are checked then parent shouldn t be checked

7955050
versioning	upgrade
your solution is either to upgrade the mockito versioning

7955069
post	get
of course you can not use get and post methods simultaneously

7955073
int	chars
i can t make it work i already tried itoa atoi strcat summing event.key.keysym.unicode to a int then converting to chars i m new to c thanks

7955080

change the foreach loops into a for-loop and use the indexer for loops to copare to cmp.length

7955112
vb.net	vb6
i m porting an application from vb6 to vb.net and have come across something that vb.net doesn t like

7955142
inherited	properties
the problem is white-space properties gets inherited in the spans

7955194
int	boolean
i would certainly take this opportunity to rewrite parts of it so it makes more sense - like having the isfirstcomponent variable converted to a boolean instead of an int and remove all html from your c# code not that you have much in there but the next person working on this code would probably like to know that the html is not being created by some assembly hidden somewhere on your server

7955207
int	boolean
others simply define that boolean values are just int 0 and 1

7955222
free	malloc
dlclose doesn t free memory allocated with malloc

7955243
cos	sin
after reviewing your math make sure you have specified the model-view and projection matrices and note if you are using the standard cos sin functions they take radians not degrees

7955331
opera	firefox
i struggled with this for a while and i was able to verify that ogg theora work just fine in firefox 7 nightly 10 and opera next

7955331
opera	firefox
opera and firefox are yet to support it

7955339
width	height
also you ll need to handle the situation where the user drags the selection right to left and or bottom to top because that will introduce negative sizes for the width and height of the rectangle

7955352
for-loop	arrays
all i did was look at your code and the first thing i noticed is that it doesn t look like you need that arrays arrays at all or that third for-loop

7955357
getter	setter
side effects in getter and setter is generally not a great idea as it is usually not expected and can lead to tricky bugs

7955365
int	chars
is_signed unsigned chars 1 is true on any normal implementation because the type of is int not unsigned chars

7955401
width	height
if the screen coordinate is either 0 or matches either your width or height then it is touching a screen border

7955494
g++	gcc
since pthread_create_with_stack is a void function and it returns nothing in the definition setting rc to its return value is not only meaningless it s an error gcc g++ won t even let you try to compile

7955511
button	checkbox
each class is split into a few dozen different 30 sec to 4 min video lectures and at the end of most of them the screen is paused and there is a user input overlay of the video with checkbox radio button or text fields along with a done button

7955530
ubuntu	linux
i have maven 2.2.1 jdk 1.6.0_26 on linux ubuntu

i understand that if it is like a worksheet function with simple return types and arguments as in private string add int a double b

7955550
regasm	regsvr32
or is there any way in excel dna that i can also consume such kinds of functions in vba without any regasm or regsvr32

7955584
getter	setter
back in the early days of java getter setter pairs were used to identify properties of beans exactly for the purpose of making it possible to define conceptual attributes implemented through computation rather than a plain member variable

7955584
getter	setter	mutators	getter	mutators	setter
unfortunately with the passing of time programmers have come to rely more and more on getter setter being just accessors mutators for underlying attributes trend that was sort of made official with the introduction of the term pojo to identify objects that only had getter and possibly setter as methods

7955587
hide	show
the problem is that when i press on the textfield it show the pickerview in the middel of view and when i press the done button to hide the pickerview the defaul position of the inputview default keyboard is not in the bottom of view but in the middle

7955637
width	height
after setting up an appropriate vto i was able to specify the minimum width and height of the framelayout

7955662
min	max
histogramming will be good for dense number sets where you have most of the numbers between min and max and sorting will be good if you have sparse number sets very few of the numbers between min and max are actually used

7955669
children	parent
i m implementing a custom view where i use viewflipper which shows my custom view that consists of relativelayout parent and two children - imageview and progressbar

7955689
client-side	server-side
employing both server-side and client-side can produce significant performance gains for your application

7955699

everything is working great and everything displays exactly as it should in ie8 but when i run the site in google-chrome or firefox each listitem is displayed with a thin gray box

7955788
int	chars
in this example defines three functions bits_str_uchar bits_str_uint bits_str_int that handle three different data types unsigned chars unsigned int int

7955816
free	memcpy
i thought of a case where the previous block maybe free and to expand my earlier block forward but that would require a memcpy so it would be pointless implementing that

7955833
public	protected
for more info about public protected and private inheritance look here

7955873
post	get
mixing get post variables is considered poor practice but is easily done

7955882
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
but the symptom i mentioned - the microscopic clickable area that isn t on the image occurs in firefox 7 google-chrome safari and opera

7955883
for-loop	loops
there is 1 for-loop and 1 while loops in the method israndom and 1 for-loop in the method diff

7955887
memcpy	realloc
you could strive towards optimising realloc for performance avoid moving the block and the memcpy or you could optimise against memory fragmentation

7955973
pop-up	dialog
a common feature of the application is to show a pop-up dialog window for basic user input

7955990
width	height
you might get better results if you float the a tag and not the image also i would set the a tag to be a block with the same width and height as the image

7956008
jar	war
this jar needs to be in war in order to fix this particular exception

7956018
put	get
i expect to get many requests dozens in close proximity that will put some of my data in an inconsistent state

7956028
selenium-webdriver	remotewebdriver
just have a look on the code in selenium-webdriver __init__.py and selenium-webdriver firefox webdriver.py which inherits a lot from the remotewebdriver class

7956139
client-side	server-side
client-side includes like framesets aren t terribly useful when you re already using a server-side view technology

7956152
spaces	delimiter
for each record the c and t is the field delimiter followed by a spaces then the field name followed by a spaces then the field data

7956253
dotspatial	proj
assuming you are using .net you can check out the positioning code in the dotspatial open source proj

7956367
post	get
firefox with modify header or tamper data that can modify http header for get post method before send it to server

7956380
uninstall	upgrade
what is the easiest way to uninstall any upgrade returning the machines to installed defaults and proceed forward with 2.7 in a virtual environment

7956427
g++	gcc
you can t do that you can compile c code with gcc and then link it with c++ objects with g++ referring to the symbols defined in the c objects via the extern keyword but you can t do the opposite

7956458
linefeed	delimiter
the general approach i have taken below is to use a flat file connection manager with a format of ragged right and my header row delimiter is cr linefeed

7956469
ubuntu	debian
pbuilder builds a clean debian ubuntu system in a chroot-ed environment

7956494

7956539
debian	linux
the problems occured with a linux debian 64 bit distribution

7956558
fancybox	jqtransform
it seems like jqtransform doesn t set the height of ul tag for select properly when it s in a fancybox

7956575
sorting	grouping
sorting by brightness is second but still important for smooth transitions between color grouping

7956578
int	chars
although i see the functor actually returns a chars not an int so if the type deduction worked for you here you d be getting back a which cannot be converted to a when you assign the result to transformed

7956603
accessor	properties
you can declare the set and get accessor in the traditional way as objective c methods although it is definitely best practice to use properties declarations for things that are logically properties

7956603
getter	setter
there s no reason why your getter and setter can t calculate values

7956603
accessor	ivar
given the above the major difference between and obj.ivar is that the former modifies the ivar directly and latter invokes an accessor this means that the latter can do any memory management stuff needed retains releases copies etc and can also invoke key value observing

7956614
textblock	itemscontrol
so all your lines would be drawn on the bottom itemscontrol while all the textblock would be drawn on the top itemscontrol

7956649
post	get
first of all why not use post instead of get

7956653
post	get
i ve used other methods to get other result codes from google if you want i can post them.i hope that i ve helped you a bit

7956654
int	chars
an int a chars a long etc

7956721
opera	firefox
this way ie9 will not have the page cached and it ll refresh like firefox opera

when a next previous link in my gallery was clicked it fired a js function using onclick that first cleared the div that i ran the preventdefault agianst

7956749
bmp	png
i want to convert this bmp file to a png file in-memory

7956750
int	chars
then newstring will hold the content without the first chars if that was not an int

7956835
filtering	grouping
how can i customize the gridview in apex to filtering it based on authorization grouping

7956841
firefox	safari
if using firefox instead of safari is an option you can set dom.ipc.plugins.timeoutsecs to to -1 in the about config page to disable the timeout

7956849
opera	google-chrome
but google-chrome s not displaying the image correctly and opera won t show it all

7956849
bufferedreader	fileinputstream
i used to read the file with an bufferedreader but i found someone saying that the bufferedreader can t handle binary data properly so i tried with the fileinputstream but the problem stayed the same

7956872
migrate	downgrade
there s no ability to migrate from bamboo to cedar so it would be safe to assume there s no downgrade path

7956882
for-loop	loops
create the rects based upon ivar integer values and put it in a for-loop which increments the xpos ivar each time round loops

7956891
integer	unsigned
4 uintptr_t is an unsigned integer at least as big as an to safely allow integer math on pointers

7956919
bmp	png
you have to understand the headers of both bmp and png files

7956919
bmp	png
after you successfully create the header you can copy data but data is not stored in the same form in bmp and png so it is quite time consuming task

7956946
int	boolean
boolean or int for example

7956954
mvp	presenter
after reading large scale application development and mvp i m a bit unclear on the presenter interface and i d appreciate help in clarifying my understanding

7956967
backbone.js	javascriptmvc
depending on how your application is structured you might want to have a look at a javascriptmvc solution such as backbone.js as well

7956979
getter	setter
groovy auto-generates getter setter but i m not sure if java does

7956994
postgresql	mysql
i have a php application running on top of doctrine2 as the dbal orm with mysql i can easily switch to postgresql mongo or any other

7957025
httprequest	httpresponse
there are already wrapper classes for httpcontext httprequest httpresponse etc

7957029
getter	setter
though java does not to my knowledge have such a feature defined several java coding environments such as eclipse produce automatic getter and setter under certain circumstances

7957030
for-loop	arrays	for-loop	loops
the code is simply a for-loop that loops over your uiimage arrays allocated a uiimageview for each image and sets the x-origin based on the index position of the uiimage in the arrays

7957063
width	height
if the height is the smallest attribut of the image i want that to be 140 pixels or vice versa on the width

7957067
entities	entitymanager
doctrine stores a reference of the retrieved entities in the entitymanager so it can return an entity by it s id without performing another query

7957079
bmp	png
i would assume since it lets you perform various transformations on images that those images are kept in memory so you should be able to just load it as bmp and eventually save it as png

7957113
sudo	passwd
see prompt user for passwd with dialog window when using sudo

7957116
postgresql	mysql
update now improved and works on postgresql mysql and sqlite

7957178
hash	md5
i am using a category to generate the md5 hash

7957180
children	parent
when you encounter a node whose subtree is a perfect binary tree all inner nodes have 2 children and all leaves are at the same depth you insert the new node as a parent of this node

7957196
union	distinct
the first thing that i looked into was having a view with a select for each distinct database all union together

7957201
serializable	deserialization
while it s possible to override the modelform used by your modeladmin docs in this case i would consider using a custom field type and building in the encryption decryption into the database serializable deserialization

7957213
httpconnection	downloading
this could be a troyan downloading it definitly opens a httpconnection downloading files and executes them

7957214
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine on both firefox and google-chrome as usual

7957231
jar	manifest.mf
it can either be specified in the jar s manifest.mf file or specified when running for example from the command line

7957312
width	height
the best i can do is this which gets the width looking good but doesn t crop the height

7957351
profiling	debugging
i am working on a university project which involves profiling and event management using sqlite due to which i have to write a lot of viewing and debugging code inside the android application which logs the database so that i can see whether the data is entered correctly or not

7957381
unsigned	short
i have a binary array which contains two bytes to be interpreted as an unsigned short at its beginning and am currently extracting those by doing

7957381
ubuntu	linux
this is on a ubuntu gnu linux system with gcc 4.4.3

7957441
background-image	background-color
background-image and background-color don t apply to svg content unless it s handled by the css box model so basically just the root svg element

7957445
width	height
as well with slide.export filename png width height

7957497
post	get
one particular example is the viewparam component which remembers the request parameter query string parameter for get or non-faces post parameter with which it was initialized

7957534
post	get
this form post the data changes and when i change the text in _resource.slim the text will change....but the p resource does not get evaluated at all

7957543
sequence	permutation
so for example a job shop scheduling problem might be represented as list of permutation which represent the execution order of the jobs on the different machines so called job sequence matrix

7957543
crossover	mutation
for all those still simple types crossover and mutation operators exist

7957543
crossover	mutation
in that light you also want to avoid having to repair a large part of your chromosomes after crossover since that is also introducing unwanted mutation

7957557
for-loop	loops
2 if 1 is true the first loops sets the value of i to the number of valid characters - how does the second for-loop work without reseting i to 0

7957569
min	max
django annotations is great for average min max etc

7957575
hash	md5
another thing you can do to enforce security is to hashing append an hash like a crc32 or md5 at the end of the file

7957599
portrait	landscape
i have a uiwebview that i would like to load different urls depending on whether its portrait or landscape

7957656
subtract	add	multiplying	subtract	multiplying	add
2 and then inside while loop you go over each character and multiplying by 10 and add the character by subtract by 0

7957668
children	parent
all of your related tables should have declarative ri which means that you can t delete a parent while it still has children

7957668
children	parent
when they accidentally try to delete the wrong parent and it not only deletes that parent but 20 children in 5 other tables that s bad

7957668
children	parent
if a developer is coding a delete for the parent then they should know that they have to use the delete stored procedure to take care of children

7957672
unsigned	short
you should not use any sort of bulk copy routine for this nor should you use typecasting to get a pointer to unsigned short because none of those options take byte order into account

7957672
integer	unsigned
the correct way to extract a two-byte unsigned integer from a buffer is with one of these functions

7957686
folder	directory
in var www directory i have symbolic links to public folder of each of my applications

7957687
min	max
notice that the min and max value for the random are different for the start and end arrays

7957688
folder	directory
if you alter a cookbook which you will eventually you place the altered file in site-cookbooks folder in the same directory structure as the original cookbook

7957700

ubuntu	debian
note that you must link with -laio which you must separately install on some systems debian ubuntu

7957756
pull	push
is there a way i can use some kind of hook to tell the remove server to pull each time there is a new push

7957777
integer	unsigned
i have a binarystream class in javasscipt that reads bytes from an array downloaded via xmlhhttprequest and has the function next which returns an unsigned byte technically an integer

7957794
put	get
i wonder if there is a way to get your own app version in code after you put it in the summary tab in xcode

7957805
integer	fractions
or you could take the integer part for the days and calculate the hour from the fractions

7957828
versioning	upgrade
question when should we backup reload data if we decide to upgrade to new versioning mongodb

7957835
pop-up	dialog
it s like a dialog which pop-up when a file is copied

7957850
for-loop	arrays
as a workaround you could use getelementsbytagname td and then check to see if the name attribute matches the one you are looking for in a for-loop iterating through the arrays of elements

7957953
folder	directory
403 forbidden on a folder url usually means that your server has folder browsing disabled and there s no default document index.html index.php etc... in the directory

7958104
cout	cin
can t you just use the regular cin and cout that c++ provides

7958104
cout	cin
of course if your program is a gui program cin and cout won t be connected to anything useful unless you call the windows allocconsole command.

7958172
int	chars
t can be an float int short or chars 10 chars 1 or chars 2 and preferably any length would be great

7958172
memcpy	strncpy
i need to use strncpy or memcpy instead of the assignment operator

7958520
apache	nginx
you must also independently configure your web server be it apache nginx or otherwise to respond to these hostnames and domains when receiving requests directing them to the appropriate php or rails site as required

7958520
apache	nginx
apache has a virtualhost directive for this purpose and nginx also supports virtual hosting using different directives

7958536
versioning	upgrade
after that you can remove the upgrade rule which prevents downgrades and modify the rule which automatically uninstalls older versioning

7958540
ssl	https
note i have not originally included https in my solution since we use loadbalancers and our https server is a high-traffic ssl payment server we do not mix https and

css inherited is on a properties by properties basis

7958658
inherited	properties
so unless you explicitly state to inherited via the properties the default value will be used

7958662
width	height	gif	png
if you re downloading a png gif or jpg it should be possible to read the file headers to determine the width and height which should mean you avoid having to download the entire file

7958662
width	height
this post has some c# code for reading the width and height from the headers for the above format which you could port to java for use in android

7958694
integer	unsigned
unsigned integer type is size_t defined in stddef.h and other

7958724

pcm	music
this technique is much easier to implement if all the sounds produced by your app are in the form of raw pcm audio played via audio queue or the remoteio audio unit api which may require significant rewrites to your music and game sound code

7958933
inherited	properties
defining custom properties in web.config as well as a class that inherited from profilebase seems like overkill

if you re generating html at the end you will have difficulty using x y coordinates for image positioning unless you also use x y width height positioning for all text areas in the final document

int	double
first your qlist is of int and the documentation points out that the type in the sequence should match the first parameter of the map function where you have a double

7961613

so the qlist needs to change to double -or- your map function needs to take an int

the problem is that this jtree drawing operation takes very long time to complete adding 1000+ children defaultmutabletreenodes for the selected parent node

free	malloc
you call malloc with an argument stating the amount of memory you want instead of sending alloc to the class which knows how much memory is needed and use free instead of release to relinquish the memory

7962231
free	malloc
since you called malloc you must eventually relinquish the memory occupied by the array by calling free in your -dealloc method

mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseleave	mouseover	mouseout	mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseleave
it would be much better to use the mouseenter mouseleave methods rather than the mouseover mouseout methods which tend to cause a rapid blinking effect during the time your mouse is hovering

7962410
mouseleave	mouseenter
then you can simply combine the mouseenter and mouseleave handlers into one by using the jquery .hover method

7962410
mouseleave	mouseenter
to prevent the animation queue from stacking up and creating a new issue where it comes on off because of the mouseleave delay use a jquery .stop true false on the mouseenter function like this.

7962410
mouseleave	mouseenter
upon mouseenter it stops any mouseleave animation immediately

7972010
hash	salt
this approach really isn t useful unless you are encrypting your passwords with a symmetric key instead of a 1 way hash which will have it s own issues that way the salt value doesn t need to be stored and can be generated on the fly otherwise it is equally susceptible to replay attacks just harder to read

7972013
typedef	struct
also since you didn t post it you need to typedef your struct if you want to be able to omit the struct part when using it

7972055
opera	safari
i viewed the page you linked with several browsers ie8 ff5 opera 11 safari and each time it looked the same as the screen shot you provided

7972213
move	drag
i want to do this so that i can move a relativelayout as the user drag their finger sideways across the screen

7972313
put	get
if you can t put your own rule in the style sheet then you can identify one or more rules that you think are representative of the stylesheet and not likely to change and design a temporary object that should get those rules and test for their existence that way

7972324
screens	hdpi	screens	mdpi	mdpi	hdpi
in my android app i have a background image which is longer than the screens width for all the three types of screens.this implies that i have got 3 drawables each for different screens type mdpi ldpi hdpi and hence i have included a horizontal scroll bar in my app

7972324

7972365
onresume	onpause
try adding calls to videoview s suspend resume and stopplayback in your activity s onpause onresume and ondestroy methods

7972367
mouse	keyboard
there will be a native os thread that handles interfacing with actual os events mouse events keyboard events timer events network i o events etc... and those are then fed into the js queue where the js engine can further dispatch them to javascript code

7972370
width	height
your image will always try to take up as much room as it can if the width and height are not set

7972420
textview	imageview
the binder can automatically handle text for textview and drawable resource id s for imageview

7972439
next	except
it s basically the same idea as the code you posted except that it moves only one character at a time through the string instead of using find to jump ahead to the next match

7972467
stdout	stderr
i was attempting to run a batch file within a process without adding credentials in processstartinfo but doing it that way caused the batch file to fail silently - no errors were raised and expected output from the batch file never was returned i am reading stderr and stdout asynchronously fwiw

7972477
versioning	upgrade
i think that you need to install the versioning of xcode built for lion after you upgrade hopefully you haven t done this already

7972478
post	get
the way i handle it is i do a post with the body containing the parameters and then i return a redirect to a get

7972480
ggplot2	lattice
i found that writing custom functions was probably easier than tweaking 10s of parameters in lattice or base graphics and ggplot2 lacks some control over the axes

7972481
unix	bsd
some of these options might not be available on macos which is based on bsd or on other unix systems

7972544
uitableview	reloaddata

make the variable private create getter and setter

7972599
projectile	angle
i am trying to draw a projectile motion for my app depending on initial angle set by user.as part of my assumptions i have assumed initial velocity to be 400 pixels second.but as we know that the accleration due to gravity is in m s2 so how do i perform units conversion or do i need to change the assumptions about my unit for velocity

7972604
typedef	struct
the first step is to get rid of the typedef and use struct tags

7972604
typedef	struct
then you can forward-declare the struct tags and make the typedef separately if you still want to use them

7972618
folder	directory
you should also include the log.h file in your include directory and make sure that the out.dll is in the same output folder of your main project

7972643

7972738
hide	show
it hide the div but then show it again

7972738
hide	show
if i hide the div at page load with css then toggle it from the console the div will show

7972738
hide	show
if i then toggle again from the console it will hide and show again in one action

7972746
for-loop	loops
i have a for-loop which is used in many classes but the task inside the for loops are different

7972784
public	protected
change to protected or public inst

7972833
for-loop	loops
this means that the linq queries declared in loops won t really be made until some time after the conclusion of the for-loop meaning that i would be set to the value of 2

7972849
hide	show
if you d rather just hide and show absolutely everything you ll need to wrap your table in a container div and then instead of you would use

7972865
installation	upgrade
reinstallation of zipped package after unzipped installation is on the contrary possible by normal upgrade without need to remove anything

7972869
min	max
you don t need a variable and you don t need top unless id is not unique in which case you might consider something besides top such as min max or some other filter criteria as you can t really predict which record top will return

7972874
serializable	deserialization
things i absolutely want is to only have a single method for both serializable and deserialization and to be able to use and like if it was a normal type supported by yaml-cpp

7972903
put	get
technically there is also the few and far between case where it is a truly ignorable exception in which case put a comment in like i never ever care if i get this exception

7972920
client-side	server-side
client-side also means that the user is downloading both the xml and xslt content i would avoid that unless you are very concerned about server through-put as in my ad-hoc experience its generally much better to rely on the server-side environment which you can control

7972967
air	flashdevelop
i used air 2.7 installed on top of flash pro cs 5.5 with flashdevelop as my ide

7972995
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller

7973027
google-chrome	safari
there s also a test page in the mozilla bug database that we ve been using to test the problem the odd thing is that some webkit-based browsers on the mac eg safari and google-chrome don t have this problem

7973031
google-chrome	firefox
that works as desired on ie and google-chrome when it comes to firefox it doesn t work right

7973081
hide	show
i want it to show primaryelement first and a user can expand collapse each row to show hide linkedelement

7973090
textmate	sublimetext
neither textmate nor sublimetext are ides and thus do not provide line-based debugging

7973118
spaces	delimiter
hint when outputting debug statements enclose values with delimiter or and that will show a spaces pretty clearly

7973149
goto	break
the best easiest to read loops do not use break or continue they are a kind of structured goto statements

7973163
firefox	safari
edit in firefox v7 i see all greyscale and in safari v5 i don t see the shadow effect at all

7973172
goto	break
basically continue and break are better but often just disguised goto statements.

7973189
goto	break
my guess as to why you haven t seen it previously is that continue is sort of a cousin to goto break and early return s from functions

7973228
unsigned	short
i have a system which deals with keys that have been turned into unsigned long integers by packing short sequences into byte strings

7973240
google-chrome	firefox
for example on the page where you have your two input boxes your firefox implementation of the required action would have two clicks while your google-chrome implementation will just have one

7973279
int	chars
that is the correct way to convert it to an int as long as you don t have any alpha chars or null values

7973285
ienumerable	iqueryable
i am unable to do a list.select are the linq methods available only on ienumerable and iqueryable

7973286
google-chrome	firefox
i can t understand why firefox or google-chrome return html .offset .top relative to the client screen it seems that ie s approach is more predictable

7973315
spaces	delimiter
note the pattern s+ will put delimiter in the string as any whitespace like tab spaces etc

7973317
hide	show
i only wanted to show the show hide if greater than max so i did this following ken

7973331
exponent	modulo
then its just calling the method mpmodexp with the message the exponent and modulo all in basehex

7973417
spaces	linefeed
spaces will not be a problem for cast however characters like tab cr or linefeed will appear as spaces will not be trimmed by ltrim or rtrim and will be a problem

7973421
client-side	server-side
edit i should mention that we cannot not use a server-side solution it must be purely client-side scripting

7973434
lua	scheme
it supports ruby python lua scheme javascript javascript.next coffeescript qbasic forth move and kaffeine

but i m afraid that if i do upgrade the versioning of local working copy and the versioning of the repository on the server are different and there may appear the inconsistent format error or something like that

7973500
udp	rtp	rtp	rtsp
for connecting to rtsp server android client sends rtp avp udp as transport option in setup command so udp is used for transport

7973500

7973780
put	get
i have put backticks every which way and cant get it to go through always the same error message

7973784
children	parent
the obvious one is to first fetch a list of all parent and then run a separate query for the children of each parent in a loop

7973784
children	parent
the order by clause is there to ensure that the children of each parent are sorted together

7973784
children	parent
if you don t actually want to show all the parent and children in the table but just say those belonging to a single family then you should still try to do the filtering in sql to avoid fetching too many records

7973798
folder	directory
button1_click prepares some dummy folder and files for proof of concept a folder root containing a file and two subfolders each also containing a file then it calls createzip to compress the whole directory tree starting with root

7973807
udp	mtu
if you send a udp datagram larger than the path mtu it will get fragmented into smaller packets which are subject to 1

7973807
udp	tcp
the tcp ip stack has no obligation to deliver packets or udp datagrams in order

7973808
post	get
then when you get a post to your personhandler you can split the relevant path

7973812
uinavigationbar	uinavigationitem

7974121
decoder	encoder
you can find a url encoder decoder here

7974157
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
using a uinavigationcontroller would allow you to manage multiple uiviewcontroller subclasses while keeping the hierarchy in-tact so the user can navigate back to the previous view controllers

7974157
iboutlet	ibaction
the xib s file owner proxy should be set to your uiviewcontroller subclass which allows you to bridge the gap between the interface elements on the xib and the code inside your uiviewcontroller subclass through the use of iboutlet and ibaction properties of your subclass

7974174
ioexception	fileoutputstream
although all the included tests exists writeable and an ioexception on createnewfile or mkdirs leading up to the fileoutputstream fos constructor pass aok the fos construct fails throwing the filenotfoundexception see below

7974186
post	get
however i would like to advice you that you might be more likely to get an answer when you post your question as an issue on bitbucket as there people that use the app will actually see it

7974217
hide	show
basically i have 2 buttons that when hovered show hide 2 hidden unordered lists so i use .toggle for these

7974232
setinterval	settimeout
settimeout and setinterval set timers that when run down to zero add an item for execution either a line of code of a function callback to the execution stack starting the javascript engine if code execution has stopped

7974261
jtextfield	jlabel
you would want to assign this value to some gui component such as a jtextfield or jlabel by using the settext string text method on said component

7974282
mouse	keyboard
the browser certainly uses at least one native os thread process to handle the actual interface to the os to retrieve system events mouse keyboard timers network events etc...

7974305
children	parent
finally the all-mysql solution would be to prepare a stored procedure that purposefully constructs the data structure you re looking for 1 row per family having the parent s full name as the first column and children s full names as subsequent columns empty fields if the person does not have children like emmit herring

7974358
post	put
when a user-initiated post occurs i put the serialized post data into the history s state object

7974361

jdom	xom
you could use one of the popular apis such as jdom or xom

7974417
setinterval	settimeout
when you make an asynchronous ajax request or call settimeout or setinterval the browser may manage them in another thread but the actual js code in the callbacks will not execute until some point after the currently executing block of code finishes

so the salt is appended to the hash then sent to the server and stored

7974735
apache	nginx
i have nginx installed with apache as a reversed proxy to handle php

7974735
apache	nginx
apache s design is thread per client while nginx uses the reactor pattern meaning - nginx can handle much more traffic than apache as a web server about 50 times the number of requests

7974735
apache	nginx
the drawback is that nginx doesn t handle the php requests and for that the apache is installed too - nginx will send all the php calls to the apache so it will handle them and return the response back to nginx and back to the client

7974735
apache	nginx
if in that setup which is quite common you will put css js files under javascript you will lose the advantage of the nginx which instead of handling the static js css files on its own it will send them to the apache as it ll address them as php pages

7974758
sorting	grouping
grouping and sorting optional

7974762
hash	salt
in general you should store the hash passwords and random salt values in the database

7974762
hash	salt
form there you use the username to retrieve the salt value and hash password from the database to do your comparison with

7974762
hash	salt
see password hashing salt and storage of hash values for more info

7974781
post	get
using post instead of get will make this attack very difficult

7974781

addclass	removeclass
are you sure you can t use addclass removeclass for your purposes

7975136
folder	directory
the nsdocumentdirectory will not be cleared on app updates but be careful using this folder since ios 5 now uses this folder for backing up in icloud and your app will likely be rejected if you use this directory to store anything other then user generated content

7975143
translation	transliteration
the issue here is that an automatic translation from sql to linq will often have to perform more transliteration than translation - generating examples of how not to write linq queries

7975147

7975200
post	get
maybe query the database to get the count of post before or after the current one and subtract from the total

7975225
int	double
i think you ve got it since the data types are double rather than int or int the resulting x and y may not be precisely equal

7975241
setcontentview	findviewbyid
method 1 should give a force close error as you are using findviewbyid before setcontentview

7975241
setcontentview	findviewbyid
findviewbyid tries to find the view inside the layout you specified in setcontentview

7975246
width	height
you may want to calculate it based on the middle of the player rather than their top-left corner in which case just add half the player s width to their x position and half their height to their y position

7975270
client-side	server-side
could somebody explain the difference between server-side scripting and client-side scripting to me

7975306
inherited	base-class
first create a base-class to force views to inherited from that like below and override some methods

7975328
client-side	server-side
this could actually mean a couple of different things but the explanation that is probably most relevant to you based on your mention of triggers is that server-side scripting is sql that is precompiled and stored in the database in the form of triggers functions stored procedures views etc while client-side sql also known as dynamic sql is sql that is contained within the application

7975332
folder	directory
e.g if your css file is in a folder and your image in an images folder and both folder are in the same parent directory you would access the image in the css with the path .. images file_name.png

you can hide show them by using mykmllayer.setmap map and mykmllayer.setmap null

7975753
hide	show
the javascript here is relatively simple but it s harder to manage your data and you re limited to the granularity of one full kml file - you can t show hide individual placemarks

you can then use the references to these objects to support your show hide controls

7975838

7975890
keydown	keyup
there are three keyboard events you can trap keyup keydown and keypress

7975890
keydown	keyup
as explained in the jquery doco admittedly it is kind of buried the keyup and keydown events give a keycode that corresponds to the actual physical key on the keyboard so uppercase a and lowercase a will have the same code as will 2 and - but note that the 2 key above the w has a different code to the 2 key on the numeric keypad

7976492
post	get
http post behaves different than get

7976492
post	get
the reason for using post instead of get is that get parameters have a size limit in some browsers whereas you can have parameters of almost any length when submitted via a post

7976492
post	get
depending on what backend server technology is being used the server may treat get parameters and post parameters the same and therefore your backend service will handle either one fine

7976492
post	get
however in a lot of cases you have to specifically code your backend service to accept parameters via get post

width	margin
so for your question i think you should set the width according to your overall spacing for the font line-height and padding margin of the contents and make sure it blends well within the design

thus apache saves thumb to disk in order next time the request for this thumbnail will be received varnish could redirect it directly to nginx

submit	submission
one way would be to use an asynchronous messaging pattern so instead of submission a request and waiting on a response you would submit a request and continue on and have either a callback contract or an external-facing service contract that your service can connect back to a callback contract is the best option when you re dealing with a typical client-server scenario

7982278

for-loop	arrays
first of all for-loop checks if the value of current argument is within boundaries of argv argc is the length of arrays so last position in arrays argv is argc-1

7982401
mouseup	mousedown
you would check if the mousedown event originated from an htmlbuttonelement or from any of its child elements and if it did you set up a mouseup listener on the button so it does not have to bubble too much that will check the target property of the mouseup event

7982486
jerkson	jackson
aside from trying to make jerkson which is a great library to use from what i have heard you could also try jackson s scala module -- modules are the official way jackson is extended to deal with 3rd party datatypes as well as native datatypes and constructs of other jvm languages

7982486
jerkson	jackson
this is not to say this is more official than jerkson just that there are many useful jackson extension modules that many developers are not familiar with

the solution i found for my development is to provide tomcat libraries for compilation and remove the javax.servlet dependency from my pom.xml but then of course compilation fails when i use the maven command line tools

7982553

any idea why the tomcat maven plugins are ignoring the provided scope of my pom.xml dependency

uitapgesturerecognizer	uigesturerecognizer
nothing s changed with touchesbegan etc as far as i m aware but a smart way forward might be to check whether uitapgesturerecognizer is available it is as of ios 3.2 and if so attach one of those to your eaglview and use its locationinview inherited from uigesturerecognizer when an event fires

7983096
viewdidload	viewwillappear

7983112
uipangesturerecognizer	uipinchgesturerecognizer

the body.read method works properly only if the request body was processed which happens only when request.process_request_body is true it is by default and when the request method is in request.method_with_bodies which is only put and post by default but not get which you probably used when requesting the page with a browser

mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseleave
the problem i have a live handler for mouseenter mouseleave which works as expected if i don t have any other handlers but breaks down when i add another live handler for mouseout on another element

7987527
mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseleave
however adding the mouseout event causes the original live handler that is supposed to fire only on mouseenter mouseleave to instead fire on mouseenter mouseout

7987529
rspec	capybara
i m still on rails 2.3.x and using rspec capybara and steak to do some acceptance testing

7987554
put	get
in line 98 this line has been determined in code i want put codes in a function like tooltip but get error how is fix it

7987555
int	double
because it creates a temporary int where the double is converted and mutable references cannot bind to temporaries whereas const ones can. that doesn t make sense to me

7987578
mvp	presenter
while some may argue that mvp model view presenter may be based on this approach i don t like the fact that the controller cannot exist without a gui object being instantiated

7987580
addition	multiplication
assuming your bignum class already has multiplication and addition it s fairly simple

7987580
division	modulo
converting the other way is the same concept but requires division and modulo

i m trying to get page data using curl and sending variables via post

7987587
move	drag
when i drag an item and move it across to another box it throws me error

if you look at the tika-app pom.xml you ll see the appropriate maven magic to have such a jar built

7987600
post	put
and like other post noted your information associated with the child class is not lost you just need to put it in a form where its accessible

7987601

cobertura	jenkins
if you are using hudson jenkins remove all checks from the pom.xml and install the cobertura plugin to hudson and configure the checks in the hudson jenkins plugin

7987670
multiplying	add
the simplest not the most efficient way to do this is to write two functions one to multiplying a large number by an int and one to add an int to a large number

7987672
for-loop	arrays
after the for-loop i initiate an arrays and assign it to the pointer

7987689
capistrano	bundler
if i understand your question capistrano is a bundler aware way to do deployment

7987704
width	height
you can replace the hard-coded width and height by binding them to parent s width and height

7987704
width	height
i feel that you will need your own value-converters for assigning special width ad height actualwidth - shadowdepth kind of stuff shadowdepth being 5 pixels here

7987705
mp3	wav
convert from wav to mp3

7987732
swt	swing

7987734
mouse	keyboard	qtableview	qtablewidget	qtableview	qabstractitemview	qtablewidget	qabstractitemview
there doesn t appear to be anything as concise as the qtablewidget s currentcellchanged but qtableview does inherit a few things from qabstractitemview that you may be able to use together specifically the clicked entered pressed signals for mouse input and the keypressevent for keyboard input

7987766
children	parent
when you ask for parent you don t load children when lazy loading is on

7987766
children	parent
when it is off whenever you load parent you load all of it s children

7987766
children	parent
then when you serialize parent you will not try to serialize children that have reference to parent creating circular reference

7987792
mouse	keyboard
once highlighted the options can be changed using the mouse wheel or with the keyboard arrow keys

7987793
apache	nginx
it works with apache or nginx is well documented and is easy to install and configure

7987874
udp	tcp
i ve been messing around with different ways of implementing this and would like a bit of advice on whether tcp or udp is a better protocol to implement the communication between client and server

7987874
udp	tcp
would using tcp to communicate with the server and then udp multicast make sense

7987881
qlayout	qtextedit
i believe i read that placing qtextedit inside qlayout can allow for scaling of the qtextedit area though did not find how to implement it

uilabel	nsstring
the font type and size is fixed and cannot be changed and i trying to identify a way of calculating the length of the nsstring uilabel prior to creating the uitableview customcell so that the cell height can be set correctly

7987979
width	height
note you should pass a cgsize parameter in to the constrainedtosize part that is a larger height than what you intend it to be but the correct maximum width of the label

7987980
children	parent
i want parent be on a specific div children on an another div and list them

7988001
post	get
as long as you keep certain security principles in mind you can use both get and post even together

7988001
post	get
for both get and post it s always important to never trust the input and escape and filter and attempt to prevent csrf and other attacks

7988014
hide	show
i am using jquery ui tabs and working pretty well and now i want to hide and show tabs with a click of button as show below

7988014
hide	show
on each tab i have a button and when i click it it should hide the present tab and the rest tabs and should show me the next tab. ie..if i am on tab-1 and if i click button it should show me the tab-2 and should hide 1 3 and 4 tabs and similarly for 2 3 4 tabs

7988024
ubuntu	linux
i am on ubuntu linux

7988025
bmp	png	bmp	tga	png	tga	openexr	tga
the ideal way would be to use a image file format with alpha channel support png tga openexr â and not using bmps actually the bmp file format would allow for a 4th channel and in fact i once wrote my own bmp loader with alpha channel support and a photoshop export plugin many years ago

7988074

i prefer old school textmate or bbedit which i am becoming a real fan of

7988096
client-side	server-side
i did this to determine if the problem was server-side or client-side and so far it s pointing more towards the client-side

7988161
for-loop	loops
i saw that a lot of people were able to use a for-loop to determine the value of the key pressed for example it would be getasynckeystate 41 and they could therefore easily use a loops but for some reason it only works for me if i type in getasynckeystate 0x41 etc is there something i can do about this so i can loops through it instead of having to type each value individually

7988204
superclass	subclassing
i had a solution in a php 5.2 codebase that used reflection to get at the constants of a subclassing from a superclass but i d advise against doing that unless it s absolutely necessary because reflection is q relatively expensive tool in php in terms of performance

7988244
folder	directory
it s faster to the operating system reach the file when you have 100 folder with 100 files inside i see a lot of improvement when i split one directory that had more than 20.000 files inside

you could use tax_query parameters to get the post by post_format

fadein	hide
when one clicks on a certain link i want to hide the all divs within the section element and fadein only the div#one

7988291
slideup	slidedown
once the div#one is visible when someone clicks on a span element it should take the div#one and slideup and grab div#two and slidedown

7988291
slideup	slidedown
if it is visible the the same span element should now take div#two and slideup and grab div#three and slidedown

7988292
for-loop	arrays
to overcome this problem just add one more element to the arrays say 100 so the for-loop to terminate after processing the decades

7988321
superclass	subclassing
perhaps a point i need to make is that it is fine to cast an object as its superclass if you are not going to call any subclassing specific methods on it

7988362
google-chrome	firefox
may i inquire about how you achieved automated plugin installation in firefox and google-chrome

7988362

this seems to work fine on a desktop browser well google-chrome anyway but doesn t seem to function in mobile safari

7988391
google-chrome	firefox
then i would run this page using ie or google-chrome dev tools or firebug in firefox

7988393

using this tag the mobile browser will adjust the size of the site according to the mobile viewport mobile screen width and height

7988397
rvm	bundler
don t forget to ommit the sudo if you re using rvm which means only gem install bundler

7988410
getter	setter
just wondering if anyone can shed some light on the basics of getter setter in ruby on rails with a view on strongly typed

7988415
codeigniter	cakephp
you could either hand code it from scratch or use an existing framework such as codeigniter symphony cakephp zend etc to develop a restful web service

7988432
getter	setter
the getter and setter of the jobfilenames property are referencing themselves causing an infinite loop

7988462
google-chrome	firefox
everything runs pretty fast thought not as fast as google-chrome in firefox

7988488
hide	show
it will also animate the change so you may not need to hide and show it again which is not a good ui practice in general

floating-point	integer
after reading that you ll realise that the floating-point representation of 1 isn t quite the integer value 1

7988597
children	parent
without adding any extra complexity to the rockauto site it appears to structure it s tree view as make-year-model-variant but year doesn t really have any attributes or children or parent it s more like an attribute of model

one approach would be to required a placeholder element in the page with a fixed id or class or something

7988909
pop-up	dialog
while this won t pop-up a native dialog box it will give you some semblance of the share functionality

7988928
fseek	fread
you could emulate that by reading the request headers and output the content in 4kb steps with fopen fseek fread and so on

7988936
width	height
ol-box-bg is the background which the jquery pulls the height and width of the browser and set the css to the box and the rest is in style.css which it says position absolute

7988975
qmodelindex	qabstractitemview
derive the view and redefine the function qabstractitemview currentchanged qmodelindex qmodelindex

7988983
pop-up	dialog
if this is an issue for you then you re probably better off sticking with the idea of applying the effect in the code-behind when you pop-up the dialog

7989008
slideup	slidedown
the problem is that slidedown and slideup animate the height not the position

7989008
slideup	slidedown
slidedown and slideup should really be called expandvertical and contractvertical or possibly squeeze

7989031
centos	linux

7989392
implements	extends
because i have a lot of methods to implements like person.is_granted person.is_admin for example i was wondering what is the best way in application design to declare methods on theses object should i extends them

7989394
folder	directory
essentially they give you a single virtual directory which contains a single active bin folder for your dlls

7989394
folder	directory
one way that we got around the issue is to reconstruct the exact same folder structure starting from the root of the virtual directory on the production server within your visual studio project

7989441
maven	m2e	maven-antrun-plugin	m2e
this should provide you with the most flexible base of writing the code and will also work with m2e though you need to run the maven generate-sources yourself as maven-antrun-plugin won t run automatically as there is no connector for it yet

7989443
width	height
the only basic settings i ve checked is app on facebook the advanced settings are for canvas width fixed 760px canvas height fluid

7989445
udp	tcp
if you want to connect to tcp udp just use net.dial

7989450
post	get
it is impossible to get a full list of post from the feed home graph api but you can use fql to query the stream table to get almost every post made by friends here is a quick example of how you would do that with the javascript sdk

7989450
post	get
this will get you the post ids which you can then use with graph api to fetch the rest of the post info

7989453
filtering	grouping
it is possible to filtering multiple messages or even pre-defined grouping of messages -- see check for details

7989490
children	parent
the parent the dispatcher knows what transformation needs to be performed however so it would be a lot cleaner to just transform the motionevent or a copy before dispatching it to the children

7989519
folder	directory
while automatic discovery of translations in the project directory is deprecated the use of locale_paths to reference a project-level locale folder is totally acceptable

7989552
width	height
i put the background in an img tag and made it the width and height 100 of the window with zindex of -1 so it stays and the content scrolls thank you for your help and anyone else that looked at this

7989572

i struggled with this issue not getting oauth id in the signed_request and instead get the code after user approves the app for over a week and this post and few others post helped me get very close to resolving the issue i was using my apps canvas url instead of the canvas page url in the redirect uri and i didn t specify the namespace in the settings

versioning	upgrade
this problem only started after i upgrade to the latest versioning of snow leopard

7989658
skip-lists	tree
for this reason i thought about using a skip-lists compared to a tree the iterator should be faster

7989658
arraylist	treeset
after some micro-benchmarking running iteration multiple times on different-sized treeset linkedlist concurrentskiplist and arraylist shows that there s quite an overhead

7989659
post	put	post	get	put	get
it s also completely acceptable to do as you are suggesting and require the user to send the token as part of the get post put delete request as you would with a standard page

7989680
jobs	cron
i am looking into cron jobs and windows scheduled tasks as well

7989680
min	max
we are talking about changing adding removing from 1 min to 160 lines max in the tables at a time

7989690
skip-lists	tree
in a single thread world is different you can use a sorted set a binary tree or your custom data structure that would perform better than concurrent skip-lists

7989690
skip-lists	tree
the complexity in iterating a tree list or a skip-lists will be always o n but if you instead use a linked list or an array list you have the problem with insertion to insert an item in the right position sorted linked list the complexity of insertion will be o n instead of o log n for a binary tree or for a skip-lists

7989690
treemap	treeset
there is also the treeset class that probably is what you need but since it is just a wrapper to treemap the direct use of treemap would be faster

7989700
ember.js	backbone.js
for more advanced browser-based applications backbone.js angular.js and ember.js are the winners

7989700
extjs	mootools
dojo mootools extjs and knockout.js are some alternatives to angular and friends.

persistent	transient	instances	transient
save object object - persistent the given transient instances first assigning a generated identifier

7989794
put	get
bear in mind that rewrite by lua is always executed after the nginx rewrite directives so if you put any such directives in the other case they will be executed first and you will get funnies

7989852
rdf	owl
we will record lot videos everyday and metadata with log data would be saved in semantic model rdf or owl

7989852
rdf	owl
so we just record the binary file s path in the rdf or owl file

7989873
gmail	hotmail
note i can also use remote images but email servers like yahoo gmail and hotmail will put them in spam

7989900

hex	binary
i use winvi which supports utf-8 utf-16 and hex binary editing

7989950
dictionary	map
...an associative array also called a map or a dictionary is an abstract data type composed of a collection of key value pairs such that each possible key appears at most once in the collection

7989950
skip-lists	tree	skip-lists	hashmap
hint a hash function is important part of a hash-table algorithm and sets a hashmap apart from other map implementations such as a treemap that uses a red-black tree or a concurrentskiplistmap that uses a skip-lists

7989951
post	get
i believe there is a way to post to a php file some information so if i could get an array of all the checked people and pass that to the php file where it will then do they mysql queries that would be great

7989999
post	get
the method get post head etc you re trying to use on that url is not supported by the app

7990011
innodb	myisam
should i always prefer mysql innodb over myisam

7990013
stdout	stderr
also note this is only one problem with your code there are potentially and most likely a lot more problems however you should be able to narrow them down with gdb using the backtrace bt command and printing to stderr as opposed to stdout so that your output is not buffered

7990022
innodb	myisam
a very basic run-down of my decision-making is table-lock myisam row-lock innodb

7990032
onresume	onpause
you can pause the thread in the onpause method of the activity and you can resume the thread on onresume method of the activity which is pretty stright forward

7990048
xlwt	xlutils
if what you mean is after you ve already saved the workbook you want to read it again to get the max widths and then save it again with new column widths this will be much slower and will involve using both xlwt and xlrd and possibly xlutils as well

7990053
getter	setter
copy only applies to the setter the getter will still return a reference not a copy

7990128

7990140
youtube	vimeo
alternatively youtube and vimeo have provided access to a html5 friendly embed using an iframe

7990173
setinterval	settimeout
you probably want settimeout rather than setinterval because setinterval will run your opacityto function every 100ms forever while settimeout will run opacityto exactly once after the 100ms delay

7990173
setinterval	settimeout
when you call setinterval or settimeout it does not pause execution of the current block of code

7990204
put	get
i also second the suggestion to put a #error just above the creature class declaration to ensure that creature didn t somehow get defined elsewhere and thus force the class declaration to be skipped

7990212
post	put
although the documentation clearly states that the update operation is a post it s actually a put

7990220
cpython	ironpython
ptvs also supports ironpython 2.7 + cpython 2.5 - 3.2 has much better intellisense and is generally just much more mature

7990242
backbone.js	javascriptmvc
javascriptmvc frameworks like backbone.js are for adding structure to your front-end

7990250
folder	directory
the solution to the problem for me was looking in my install directory finding the data folder and copying it s content to the data folder that was specified in my .ini .cnf configuration file

modifying ironpython or ironruby to do this wouldn t be too difficult

phong	shading
as a final year project at university i created my own non-competitive demo in 3dfx where i impressed the graphics professor by doing phong shading although 3dfx cards could not do this simple texture mapping trick in reality

7999438
post	get
i decided not to post my work since i think i got it so wrong that it would not help me to get correction on it

7999461
google-chrome	firefox
problem is that using firefox all functions are working properly but using google-chrome when image is placed resize option frame doesn t work

7999475

put	get
i ve just put your code as is into a module and all i get when requesting is the expected json there are no tags

7999725
children	parent
the parent window will call the enumchildwindows whenever it is resized or for some reason need to redraw its children

7999800
inherited	properties
note in the description of the jvm properties that jvm settings are not inherited from maven_opts. try setting your memory options there instead

7999811
iframe	prettyphoto
you can tweak the prettyphoto js code but that will effect all your popups so as you found the workaround of the close function inside the iframe then that s it you didn t have to duplicate themes and hide the close button on the its stylesheet you could have simply let jquery do so from withing the iframe just include this code into your iframe

7999830
post	put
if you read this blog post it sounds like it was pulled out of 1.6.3 and perhaps will be put back in 1.7 and the main reason it was pulled is because it broke some things people were incorrectly using the animation queue for though perhaps that is a matter of opinion

7999848
pop-up	dialog
when i press a button in the contextual menu i want to pop-up a small window dialog subactivity lets call it b that appears on top of activity a and displays some data about those background operations

7999848
width	height
what i don t like about this approach is that i use the width and height of the screen

7999852
vim	emacs
you can have a look at emacs or vim there are plenty of plugins and useful tips on the web

7999856
textview	simpleadapter
then you d use a simpleadapter to map the appropriate pieces of the string to each textview

7999862
portrait	landscape
i have developed a ebook reder which supports ios 3.2 and above versions of ipad.the ebook reader shows a single page in portrait mode and 2 pages in landscape mode

7999862
portrait	landscape
i tried the same application on another device which runs on ios 5 the application works fine until i change the orientation.once the orientation is changed the view sizes are not proper and it seems like it is taking portrait view size in landscape and vice versa

7999873
joptionpane	jdialog
the program consists of 5 stages 1 set up the gui 2 put up a message saying wait for the task to complete 3 the lengthy non-edt task 4 a change to the message so that it now says wait for gui to update the table 5 updating of the table in gui followed by disposal of the jdialog joptionpane

7999873
joptionpane	jdialog
the thing i don t understand is why if you comment out the thread.sleep line in doinbackground above the jdialog behaves oddly the title is then updated but the text of the joptionpane does not change and the cancel button is not removed

7999924
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
it works in google-chrome and firefox but in opera it fades from a grey color to white instead of transparent to white.

7999954
versioning	upgrade
also i d seriously recommend you upgrade to a more current versioning of watir

7999973
ubuntu	debian
starting with debian 7 wheezy and ubuntu 15.04 dcevm can be installed with the openjdk-7-jre-dcevm and openjdk-8-jre-dcevm packages and invoked with java -dcevm

phonegap does work with both get and post - cross-domain security issues do not apply

8000104
moq	moles
personally i use moq for internal dependency and moles for externalities and unpleasant static stuff forced on me by others so i might not be giving you the best way but it s a way

8000104
moq	moles
again i d usually do this with moq and used mystub.verify for this purpose so it s possible that there s a slicker way to do this with moles that i m not aware of

8000104
moq	moles
personally i think moles is much better suited for mocking the unmockable and i prefer a combination of moq for my own interfaces and classes and moq for framework and externalities like file i o gui db connections etc

8000114
post	put	post	get	put	get
i am trying to write an android application that will take a picture put the data byte in an object along with some metadata and post that to an appengine server where it will get persisted in a datastore as a blob

8000124
nsstring	nsdata	writetofile	nsdata
if the array s to save is fairly small and contain only basic data types instances of nsdata nsdate nsnumber nsstring nsarray or nsdictionary you could simply write them to a file using writetofile atomically

8000129
qtableview	qabstracttablemodel
i am using a delegate to display a qpixmap from a qabstracttablemodel in a qtableview like this

8000199
listadapter	convertview
if you are using listview with listadapter then when overriding getview int position view convertview viewgroup parent determine from position what view should be returned and return it

8000202
for-loop	arrays
the output of each is discarded because each is the classical imperative for-loop you need to do some kind of side-effect read from a file print to screen update an arrays hash ... to effectively do something

8000227
clientaccesspolicy.xml	crossdomain.xml
if you want to access some rest web services with your silverlight application the third party server where the service is you want to access needs a clientaccesspolicy.xml or crossdomain.xml in the rootfolder

8000227
clientaccesspolicy.xml	crossdomain.xml
but how do i consume or access a rest service which responds with a xml file with my silverlight application but without any clientaccesspolicy.xml or crossdomain.xml beeing on that server

8000231
gridview	repeater
edit i just realized this in a repeater and not a gridview

8000250
dns	spf
moreover if the receiving server checks spf records it is useless to impersonate a remote domain even if it is allowed because the mail will be rejected anyway if the domain publishes an spf dns record

8000261
inherited	properties
i believe the textbox only has this properties because it inherited it from dijit._widget according to the api docs

8000264
put	get
what i figured out that worked just to get the times not to put them in a data frame after about 10 other guesses was this

8000264
do.call	lapply
i also have to do do.call c lapply ... rather than just sapply ... because sapply loses the fact that it s a date

8000279
post	get
is the form a post or a get

8000295
children	parent
when qobject is freed all it s children will be freed based on the parent passed as arguments to object constructor

8000337
width	height
column 1 will have width 200px and height 100 so it will fill the screen vertically then next to it there will be a second column with width 500px and the same height 100

8000337
width	height
and finally the last column will fill the rest of the screen so it will be width 100 and height 100 and in that column i would like to place an image which will stretch and fill that div

8000373
mkmapview	mkoverlay
i have a mkmapview with a mkoverlay over it showing the location history of the user

8000457
uilabel	uibutton
i would recommend getting rid of the uitextfield and replacing it with a uilabel with a uibutton over it

8000475
getter	setter
the tricky part is with the parameter names being unknown i cannot write getter and setter methods

8000520
memcpy	malloc
do i have to malloc the this- preset1 pointer before i memcpy everything

8000558
pull	push
you will want to use the incoming hook which is called for each changeset that is applied on the repository either via pull push or unbundle

8000575
ant	maven
framework is not installed on the target machine and requirements call for a standard war to be created from either an ant or maven build script

leiningen	counterclockwise
i got this to work by setting up a project with leiningen installing cake and installing the counterclockwise eclipse plugin

8000732
equals	gethashcode
microsoft guidelines indicate that that when gethashcode for two objects is equals equals should return true for those objects

8000733
post	get
try adding a hidden field that stores the value onclick and then get that from the post or get array in your action file

8000736
folder	directory
open the settings find the android section and make sure the directory is correctly pointing to your android sdk folder

8000828
for-loop	arrays
your for-loop to delete the objects pointed to by the elements of the arrays is fine

8000828
for-loop	arrays
you need both the for-loop and then the to dispose of the arrays itself

8000907
fadein	fadeout
fadein and fadeout image until you have fadein and fadeout all images

8000907
fadein	fadeout
and for your knowledge i m using the second parameter of fadein and fadeout it s the callback do this function when the animation is finish

8000934
getter	setter
in scala a getter and setter will be implicitly defined for all non-private vars in a object

8000934
getter	setter
the getter name is same as the variable name and is added for the setter name

8000953
min	max
another possibility to get more coverage would be to set up one of your common forminfo objects to generate random strings for each of the fields that comply to the min max length and cycle between all different allowed characters

8000957
mouseover	mouseleave
i want to add mouseover and mouseleave events to dynamical created panels in a flowlayoutpanel

8000957
mouseover	mouseleave
now i want to dynamical add a mouseover and mouseleave event to each panel

8000968
serializable	deserialization
it is not all that hard to write serializable and deserialization functions to handle the formatting

8001043
rss	feed
i am currently developing a dynamic rss feed that will automatically pull articles from a mysql database

8001056
opencart	infusionsoft
you mentioned that you re integrating a shopping cart so i ll also mention this- we provide connectors for many common shopping carts already built quickbooks connector for opencart infusionsoft whmcs foxycart and more

8001064
uiview	subviews
however in order to have a fixed footer to make selection settings for the table buttons i used a uiview with two subviews a uitableview on top and a simple uiview with four buttons below

8001072
daemon	cron
have this run by a polling os daemon or cron or something

8001078
implements	extends
that s why i decided to implements my own customcursoradapter extends simplecursoradapter

8001089
udp	tcp
failing that set the interrupted flag and make the udp read return by sending it a datagram on the local tcp stack from a socket in thread requesting the shutdown

8001107
post	get	feedback	review
if this isn t helping you solve your original problem you might want to post your code on the code review site and see if you can get some feedback on your design

8001119
getter	setter
don t expose a getter setter for the private libcod

8001156
cpu	affinity
perhaps you are interested in cpu affinity with non-portable functions like pthread_attr_setaffinity_np

8001182
hide	show
a list is populated with checkboxes to give the user the ability to show and hide events by category via the following code

8001182
hide	show
i would like to show render the events that the user chose to hide when they re-check the appropriate box without reloading the whole page and json source but keep other events that are unchecked removed

8001192
screens	tablet
in fact just having layouts set up for the larger sizes that share names should set it so the same app could be used for both a smaller screens phone and a larger screens tablet

8001231
gridview	rowdatabound
the dataitem property is only available during and after the rowdatabound event of a gridview control

8001233

i have a vbs file that i am trying to use to determine what folder and files are in a certain directory

8001271
int	chars
it could be int chars float whatever

8001289
gridview	rowdatabound
so on the .net gridview control there s a rowdatabound event at which time i create a dropdownlist for each row in a particular column

8001289
post	get
when that dropdownlist changes on the client i can get it to post back but the control s state is already gone

8001376
setinterval	settimeout
this allows the user to have a familiar interface even without javascript and can be simply implemented with settimeout or setinterval

8001382
gridview	sqldatasource
basically i have a sqldatasource connected to a gridview and i want to change the selectcommand of the datasource without causing a postback

8001384
vim	emacs
the typical eclipse activities i do and would like to transfer that to vim emacs are this is for multi-module multi-projects multi-folder source code

8001384
maven	pom.xml
updating dependencies 3rd party jars via maven pom.xml

8001384
vim	emacs
i have a macbook pro 13 which would benefit of using vim emacs or any lightweight editor

8001396
webclient	webrequest
if you just want to test a http proxy for a valid connection you can use the webrequest webclient classes and download a small file on a remote computer

8001423
min	max
the min max attributes are for more efficient searches

8001438
updatepanel	scriptmanager
there are many approaches to this but the easiest is to enclose your content inside an updatepanel and drop a scriptmanager on your page

8001461
internationalization	localization
internationalization localization

8001471
vim	emacs
if you ask a question which involves vim or emacs you will never get an useful answer

8001503
uninstall	upgrade
if you need a newer boost than 1.40 either upgrade your ubuntu or uninstall all boost-related packages and reinstall from source in usr local

8001504
pop-up	dialog	hide	show
each input on the page is designed to hide a more complex form show via a jquery dialog pop-up

8001512
vim	emacs
i think that with emacs you should start it at most daily and it is very different with vim and you should configure it in your .emacs file

8001560
put	get
in the code that i put bellow on map click i get alert with undefined message

8001567
implements	extends
since i m using v4 compatibility package i thought that using custom loader that extends asynctaskloader would help me since that internally implements a thread pool

8001609
bazaar	git	bazaar	svn
i usualy make use of ohloh.net which has some tools to extract some basic statistics from your git mercurial bazaar svn repositories

8001629
pseudo-class	visited
visited pseudo-class

8001639
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
if it s longer than 355 chars my block will be appeared it works in major browsers firefox opera google-chrome safari but in ie doesn t because ie says that the length of the block is 55 character

8001684
width	height
edit example code width and height are predefined floats points is an array of cgpoints all of which lie inside the context and color is a uicolor with an opacity of 100 -

8001698
postgresql	mysql
i am used to mysql so you may need to adjust the syntax slightly for postgresql

8001698
postgresql	mysql
probably this would work in postgresql as well as in mysql

8001716
hash	md5
however a very simple method is to use a md5 hash with a private key

8001716
hash	md5
if you know the users name on the website login you can provide that key in an md5 hash set to a javascript variable

8001763
int	double
note the problem goes both ways when i keep the denominators and numerators separate for most of the calculation i struggle with int overflow when i do most calculations on the fly using double arithmetic i m met with the various problems limits that really small double values have as defined by ieee 754

8001785
bufferedreader	fileinputstream
new bufferedreader new inputstreamreader new bufferedinputstream fileinputstream 2048

8001887
button	checkbox
this script adds a checkbox to the final screen of the installer and allows an exe script to be run when the finish button is clicked

8001890
haskell	scheme
how can i implemment this in scheme or in haskell

8001898
profiling	instrumentation
so i took instrumentation s time profiling and dug into the depth of my app only to find out that every time the app hung it actually was in the process of opening png files for uiimageviews just like you found out as well

8001899
vim	emacs
for java development eclipse has lots of features which you ll miss from emacs or vim

8001906
width	height
when you resize a uiview the width height increases to the right bottom direction

8001910
spaces	delimiter
so you should be able to simply supply the classes in a string delimiter by spaces

8001913
uiview	calayer
to animate properties of the calayer you must use core animation classes and methods not uiview s

8001946
codeigniter	cakephp
i am new to cakephp as a framework however am very familiar with codeigniter zend etc

8001984
implements	extends
so to make a type of library class that implements ihero extends a display object like sprite or movieclip and then use the implements keyword to indicate the class implements ihero

8002041
width	height
i have tried setting div height and using width 100 but nothing seems to work

8002059
children	parent
when i want to display all of the children for the parent model i can do

8002067
put	get
get out the words that are the most comonly used let s say drop your rate up to xx trial and error here put this words in your database and give them a weight of 0

8002111
migrate	upgrade
this application was actually upgrade from a biztalk 2006 r2 project and the parties were migrate over using the party migration tool included with biztalk 2010

8002188
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
this occurs in firefox 7.0.1 safari 5.1.1 google-chrome 11.0.696.68 and opera 10.53 on a mac snow leopard

8002202
decoder	encoder
unfortunately none of the java encoder decoder classes seemed to solve my problem

8002204
getter	setter
a better approach i think will be just to gather all data you will ever need either in your bean as an instance variable with a setter getter method or passed as a parameter when you fill your report

8002235
division	multiplication
division by a constant can usually be optimized into a wide multiplication followed by a shift

8002237
opera	google-chrome
in opera and google-chrome it works as i expected and prints

8002282
folder	directory
could it be giving an error because there is a space in one of the folder names in my python directory

8002308
post	get
is it possible to get all post from tumblr users which have the same tag

8002308
post	get
for example i want to get post from this category tag

8002338
gridview	rowdatabound
i m curious why are you adding these dropdownlist s to the gridview in the rowdatabound event

8002354
macbook	isight
i am trying to create an opencv application on my macbook with built-in isight camera

8002393
getter	setter
the attr_reader and attr_writer class macro methods define getter and setter methods for instance variables

8002415
post	get
doing it this way the browser will show the show_result.php page a get request instead of the page requested with post

8002440
many-to-many	one-to-many
if you had a separate joining table used for many-to-many you would need to resort to trickery to enforce the one-to-many relationship

8002442
udp	tcp
the idea is that requests come in via the network though i ve not decided if tcp or udp would be best yet and are passed immediately to a high-speed load balancer

8002442
cpu	affinity
each queue corresponds to a thread whose affinity is set to one cpu core on the server

8002442
udp	tcp
would tcp or udp be more appropriate for requests

8002442
udp	tcp
it d be very useful to have the proof of delivery that tcp offers but the lightweight nature of udp is appealing too

8002473
put	get
i put the onclick code in the oncreate of the main.layout but i get a nullpointer at line 101 which is chkbox.setonclicklistener new view.onclicklistener

8002515
post	get
according to http standard you ought to make browser to do a get request after sending post one

8002553
dbcontext	objectcontext
the datacontext objectcontext or dbcontext in ef is nothing else than an implementation of the unit of work uow repository pattern

8002566
width	height
say you want to increase it s width and height by 10 in the opposite direction

8002598
getter	setter
could you encapsulate the integer in another class wrap with a setter and getter and add a notification via an observer

8002603
int	double
i presume that the reason for this is something to do with casting the left hand side to a double in the same way that it happens for int double comparisons and calculations but here the left and right sides do not interact in this way

8002615
realloc	malloc
i m using malloc rather than new because i want to use realloc in the function that resizes the array

8002663
equals	compareto
if you look at the documentation for compareto you ll notice that it s intended to return -1 b goes before a 0 a and b are equals or 1 b goes after a

8002684
int	chars
if one of the operands is of type t where t is byte short or chars and the other operand is a constant expression of type int whose value is representable in type t then - the type of the conditional expression is t

8002684
int	chars
chars and the other operand is a constant expression of type int whose value is representable in type chars then the type of the conditional expression is chars

8002684
int	double
that s exactly what happens here - the parameter types are converted to int and double respectively the second operand the third in the original expression is then of type double so the overall result type is double

8002741
pop-up	dialog
currently if you do not correctly enter the form questions a dialog box pop-up with a message indicating you didn t fill in the field correctly

8002749
put	get
i put the onclick code in the oncreate of the main.layout but i get a nullpointer at line 101 which is chkbox.setonclicklistener new view.onclicklistener

8002781
nsstring	nsdata
you can do this by creating an nsdata from the nsstring using whatever encoding its was originally created with you need to know this much at least or it won t work and then you can create a new nsstring from the same data using utf-8

8002793
udp	tcp
basically i want the phone to communicate with a server sending it tcp udp packets and i want the server to reply to the phone an answer depending on the packet received

8002811
width	height
perhaps setting the width and height to zero might have the same effect.

8002816
post	get
if you do then whatever that element s value was would have been posted and retrievable using assuming the request method was post and not get

8002817
put	get
a put your for in loop in a child process and get the result in your main app once it s over

8002852
range	max
multiplying it by your num or max range gets you a value with a max of that number 1 num

8002904
richtextbox	textblock
chrisf offers the richtextbox as a solution but its less well known that simple font variation is acheivable with the simple textblock -

8002930
uilabel	uibutton
sounds like you really don t need the complexity and weight of cocos 2d and could very well do with just nstimers uilabel uiimageviews and uibutton and if you need finer control you can use coregraphics it has simple methods for text and images and system timing apis as nstimer accuracy can be an issue

8002940
getter	setter
it is better to keep the field private and only expose the getter and setter

8002940
getter	setter
one advantage is that you can choose different access levels for the getter and setter whereas a field has only a single access level

8002940
getter	setter
even better is to avoid getter and setter where possible

8002940
getter	setter
this is because objects shouldn t be tampering with other objects internal state either via directly accessing fields or indirectly via getter and setter

8002940
getter	setter
are getter and setter poor design

8002960
width	height
i have 2 html elements that sit in the exact same position same x y values same width height

8002963
vb6	vba
perhaps one of the important traits of cryptosys is that it supports several development languages platforms not just vb6 and vba

8002985
put	get
however in ios 5.0 you will need to put up with the fact that it may get purged in low disk space situations

8002992
getter	setter
private properties with getter and possibly setter are considered proper style since declaring them public and using them directly harms the principle of encapsulation

8002992
getter	setter
besides getter setter allow you to add logic to the process of accessing and mutating

8002992
getter	setter
then again in many cases like most javabeans usage the getter setter do nothing more than what you d do with direct access

8002997

8003094

i know to use basic caliburn micro i m still fairly new to it so i haven t covered all of the less-frequent areas so i basically would benefit just from the snippets on each area viewmodel view and model that would pertain to the image control

8003836
postgresql	mysql

8004406
qgraphicsview	qwidget
a qgraphicsview has a bit more going on than most qwidget subclasses and i m not familiar enough with it to say what is going on for sure but i might venture a guess that your problem is related to the fact that the scene is actually rendered onto the view port widget

i implemented the jqueryui slider and want to display the min max slider values in 2 different divs

8004443

8004981
width	height
so that when the window size gets larger or smaller the child items should stretch according to a certain width height ratio

8004981

my problem is i want to hide only one item value from my db that show on this dropdown

8005063
int	chars
i m not quite sure if this is what you want but you can assign int values directly to chars types like so

8005084

i m reading a rss feed and i get an image url and now i want to store this image in my folder

postgresql	mysql
if you have a aoutvalue id in any sql server postgresql mysql ms sql ... and do a delete from it only removes the table content not the counter

8005497
nofollow	noindex
the sure fire way of having the page not show up in the serp is to remove the disallow admin command and allow googlebot to crawl the page and see the noindex nofollow meta tag

8005497
nofollow	noindex
the noindex command will remove the page from the serps and the nofollow will help inform googlebot not to give priority to the links that it finds on your login page this will help maintain your crawl efficiency but does not guarantee google won t crawl the links it finds on the page

8005540
hash	salt
the length of the salt does you no good as it s a known constant in the hash input

8005601

and if you put a break point in the code and go to disassembly you ll see that although the second line looks complicated it is not complicated at all you can t get any faster

8005798
ant	maven
you could replicate this into an ant or maven script but you then lose any backwards compatibility you have to future upgrades

8005798

8006222
comparator	comparable
it is equivalent to java comparator not comparable

8006262
client-side	server-side
you must pay attention php is executed in server-side javascript is executed client-side

8006277
post	get
at this point it is important to understand that if you want to store a value in session that originates on the client side then you can only pass it onto the server using get post or cookies -- whether you use ajax or call the page directly does not matter

8006293
outputstream	inputstream
have a look at the inputstream and outputstream types

8006302

sparc scalable processors architecture sun microsystems s specific cpu

8006538

8006895
pull	push
the best way i recommend cometd for always pull it is adavenced technology for push

8006930
imperative	declarative
he also mentions an absolute declarative or imperative model being a myth

8006930
imperative	declarative
so i guess i wouldn t get too hung up on declarative vs imperative - it won t get you anywhere as far as this problem goes

8006930
imperative	declarative
1 - declarative or imperative scenarios

8006930
imperative	declarative
declarative when you can though imperative has some value at some points in a project lifecycle

folder	directory
you can just use nsfilemanager to access the directory and get a list of all files like if you stored it in your app s library folder

8007213
xlsx	xlsm
if you re not running on windows then you re going to need code that understands the excel file format which is fairly achievable in the new xlsx xlsm xml-based world available from excel 2007 onwards and rather more difficult in the old binary xls form

8007290
xlsx	xlsm
the sheet is an xlsx file and not an xlsm file

adding a breakpoint in google-chrome to see what happen make it works same ouput as firefox

8007466
xls	.doc
the simple answer would be to use a different output format instead of word .doc - for example html or xls

8007466
doc	rtf
there s a post on the subject on the birt world blog here specifically relating to xls emitters although the tribix emitters mentioned should also enable output to rtf a microsoft format readable by word that is much more concise than doc

8007622
switching	screens
both screens are tabs which the user can switching between quickly for reference purposes therefore both pieces of data are required at the same time

while this may be tempting for form features in which a custom text value is secondary to a radio button or checkbox the click-focus functionality of the label element will immediately throw focus to the element whose id is explicitly defined in its for attribute making it nearly impossible for the user to click into the contained text field to enter a value

8014129

typedef was added to the language to allow the creation of shorter names which didn t included the struct however the full struct syntax is used - and specifically is used in historical context where the original definition of a system structure is defined as struct without a corresponding typedef short form

8020360
typedef	struct
as comparison c++ which is a much later language allows a class struct to be referred to by just the class struct name regardless of whether it was defined with a typedef

asterisk	pbx
i am having some problems with asterisk ip pbx freepbx

8020383
rtp	sip
i am having two clients and i want that all of the sip and rtp traffic should go through proxy

8020383
rtp	sip
sip and rtp traffic is going through the proxy machine currently but i changed the proxy implementation such that instead of routing the media or rtp traffic through asterisk proxy automatically forwards it to the other client

8020399
typedef	struct
many modern c libraries are systematically typedef -ing their struct and use some naming convention

8020406
width	height
i m wondering if it s possible to get sizes width and height of an image before it s loaded

it s pretty much the same in javascript only that min and max are members of the math object

8020610
subtract	add
if mod 3 1 then subtract 1 with mod 3 2 then add 1

8020612

8020647
jcl	rexx
yes you can do this with rexx but you re going to be parsing jcl

8020654
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
as you push uiviewcontroller on to a uinavigationcontroller the view of the uiviewcontroller which have been pushed onto may be unloaded to save memory as they are invisible

8020654
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
you should have iboutlets to uiviewcontroller not uinavigationcontroller so that they can be released on viewdidunload

8020654
accessor	properties
the usual way to release them is to declare them as retained properties and set them to nil with the self.outlet accessor in viewdidunload and dealloc

8020681
richfaces	icefaces
richfaces or icefaces jsf libraries provide such capability

8020690
folder	directory
i run this command to compress the content of current folder while excluding some directory

8020702
kde	gnome
what the world would need would be some kind of extensions to the c++ language which would make it easy to interop with gobject a little like c++cx on windows but 1 it is a difficult task perhaps achievable through a gcc plugin and 2 there is no momentum towards c++ in the gnome world or generally in the linux world kde being a notable exception

8020746

prepare	execute	prepare	pdostatement
if the query contains parameters then prefer using pdo prepare and pdostatement execute instead of pdo query

8020932
range	min	range	max	min	max
you could use inputquery from qdialogs unit which has an overloaded version with min and max parameters for limiting the range of integer input

8020935
google-chrome	firefox
when inspecting the output in the browser google-chrome 15 firefox 7 with firebug the ul element seems to have height 0 and the li elements are displayed outside of it

8020938

versioning	upgrade
have you upgrade from a 1.7 versioning of codeigniter to a 2.0 versioning

8021191
content-disposition	content-type
to view the file in the browser instead of having it downloaded you need to set the response content-type to the appropriate mimetype for the file application pdf for pdf files and add a content-disposition header that specifies the file is to be opened inline and the file name for the user

8021206
innodb	myisam
innodb is much much stricter than myisam

8021212
implements	extends
you have to extends defaulttablecellrenderer instead of implements tablecellrenderer

8021213
innodb	myisam
generally innodb is much better for preserving your data integrity so stick with it and do not go back to myisam there is also a matter of what each engine is best fore but unless you give us more details there is no point in dwelling on that

8021220
google-chrome	firefox
this actually crashes my browsers latest stable firefox and google-chrome upon hitting enter

8021242
emacs	sublimetext	emacs	textmate	textmate	sublimetext
that said i flip back-and-forth between intellij textmate sublimetext 2 and emacs

8021282
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
it works prefectly in google-chrome firefox opera and safari

8021282
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox

width	height
you have the a and b from the width and height of the cgpoint minus the width and height of the center

8021395
getter	setter
you do not need to avoid internal getter and setter unless they are causing specific performance problems

8021395
getter	setter
you can usually determine this by using traceview and seeing lots of time spent in the getter and setter

8021395
getter	setter
so for example in a tight loop over a large data set trying to avoid getter and setter is probably worthwhile

8021395
getter	setter
outside of scenarios like that using getter and setter is unlikely to cause any material pain to you or the user

8021396
getelementsbytagname	getelementbyid
causes jquery to use getelementbyid which obviously return a single element whereas will do something like getelementsbytagname and then using loop find only those which has id as names

8021410
config	ini
according to netbeans manual you have to add the xdebug config file to the apache php ini directory and not the local php ini directory to make it work with anykind of wamp

8021452
stdout	fflush
you should usually end not start the outputted string with newline because on stdout a newline may fflush buffers

8021452
stdout	fflush
or you should call fflush stdout

8021477
nunit	mstest
i ve selected mstest as the test runner because i can t be bothered with invoking nunit i d like to use nunit in the long term but at the moment i just want to get some bdd code working

8021477
nunit	mstest
the generated code files however continue to reference nunit - which is obviously wrong since i ve just told specflow to run using mstest

8021477
nunit	mstest
i m not surprised at this one since it s still trying to run nunit tests even though i ve explicitly asked for mstest though obviously it shouldn t nullref and present that to the user

8021496
altera	xilinx
- design partitioning xilinx and altera have some differences

in ini application.ini style config this looks like

8021976
submit	submission
on form submit it goes to a submission page where i do all my updating inside the database

8022003
sorting	filtering
i d like to use mysql for the final retrieval as it would make sorting and final filtering of these results much easier i won t get into the details of why

8022069
post	get
what i want to do is get the post category from the permalink which is formatted as category postname then get an array of all categories remove the current post category from that array then exclude that array from the next and previous post link effectively leaving only the current category as dictated by the permalink

8022069
next	except
for example if the permalink is myurl.com music september-guitar-post i want to exclude all categories except music from the previous and next post links

8022105
arp	snmp
you can also use snmp to examine the routing tables on routers on your network to fetch arp ip maps quite often

8022110
width	height
if you re using weight weightsum parameters in your linearlayout you might want to set your height if linearlayout is vertical or width if linearlayout is horizontal to 0dip instead of fill_parent

8022120
decoder	encoder
the issue is not quite a netty limitation or encoder decoder limitation

8022120
post	put
in this way the example from netty will work for you but as was mention in a previous post you have to put more logic in the business logic handler

8022147
google-chrome	firefox
and in serialize1.php in google-chrome firefox and ie i get

8022158
children	parent
so the parent need to be ordered a - z and the children need to be ordered a-z

8022224
m2e	pom.xml
i have just downloaded eclipse indigo and the m2e plugin and this error shows up in the pom.xml of my project

8022234
hide	show
i m trying to show hide content in the following doctype

8022234
hide	show
if i need to try a different script to show hide at this point i d scrap what i have and do it

8022292
google-chrome	firefox
i tried it in firefox instead of google-chrome and it worked

8022322
submit	submission
i have the submit page and a form action to a page that queries the submission info into my database

8022339
post	get
sending that data using a get works just fine but when any of my forms send the data using post i get the following error message in chrome no data received

8022343
g++	gcc
i believe that recent gcc ie g++ 4.6 made a lot of efforts on language standard conformance

8022369
packets	multicast
some routers filter out multicast packets and unfortunately if you don t control the network there s not an awful lot you can do about it

8022399
int	boolean
i am used to the word primitive being used for basic data types boolean int float etc

8022401
ubuntu	linux
i use ubuntu linux

8022409
google-chrome	firefox
if you use google-chrome or firefox for regular browsing you can get an extension for visual studio 2010 using nuget

8022461
rubygems	bundler
3 the compromising solution i haven t tested this personally but i hear that rails 2.3 with bundler is compatible with the latest rubygems

8022506
folder	directory
i have those folder folder1 and folder2 and all of the mp3 files in the android data com.example.android.app files directory on the sd card

8022521
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
don t use blobbuilder in google-chrome tested in osx google-chrome firefox 12 safari 6 ios google-chrome ios safari

8022534
mouseup	mousedown
furthermore before you send the mousedown and mouseup events to via sendinput you have to move the mouse to the control you want to click on

8022546
portrait	landscape
i decided to redo the homescreen for my application so the first thing i did was to remove the specific landscape portrait layouts and to use a simpler one

8022546
listview	gridview
i also changed a gridview to a listview i changed their id s too

8022554
thin	unicorn
i m running unicorn which is about 40 faster than thin on celadon cedar

8022569
lxml	elementtree	lxml	libxml2
if you re concerned about speed there s also lxml which builds an elementtree-compatible dom using libxml2 and should be quite fast â they have a benchmark suite comparing themselves to elementtree s python and c implementations available

8022570
jobs	cron
of course this code can be modified into a bash script if you prefer not to have a java class running in your cron jobs - but i ll leave that to someone more experienced with bash

8022592
division	multiplication
multiplication and division of large numbers is extremely quick so thats not a problem

8022631
unsigned	short
unsigned short

8022633
int	chars
it does pointer comparisons because string literals decay to pointers and chars are promoted to int

8022656
pull	push
its not that i had found the quirks of scala xml to be bad but the approach itself didn t sit with me well and prompted the question what if you separated the content from the tree and unified push and pull

8022683
int	chars
but when you re extracting formatted data into a type like int the parser attempts to pull as many chars out of the stream as it can to form the number

8022694
postgresql	mysql
regarding performance the apache guys say derby is perfectlly good for production matching and sometimes even surpassing mysql and postgresql in certain scenarios as you can see in this apache document

8022695
onkeyup	onblur
is there a way to disable the jquery validation for a certain validator creditcard so that it only occurs onblur instead of onkeyup

8022698
int	chars
in the int case multiple chars can be read while parsing an int because an int may be represent by multiple digits

8022714
passenger	unicorn
i m trying to decide between unicorn and phusion passenger standalone formerly phusion passenger lite

8022714
passenger	unicorn
i have read a lot about unicorn and it fits my model well but i see passenger standalone can essentially do the same thing

8022734
post	get
if you can post you code and possible callers that could help get to the bottom of the problem

8022743
multiplication	modulo
you should calculate the modulo after each squaring multiplication so the intermediate results should never be more than twice the digits as in your value for m

8022749
ready	each
i have more images ready to multilayer and stuff but i can t seem to get the darn thing to override the background for each li entry since the main thing is coded on the ol itself

8022752
viewdidload	viewwillappear
i know because it is a tabbar so neither viewdidload nor viewwillappear is called on click of that tab

8022764
fadein	fadeout
i have done an accordion style jquery function which works lovely but would like to add to it fadeout and fadein here is the part of the code

8022764
slideup	slidedown
im wanting to it fadeout then slideup and then again fadeout on slidedown

8022776
persistent	transient
like matt said in his comment to your question since those fields are marked as transient they are not persistent to the database and thus there s no way for you to query them

8022816
stdout	stderr
in either case the error message goes to stderr rather than stdout

8022850
ubuntu	linux
i have recently installed ruby 1.9.2 on linux ubuntu 10.04 running 0.7.65 when i run gem server the server starts but is not viewable on the 8808 port of the domain

8022892
multiplying	add
then just use direction and multiplying it by the time between frames and add this to the bullet position

8022966
width	height
i want an image with height and width 48px so if the image is different from that size i just resize the image to that size

8022977
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
however this code is clearly not doing anything because if anyone not just the user with account_id 3 goes to www.mysite.com uploads 3 2 my_video.m4v they can still access this video it is downloaded by firefox safari and played by natively by google-chrome

8023011
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
i m using the uitabbarcontroller to control the views and just want the uinavigationcontroller so i can show the title in it as well as show a save button

8023034
spaces	delimiter
if that s not feasible although it s probably the better option replacing all single quotes with single quote escape sequences then placing single quotes around each of the arguments split the string with a spaces as the delimiter could provide a similar effect

8023036
min	max
the second is fast fourier transform - this is useful for lines which are like waves in that they stay between a min and a max bound and have some regular cycle or a number of regular cycles which is what the equation will divine

8023041
width	height
what happens is the iframe width and height is not fixed values so they can be any other numbers

8023041
width	height
how can i make this works for any width height

8023049
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
the natural thing to do would be to have a uitabbarcontroller load first and have each uiviewcontroller it loads upon tab selection be an instance of uinavigationcontroller

8023052
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
basically you add uinavigationcontroller to the uitabbarcontroller

8023052
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
each uinavigationcontroller is initialized with the desired uiviewcontroller as its rootviewcontroller

8023071
post	get
gather information like url parameters and request type post get from that ajax request

8023094
post	get
hi how can i get the variables in a http post with wtforms when the post is done with a blobstoreuploadhandler and preferably also with i18n localized messages for validation

8023123
onresume	onpause
it would probably be much easier to register your receiver in code in your activity s onresume method and unregiser in onpause

8023144
ssl	https
according to this page all i really need to do to enable my service for connections via ssl is to update the axis2.xml file and include a new transportreceiver node for https

8023226
pull	push
once that is setup i start the process of pull ing and push ing to it - you talk about your ide here and there are a lot of git ide options but i just use the command line - i just find it faster

8023258
multiplying	addition
if you re testing a multiplying in one implementation and an addition in another method your matrix could look like this

8023279
google-chrome	firefox
if you run the code in firefox or google-chrome press f12 and watch the height of the body tag and of the first div after the body you will see that none have dynamically changed their height to include the inner content

8023301
concave	convex
however since my need is now to effectively compute a concave contour i m lost wikipedia does list a lot of resources for convex calculation but none for -concave-

8023322
curlpp	libcurl
edit2 couldn t you also use curlpp as a c++ wrapper for libcurl

8023339
inotifycollectionchanged	inotifypropertychanged
observablecollection however implements inotifycollectionchanged and inotifypropertychanged interfaces

8023350
wmv	asf
i have a filter graph that takes raw audio and video input and then uses the asf writer to encode them to a wmv file

8023358
onfocus	onblur
you could set the defaults to off in the onfocus event of the credit field then turn them in the onblur

8023378
outputstream	inputstream
are writers and readers faster than outputstream and inputstream

8023390
ubuntu	linux
i installed the eclipse platform using the software installer included with linux ubuntu lucid lynx

8023414
integer	unsigned
i m trying to convert a 128-bit unsigned integer stored as an array of 4 unsigned ints to the decimal string representation in c

8023414
hex	binary	octal	hex	octal	binary
if i was going to hex binary or octal this would be a simple matter of masks and bit shifts to peel of the least significant characters

8023451
int	chars
the method should take a chars array and and int pointer which is the size of the array

8023459
hide	show
i have a small uiview that i hide show in to show a message to the user

8023463
int	chars
the second code prints the int value of every chars read from the reader

8023470
comparator	comparable
the language you are using will determine how to define this ordering in c++ operator is used in standard containers in java the interface comparable and function comparator are typically used

8023473
addition	multiplication
you need to implement multiplication by a power of two and addition

8023473
multiplying	add
multiplying them by 2 32 3 2 32 2 2 32 1 and 2 32 0 respectively then add them together

8023477
uitableview	nsindexpath
- uitableviewcell tableview uitableview tableview cellforrowatindexpath nsindexpath indexpath

8023488
int	chars
you might use the string.split method to split the line at every space chars and the integer.parseint method to transform the third token into an int

8023505
width	height
you should be able to call the constructor of that with the same width height and textureoptions parameters - or any of the other variants of your liking

8023508
rsa	dsa
the openssl library also supports other key types besides rsa such as dsa see openssl pkey module .

8023511
memcpy	strcpy
check strcpy or memcpy

8023534
implements	extends
i have created a custom camera preview view cameraview which extends surfaceview and it also implements surfaceholder.callback interface

8023534
onresume	onpause
the activity that holds the cameraview releases and reopens the camera in onpause and onresume methods

8023534
pop-up	dialog
the interesting part starts if there are multiple activities that can handle this intent and the intent chooser dialog pop-up

8023550
emacs	aquamacs
i really want to run gdb from within emacs but x-forwarding emacs has too much latency so i run aquamacs locally on my mac

8023552
onresume	onpause
from the standpoint of that activity any time after onpause until possibly a corresponding onresume the process may be terminated and the activity be lost

8023589
put	get
your best bet is to save things in whatever manner makes sense if you really need them between places where someone might logically put the device to sleep or rotate it or get a phone call or anything else that interrupts its top ness

8023589
serializable	deserialization
there s a little more work up-front and of course slightly more overhead in the serializable deserialization but since it s only happening on the rare instance that my variables are destroyed it s really not anything to worry about unless you have some massive amounts of data in which case you should be using a database anyway

8023606
equals	gethashcode
2 you don t override gethashcode to be consistent with equals or it s just not shown in your code excerpt

8023625
uilabel	uitextview
try changing it to a uilabel and see if the problem is specific to the uitextview

8023625
uilabel	uitextview
if you absolutely need a uitextview let me know in a comment but i have a suspicion that a uilabel is what you re after

8023633
width	height
i know i can call the method setresizible boolean and that disables or enables the user from resizing the jdialog but is there a way to restrict the user from changing the height of the window but allowing him to change the width

8023661
free	malloc
also should i use free after malloc sizeof struct point

8023671
division	modulo
use the remainder operator also known as the modulo which returns the remainder of the division and check if it is zero

8023672
free	malloc
and yes if you malloc a struct then you should free it when you re done with it

8023675
for-loop	arrays
you re trying to mutate the arrays with replaceobjectatindex while enumerating it the for-loop at the beginning of your code

8023699
int	chars
how would i format an int between 0 and 99 to a string which is 2 chars

8023703
width	height
and the generated result is the next where the generated has a width and height of 300px but is far away from using all the space

8023714
int	chars
you could convert your int to a string or a chars array and simply insert a comma every three digits working from strin.lenght -1 backwards then set the text atribute of the view using this string

8023740
getter	setter
if you really don t want to use any xml files then you should probably adapt the touchlistview class and add the necessary getter and setter

8023783
textview	imageview
i m not sure if it s the best approach but i would try to return a layout which is an indirect subclass of view that encapsulates both the imageview containing the image and a textview with the overlaying text

8024009
for-loop	loops
programmers often refer to it as the for-loop because of the way in which it repeatedly loops until a particular condition is satisfied

8024012
for-loop	loops
the only difference is that with your for-loop the variable i exists only within the scope of loops

8024012
for-loop	loops
every for-loop can be transformed into a while loops using this same pattern

2 a for...in loop which returns all the enumerable properties of an object regardless of whether they are own properties or inherited from the prototype chain

8024149
inherited	properties
we also have such methods as hasownproperty prop lets us check if a properties is inherited or actually belongs to that object and propertyisenumerable prop which as the name suggests lets us check if a properties is enumerable

8024149
inherited	properties
in other words can i somehow get a list of the inherited non-enumerable properties

8024152
implements	extends
note that it s and not in a class extends implements containeraware

8024292
equals	tostring
gerhashcode equals tostring ...

8024295
hide	show
from the user perspective it should work similarly to google search and intellisense it should come up with a number of ranked choices and also come up with an intelligent way to cut that list off at the right point if nothing really matches the query then suggest nothing rather than show the best of the worst fits and also if the first few results have a strong rank but subsequent ones have a much weaker one relatively to the top results then perhaps hide the weak ones

8024325
rss	feed
also i have to answer this question - what are the standards and format of rss feed

8024334

8024480
integer	unsigned
i would like an algorithm or pair of algorithms that works for both signed and unsigned integers and does not rely on casting the values to a larger integer size

8024480
integer	unsigned
computing abs a - b as a signed value and then casting to an unsigned value doesn t work because signed integer overflow is typically an undefined operation at least in c.

8024492

i django recommends against accessing post get data in middleware i m not really sure why so.

8024518
spannable	charsequence
if it s just basic text styling you could probably build a spannable and set the completion hint with the result since it accepts a charsequence

8024519

if these don t reveal where the problem is you may need to save the output of error stderr and output stdout

8024534
lxml	html5lib
more sophisticated alternatives include html5lib and lxml

8024536
subtraction	modulo
further the unsigned-integer subtraction operation is congruent to actual subtraction modulo uint_max so combining these facts we know that unsigned a - unsigned b is congruent to the actual value of a - b modulo uint_max

8024579
stdout	stderr
this is really problematic for non-interactive command-line programs that are merely trying to run a program and capture the exit code and stdout stderr output

8024592
post	get
everything works fine if i use a get request but it doesn t work with post

8024592
post	get
for some odd reason the php script is actually receiving a get request instead of post

8024767
post	get
i believe those would change the request type from a post to a get

8024767

it needed get requests but the default for httpservice was post

8024767
post	get
i was able to get around this by specifying a http header to get instead of post

you would then bind the itemssource property of a listview to your property and declare your gridview inside the listview.view property

8024798
std	ostream
.. symboltable symboltable.h in function â std ostream operator std ostream const compaler symboltable â

8024803
superclass	subclassing
the first case is essentially defining an entirely new class though it may be a subclassing of a relatively generic class while the second is defining a new subclassing of some superclass which largely describes its external behavior

8024803
getter	setter
c++ has ordinary structures as well as classes though technically the difference is only whether the members default to public vs private and some things eg parameter lists or simple internal structures are probably better left as simple structs without making all data members private and requiring setter and getter etc

8024840
free	malloc
3 it s the type of raw memory pointers the result type of std malloc and operator new the argument type of std free and operator delete and of placement-new

8024848

8024863
udp	tcp
tcp is faster for when using a few connections the important difference is that modern nics perform significant amounts of acceleration on tcp and not really that much for udp

8024884
maven	pom.xml

8024889
strtol	atoi
i would like to see how are those functions are implemented such as atoi strtol etc

8024914
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
try that in firefox google-chrome safari to see how it should look and check in ie8 9 youll understand the issue

8024943
std	ostream
however an alternative i often prefer is to make a public print function which prints the object to an std ostream and then let operator call that function

8024974
cgpoint	cgrect
a general cgpoint or cgrect has no concept of how it is being used

8024974
uiview	subviews
on the flip side there s nothing inherent in a uiview that would do anything to spit out anything visual unless it draws or adds subviews which of course is implemented by you

in google-chrome opera and safari it works however in firefox it calls the page into the content frame then doesn t run my function on the iframe

8025134
width	height
when i load the page into a frame its height and width are just whatever stock iframe height width the browser uses

8025492
getelementsbytagname	getelementbyid
what you need is getelementsbytagname not getelementbyid

8025498
put	get
put the filemtime call inside that loop to get each file s mtime and do the comparisons in there

8025498
int	boolean
your code is not working as you ve not assigned a value to at the point you do the initial filemtime call so that returns a boolean false for failure which gets converted to an int 0 for the date formatting

8025504
width	height
this is even with height width defined in the css

8025512
folder	directory

that s surprising since should be available on all unix-like posix systems not just linux -- and comments in the source indicate that it s been used on sunos 4.1.1 and several other unix systems

8025633
width	height
edit also it d be a better idea to check if the x and y were greater than or equal to the width height and less than or equal to 0 for 2 reasons

8025643
getter	setter
so i ve been around android for about two years now and around 6 with java something that i liked from the very start that i discover them where the java convetion this guide that help me wrote more understandable code you know the typical calmelcase upper for class lower for method or the getter and setter of javabean etc

8025643

as long as all of the radio buttons and submit button are part of the same form you don t need to worry about submission multiple forms because there won t be any

8025771
uiview	subviews
i have one uiview with slider and segment control as a subviews

8025796
post	get
basically i can get the model-binding to work if i simulate a post in fiddler with the following data serializing it also of course

8025845
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller
to add it to a navigationbar you need to then push the navigationitem onto it similar to how you add a new uiviewcontroller to a uinavigationcontroller

8025847
for-loop	loops
instead of a while loops i used a for-loop with xrange

8025899
ubuntu	debian
the good news is that ubuntu by way of debian has specific tools for this for example

8025958
division	multiplication	division	modulo	multiplication	modulo
supposing you have a fast 32-bit multiplication and division the result can be computed 4 digits at a time by implementing a bigint division modulo 10000 and then using s printf for output of digit groups

8025959
verilog	vhdl
there are hardware description languages out there verilog or vhdl where a couple of simulators exist vcs from synopsys or verilator if you want a free one

you could counter-rotate your subviews when you handle the gesture for rotating the uiview

8025998
width	height
something in your code is wrong try giving to pivot width and height and it wont work in any browser

8026007
backtracking	greedy
for an exact solution you can use backtracking check all possibilities and choose the best but it will take a lot of time or you can sattle for a heuristic solution such as greedy but it will not be optimized

8026042
installation	upgrade
so i recommend you to upgrade your installation if this is possible

8026056
int	boolean
since i don t know which database you re using you may need to consult the documentation to see how to cast from a boolean value to an int

8026175
padrino	ruby-on-rails
i built it for all my restful api needs in sinatra padrino and ruby-on-rails

8026190

8026323
filesystems	btrfs
modern filesystems like btrfs and zfs also support block sub allocation

8026335
qapplication	qcoreapplication
qapplication is derived from qcoreapplication and thereby inherits quit which is a public slot of qcoreapplication so there is no difference between qapplication quit and qcoreapplication quit

8026354
inherited	properties
it gives you control over how the image is drawn and is actually a uiview properties so uiimageview inherited it

8026374
rss	feed
i have a yahoo pipe which gets lots of feed inputs atom and rss

8026446
clang	llvm
llvm clang is a possibility or extending gcc thru plugins or even better with extensions coded in melt

8026506
jobs	cron
i have python-scripts set as cron jobs and they do the job almost fine

8026524

ssl	https
it loads the module but it continues to load io socket ssl and use it for the https requests

8026530
gif	png
i am trying to recognize if this is an image url or not ending with jpeg jpg gif png etc.

8026540
maven	pom.xml
yes maven reads the parent pom.xml from your local repository or proxies like nexus and creates an effective pom.xml by merging the information from parent and module pom.xml

8026564
strstr	substr	strlen	strstr	strlen	substr
all byte functions eg strlen strstr strpos and substr work like the corresponding character functions eg mb_strlen mb_strstr mb_strpos and mb_substr

8026570
children	parent
the toplaintextstring method includes the text content of the tag s children so all the parent tags of the tag containing are going to contain too

8026580
super	abstract	super	implements
is being implements by the abstract class super there should be necessary for the abstract class super to implements that method showsum

8026580

it works fine with mozilla and opera but fails with webkit browsers like google-chrome and safari

8026635
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	google-chrome	safari
as a workaround i tried to use a snapshot instead of an iterator with the dom level 3 xpath api that approach works fine for me with all four major desktop browser supporting document.evaluate mozilla opera safari google-chrome

8026662
for-loop	arrays
instead of using a for-loop to copy an arrays you can simply copy a vector using the assignment operator

8026686
google-chrome	safari
previously the only way to do this was to use a safari google-chrome extension written by simon whitaker

8026694
integer	unsigned
6.2.5c9 says a computation involving unsigned operands can never overflow because a result that cannot be represented by the resulting unsigned integer type is reduced modulo the number that is one greater than the largest value that can be represented by the resulting type

8026700
rank	max
since there may be several entries with max rank i don t think you can get the entry_date from an aggregation query like this

8026701
equals	tostring
instead of equals etlandsize.gettext .tostring since using to avoid comparisson with null is not usefull here - tostring cannot return null

8026712
width	height
in a wpf application i get the image size width and height before really loading it as i am loading it with reduced size... and i am using this c# code to get it

8026717
memcached	apc
but you could use memcached apc and more advanced caching techniques if you are up to it

8026731
g++	gcc
did you try to compile with g++ -wall if using gcc

8026738
hash	salt
if you are not going to use any frameworks or libraries you just have to implement it manually use some kind of storage for credentials generate forms check passwords preferrably using salt hash create and store session identifiers in cookies and so on

8026738
apache	nginx
but maybe if it s not intended to be a public application you can go with just basic http auth implemented in apache nginx or any other web server you are using to launch your wsgi app

8026740
post	get
you can also use documentation here to retrieve all the values passed in the request by get post and cookie

8026786
oncreate	setcontentview
put the above code in oncreate of your activity after you do setcontentview

8026801

versioning	upgrade
the user will be able to upload a new versioning and upgrade to it and even do a downgrade if the new versioning starts to fail

8026804
ncover	testdriven.net
most of the runners you mention will run in x86 mode by default you ve had to find specific instances where you can tell certain runners like testdriven.net to use x64 to run on your machine but now you re hitting the same problem with ncover or coverage

8026804
ncrunch	dotcover
this is how we have it set up on several projects on win7x64 dev machines with ncrunch r# dotcover all behaving fine

8026805
width	font-size
in essence it seems that the width measure of a block of text should be around 50-60 characters the line-height set at 1.5 without a unit which will be 1.5 times the font-size regardless of the units used to set the font-size

8026808
ubuntu	linux	vmware	virtualbox

i see the relationship between collaboration frameworks and rss feed as follow collaboration frameworks provide support to rss feed as a way to communicate export updates of something or to import communication from other systems

8026854
rss	feed
here is a list of three academic papers somehow related to collaboration frameworks or the use of rss feed to create systems

8026869
maven	m2e
when m2e first appeared it depended on unreleased maven features to work right with maven 3

8026900
margin	height
i assume margintop can t be solved since im setting margin top to -820 in order to get at a point of top 275 therefore screens smaller than 1200px height the div will go much higher...

use single-table inherited there your models are subclassing from a common base class and this is realized on the database by only one table that contains all columns for all model classes

8026976
awt	swing
also don t mix awt components such as component with swing components unless absolutely necessary -- which isn t the case with your program

8026980
put	get
for anything where i just need a char equivalent holding data read from a database where locales encodings are not applicable i use std strings as they re a lot easier to use with non-qt libraries and your data doesn t get put through any encoding conversions

jaxp	stax
it provides full trax support and under the normal sun jaxp impl not all other providers allow this allows conversions using stax

division	multiplication
it will probably turn that division operation into a multiplication by a precomputed reciprocal value too

8027768

google-chrome	safari
i can t quite remember its compatibility table but it definitely works in google-chrome safari and ie8 9

8028010
udp	tcp
by removing the headers generate by the layers below the application layer tcp udp ip ... you will have access to the rtsp stream

8028010

8028618
post	get
the post by cronoklee works good too u might want to combine the two methods to get exactly what you want

8028623
int	double
imagine a function myfunctiona with the parameter double and int

8028648
ggplot2	lattice
for example both lattice and ggplot2 export a layer function

8028648
ggplot2	lattice
thus if you first import lattice and then ggplot2 it means that ggplot2 layer will mask lattice layer

8028664
serializable	deserialization
i m not talking about serializable to get the json representation of an existing c# object instance or anything to do with deserialization

8028671

8028864
google-chrome	firefox
originally i was targeting google-chrome as my ideal browser for this app i might just switch over to firefox

8028888
ienumerable	iqueryable
you better use ienumerable interface instead of iqueryable when you are doing operations in memory

8028962
width	height
at height and width delete the single quotes and just write the integer since it isn t a string

8028994

apk	dex
if none of the above solution work you should check the read only property of the project folder if it is read-only the compiler will not be able to overwrite the resources r.java and other dex apk etc files and hence this will occur.

8029180
put	get
this means that if you try joining that process you may get a deadlock unless you are sure that all items which have been put on the queue have been consumed

8029180
children	parent
similarly if the child process is non-daemonic then the parent process may hang on exit when it tries to join all its non-daemonic children

8029230
avassetwriter	avassetreader
there is a keynote presentation where avassetreader and avassetwriter are looked in to titled advanced media manipulation with av foundation

8029237

codeigniter	cakephp
suddenly i came across codeigniter in one of the yahoo answers recommendation and came to know about it as an alternative to cakephp but i m still very inexperienced in mvc programming techniques to be able to take a decision and this is why i came here to ask the experts

8029506

8029584
calloc	malloc
why do malloc behave like this even though there is calloc

8029607
children	parent
so it makes easier to change the type of panel mantaining logics as zoom pan drag children implemented in parent contentcontrol

8029624
calloc	malloc	memset	malloc	memset	calloc
mentions in the comments this zeroing is why you should always use calloc instead of malloc + memset

8029624
memset	calloc
calloc can take advantage of this fact to avoid a separate memset

8029628
free	malloc
to see shich is the case write a different value to the memory free it and call malloc again

8029651
free	malloc
if you call free the glibc allocator will return the region to its free lists and when malloc is called again you might get that same region but dirty with the previous data

8029653
mouseover	mouseout
the only other thing that comes to mind is that mouseover and mouseout bubble to parent elements which can be confusing if you re not careful

8029653
mouseover	mouseout
...and you watch for mouseover and mouseout on the div you ll see mouseout when the mouse moves from the span bar into the div foo which can be surprising if you re not expecting it

8029665
comparator	comparable
alternatively define a comparator in your class and have the class it implement comparable if you always need to sort the same way and skip the comparator

8029748
post	put
is it possible to user this with post or put and how

8029749
prng	random
obviously there are issues around the repeatability of random tests so use a prng and log the seed

8029768
vb.net	vb6
if you have never learned old win32 with vb aka vb6 i would advise you to skip it altogether and learn vb.net unless your end goal is to maintain legacy applications

8029785
vb.net	vb6
vb6 is unsupported products for it are unsupported and there isn t much you can gain by learning it instead of learning something else like vb.net

8029859
cvs	svn
is it possible to download that svn repository using my existing version control like cvs

8029859
cvs	svn
or download a cvs repository with svn

8029875
folder	directory
you are passing a relative path to fopen so it may be opening a file in another folder you are not expecting as the calling process s working directory can change dynamically

8029894
cvs	svn
there are no connectors between svn and cvs that i know about

8029912

8029923
google-chrome	firefox
but in firefox and google-chrome it is showing in the tab data in the same window

8029929
yacc	bison
think that many parser generators like antlr or yacc or bison are build on a similar idea

8029941
actualheight	actualwidth
you will need to refer to actualwidth and actualheight in you code behind to get the rendered size of the container

8029946
put	get
so far i have and i know that i m going to have to put how to get the balance in the if statment

8029955

either use a datagrid or a listview with gridview do not use a grid and what is this table you speak of

8030015
nowjs	node.js
node.js and socket.io or nowjs on the backend

8030041
int	double
in the code you are comparing a double to an int

8030041

therefore you have to use fromintegral or frominteger to convert an int to a double

8030043
uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
an uitabbarcontroller or an uinavigationcontroller will call the viewdidload by default lazy right before the user sees it

8030055
width	height
the right image doesn t look like a square the width is larger than the height

8030060
hide	show
is it possible to prevent web browsers from displaying the text selector the | which alternatively show and hide when an input is focused

8030062
width	height	portrait	landscape
of course if you are dealing with both portrait and landscape images it would be slightly more complicated but the general idea is you set either height or width then use the bitmap s scale properties to adjust the other dimension

8030066
post	get
if you want to compare the two different variants given in your post it probably won t matter that much nowhere near the same gains you get in c or co if you order your arrays correctly

8030075
switching	screens
it works but when the switching occurs between the default.png and the uiimageview default.png on the view the uiimageview show up slightly down in comparison with the default.png which is the splash screens image

8030085

the uploads work fine in firefox and google-chrome

8030281
post	get
the url you are using is afaik from the google safebrowsing api v 1 which used to support get requests and is now deprecated and will be taken offline by december 1st - i strongly recommend switching to v2 of the api which from what i gather only supports requests via post

8030282
put	get
i am able to put just the username into the spinner with the commented out code above but then get no return values

8030297
post	get
so this is what i get - thanks to this stack overflow post for a pointer on capturing standard error - and the rubygems source for the idea on aliasing the original kernel#require

8030381
swt	swing
i read so link and incorporated swt with swing into my code

8030383
postgresql	mysql
so unless you want some models that aren t searchable using sphinx on sqlite and the rest in mysql or postgresql - and that is more of a headache than it s worth - then you should just use either mysql or postgresql for your rails application and not use sqlite at all

8030386
post	get
imo changing request.path is more bad if it can be called bad compared to accessing get post parameters so just pass token as get parameter and login based on token and do not redirect or do request.path modifications

8030405
post	get
if i get you right you want to pass a variable from one php-file to another via post

8030417

i got a spinner element which i populate with data from a cursor using a simplecursoradapter

8030441
getter	setter

now i want to abstract out the functionality and put the code into an associative array per the previous post as well..however their seemed to be some contention as to whether this is best practice

8042970
superclass	subclassing
superclass and subclassing form a strict hierarchy while interfaces can be attached wherever you need them

8042975
mouseover	mouseout
the problem originaly is not mouseout or mouseover events

8042975
mouseover	mouseout
it s better to not use mouseout or mouseover event and use jquery .hover if you are using the plug in .hoverintent for more clean and readable code

8042980
viewdidload	viewdidappear
it appears that a side-effect of this problem is that none of the view management methods on cameracontroller are ever called like viewdidload viewdidappear etc

8042994
min	max
- min 5 char and max 30 characters

8043023

gwt s requestfactory requires that i implement a getversion method in all my entity objects

8043054
spine.js	backbone.js
i am not sure if any of the up and coming javascript libraries backbone.js spine.js interact with local storage

8043060
hide	show
show and hide aren t defined so you are passing in an undefined variable

8043114
width	height
the container has a fixed width and 3 different types of boxes 3 widths and a fixed height

8043125
sortedlist	sorteddictionary
so sortedlist sorteddictionary are not what i m looking for.

8043359
int	chars
i want to have chars and int inside one array

8043359
int	chars
i assume i cant pass chars into an array that is called as so is there a way to have both int and chars in an array

8043369
equals	gethashcode
i m a little confused about the default behaviour of equals and gethashcode in c#

8043369
equals	gethashcode
do i need to override equals and gethashcode to reference the base implementation as i have done here or is that the default behaviour

8043399
prepare	execute
prepare statements are slightly faster when execute repeatedly because the mysql server has to parse the sql and run the query planner optimizer only once

8043401
equals	gethashcode
you don t need to explicitly override equals and gethashcode unless you want to change their behavior

8043407
int	chars
in c++ int s and chars s are almost the same thing

8043408
folder	directory
here s a basic python script that will combine all css files in a directory and replace references to your images folder

8043425
int	chars
when the user inserts a chars at a specified index you want to update an array of chars instead of inserting the value in your int array

8043442
google-chrome	safari
it works for google-chrome v16 and safari v5 except

8043446
button	checkbox
the title of your question says radio button but your question asks about checkbox

8043447
int	chars
as others have mentioned chars will be promoted to int when you assign elements of the array with chars values

8043447
int	chars
since you would need to keep track of which elements hold int and which hold chars -- this is not an attractive solution

8043467
post	get
when i use the graph api to fetch the likes for the post eg post_id likes i get a data field with 5 entries in it and no count field

8043474

8043601
google-chrome	firefox
for google-chrome and firefox this script works perfect when it comes to the horrible ie

8043601
google-chrome	firefox
i m tried some debugging and found out that the parent of google-chrome and firefox is which is correct but the parent of ie is

8043630
children	parent
it should be specified on the parent in order to affect the children in your case searchlistviewmodel

8043681
post	get
i am wondering which one is the best practice to get the form post data when updating the database from controller or from model

8043681
post	get
if we get the post data in the controller then we need to pass the data as arguments to the model function but the model function can be used in other forms

8043681
post	get
if we get the post data directly in the model then we can eliminate the argument passing step but it s limited to some specific forms

8043701
put	get
but as it seems every time i put this into one of my groovy classes i get the following error

8043744
children	parent
sure just iterate through the children of your parent view self.view and remove any that are zeldaview elements

8043760
typedef	struct
my advice drop the typedef and just use a struct tag as you already do for struct internalstruct and don t try to create a special name for the array type

8043771
libevent	epoll
if we want mainly an epoll based loop over file-descriptors what else features does the libevent offer not interested in http or dns stuff

8043779
accelerometer	gyroscope
currently i am trying to combine accelerometer and gyroscope on android phone to calculate the orientation how much angle each axis rotates of the phone

viewdidload	dealloc
create the mutable array in viewdidload and release it in viewdidunload and dealloc

8043792
decoder	encoder
if you want to implement a decoder encoder or some audio video-effect then you can create a dmo maybe in c# but c++ would be better

8043818
unix	bsd
low-level functions in the c unix mach bsd layer are generally available for use in ios apps although these apis typically aren t described in the sdk documentation

8043820
iboutlet	ibaction
this controller will have to support the defualt xib iboutlet and ibaction

running a quick benchmark on my netbook inserting 1 000 000 bindings into a dictionary shows that the mutable sorteddictionary takes 5.2s and immutable map takes 11.8s so there is a significant but not huge difference

8043896
udp	tcp
for tcp and udp protocol there is no such thing as wchar_t

8043929
for-loop	arrays
using the variable i as an index which you already have set up in the for-loop you can access the arrays s values one by one and compare with number1

8043948
next	except
each exponent governs a range which is half the size of the next greater exponent except for the denormalized case which is the same size as the smallest normal exponent region

i ve searched online to see if elmah can send daily emails and from the reading i ve done the developers say to use the rss feed instead of emails

8043993
width	height
you can set height and width to fill_parent and then use setscaletype

8044000
postgresql	mysql
but type tables for instances where users need to be able to add modify delete various values or if i know that i m going to have a data warehouse of some sort type tables are better quicker due to foreign keys with your run of the mill storage systems mysql postgresql etc

8044052
width	height
i d like to get the aspect ratio based on the width and height of the image being specified in a form i m letting users enter these values in

8044069
post	get
for the difference between get vs post please see this article

8044070
width	height
if you can get one of height width then you can calculate the missing width height

8044070
width	height
original width new height original height new width

8044070
width	height
original height new width original width new height

8044070
width	height
original width original height ratio

8044132
post	get
the only two methods for sending values are get querystring or post

8044150
ssl	https
https uses ssl to encrypt communication between the server and the client

8044153
google-chrome	firefox
you can view this for example when you open firebug in firefox or console in google-chrome and view headers

8044158
stdout	stderr
it will print a lot of debugging to stdout or stderr and you will be able to

8044207
firefox	safari
safari did not mind but firefox did not like it because linefeeds and carriage returns are not valid json so that could well be your problem

8044210
post	get
i actually like that having got the gold flag weight badge i m able to flag the problem post that are less obvious - the ones that 9 times out of 10 get marked as helpful but occasionally get disputed

8044222
min	max
i d like to find its local min and max points

8044222
min	max
is there any built in support in .net linq c# f# to get local min max values of an array list

8044222
min	max
check my sample chart and the blue points on it it is not just a simple getting min max values from an array

8044249

8044320
move	drag
i have a screen that the user can drag move different things around on

8044338
google-chrome	firefox
here s a simple example of this showing that google-chrome does the former while firefox does the latter

8044338
google-chrome	safari
edit here s the webkit bug describing google-chrome safari s incorrect handling of this test case

8044347
sequence	permutation
the c++ algorithm next_permutation performs an in-place rearrangement of a sequence into its next permutation or returns false when no further permutation exist

8044370
maven	pom.xml
i am relatively new to this and still bit puzzled how the maven dependencies in pom.xml and the grails dependencies in buildconfig.groovy hang together

8044370
springsource	grails
in sts springsource tool suite it seems to list the different the grails dependencies

8044379
uiview	calayer
it seems to me that the first time i run an animation animating the frame of a uiview or the position of a calayer etc it is quite choppy and subsequent animations are smooth

8044391
webclient	httpwebrequest
you have two options httpwebrequest and webclient

8044419
width	height
to get the aspect ratio just simplify the width and height like a fraction for example

8044420
integer	unsigned
could an unsigned 32-bit integer be used as an index would allow 4 294 967 296 indexes which could be used to identify how to sort the original array

8044444
oncreate	ondestroy
when this happens it appears that ondestroy oncreate and onstartcommand are not being called

8044481
width	height
if you want to be concise calculate the greatest common divisor of the width and height and divide both of them by that

8044482
setinterval	settimeout
this is a technique to replace settimeout and setinterval functions globally in a cross-browser fashion

8044498
qicon	qfilesystemmodel
if it does then i am right and only thing you can do is to subclass qfilesystemmodel and change qicon returned from data method - but this is quite crude and non-flexible solution

8044518
width	height
now this form will not allow the user to set its width or height below 400

8044536
width	height
i tried using negative margin-top instead of top but that as i suspected defaults to using the width of the element to determine the height offset which does not achieve your effect

8044536
width	height
by giving .bkg a width and height of 100 that set s its size which apparent is enough to correctly then calculate the correct 50 offsets to reposition it down and to the left which is the same relationship you wanted for your original look

8044563
google-chrome	firefox
this works in google-chrome and firefox current versions but apparently not ie7 or ie9

8044568
cufft	fftw
i am trying to write fortran 2003 bindings to cufft library using iso_c_bindings module but i have problems with cufftplanmany subroutine similar to sfftw_plan_many_dft in fftw library

8044596
prng	random
it then likely uses its last result as an input to the next value so by seeding the prng with a known value you will always produce a known sequence of random numbers

8044623
jboss	glassfish
may be the java part can be implement and work on java server glassfish jboss

8044656
mouseleave	mouseenter
try using mouseenter and mouseleave instead

8044656
mouseover	mouseenter
here s the relevant piece of documentation about mouseenter vs mouseover

8044656
mouseover	mouseenter
the mouseenter event differs from mouseover in the way it handles

8044683
margin	height
the height of this grey margin i wasn t expecting looks to be about the height of the top signal strength bar

8044706
post	get
passing data using get post should not be sent in plain text like

8044719
width	height
drop a line down from the top right of 1 0 you end up with another right angled triangle and a triangle composed of three right angled triangles height is your original triangle height width is 1.5 triangle length hypotenuse i leave for an exercise for the class

8044719
width	height
another option is to work out the parallelogram calc it s centre move that to the origin rotatee 30 degrees clockwise move back precalc the transform you have a diamond with a width of the above hypotenuse which side of the middle is which triangle height of the diamond is triangle length you ll still need to work or the parallegram as 1.0 and 2 0 will overlap

8044756
unsigned	short
try unsigned short for 16 bits grayscale image

8044773
dsl	dynamic-languages
but you may want to look at perhaps using groovy to write your dsl as there is a great deal of opportunities in a dynamic-languages and it would have a shorter learning curve than scala does

8044854
puts	gets
i m trying to write a program that in a function gets 2 numbers from the user puts them in an array and returns them to the main function

8044859
slideup	slidedown
found lots of ways to achieve this using slideup and slidedown

8044863
post	get
this way you will handle both post and get requests

8044866
do-while	break
in your c++ textbook look up the keywords continue and break as they apply to your do-while loop

8044871
width	height
it does seem to work correctly if you use self.resize width height instead of redefining boundingrect

8044874
google-chrome	firefox
demo works in google-chrome and firefox but not ie

8044905
textarea	textbox
the user could add 50 form elements from textbox to radio to textarea

when loading my maven project in eclipse i get an eclipse red x on the pom.xml

8044960
equals	tostring
also note equals tostring etc are public virtual

8044973
memcpy	memmove	memcpy	memset	memmove	memset
theses indices can then be used along with memcpy memset and memmove from string.h to perform string replacement

8044995
elementname	datagrid
elementname binding is not working within datagrid

8045010
hash	md5
my recommendation will be to simply hash the client id using md5

8045015
equals	tostring
there s only one way to do it so there s no reason to let you customize the behavior with some specialized logic like equals tostring etc

8045016
ienumerable	iqueryable
iqueryable contains provider info and ienumerable listgrpholder does not

8045048
division	modulo
if you want to do it in reverse as in finding the x y position by the array index you can use the modulo and division

8045070
carrierwave	fog
i am trying to crop an image with carrierwave and put it on the cloud fog cloud_files

8045134
inherited	properties
i need the derived class to be able to show the inherited class s name properties

8045138
post	get
the issue now is that when i do the get depending on its value i need to do a post

8045153
post	get
this way you don t need to determine whether it was by post or by get that the data was submitted

8045167
uiview	subviews
if i put the shadow on self.layer it appears but it encompasses all the subviews of my parent uiview

8045185
width	height
note the width and height on the down-arrow image will depend on the image you are using

8045192
for-loop	loops
i use a for-loop 100 loops to create houses and treasuries across an area

8045199
google-chrome	firefox
there are no problems in firefox and google-chrome

8045219
ontouch	ondraw
in ontouch you can modify a member variable which is accessible in ondraw

8045231
i2c	spi
step one is getting your program compiled and running step two is some simple i o then a lot of learning about various interfaces spi i2c etc and peripherals timers lcd controllers pwm etc

8045232
getter	setter
and if you need to access the members of the struct then you can do so with self.ms.member or by writing getter and setter

8045240
implements	extends
if it is not possible at all i will dynamically generate a new class that extends the abstract class implements its constructors and the abstract method of all its ancestors a bit more complicated so i would be very happy if i succeed just making the original class non-abstrat instead

8045280
punctuation	words
a single-character words followed by certain punctuation like that a back there

8045288
openssl	m2crypto
you could name your swig-generated module _foobar and write a pure python module foobar that defines the necessary pythonic interface m2crypto an openssl wrapper follows that approach

8045317
post	get
how do we get permissions to post to a fan page from the javascript sdk

8045327
int	chars
whenever i ve had values that can only be a single int a value 0-9 i ve always just used int 1 to say it s an int and it will only be one chars which i assume means that it could only be a value 0 through 9 please explain this to me if i m wrong

8045368
superclass	subclassing
your action s superclass implements modeldriven hence so does your subclassing

8045374
setinterval	clearinterval
the setinterval function on the other hand runs a function at a specified interval until clearinterval is called

8045374
setinterval	clearinterval
if you were using setinterval then you would need to clearinterval when you no longer wanted the function to be called

8045394
ffmpeg	libavformat
by the way in my ffmpeg version there are still many bugs in libavformat module for proccessing mms protocol

8045409
collabnet	svn
i have created a svn repository under collabnet subversion for window server and using tortoisesvn as window client to access the repository

you can get or post to whatever you want provided you don t run into any cross-domain issues

8045445
padding	overlapping
the block level elements still exist behind the image padding has just been added to keep them from overlapping the float

8045464
min	max
the declarations of min max total_border_height and total_border_width all come after at least one statement in the block

8045487
passenger	unicorn	passenger	thin	thin	unicorn
passenger unicorn or thin could all address your needs in this respect

8045488
stdout	stderr
if catastrophic errors are logged or just printed to stdout stderr before the logging service starts in glassfish you will never see the output

8045523
floating-point	integer
i have some code that executes quite a few floating-point operations but runs unacceptably slowly on the phone and i d like to see how the performance of integer computation compares

8045529
post	get
it should count the impressions for each post and count the amount of users that like or dislike so if you have 30 people dislike for each post it should get them i cannot see your table structure but i hope it will help or point you somewhere

8045610
int	chars
the easiest way is to just cast that chars to an int

8045645
queue	fifo	min	max
one way to solve this problem is maintain priority queue with min max values and fifo discipline too

8045645
min	max
what you will find simpler i think is to not track min max while allocating but instead just have a loop to find min max right before each printout

8045672
uiviewcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uiviewcontroller	uitabbarcontroller	uinavigationcontroller	uitabbarcontroller
the basic theory is that you create a uitabbarcontroller and then put a uinavigationcontroller inside that and then put a uiviewcontroller as the root view controller of the navigation controller

8045674
subtraction	multiplication	subtraction	addition	division	multiplication	division	subtraction	division	addition	addition	multiplication
i have tried looking online with no success and i need functions for addition subtraction multiplication and division if possible and limited to a specified number of decimal places.

8045707
automake	autotools
in the book autotools a practioner s guide to gnu autoconf automake and libtool chapter 6 building libraries with libtool an example of linking library is given

8045735
stdout	stderr
while it is true that set_combine_stderr diverts stderr to the stdout stream it does so in chaotic order so you do not get the result you probably want namely the lines combined in the order written as if you were running the command in a local terminal window

8045735
stdout	stderr
if instead you comment out the chan.get_pty call and uncomment the chan.set_combine_stderr true call you will get clumps of stdout and stderr lines interspersed randomly from run to run

8045773
keydown	keyup
it updates the input val with the focused val the user is on with keydown keyup

8045777
mongodb	bson
when selecting inserting binary elements into mongodb using node-mongodb you must use binary bson object

jar	war
and like you said define the scope as provided since it s already in the tomcat and you dont want the servlet-api jar from pom to be included when building the war

8045871
copying	overwrite
if it involves only copying files then imo the best option is to give the bunch of files in needed directory structure and ask to overwrite existing copies

8045871
folder	directory
a slightly more user-friendly measure would be to zip up the directory structure along with a batch file and ask to unzip it in the app directory under some designated folder and then run the batch file to overwrite files

8045886
getter	setter
it is only data no functions although i might now add getter setter

8045932

8045980
centos	linux
how does one profile disk i o on a linux centos machine does this sound like the culprit

8046032
filesystems	btrfs
reiserfs and i believe btrfs dynamically allocate new inodes as needed and so the total inodes field of the filesystems doesn t really reflect any sort of useful value

8046052
hide	show
you could even make your list of available selections and then hide them with css and only show those items when their corresponding form values have been selected

8046104
nsurl	nsstring
remember that cfstringref and cfurlref are toll free bridged which means that the objective c equivalents are nsstring and nsurl

8046140

8046223
width	height
but i want to know whether it gets fixed for all android device because wat to be the button height and width

8046224
comparator	comparable
instead just use the comparator method that you know your comparable objects have

8046271
for-loop	loops
in this case a bit of glob magic needs to be thrown in due to the way the for-loop assigns to its loops variable

8046276
onclick	onfocus
ok ignoring the fact that inline event handlers are generally frowned upon these days try something like the following in which the onclick and onfocus in your html pass this through to the associated functions such that those functions have a reference to the element that the event was triggered on so that they can figure out what the related field or label is

8046311
children	parent
for the parent of those leaves build another hash table using the values at each parent and the identifiers of those children

8046311
children	parent
assign each parent an identifier that is the same if the value at the node is the same and the identifiers of its children are the same

8046314
avassetwriter	avassetreader
use avassetwriter and avassetwriterinput in order to encode the raw samples into a file - the following sample mac os x project shows how to use these classes the sample should work for ios too however they use an avassetreader for input it reencodes a movie file instead of the camera and microphone.

8046363

8046439
client-side	server-side
alternatively if you are using a server-side programming language such as php you should do the redirect through that instead of client-side code

8046442
children	parent
however i can t help feeling that there has to be a better way and i haven t tested this with an existing parent that s had children modified and maybe added and removed so i know it s not actually correct yet

8046449
int	chars
for example if you want to extract an int from a stringstream and then see if there were any left over chars ie

8046451
children	parent
this way once the parent object goes away so will the children

8046459
apache	nginx
webservers like apache nginx are perfect for this

8046477
class-method	eigenclass
that s because all class-method are instance methods of eigenclass for this class es object

8046507
public	protected
the difference between the two is that if a is not in the same package as b package access is a different case - left as exercise for the reader - then in case of delegation or composition you will have access only to public data members and methods of class a whereas in case of inheritance the inheriting class b will have access to public and protected members and methods of class a

8046509
union	distinct
you could replace the group by a b c clause with a distinct in front of a in the select-list of the first part of the union

8046520
hash	md5
use this md5 hash algorithm to save the password

8046520

8046542
fadein	fadeout
you can also try this fadein fadeout

8046547
public	protected
inheritance gives you all the public and protected methods and variables of the super-class

8046547
inherited	subclassing
it follows that the subclassing should have a logical implementation of each of those inherited traits

8046555
public	protected
class b will be an extension of class a and contain all of class a s public members as well as have access to the protected ones also which you won t in the second example

8046577
vb.net	vb6
i have a old vb6 project.now i migrating it in vb.net on vs2008 and the solution platform now i have to use 64bit.in the old code the variable hcontext was declared as integer

inherited	properties
problem with stl containers and inherited is that stl containers store copies of objects so all extended properties of child classes are lost in progress

8047466
argumentnullexception	argumentexception
as i have done in my implementation checking for null is something different than checking for an empty value or whitespace value because you want to throw a specific argumentnullexception in the former case and some argumentexception in the second

8047479
gitolite	gitosis
that means gitolite i won t even mention gitosis which is obsolete can establish restrictions on

you will still have to revert to objectcontext api in more complex cases because dbcontext api is only for simplest tasks

8048152
dbcontext	objectcontext
since .net 4.5 dbcontext api will be entity framework and objectcontext api will be entity framework core libraries

8048183
uiviewcontroller	uipopovercontroller
to integrate it to a uipopovercontroller you can make a subclass of uiviewcontroller say yourvideoviewcontroller which has a mpmovieplayercontroller property and adds the mpmovieplayercontroller view to its own view then create a uipopovercontroller with yourvideoviewcontroller

if you want to do it yourself width wise it can be simple enough if you set a certain width and height for tiles but i am not sure what content your tiles hold and of what sizes they can be so it will be difficult to tell you how to tackle the problem the best way

8048440
google-chrome	safari
look at this in google-chrome and in safari when you click the link the div rotates and should expand the page horizontally to ensure the whole page is visible

8048451
post	get
it is also priceless for debugging ajax requests as you will see each get post request as it s made along with the response text or the error it generates

8048498

8048689
width	margin
textrenderer is less accurate because it uses gdi and graphics uses gdi+ so maybe you should leave a little margin on the value you get from the width property

8048718
for-loop	loops
either your while loops or the for-loop runs in a subshell which is why you cannot await a child of the parent outer shell

8048718

8048823
folder	directory
i have no idea why i have to go up one directory to make this work as the assets folder is in the same folder as the mxml file.

i have created a compositecontrol that is essentially a wrapper for a multiview but if i try to use any databound controls such as gridview or formview inside the view i get the error

8049542
phong	shading
if you want phong shading you pass the vertex normal directly to the fragment shader which will be automatically linearly interpolated too and then you compute the lighting model in the fragment shader using this interpolated normal

8049561
width	height
i can force it to use multiple lines by removing the before the call to setpreferredsize in the above code but this requires me to set both a width and a height and i don t know what height to use

8049561
width	height
or alternatively is there a way to calculate the required height of a component when its width is known

8049579

8049749
put	get
incidentally the tutorial doesn t tell you to put this at the top of your file but if you don t you ll get an error

8049821
put	get
if you know of some if cases where you get crashes then maybe you can put a breakpoint in the else of a null check prior to that

8049873
width	height
i ve created a subclass which works out the preferred size as the parent container s width and then whatever height is required

8049878

8051112
rtp	rtsp
rtsp stream does not carry video audio itself it provides a method to control independent rtp video and audio streams they are in turn independent one from another

8052109
portrait	landscape
since the device is in landscape mode as the split view controller is revealed this causes splitviewcontroller willshowviewcontroller invalidatingbarbuttonitem to be called on the delegate simulating a portrait - landscape rotation thereby invalidating the bar button item removing it from the right-side of the split view and leaving us where we want to be

8052109
portrait	landscape
it s only after you rotate again to landscape and then back to portrait has the system got back into the right state and will actually install the popover bar button item in portrait mode

i m pretty certain that every method will take 0 1 or 2 parameters which have a mixture of boolean int double and chars

8052544
int	double
where the int is the payment method type in this case would be cheque and double is the total

8052634
int	double
my idea was to write an immutable â realnumberâ class that handles primitive numbers int long float and double without a bunch of instanceof controls

8052634
int	double
but brings another 2 issues this pattern allows to add double to int which results in realnumber of int and results in a stackoverflowerror if one passes a biginteger byte or some other number

8052641
backbone.js	javascriptmvc
in back-end i use php while in front-end a javascriptmvc framework backbone.js

8052678

8053053
integer	unsigned
if my analysis is correct isn t it wrong to use adder to perform unsigned integer subtraction

8053072
tablet	mdpi
that tablet is mdpi so the sdk icon is an exact match because it s in drawable facebook_icon and your icon is in drawable-hdpi facebook_icon and the drawable directory without a qualifier is mdpi.

8053076
screens	tablet
i offer a mute option in my application again in the settings screens but although this mutes my sound effects any clickable items that are pressed on the tablet still get the default click sound

8053135
mouse	keyboard
this way it will be shown automagically both for mouse and keyboard triggers the latter depends on laf

8053147

for example things like dynamic getter setter are not to clear to me etc

8053249
nsobject	nsmanagedobject
1 are there any features of nsmanagedobject that would prevent me from handling instances of custom classes just as i would with nsobject

8053349

this would stop the active activity don t forget to unregister the receiver in onpause and reregister it in onresume

8053677
setinterval	settimeout
also use setinterval instead of settimeout to make it work multiple times and then when all are clicked clear the interval

8053692
ireport	subreports

8053735
inherited	properties
sounds like you could just inherited from the textbox control and override the text properties

8053746
post	get
you ll need to post more code to get a definitive answer but somewhere one of your variables is nullable and to assign it to a non-nullable type you need to do .value

8053761

8053785
tiff	png
the file can either be pdf png or tiff and i don t know which on beforehand

8053786
dictionary	map
why not create a mutable map with all the integers in the dictionary as keys 1000000 ints in memory is roughly 3.8m from my measurements and pass through the document list only once where for each document you extract the integers and increment the respective count values in the map for which the integer is key

8053786
dictionary	map
the result is a map with its keys being a number in the dictionary and the value the number of times it appears in the document list

8053786
dictionary	map
i dont verify if the number exists in the dictionary although you only need to init the map with the values and then increment the value in the final map if it has that key

one way is to wrap the array in java.nio.bytebuffer use the absolute put get functions and slice the buffer to work on a subarray

8054854

examples of drupal modules are views token cck and pathauto

8055545
accessor	properties
what the storage properties does is allow you to put business logic into the public field accessor and still allow linq to access the data directly without going through that business logic

8055551
hide	show
however i really found it limiting and it caused weird things to happen to positioning of form elements in position fixed divs as well as being tricker to show hide and animate so i changed to this

8055552
width	height
i ve got a requirement to create several shapes based on a supplied size all of them have the same height width and have their sizes be databound to that supplied property on the datacontext

i have upgrade my localhost versioning of ruby from 1.8.7 to 1.9.2 and i got some errors in my templates

versioning	upgrade
also - later joomla versioning contained many performance upgrade as will later components

8055654

if you use codeigniter or kohana your file might be something like

8055818

if one of the filesystems is fat this could lead to problems timestamp resolution...

8055857
min	max
for that you need to know the min max and the observed value

you need to play with the xml height and width attributes in all likelihood

8055951
post	get
it encapsulates get post files using path or stream objects and gzip not directly supported by wp7 requests

8055966
screens	tablet	tablet	galaxy
it s important to understand the difference between dpi and screens size dpi tends to be high on phones like a samsung galaxy s2 but on the big 10 inch tablet it tends to be low which makes sense if you think about it the phones squeeze more pixels into a smaller space

8055970
gif	png
does not save as gif file but as png since the extension is not sufficient to specify the saving format

8055982
beanstalk	amazon-web-services

8056081
processors	hyperthreading
omp_get_num_procs returns the number of cpus the os reports and since a hyperthreading core reports itself as 2 cpus a dual-core hyperthreading chip will report itself as 4 processors

8056087
int	chars
getchar returns an int and you re storing it in a chars

8056133
int	chars
getchar returns an int to allow for passing additional values which are not in the range of valid chars

8056133
int	chars
in normal operation any valid chars may be returned in error operation an int that is too large to fit in a chars is returned

8056133
int	chars
the firs one is more common and works on all systems where the size of an int is greater than the size of a chars

8056133
int	chars
the second solution to error checking for input failure doesn t rely on the size of an int being larger than the size of a chars

8056176
postgresql	mysql
note that the syntax in postgresql is different than in mysql and i guess that is why there is no general activerecord implementation

8056215

like others have said the only way for it to remember that the thing you get out is the right type to put back in is to introduce a type variable

8056501
uitabbarcontroller	uiwindow
the uitabbarcontroller should be use directly on the uiwindow the gap you re seeing is because it automatically places it self above the status bar

8056552
google-chrome	firefox
now i ve done a very simple mvc app with no javascipt no css and no other images and it seems that ie9 calls my url.action twice fiddler confirms but google-chrome and firefox both do what i expect

8056563
ssl	https
rails 3 ssl routing redirects from https to http answers this question pretty well

8056571
client-side	server-side
it requires a little setup since it doesn t give you stack traces on the client-side but sends you the raw stack memory and does the stack walking server-side so you don t have to ship debug symbols with your app

8056577
rss	feed
i want to use some type of secure rss xml feed because that would seem to offer the most options for the client to consume and it would be as real time as possible

8056577

qtreeview	qstandarditemmodel
if you used a qtreeview with a qstandarditemmodel this would be easy

8056715

mouse	keyboard
i have a routine that needs to catch all the keyboard and mouse events in the application on all the active form controls and handle them

8056804

8056856
cvs	svn	ant	maven
i am working on some migration project involves moving around quite a few stuff from ant cvs jboss4 java5 to maven svn jboss7 java6 - this gets nasty

8056856
ant	maven
first step i am working on moving the ant build to maven - that it in iteslf involve a lot of complication

8056856
ant	maven
now that i get the ear file built and i compared it with the ear from ant build i think i got it good with the maven build

8056856
ant	maven
i came across this thread jboss deployment of message-driven bean spec violation - so i figured i was using the wrong library on my new maven build i replaced it and made sure it s using the same javax.jms library this now points to the same jar containing javax.jms.message as the original ant build - in fact i simply grabbed the jar referenced by the ant build and upload it to maven repo and reference it from my maven build

8056863
vxworks	rtos	vxworks	qnx	rtos	qnx

8056908
apache	nginx
that is to say i would rather use an apache nginx etc. web server based approach instead of a java j2ee based one

8056921
range	max
that curve is then easily mapped from 0 to some max value by multiplying by the range and dividing by x-1

8056941
subtract	add
the loop will add some overhead so if you need precision you ll have to subtract the constant cost of one loop iteration from the constant argument to __delay_cycles

8056963
post	get
i don t know about facebook developers apis you may want to check that first but if you want to emulate exactly what happens in your browser then you can use tamperdata to intercept get requests when you click on more post link and find the request url and it s parameters

8056990
width	height
the left top width height properties of a symbolinstance in jsfl don t seem to include the strokes

8057000

versioning	upgrade
my recommendation would be not to any functionality specific to a versioning of the orm otherwise your framework becomes coupled with that versioning and you will have to upgrade both the orm and the framework at the same time

8057522
try-catch	exception-handling
wrap the body of the task s action function in a try-catch and do some logging in the catch but swallow the exception-handling rather than re-throwing it

the issue i am currently trying to integrate ienumerator and ienumerable with this class and it seems to me like it should be both rather than using a sub class as the ienumerable

8058101
subtraction	addition
you can find examples of when the carry and overflow flags are set to 0 and 1 following addition or subtraction of integer numbers in this answer to a related question

8058101
subtract	add
you can also find there sample c code emulating the add with carry and subtract with borrow instructions for 8-bit numbers and you can play with that maybe get more examples

8058488
folder	directory
this keeps sprockets auto-loading any files in the same directory but not in any folder further

8058526
children	parent
so if the parent s dimensions don t really change it won t be cascaded down to its children

8058560

what is your desired min max

8058662
httpresponse	request
what i want to know is how to set the expiry of the page so that each pivot view request creates a httpresponse or has the pivotviewer got a bug in it and it is ignoring cache control

8058699
move	drag
however while the parts of my code which have drag drop functionality work on an iphone i cannot scroll or move the page in anyway

8058771

alternatively put the src in a different attribute on the image like data_orig_src and run the script to set src to data_orig_src on each image upon document ready

8058777
rss	feed
the rss feed url is available a site s meta data if one available

8058781

consider a class that represents a numeric value be it a double a float or an int

8058847
x86	64bit
on 64bit x86 cpus your instruction pointer is 64bit long

8058887
mouse	keyboard
i have a simple opengl program that allows you to spawn triangles and quads then move them around using your mouse and some keyboard controls to make complex objects kind of like a 3d model editor

8058892
int	boolean
additionally you re mistreating an int as a boolean which is almost always a bad idea from a maintenance standpoint

8058898
min	max
when new data is available moc observation i add data to plot s data array scatter plot determine the new y-range required min max value in data array and reload the whole plot

8058913
addclass	removeclass
so when i want to do a simple addclass and removeclass for one element this works

8058919
perl	tcl
i don t think you can usefully call those from tcl but you can from perl or python

8058929
ftp	telnet
applications such as telnet ftp passwd fsck rlogin tip ssh and

8058938
memset	malloc
you re malloc ing 512 bytes and you re writing with memset 513 bytes so you ve corrupted the heap

8058958
width	height
creating a popup window from main page with window.open the child popup page uses the onload event which should display it s width height

8058958
width	height
checking both the window s and document s width height with or without jquery will only return 0

8058958
width	height
oddly enough loading the child page in a tab by itself will always report the width height correctly

8058958
width	height
is there another event i can wait for to assure the width height properties in particular are set

8058958
width	height
but it seems to just be a guessing game about how long to wait before you check the width height

8058958
width	height
is there no way to wait for a particular event to know for sure that the width height of the child window are set in chrome

8059029
post	get
this is a common problem and the cleanest method i know to work around this when using post-redirect-get is to set a cookie in the response to the post and then immediately delete it in the response to the get

8059054
shadowing	named
shadowing means add a new method with the same named without using polymorfism

8059054
shadowing	named
speaking from the point of view of the virtual table or virtual method table if you prefer another named with shadowing the base function and the derived function occupy two different entries in the virtual table also if they have the same named

8059063
ready	each
i m going to assume that generating each chunk is independent therefore you can probably move the work to another thread - then show the chunk when it is ready

8059065
range	minimum
so that works fine except that my value1 or v1 data will generally range from a minimum of 10 to a maximum of 90

8059112
children	parent
the default is cascadetype.none so as a result the update that the parent id has changed doesn t get propagated to the children so hibernate will delete the orphans

8059122
getter	setter
i suppose some people would even extend that philosophy to getter and setter

8059130
chunked	transfer-encoding
that is if your response has transfer-encoding chunked header the original http dissector tries to reassemble the data and if you hook it over with such http_wrapper then reassembling fails

8059133
folder	directory
if you want the user to select a directory on the web server machine then you will need to gather the list of folder that they can select from and present them to them in a tree or other user interface construct that makes sense for the task you wish to perform

8059135
lisp	scheme
it s my understanding that scheme and lisp are related

8059135
lisp	scheme
even if you re not ok with scheme you could surely fork the module to edit it to use your favorite lisp engine without too much trouble

8059165
accessor	properties	getter	setter
i know it has something to do with setter and getter and accessor but would someone mind clarifying for me without those words if possible when you use properties and when you don t

8059166
prng	random
you get the same sequence of random numbers in each process because you seed the prng before the call to fork

8059167
cvs	svn
it s a modern way of thinking about a commits subversion svn and cvs repositories could barely support this style of repository check-ins

8059175
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
you can only do it if you create a browser extension in google-chrome firefox or safari

8059180
ubuntu	linux
if i have a dozen users on my linux machine ubuntu 11.10 what are the security concerns of giving each of them sudo access of apt-get install

8059205
free	malloc
by overriding this you actually destroy the information that free call needs to succeed and really free the malloc d memory

8059208
superclass	subclassing
i have an activity superclass with some utility functionality in it but in order formit to be of general use i d need to also subclassing all those as well

8059214
ant	maven
like an ant script or maven script

8059235
getter	setter
all this does is create getter and setter methods

8059235
getter	setter
the synthesize directive automatically generates the setter and getter for us so all we have to implement for this class is the dealloc method

8059291
explode	implode
according to other answers i need to use the explode implode function but i m not quite sure when and where to implement it

8059311
min	max
except i have no idea how i can include this min max size into the type

8059334
mouse	keyboard
use jquery dojo zepto or any other library for your ajax calls and mouse keyboard events

8059360
realloc	malloc
some variety of realloc trick might then work but i don t think realloc in particular because that s intended to be used on objects that are allocated with malloc and the details of what c function is used to allocate objects in not exposed in objective c so you shouldn t assume it s malloc

8059377
min	max
the only way to do this sort of thing would be to add an interface constraint to size which requires size to have max and min methods or something like that

8059410
ubuntu	linux
i have an ubuntu natty linux server and have several virtualenvs on it

8059421
division	modulo
it does not matter whether you do that by arithmetic manipulation division and modulo by 10 or by converting the numbers into strings but fundamentally your question is precisely about the individual digits of the numbers

8059428
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
i thought ie7 and above followed the same box model as google-chrome firefox opera but when i run the following code in ie8 and then in google-chrome firefox opera i get different results

8059428
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
in order to see my problem you need to use ie and then either google-chrome firefox or opera

8059536
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
i realize that firefox opera google-chrome have thousands of extensions that extend and alter the ui and for everything else there are bookmarklets

8059536
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome firefox whatever i load up a regular html page with some javascript code

8059553
hide	show
10 of the time this works beautifully the other 90 the tool tip div flashes that is it hide and show infinitely even if the mouse remains still

8059553
mouseover	mouseout
it seems like the mouseover and mouseout events are endlessly firing

8059578
mouseleave	mouseenter
try using mouseenter and mouseleave instead

8059591
min	max
i held the min max of each bucket 24 bits for each bucket entry and made one big struct array for the key-pairs

8059627
jsf	seam
i have a jsf 1.2 seam 2.2.2 application

8059691
ubuntu	linux
i m running a proc now on ubuntu linux that has a definite memory leak and node 0.6.0 is pushing 8gb

8059696
versioning	upgrade
upgrade to the latest eclipse versioning

8059718
post	get
as far as i know all modern browsers ignore the message body of a 302 in response to a get or post and will directly go to the url as specified in location header

8059722
put	get
the fatal error i get is in the locker.comp section of cmd printout however i get a warning just before it which i will also put down briefly

8059726
sorting	grouping
the crux of the issue here is that i was doing ajax binding but wanted to do grouping and sorting

8059726
sorting	grouping
what that required was a manual sorting process that sorted by the grouping column first then the other sorted columns

8059745
google-chrome	safari
all this works in safari and google-chrome

8059766
min	max
any item in the select portion must be in the group by portion if an aggregrate wasn t defined min max sum count etc.

8059790
udp	tcp
udp doesn t require to acknowledge every packet like tcp does ack flag

8059790
udp	tcp
you would be slower because you would have to implement a packet control like in tcp in udp too

8059790
udp	tcp
udp does not acknowledge the receival of packets and it also does not knock on the door to see if anybody is home tcp syn

8059790
udp	tcp
udp packets are easier structured than tcp packets but sacrifice security for their size

8059790
udp	tcp
with a cable that can hold c packets s and tcp at a rate of c packets s and udp at a rate of 8 c packets s udp would be much faster

8059879
client-side	server-side
i ve been working in the j2ee field for several years and tired of writing all those ajax functions which downloading some data from server-side and render on the client-side

8059879
client-side	server-side
is it possible to only write javascript codes that run on both server-side and client-side

8059879
client-side	server-side
rhino is a javascript engine running on j2ee projects but it doesn t provide any means to access both client-side data and server-side data

8059900
gridview	entitydatasource
i d like to use a gridview and entitydatasource in order to save writing crud

8059900
dbcontext	objectcontext
can i convert my dbcontext to an objectcontext that is expected by the entitydatasource

8059908
primes	modulus
if you are using rsa properly your modulus should be composed of two primes each one at least 1024bits long

8059988
salt	md5
we have a php application that stores passwords just using the md5 function with no salt

8059988
crypt	hash
any language that uses the crypt 3 library will see that string and know to use sha256 with the given hash and expect the given result

using jquery i show hide the span depending on whether there is a value entered into the field

8060087
client-side	server-side
is it possible to only write javascript codes that run on both server-side and client-side

8060101
g++	gcc
note also that while gcc often works for c++ programs you should use g++ instead

note the rss feed has charset utf-8 and so does the page where i m trying to present the feed on my site

8060137
put	get
like this the ad will destroy less space on the screen and i can put the ad at a better place to get clicks

8060180
rhel	suse
this code runs fine on linux rhel suse but on windows the memory usage increases as the number of files to create increases near a million files

8060195
int	chars
since chars is an int 8-bit signed int in your case your chars are being promoted to int via sign-extension

8060226
cells	tablecell
my question is when i tap the cells i want to get the label value i know how to get a cells value when tapping the cells but i need to get the label value my code for getting the tablecell value is

8060247
int	chars
then when printing it is converted to int and to keep the semantical equivalence the compiler pads the extra bytes with 0xff so the negative int will have the same numerical value of your negative chars

8060263
int	boolean
won t compile in java because length is an int but the condition part of a while must be a boolean

8060264
ubuntu	linux
ruby 1.9.2 in linux ubuntu

8060410
accessor	properties
i ve seen this happen when i ve accidentally used an accessor to clear a properties on a calayer while within that layer s -dealloc method

8060418

the date output is displayed in firefox and google-chrome but the date output doesn t display in safari

8060674
google-chrome	firefox
i am using firefox 7.0.1 and google-chrome 15.0.874.106

8060694
mouseover	mouseout
how can i make this smaller not minify but isn t there a way to say like toggle instead of mouseover then mouseout

8060697
width	height
but this code draws some strange type of arc i am sure with the x y width and height params

8060701
int	chars
you need tn convert the int to string chars exactly using

8060709
mouseover	mouseout
use .hover instead of mouseover mouseout

8060723
nullpointerexception	runtimeexception
open up your breakpoints view and you should see a breakpoint listed as a nullpointerexception runtimeexception or exception

8060732
listview	gridview
nikhil just keep in mind that defining a custom adapter is one time practice once you define and understand it properly then you can customize any views like listview gridview gallery spinner

8060759
width	height
and add a tableview of width same as textfield and height whatever you want and place it exactly below the textfield and keep it hidden

8060787
filtering	grouping
in my dataset i got some rows that i don t want to show in the report and i m using for grouping i m using a filtering for that

express	nowjs
i use express nowjs running on port 8003

8060841
mouseover	mouseenter	mouseover	mouseleave	mouseover	mouseout	mouseleave	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseenter	mouseout	mouseleave
it should also be noted that mouseenter and mouseleave work somewhat differently and usually much better than mouseover and mouseout

8060878
wxpython	textctrl
here in this extract i am reading output so that i can redirect it to display in a wxpython textctrl in a separate thread

8060908
post	get
i did manage to get the code in beta s post to work on a small test project

8060937
accessor	properties	accessor	ivar
the in the synthesize statement above is entirely optional but it helps to force the distinction between accessing the ivar directly in your code and attempting to use the properties accessor because to use the ivar directly you have to type it out with the underscore

8060943
debian	linux
with gcc it is the -wall option and on linux debian sid gcc 4.6 i m getting with your example file david.c using the gcc -wall -g -o david david.c command

8061103
stdout	stderr
it doesn t always print out the output to stdout because by design stdout is buffered output and stderr is unbuffered

8061103
fflush	gets
so data can continue buffering for a long while before it gets fflush

8061104
stdout	stderr
the reason being is that stdout is buffered in order to be more efficient whereas stderr doesn t buffer it s output and is more appropriate for error messages and things that need to be printed immediately

8061104
stdout	fflush
stdout will usually be fflush when

opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
tested in all major browsers google-chrome opera firefox internet explorer

8070381
repo	egit
i don t think egit will connect to your git repo easily in this mode but your eclipse specific project files will be in a different location than your source tree

8070381
repo	egit
then using will allow you to connect egit to the already existing git repo

8070399
put	get
if you put the cursor between methods where the new method declaration will go and hit ctrl-space you get a list of all the methods that you can override

8070408
opera	google-chrome	opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
again the video works fine in ie9 safari and google-chrome but no goin ie6-7 or firefox and opera

8070413
mongodump	mongoimport
the counterpart to mongodump is mongorestore and the counterpart to mongoimport is mongoexport -- the major difference is in the format of the files created and understood by the tools dump and restore read and write bson files

8070413
csv	tsv
export and import deal with text file formats json csv tsv

8070423
sqldatasource	linqdatasource	sqldatasource	entitydatasource	linqdatasource	entitydatasource
entitydatasource sqldatasource linqdatasource name it you provide low-level access details in your declarative code

8070463
nettcpbinding	net.tcp
could not find a base address that matches scheme net.tcp for the endpoint with binding nettcpbinding

8070466
width	height
in the example the width must come first than the height

8070481
button	checkbox
if the radio button is checked it should deselect all of the checkbox and clear the input right

8070489

the firefox add-ons sdk only allows put and post requests via its api

8070501
helpers	actioncontroller
i have tried including actioncontroller urlwriter modules and actionview helpers urlhelper with no luck

8070502
ncover	testdriven.net
how do i get testdriven.net to generate a useful code coverage xml file with ncover

8070506
mouse	keyboard
i don t know of a way in firemonkey to capture mouse and keyboard events at the application level in a platform agnostic way

8070506
keydown	mousedown
however by default firemonkey forms get all of the mousedown and keydown events before the controls do

8070506
keydown	mousedown
if you simply override the mousedown and keydown events on your form you ll accomplish the same thing

8070506
mousemove	mouseleave	mousemove	mouseup	mouseleave	keyup	keyup	mouseup	mouseup	mouseleave
if you want you can keep going with mousemove mouseup mousewheel mouseleave keyup dragenter dragover dragdrop and dragleave

8070520
disk	ram
vsuite ram disk

8070520
disk	ram
the vsuite ram disk on the other hands works very well

8070527
post	put
i think you are asking about a client that can help you try out the post and put methods correct

8070527
post	put
it will let you use your ff browser to test post put delete methods

8070532
kde	gnome
although i am still new at linux and the destop environemnts i want to know if i can develop kde based applications from a system using gnome as its desktop environment

8070537
std	ostream
i cannot understand why assigning cout to test std ostream is ok to compile but the compiler produces error messages for the rest like stdout1_ cout

8070542
rss	feed
i m trying to add a rss feed to the site so i edited the header.php file that s where it s going

8070557
int	chars
i thought a for-loop that goes through every chars in the original string and builds two separate strings inside would work but i could only think to base the separation on int and alphabetic chars which would make something like pr405j turn into prj and 405

8070569
getter	setter
bottom line as i ve always heard it you should always use the synthesized getter and setter

8070569
getter	setter
however there are times when you need to access the variable directly especially when you may override the synthesized getter or setter to return set some processed data but need to also access the raw data from inside the class

8070569
getter	setter
say in this example you wanted to use the default setter but you wanted to override the getter to always return a normalized version of the first name sorry i know its weird but i can think of a better example off the top of my head

8070582
memset	calloc
note that you can also use calloc to allocate memory initialized with 0 so you can avoid the memset call

8070587
folder	directory
another possibility is to create virtual directory for each of your sites which all point to the same library folder

8070624
post	put
once you have started one of these clients you should be able to send requests using put post delete or even one of the other less common http methods

8070633
updatepanel	scriptmanager
ps there is a scriptmanager and a updatepanel on the page just in case..

8070637
width	height
how do i show the img with a minimum width and height no distortion and show the exact size i want

8070660
std	ostream	ostream	noncopyable
you need to use a pointer because references do not allow rebind and std ostream is noncopyable

8070661
put	get
in order to update a record i d first have to get that record by calling findbyid which would put the record into the session cache

8070678
postgresql	mysql
but the most general solution has to avoid automatic series generators like postgresql s generate_series and common table expressions because mysql doesn t support them

8070699
hide	show
i have two buttons hide show liked and hide show disliked that when clicked toggle all liked posts or toggle all disliked posts

8070703
listview	gridview	gridview	datalist
i would use a listview or datalist instead of a gridview

8070743
width	height
given the width height ratio of your input you may choose some different small resolution

8070751
button	checkbox
use docmd.runsql insert into ... as many times you need as given by the radio button and the selected checkbox

8070855
tinyint	nvarchar
conversion failed when converting the nvarchar value xxxxxxxxx to data type tinyint

8070880
width	height
and then i make some operations like tracking objects but it s have very bad performance i mean every about 200 ms i get new frame when removing the lines 5 6 that set the width height i get very good performance.

8070890
pop-up	dialog
by inserting new as a first child of prevents pop-up for me in ie8 xp or this is too brutal because it blocks modal dialog at all

8070899
maven	cobertura	cobertura	emma
if you re going to stick with maven and want a plugin for maven that will do the code-coverage job i think cobertura is a better choice as emma stable last build is from 2005

8070899
maven	cobertura
according to the cobertura site it supports code coverage in maven 1 and maven 2 environments

8070899
maven	pom.xml
a problem exists between pom.xml configurations of maven 2 and maven 3

8070899
cobertura	emma
sonar has cobertura embedded also options to embedd emma and some people state that they had successfully reported code coverage despite they had problems using the stand-alone cobertura plugin

8070915
portrait	landscape
jquery mobile form validation even with landscape portrait distinction

8070916
getter	setter
and added getter and setter method for it

8070918
button	checkbox
such as unchecking any checkbox checks the radio button even if other checkbox are checked or entering and clearing the text box when no other checkbox are checked etc

8070941
for-loop	loops
the for-loop does not create a separate closure for each iteration through loops

8070965
std	ostream
i cannot understand why assigning cout to test std ostream is ok to compile

8071006
google-chrome	firefox
i am able to access the session variables in google-chrome 15 and firefox 7

8071020
portrait	landscape
if so you have to support both landscape as well as portrait orientation otherwise apple will reject it

8071029
int	chars
it depends on what you mean by convert an int to chars

8071029
int	chars
if you mean transforming the int 1 into the chars 1 you can do it like this

8071054
google-chrome	firefox
i can always use firefox to look at it but i use google-chrome as my main browser and i would really like this too work

8071143
int	chars
you should look in java s api at and use the string classes substring int beginindex method after you find the index of your specified chars so

8071166
nsscanner	nsregularexpression
you may also consider using nsscanner or nsregularexpression

8071167
disk	ram
for msmq 1.0 and msmq 2.0 the combined size of messages capable of being stored on one machine is not limited to the amount of ram in the machine or the size of the hard disk but to the amount of virtual address space provided to the msmq service by the operating system this limitation has been lifted in msmq 3.0

8071173
photoshop	fireworks
photoshop or fireworks

8071195
superclass	subclassing
frog subclassing anyref the superclass of philosophical and mixes in

8071224
octal	hex
if you re using 17 backslash escape it will be interpreted as as 0017 where 17 would be an octal digit equals to f hex

8071256
implements	extends
if you are coming from java it can sound strange at first it was the same for me but actually now i find it s more regular syntax then java s where i need to explicitly say whether i want to implements or extends other class interface

8071256
implements	extends
it does not actually matter whether you are saying extends or implements

8071256
implements	extends
just try to replace extends implements with with is a and it becomes more clear

8071256
implements	extends
with this you are saying that bar does not extends implements foo directly but all other classes that want to extends bar should also extends foo

8071334
implements	extends
first note that the extends implements difference tells nothing to the compiler than it would not know

8071334
implements	extends
in c# you write class a b c d instead of both class a extends b implements c d and class a implements b c d

8071340
post	get
how do i get my facebook application to automatically ask for the required permissions post installation

8071363
int	double
i use math.pow a b now but it returns a double and that is usually a lot of work and looks less clean when you just want to use int a power will then also always result in an int

8071379
children	parent
in category model belongsto parent and hasmany children both have the class category and foreign key parent_id

8071382
matplotlib	scipy
i am noticing an unexplained behaviour when comparing scipy s 0.9.0 and matplotlib s 1.0.1 delaunay triangulation routines

8071382
matplotlib	scipy
scipy s edges are missing some of my points while matplotlib s are all there

8071423
mouse	keyboard
also i included code to make sure the text gets selected if you click on the textbox with the mouse and not just keyboard focus it

8071424
google-chrome	safari
i can reproduce the error in safari google-chrome

8071452
int	double
you first need to cast to decimal or double to avoid int division

8071495
put	get
i d also study up a bit on the mvc model view controller design pattern so you get more comfortable knowing where to put app logic

8071502
rss	feed
i wrote my own thing to handle rss feed

8071502
rss	feed
you now have an object containing a list of each entry from the rss feed

8071502
rss	feed
you should be able to use this with no changes for standard rss feed

8071539
post	get
the first security-constraint does not have any auth-constraint so the get and post methods are available to anyone without login

8071565
width	height
same logic is applied to column definitions only regarding width instead of height

8071565
expander	grid
the parent grid is also stopped since the template for expander uses dockpanel that is also a stopping panel

8071565
expander	grid
the expander is not stopped the child grid is not stopped since the grid assumes it has infinite height available thus the list box is not stopped the scrollviewer in the template of list box is not stopped so it s viewportheight is infinite for the virtualizingstackpanel that arranges the items and is a child of the scroll viewer this means all items are in the view render all elements

8071632
postgresql	mysql
is there a tool to create python code from an existing database mysql postgresql

8071694
fgets	splfileobject
if you want to read every 5th line you could use an splfileobject to make life a little easier than the fopen fgets fclose family of functions

8071701
keydown	keyup
you can just toss the whole event object that a keyup keydown keypress whatever was directly into an array

8071744
google-chrome	firefox
server socket receives 2 http requests when i send from google-chrome and receives one when i send from firefox

8071771
submit	submission
i m curious because i just asked a question regarding webkit not submission my form if the submit button is hidden display none

8071847
width	height
size.x y is the width height of the window

8071855
hide	show
this is ugly and i was wondering if there was a function which controls the hide show of this window

8071866
integer	unsigned
a perhaps more common cause other than actually running out of memory of course is an unsigned integer wrap around case where a uin32_t or uint64_t is used to allocate memory but was 0 and had 1 subtracted from it leading to a very large request allocation in 64-bits that would be many thousands of petabytes

8071885
folder	directory
it pulls the code from a github repository creates a new folder in var www releases timestamp and symlinks the document root var www current to that directory

8071903
ldd	glibc
just do ldd on your app and see which are used ok not that much but certainly glibc

8071903
profiler	gprof
use gprof and the visual studio built-in profiler and compare time spent in different functions

8071909
submit	submission
the standard does not say anything about a submit button being necessary in the submission process

8071917
wmv	asf
everytime i try to convert asf file to wmv

8071959
hide	show
show and hide work but i have to do this

8072001
userprincipal	directoryentry	principalcontext	directoryentry	principalcontext	userprincipal
i don t understand why you re using the new principalcontext userprincipal stuff in your first example but fall back to the hard to use directoryentry stuff in your second example..

8072119
dictionary	map
you can simplify your code by using a dictionary to map weekday names to numbers

8072152
google-chrome	firefox
i ve found this trickling down to be there in google-chrome but not in firefox

8072160
width	height
however the methods that take in a height width or a rectangle are different

8072160
width	height
those methods either ignore the height and width or with the rectangle only use the top and left

8072180
skip-lists	tree
as measured using open jdk 6 on typical production hardware my company uses you can expect all add and query operations on a skip-lists map to take roughly double the time as the same operation on a tree map

8072203
rtp	rtsp
to be more open for interoperability you might prefer to implement some well known protocol for data streaming over network such as rtsp rtp

8072208
width	height
height and width are both correctly set to the resolution of the camera

8072231
min	max	minimum	max
can anyone tell me how to select the minimum and the maximum from a table using the min and max and union keywords

8072234
rss	feed
you can either tell simplexml to skip them default or to read them see read cdata from a rss feed

8072252
imageview	viewswitcher
rather than loading all the images at once perhaps try something like a viewswitcher with two child imageview

8072304
ffmpeg	libavformat
libavcodec libavformat and other ffmpeg projects - a wide range of codecs to use

8072322
width	height
in ie8 block elements with a set width height will display properly but mouse events and linking only work for text inside of that element

8072364
opera	google-chrome	opera	firefox	google-chrome	firefox
in firefox google-chrome and opera that is working pretty well but when i try to append child no matter if i m using jquery or not ie gives me a unspecified error

8072374
for-loop	loops
in the case of a for-loop the increment operator is called entirely independent of when it is evaluated so think of it as a line at the end of loops by itself either being

8072384
subclass	accessor
first always keep in mind the implications of accessor mutators being virtual as all objective-c methods are. in general it s been said that one should avoid calling virtual methods in init and dealloc because you don t know what a subclass will do that could mess you up

8072395
portrait	landscape
you pass a cgpoint where 0 0 represents the top left of the picture area and 1 1 represents the bottom right in landscape mode with the home button on the rightâ this applies even if the device is in portrait mode

8072396
min	max
note that this can return more than 2 rows if there is more than one row with the same min or max value

8072396
min	max
it could also return just one row if both min and max happen to come from the same row you could use union all to avoid that

8072396
min	max
btw your query means get min sal and then get the ename from a random row and the same for max

8072396
min	max
in both min and max cases the mysql decided to return the same random row

8072427
opera	google-chrome
at this moment i have that problem on my two computers and i cant login using google-chrome ie and opera

8072445
versioning	upgrade
so you can also just upgrade to at least that versioning

8072459
int	chars
builder.length and word.length are int - the number of chars in each word

8072470
hash	salt
well what i do with my apps is usually create a special id by taking the hash from the machine name found in environment concat it with a hash value of my app s name and then apply a salt probably not even necessary but it helps to be paranoid to produce a fingerprint for an app machine combo

8072500
super	self
the point of this is that the super implementation could return a different but still valid object than the current value of self

8072500
super	self
however since it returned a different object the super implementation should have released the old self which is what you are returning

8072500
super	self
this code reassigns self to be the value returned by the super initializer instead of just assuming the value returned is the same

8072511
actualheight	actualwidth
actualwidth actualheight rendersize are set by

8072519
mouseleave	mouseenter
i highly recommend using jquery s mouseenter and mouseleave events

8072521
children	parent
this works because the lifespan of the children is bounded by the lifespan of the parent

8072521
children	parent
hibernate knows that it should remove the children when it removes the parent and therefore avoids violating the constraint

8072521
children	parent
it deletes the children and then the parent

8072559
versioning	upgrade
yes when an rpm upgrade occurs rpm first installs the new versioning of the package and then uninstalls the old versioning of the package

8072559
uninstall	upgrade
but your scripts pre post preun postun need to know whether they are handling an upgrade or just a plain install or uninstall

8072569
vmware	virtualbox
just make sure you are getting the physical nic s mac address and not a virtual mac created by vmware or virtualbox

8072603
centos	linux
i want open pop3 port on my centos linux box with etc services

8072605
hide	show
sure all you need to do is attach an onmouseleave event listener to the container div so that when the mouse moves away it will check if that div .content_inner has been show and if so hide it

8072646
gridview	formview
i have an xml file called answers.xml and i need to connect gridview formview etc.

8072652
google-chrome	firefox
it works fine in firefox and google-chrome and it works with ie getting the page from the old server

8072664
matplotlib	scipy
which somehow installs numpy 2.0 scipy 0.11 matplotlib 1.2 ipython 0.12 pandas 0.5.1 as well as pymc 2.2 alpha

8072665
debian	linux
debian like most other linux distributions comes with python installed as standard as many of the system tools depend on it

8072684
gridview	sqldatasource
but when i execute this procedure and using sqldatasource and show results in gridview rows aren t in the same order as it should be

8072732
portrait	landscape
the problem is that i want the player to be able to play both in landscape mode and portrait

8072732
portrait	landscape
in the manifest.xml file - you can tell the game to play on just portrait or just landscape mode

8072734
portrait	landscape
i use this code to set my app to portrait as opposed to landscape

8072738
versioning	upgrade
i did like to first upgrade the solution from 2005 to 2010 first and then actually change the framework versioning but you may get better mileage with a different method

8072780
entities	entitymanager
which for instance looks to the modules defined check if there is a entities directory and add s this to the doctrine entitymanager

8072789
versioning	upgrade
upgrade it to a more recent versioning of rails 3.0.x

8072851
firefox	safari	google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox
does anyone know the timeout times for google-chrome mozilla firefox ie 9 and safari

8072852
punctuation	words
but technically hello there all first are all words that are spelt correctly...just that there s punctuation between them making them wrong

8072852
punctuation	words
at the same time i don t want to just strip away all the punctuation in a words because for words like don t won t can t it requires the apostrophes to be marked as correctly spelt

8072858
postgresql	mysql
long question short - - can postgresql used instead of mysql

8072858
ingres	oracle	ingres	firebird	ingres	mysql	ingres	postgresql	postgresql	mysql
firstly i noticed that these are the most common names when it comes to relational database management systems - - db2 ibm oracle microsoft sql ingres mysql postgresql and firebird

8072858
postgresql	mysql
while mysql exclude enterprise version postgresql and firebird are open source and free

8072865
fitnesse	jbehave
look into jbehave or fitnesse

8072889
portrait	landscape
my app supports both portrait and landscape orientation so the tableview sometimes needs to be scrolled when the device rotates

8072890
hide	show
however you have several element that you want to hide show i m not sure when you want to do so so it may be easier to use a different method of selecting the elements such as getelementsbytagname or getelementsbyclassname but it depends on your html and what you re actually trying to do

8072907
hide	show
so if you wanted to hide all and show one you could do that with this function

8072925
mdpi	hdpi
what you should do in this case is make a 50px x 40px button for mdpi and make a 75px x 60px these are x 1.5 for hdpi etc

8072935
matplotlib	scipy	matplotlib	chaco
either will install numpy scipy matplotlib ipython traits and chaco on window osx or linux

8072965
postgresql	mysql
note also that some platforms scale better when adding more servers mysql and others do better when increasing your server resources postgresql

8072968
skype	hangout
is there any way i can outsource this to existing services such as the hangout feature in google+ the new video chat in facebook or the skype api

8072973
collabnet	svn
collabnet does not yet offer the 1.7 svn package for os x you need to get it from wandisco.this messed me up for hours

8072983
filtering	grouping
input a set of maps a database table output a report grouping on one of the columns filtering on a predicate with aggregate functions applied to the columns

8072990
put	get
however if i put a messagebox.show in the catch - the io exception catches one time - get the message box displayed and then hitting the ok button has the effect of unbusying the file to allow the file.move operation to proceed

8072994
put	get
what can i put in the location tag to always get the correct url regardless of where i started

8073004
jax-ws	jax-rs
other than that a simple servlet or a real webservice api like jax-rs jax-ws is really the best way

8073005
lapack	fftw
matlab adds a layer to anything it calls fftw lapack mkl

8073009
background-repeat	background-image	background-repeat	background-position	background-repeat	background-size	background-image	background-position	background-image	background-color	background-image	background-size	background-position	background-size
this property defined background-color background-image and background-repeat explicitly however background-position background-clip background-size etc

8073019
post	get
is the array idea the best idea if so how do i get the contents of the array from the ajax or is there a better way and how do i do the ajax call if i am not doing a post of anything

8073070
unsigned	short
this will fix the cannot convert parameter 1 from _bstr_t to unsigned short error

8073078
touchesbegan	touchesended
i ve tried variations of overriding touchesbegan touchesended touchesshouldcancel etc.

8073183
google-chrome	firefox
but when the field is displayed in ie9 google-chrome firefox etc as part of the output of a php script the question mark is displayed as an apostrophe dan s

8073184
vb.net	vb6
i have an application .net framework 4 vb.net that originally was a vb6 application

8073190
versioning	upgrade
report it and or upgrade to latest versioning

8073204
int	double
you are converting the text to double and then saving the value in an int

8073220
portrait	landscape
i added orientation to my app for landscape and portrait without many problems and it works

8073233
width	height
as for problem #1 i would look at the width height ratio of your button and pick actual pixel dimensions based on that but larger than the model 50 x 40 px

8073258
width	height
both the custom sliding drawer and parent both specify layout width and height attributes

8073281
google-chrome	firefox	put	get
i have the code blow for tabbing through 2 fields and it has no effect in ie and google-chrome it seems it runs nothing for example i get nothing when i put alert and in firefox it runs with some bug it jumps twice there where do you think the problem is i m developing in by asp.net and jquery version 1.3.2

8073319
keydown	keyup
you ll need to use keyup or keydown

8073320
nsurl	nsstring
i m sure it s not possible to retrieve the original nsurl from the nsstring

8073326
vbscript	vb6
since classic asp with vbscript is a close cousin of vb6 and they re both com based should i not be able to inspect vb6 errors variables and objects properly too

8073331
public	protected
a method or variable which is not declared to be public private or protected is thereby package protected and can therefore be accessed by any class in that package

8073336
kde	gnome
i ve no idea if either gnome 3 or kde support displaying libappindicator notifications anywhere.

8073338
superclass	subclassing
now on the other hand if you want a function of a subclassing to call a method of a superclass that can be done

8073368
inherited	properties
all objects inherited a constructor properties from their prototype

8073407

8081460
free	calloc
my question is about the free before calloc

8081460
free	calloc
the question is simply will the free actually free up the memory allocated by my calloc when coded like this

8081465
equals	gethashcode
this won t ever work for you because s equals and gethashcode methods don t consider the contents of the list

8081484
put	get
you do need to pad the result if you wnat it to get put back into the dataframe

8081542
integer	unsigned
since irecordcount is clearly intended to hold a nonnegative integer why not just declare it as unsigned int in the first place

8081544
width	height
you may limit the size of the components by setting their width height to a desired value

8081544
listview	gridview
i would say that gridview is likely used for galleries listview being used for tasks like your

8081578
gif	png
we support png jpeg and gif formats

8081579
svg	vml
i think that i can use flash flex or javascript svg vml for this purpose

8081579
svg	vml
minus of js svg vml is that there aren t such powerfull developing tools as in flash case but if we use some library like application won t require flash plug-in

8081581
google-chrome	firefox
you can do this google-chrome with the built in inspect element tool or firebug in firefox or live http headers

magento	joomla
your business requirements have simple 1-1 mapping with cms features then go with a cms such as magento joomla drupal etc

8081695
uiview	subviews
my suggestion create a uiview below the table view then put the table view as a subviews of that view and then you can manage its size as being not full screen

8081719
sorting	grouping
if you don t want the inefficiency of sorting the items within each grouping consider using an o n maxby method such as the one from morelinq

8081723
explode	substr
otherwise you are going to store every substr location and that will explode your memory

8081753
explode	substr
you re doing things in the wrong order first explode on the quotes so you ll isolate quoted substr easily then explode based on the spaces

8081820
for-loop	arrays
you are creating your tabpanel inside the for-loop which is creating one tabpanel per arrays item with each tabpanel having a list bound to a store with a single record

8081828
post	get
i would make sure you are actually invoking a get and not a post as the method

8081828
post	get
if you are submitting a form it defaults to post which would mean you don t have a matching route the route you listed above only works for get requests

8081923
getter	setter
this means that i can easily call getter and setter but i immediately get a segmentation fault when trying to call a function that overwrites a virtual base class functions

8081937
maven	pom.xml
with the transitive dependencies declared even if they are used explicitly the maven pom.xml becomes more verbose

8081947
min	max
if you just replace the min function with a max function the algorithm will lead to a-b-c but the longest path is a-d-c

8081947
min	max
then you can use max instead of min to find the longest path

8081955
client-side	server-side
what s the worst that can happen on the server-side and client-side

there is quite a lot of data associated with it since any manufacturer s data will contain images descriptions notes thousands of products modifications and lots of information about them width height depth number of doors etc

8082360
width	height
important tags to the width and height of the css the slideshow resizes according to the percentage values in my stylesheet

8082407
hash	salt
include a salt to prevent the attacker from relying on generic hash tables

8082430
width	margin
unless you have a specific reason for formatting the page in that manor which is entirely possible given this looks like an extracted test case i would make the inner div width relevant to the outer div plus some margin and then expand the outer div instead

8082430
width	margin
instead of using a width i d try margin on the left and right to get the effect your going for so dynamic resizing is easier

8082516
addclass	removeclass
if li.slidenum first has a class of active addclass disabled to li.prev else removeclass active from li.prev

obviously that s running in cassini but i get the same message when running in iis

8082548
versioning	upgrade
xcode uses gcc 4.2 and it s very unlikely it will be ever upgrade to a newer versioning most probably due to newer versioning of gcc being licensed with gpl3

8082677
getter	setter
i ll skip getter and setter for primitves

8082703
put	get
but i get a validation when i put in dates older than 2000 and since this is a field for inputting date of birth you can see why it would be a problem

8082719
nsurl	nsstring
but in the 2nd case where the user picks an image form the photo library i get an nsurl which i want to convert to an nsstring to be able to save it in

8082719
nsurl	nsstring
is it possible to convert the nsurl to an nsstring

8082759
for-loop	arrays
you could make an arrays the same size as the arraylist and then make an iterated for-loop to index the items and insert them into the arrays

8082773
for-loop	loops
try a for-loop where it only loops twice

8082802
maven	buildr	ant	maven	ant	buildr
in real life people use special build tools like good old ant maven or newer graidle or buildr

8082835
client-side	server-side
i want to perform client-side validation as well as server-side validation which means either using remote validation or implementing duplicate validation code

8082868
postgresql	mysql
i am almost close to settling with mysql over postgresql over the reasons i wrote on my blog here

8082868
postgresql	mysql
it s often said that mysql is the most used rdbms among those that are available for free alongside postgresql firebird etc

8082874
min	max
for min max scenarios i d want that as an option but obviously something like a sum would make it hard for the component to know what the source row it d tie to

8082907
post	get
in the same way i can get the user post

8082910
cgpoint	cgrect
there are four uiview methods which can help you converting cgpoint and cgrect from one uiview coordinate reference to another

8082941
int	double
then just remove the pointer reference out of the type and you just have a function type void int double

8082944
mousemove	mousedown	mousemove	mouseup	mouseup	mousedown
use a combination of mousedown mousemove and or mouseup to tell whether the div is being has been resized

8082944
mousemove	mousedown	mousemove	mouseup	mouseup	mousedown
if you don t need that you can simply not use mousemove at all and just measure the div in mousedown and mouseup and figure out if it was resized in the latter

8082956
debian	linux
and you could take a debian linux distribution and find all the compression utilities there

8083025
opencart	oscommerce	opencart	magento	magento	oscommerce
i tried to use open source ecommerce packages like opencart magento oscommerce etc

8083034
int	chars
i also read this in the documentation if the string does not contain any of the chars . e or e and the numeric value fits into int type limits as defined by php_int_max the string will be evaluated as an integer. so i m guessing it should not be below or the same as the value of php_int_max which is by far less than the strings i m evaluating above - assuming that s what they mean by fits into

8083041
width	height
you probably want to adjust the font height width and overflow

8083047
glulookat	glrotate
the glulookat function comes in handy when you want to position a classical camera but its functionality can also be achieved by calls to gltranslate and glrotate without problems and sometimes depending on your requirements this is even easier than artificially mapping your view parameters to glulookat parameters

8083047
glulookat	glrotate
after this gltranslate comes whatever other camera or scene transformations you already have be it glulookat or just some gltranslate glrotate glscale calls

8083053
switching	screens
my cursor does not blink by default i find that annoying but what i would like is this when the cursor jumps to the next match it should change color or blink briefly to draw attention to its placement on the screens then switching back to the default cursor behavior

8083083
int	chars
c naively defined all of its chars test functions for an int

8083083
int	chars
but chars s are often signed and a full chars often doesn t fit in an int or in any single storage-unit that used for strings

8083083
int	chars
similarly because isspace and it s ilk all take int and because the actual width of a chars is often unknown w o string-analysis - meaning that any modern chars library should essentially never be carting around chars s or wchar_t s but only pointers iterators since only by analyzing the chars stream can you know how much of it composes a single logical chars i am at a bit of a loss as to how best to approach the issues

8083112
google-perftools	pprof
there is a pprof utility in google-perftools package

8083122
accessor	properties
you should set it to null by using the properties set accessor

8083149
jruby	mri
i have used mri ruby 1.8.7 and rails 2.3 with the memcached gem and when experimenting with jruby and rails 2.3 i found the jruby-memcache-client gem had a good story and seemed to work well

8083191
hash	md5
for each database select query cache the result in apc with a ttl of 5 min md5 hash the select statement and use it as key for apc cache

8083208
versioning	upgrade
you should upgrade to a newer versioning of simplepie which is actively maintained and designed for modern versioning of php

8083239
udp	tcp
by definition tcp is a streaming protocol whereas udp is message based

8083276
button	checkbox
bind the new column s value to the array controller s arrangedobjects.title and turn off the checkbox button cell s title so only the checkbox itself is displayed

8083308
public	protected
also i noticed that the load method is protected and it looks like you re calling a public load method on t

8083308
public	protected
this could cause some confusion as to what methods are actually being called since you can t override a protected method with a public one compiler error inconsistent accessibility base class baseclass.protectedmethod is less accessible than class derivedclass.protectedmethod

8083312
ssl	https
possible ways http tunneling - may be used to connect to the mysql server it is a method of connecting to the server through http https protocol or using secure connection ssh ssl network protocol

8083334
pprof	callgrind
ps there are some other useful pprof commands like callgrind or gv which shows graphic representation of call tree with profiling information added

8083355
put	get
the get and put principle use an

8083355
put	get
when you both get and put

8083378
checkbox	dropdownlistfor
i have a controlresolver class that returns idynamiccontrol - for my purposes i have wrapper classes for asp.net textboxes checkbox and dropdownlistfor which implement idynamiccontrol dropdown implements idynamiclist

8083390
width	height
if the image s width in emus is greater than the max page width s i scale the image s width and height so that the width of image is equal to that of the page when i say page i m referring to the usable page that is minus the margins

8083390
width	height
i then use the width as the value of cx and height as the value of cy both in the dw.extent and in the a.extents of the a.transform2d of the pic.shapeproperties

8083451
for-loop	loops
is the for-loop a python loops cython or c

8083498
maven	cobertura
the answer to running integration tests with cobertura maven plugin did not work for me and also i would not want to call verify with every cobertura run but only for nightly coverage

8083540
post	get
then configure a custom flowurlhandler which appends the _token parameter to generated urls so if you have been using flowexecutionurl to reference your flows the token will appended whenever you post get back to your flow automatically

8083540
post	get
webflow and many other web frameworks don t distinguish between get and post - by default you generally can use a get to do whatever you do with a post unless you verify the request method yourself which would be a good idea anyway

8083540
post	get
so an attacker wanting to bypass your csrf filter would just do a get instead of a post

8083561
matplotlib	scipy
you can also try to package your numpy scipy matplotlib .

8083609
profiler	google-perftools
also there is a good heap profiler in google-perftools

8083609
gcov	gprof
needs no recompilation of application like it was needed with gprof gcov

8083609
pprof	callgrind
pprof even can draw via kcachegrind with callgrind command

8083638
folder	directory
if necessary you may set the output build folder for each source directory and clear eclipse s default bin output directory

8083653
qstring	qchar
i haven t been testing internationalization capabilities of qt library so much but from what i know qstring is fully unicode-aware and is using qchar s which are unicode-chars

8083659
int	chars
fgetc for example already returns either eof or a chars read as an unsigned chars and then converted to int so there s no sign-extension issue for values from that

8083659
serializable	deserialization
you can think of this as deserialization on input and serializable on output

8083677
toggleclass	slidetoggle
this toggleclass active .children div slidetoggle slow

8083687
dbcontext	objectcontext
you need to cast your dbcontext to iobjectcontextadapter so you can access the underlying objectcontext which gives you access to some more advanced features hidden by dbcontext

8083701
inherited	properties
background is a tricky one...because although it is not an inherited css properties changing an ancestor s background can alter a descendant s appearance if they have transparent backgrounds

8083731
for-loop	loops
not to mention that since you have in the condition part of your for-loop it s gotta loops through the entire enumerable every single time to get that count

8083786
mouse	keyboard
it doesn t respond to keyboard input but will still change the cursor once the mouse moves into the window

8083833
viewdidappear	viewwillappear
you can use the viewwillappear viewdidappear viewwilldisappear and viewdiddisappear in your view controllers

8083837
mouse	keyboard
unless that midi controller has some kind of a web-based interface that you can point a url at or the controller can insert its data into a normal keyboard mouse input stream then no you cannot use js to talk to it at all

8083838
hide	show
the problem is not deciding which row to show hide it s the actual code to hide show a row

8083838
hide	show
titanium api docs for tableviewrow list show and hide methods but they don t see to work

8083879
google-chrome	firefox
this page renders great in firefox google-chrome etc

8083908
swt	swing
griffon can run on different ui toolkits through plugins swing javafx swt pivot gtk

8083916
hide	show
i just do a simple show the message before the call and hide it on the success callback like this

8083928
daemons	systemd
i want to use the pear systemd daemons library to spurn a daemons and then spurn off processes within that daemons

8083929
hide	show
the easiest thing would be to wrap everything you want to show in a div then hide and show that div instead of hiding and showing the individual divs

8083929
hide	show
then you can just hide or show the #container box which would also hide show box 1 and box 2

8083929
hide	show
and finally the most exact solution would be to explicitly hide show those divs based on ids like so

8083951
post	put
i find this to be quite annoying as it doesn t really follow the rest architecture id like the option to be able to return response objects for post delete and put requests in some cases

8083972
uiview	uiwindow
say i want to do something which grabs the origin of a uiview with respect to the uiwindow instead

8083973
spaces	delimiter
i have a large txt file spaces delimiter which i split into 18 smaller files each with their own number of columns

8084014
folder	directory
is there some commend-line option for svn with which i can just ignore folder for which i am lacking checkout permissions and have it continue with the next directory

8084080
min	max
have you use the min and max functions

8084088
min	max
if so you will need to query and use the max and min functions for the dates

8084101
int	double
so i have 2d point structures of int and double which i need to manipulate

8084146
linefeed	delimiter
if you are able to edit the .csv file a workaround is that you can use a text editor such as ultra edit that supports wildcards or regular expressions in its find replace feature and replace each carriage return linefeed with a cr linefeed followed by ix quotes optional depending on if you want to specify a text delimiter on insert

8084147
post	get
i have tried to get post and echo the variable in the update.php script into the edit.php script redirect but with no luck

8084161
int	double
xna s point structures are all single-precision float where wpf s are double precision and gdi+ are mixed sometimes int values

8084178
multiplying	add
if i have that total of items i can multiplying the 456 by 1 000 and add it to the 329 to get the total number of items

8084178
division	modulo
there are faster methods but the compiler usually turns the above division and remainder modulo operations into more efficient bitwise logic operations so you don t need to worry about it generally

8084191
hide	show
if you are trying to show hide from code behind server side you can make the row a server control and set its visible property

8084352
google-chrome	firefox
anyway i am not able with google-chrome nor with firefox and firebug to see the up to date dom source code of course the rendering in the browser is fine

8084356
hide	show
as long as the provider you are using for mysql covers all of the same methods you can do a quick google search and find tons of sites showing how to show hide bits based on roles

8084383
post	put	post	get	put	get
all that readings lead me to use the webappdebug template make some actions and respond to get post put delete with some json objects

8084402
postgresql	mysql
perhaps you might consider switching to a fast dbms like postgresql or mysql or perhaps you could use gdbm

8084461
int	double
cvapproxpoly const void array 0x00000000 int header_size 88 cvmemstorage storage 0x017e7b40 int method 0 double parameter 3.0000000000000000 int parameter2 1 line 703 + 0x28 bytes c++

8084473
nstextview	nsscrollview
i have an nstextview inside an nsscrollview

8084485
hide	show
i know it sounds silly and should be identical behavior but have you tried the visible property instead of show and hide

8084495
stdout	stderr
i am having trouble figuring out how to redirect stdout stderr to the client

8084510
hlsl	glsl
i have been told by experienced shader developers that while cg is great for simple shaders it is advised to do glsl hlsl directly for advanced shaders due to bugs in resultant shader code

8084533
onmousemove	onmouseup
i think you might get a better user experience by making the sliders change canvas onmouseup instead of onmousemove

8084540
realloc	malloc
and my limited understanding of the standards makes me think that an implementation which always return a null pointer for malloc and does nothing for realloc is still respecting the letter but not the spirit of the standards

8084547
realloc	malloc
you never know when realloc is going to allocate another memory block and copy data because there is no api that allows you to look at malloc internals and see if allocated region can be extended or shrunk

8084562
x86	64bit
will it put the .exe into the c program files x86 directory structure automatically or do i have to make allowances for 64bit versions of windows

8084623
voip	sip
to create this it s necesary - sip voip android.software.sip

8084635
firefox	safari
this ll probably require using javascript listeners eg window.onclose although apparently that doesn t work for safari or firefox 2 and within that an ajax xmlhttprequest to send the data to your server

8084770
openssl	gnutls	openssl	opensc	gnutls	opensc
both openssl and gnutls provide full x.509 ssl tls cryptographic functionality while also supporting smart cards via the opensc library

8084816
stdout	stderr
you just need to use dup2 to duplicate the socket s file descriptor onto the stderr and stdout file descriptors

8084849
width	height
i m playing with qtgstreamer 0.10.0 and i m trying to retrieve the video size but it s returning zero for height and width values

8084866
width	height
the width of page is fixed but the height will be dynamic

8084900
post	get
this will move all the data from _post to _session post for future use in the template and should be all you need to get it working

8084946
subtract	add
how do i add subtract two time objects

8084973
rss	feed
time passes more quickly when you have something interesting to read so i pulled in rss feed in an ajaxy fashion from different news sites while the web app polled the queue for process-completion in the background

8084985
public	protected
this class would friend foo and provide protected access to secret thus allowing foo to access secret without exposing secret to the public user through inclusion of foo.h

8084989
jar	manifest.mf
not to bother with -classpath parameter you could put references to the jar files into the manifest.mf of your application jar if it s you application of course

8085000
subtract	add
you can easily subtract and add datetime and find out interval easily

8085062
width	height
imagemagick is not identifying the correct width x height for .jpg images

8085135
vsto	add-in
in a vsto outlook add-in produces a similar document object which i m able to use with my existing application

getter	setter
according to this answer here getter and setter

8085149
public	protected
also notice i made them protected not public

8085184
getter	setter
however this is not how magic getter and setter work in the first place

8085207
folder	directory
has anyone successfully installed umbraco 4.7 into a sub folder or virtual directory

8085207
folder	directory
what i find happens every time is it can never find the umbtopnavigation.xslt when i install the starter kit i find out after changing skins it creates a sub directory in my umbraco folder with the same name as the install folder so if my virtual directory points to c apps umbracotest it creates a folder c apps umbracotest umbracotest which has the xslt folder css scripts images etc

8085212
imperative	declarative
programmers are used to the imperative procedural style of c like languages and fail to comprehend the declarative set based nature of sql

a jar file for your war in fact this is the war with the classes in web-inf classes a jar file for your ejbs and a jar file for the 3rd type we ll call that a library

8088403
jar	war
but neither the war nor ejb depend on each other as they don t share anything directly only indirectly through the 3rd library jar

8088403
jar	war
the lib jar is stand alone since it doesn t have any dependency on either the war or ejbs

8088403
jar	war
in your ear you simply bundle the lib jar the war and the ejb jar along with a meta-inf dir and an application.xml file

8088403
jar	war
the war has its own structure with the web-inf and all the ejb jar has its meta-inf and ejb-jar.xml

8088403
jar	war
for example if you have say a simple static singleton in your lib jar then both the war and ejbs will share that singleton since they re all part of the same class loader

8088403
