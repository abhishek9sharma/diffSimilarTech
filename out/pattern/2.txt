with the boo solution you can choose between compiled scripts or using the interpreter and boo makes a nice scripting language has a flexible syntax and an extensible language via its open compiler architecture

my opinion is that vb is more productive then c# it seems it is always ahead in terms of productivity tools such as intelisense and i would recommend vb over c# to someone that asks

i would definitely choose svn over cvs if only because people who learned source control using cvs tend to use svn delete then svn add instead of svn move

be careful with this - you should favor composition over inheritance
14821
there is no compelling reason to choose ftp over http anymore and there are a few small advantages to http as others have pointed out

i would strongly recommend against this

sadly tinymce doesn t come with the image manager or document manager integrated like fckeditor but you must buy them as plugins form moxiecode

another thing to note is that you should never select all as this might lead to unexpected results later on if you add or remove columns to this table
