once you ve figured out which process es have the file locked you ll need to safely inject a small native dll into the process you can also inject a managed dll but this is messier as you then have to start or attach to the .net runtime

it s trivial to do if the search and replace strings are the same length or the replace string is shorter than the search string since i have enough space allocated

i certainly believe that being enough familiar with java plus some experience programming with a dynamic language is more than enough if you plan to do serious development with grails
5132
i have never used grails or rails before but i have used groovy and ruby before and as a language i think ruby is much cleaner and more consistent and the team might enjoy production more

but designing a server to handle that many pageviews is more than just saying our server should handle 300 000 000 000 pageviews it should contain a very detailed specification for how it can do that right down to processing time guarantees and disk access average times

accessibility is important and maintaining semantic x html is much easier than maintaining table layouts but that #1 spot on google will bring home the bacon

i think it s important to realize is that the whole system is diff-based a merge is nothing more than automatically applying the changes that have been made in one branch to the code in another branch instead of correcting the code yourself

given my lack of experience with variadic parameters in c i m not sure if you can use this with a function pointer but this gives even more flexibility than the first solution albeit still with the lack of type safety
11657
you design stuff it might look like an existing pattern you name it that way so everyone understand what you are talking about and the rationale behind your design decision is stronger knowing it has been discussed ad nauseum before

my concern is that a dvcs makes it easier to not share your work since you don t have the drawbacks of not sharing your work you get with svn
27134
if the friction of not sharing is lower than the friction of not sharing which it is in dvcs a developer all else being equal might easily choose the path of least friction

in a one off situation where i just need it here i think using some handrolled reflection code is a better approach than having an additional library to link against and only calling it one place.

in most regards postgresql is slower than mysql especially when it comes to fine tuning in the end

there are other methods of interpolation that sometimes work better
27537
however if you have just two separate programs but want to run them as single application then i guess ikvm is a better approach as suggested by marxidad

so on some level it is easier to reason about order of evaluation with respect to one function at a time
28312
from my experience the only thing that matters is which one is easier to mock in unit tests

i always felt singleton is easier and natural to mock out

basically packer does a better job at initial compression but if you are going to gzip the files before sending on the wire which you should be doing yui compressor gets the smallest final size

the second is inverting the main colors white text on black background is much easier to stare at for hours in my opinion
29828
you could check that at insertion time or at retrieval time whatever makes more sense and throw an exception

in my experience the design and implementation has much more to do with performance than do the choice of language framework however the usual caveats apply eg don t write a device driver in c# or java
30799
programming to an interface rather then a direct implementation allows for more dynamic and manageable code as you can completely swap out implementations as long as the contract is still held
30805
while the change wasn t necessarily prompted by the language i feel that the fck editor is a better choice because of it s versatility

asp.net makes it easier to follow function calls around so you might start by breaking out your larger code blocks into several smaller functions

price generally has higher cardinality
31615
this is because fewer cars will satisfy the price point than the color choice giving the query engine far less data to analyze
31631
git is even easier to set up and use than subversion and doesn t require a server component
31632
tfs is far better than vss though it is fairly expensive for such a small team
31693
i keep reading that java made the wrong decision or that .net has better implementations etc
31732
it s a distributed system like git but seems easier to use and seems far better supported on windows the latter of which was crucial for me
31866
in some ways this is much cleaner - if you need to use a collection in c# there is really very little reason to go with the non-generic version but those legacy classes remain in place cluttering up the landscape

i fiddled around with the scriptmanager suggestions - which i reckon i would have eventually got working but it seems to me that the timer idea is easier to implement and not really
33246
writing in file is slower than writing in memory so a commit will be slower if performed for many operations in a row rather then for a set of coalesced updates
33563
this page has more details on the differences

yes caching to a database is slower than caching on your webserver
33746
the reason i suggested the first is that the size of the file created is much smaller

i ve recently started using it and although i like its minimalistic interface it makes it harder to stumble upon cool features if you don t know what you re looking for

i m not sure which is worse though sending a phantom click to an invisible submit button or calling eval on the getattribute onsubmit call after removing the return call with a javascript string replacement

nant is an older and more mature build scripting language but they are both similar in how they work

i now feel that templateresponse and view decorators is a better answer for decomposing view code
34163
i don t think either of the two methods is necessarily easier to read as long as you stick to it

in that case it becomes much easier to have a single pace which attaches events rather than having to search many different html files to find where a particular function is called

html is harder since there s traditionally not been as much interest in validation among the html crowd run stackoverflow itself through a validator yikes
35606
edit okay according to ntfs has more green boxes than both ufs1 and ufs2
35627
also since you mentioned grep if all the source code for system libraries such as the kernel and libc is stored in usr local src doing a recursive grep for a particular error message coming from the guts of some system library is much simpler than if things were laid out as usr local library-name bin|src|doc|etc
35677
i ve heard of an xmpp gateway protocol but it s unclear if this is any better than the client solution
35756
the last one doxygen is more of an automatic documentation tool but it is capable of generating dependency graphs and inheritance diagrams

in my opinion python is more than ready for developing complex applications

cons as a dynamic language has way worse ide support proper syntax completion requires static typing whether explicit in java or inferred in sml its object system is far from perfect interfaces anyone

this makes it easier to tie up exceptions on a client back to your app box by using logparser displaylang en

for 15 000 points you probably have a much smaller map - i first sized it up as a first step to doing lat-lon to postcode searches which needs higher resolution
36122
language doesn t matter to me this is more of a theory question than anything so use whatever language you want just try to keep it to generally popular and current languages
36186
i think this is a better question and someone suggested i hope this question will allow others to join in and suggest other tools or give specific recommendation to using version que versus other tools

i find the c++ behaviour makes more sense since base class c-tors are called first it stands to reason that they should call base class virtual functions--after all the derived class c-tor hasn t run yet so it may not have set up the right preconditions for the derived class virtual function

to illustrate this the chance of me hitting the letter e in this comment is much higher than that of z so if i were to use key interrupts as a source of entropy it would be bias - but there is still some randomness to be had in that input

this is more of a how-to-implement tip but i started dabbling with creating an activerecord datamapper implementation in php and quickly ran into many hurdles with array-like access

the movement to the subprocess module would have been an opportune time to rename them but i guess that keeping popen makes it easier to find in the docs for those who have a long history with python or even to the venerable posix functions

soap is nothing more than an updated version of the same principles defined with c and c contracts providers consumers etc.
38519
it s just that has appeared to soap succeed at least partially where the other two failed and it could be that soap just has a better marketing team that is that soap really does allow to different systems to connect rather easily compared to it s predecessors

so the question one should be asking is not which of these two operations is faster it is which of these two operations expresses more accurately what you are trying to accomplish

this is harder to do in applications that are only in maintenance mode because it is hard to convince management that rewriting something that is already working is worth doing
40350
first this is much easier if both the server and your workstation are on the same domain the server needs access to connect to your machine
40381
also you re likely going to be doing the same amount of work that you were going to do if you just started from scratch but you might have an easier time trying to convince your bosses that this is a better approach
