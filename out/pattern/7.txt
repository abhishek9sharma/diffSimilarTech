it sounds like .net 2.0 does this better thank goodness but honestly i never had time to go back and check

once you ve figured out which process es have the file locked you ll need to safely inject a small native dll into the process you can also inject a managed dll but this is messier as you then have to start or attach to the .net runtime

it s trivial to do if the search and replace strings are the same length or the replace string is shorter than the search string since i have enough space allocated

the big-o is still o n even though we might find our number the first try and run through the loop once because big-o describes the upper bound for an algorithm omega is for lower bound and theta is for tight bound

i certainly believe that being enough familiar with java plus some experience programming with a dynamic language is more than enough if you plan to do serious development with grails
5132
i have never used grails or rails before but i have used groovy and ruby before and as a language i think ruby is much cleaner and more consistent and the team might enjoy production more

there is an express version on ssms that has considerably fewer features but still has the basics

but designing a server to handle that many pageviews is more than just saying our server should handle 300 000 000 000 pageviews it should contain a very detailed specification for how it can do that right down to processing time guarantees and disk access average times

accessibility is important and maintaining semantic x html is much easier than maintaining table layouts but that #1 spot on google will bring home the bacon

one thing i m kind of proud of is how to mark your spam as read this is for courier imap and maildir where read means move to different folder and change the filename

i think it s important to realize is that the whole system is diff-based a merge is nothing more than automatically applying the changes that have been made in one branch to the code in another branch instead of correcting the code yourself

if you can move to sql server 2008 you can take advantage of the filestream support which gives you the best of both - the files are stored in the filesystem but the database integration is much better than just storing a filepath in a varchar field

given my lack of experience with variadic parameters in c i m not sure if you can use this with a function pointer but this gives even more flexibility than the first solution albeit still with the lack of type safety
11657
you design stuff it might look like an existing pattern you name it that way so everyone understand what you are talking about and the rationale behind your design decision is stronger knowing it has been discussed ad nauseum before
12351
but again this is a bigger issue
12571
if your full codebase is closer to 70-80 coverage you are doing a good job

obviously some profiling will be needed to ensure this is actually faster than regeneration - forcing the web server back to disk regularly can be detrimental so the resource really does need to have heavy reuse

while both these hold the same information the second list is larger and slower

using an outliner i can keep increasing the level of detail and easily move these details around as the solution becomes clearer

if you know another way to copy and otherwise work with data from a store you might as well use it but using the cmdlets provides a better learn-once use-often approach

consistently well formatted code is easier to read and code that is easier to read is easier to maintain
14655
oh and rob i completely agree -- this is more than likely a limitation of my design and not the language

it s also easier to make backups - cloning a repository to another location machine disk means i can just push the changes to that location which is even easier with a default push repository

so this is much easier to maintain than having one different server application for each client
15277
in this case it is easier to push one new sproc but in my experience 95 of pushed changes affect the code and not the database

using ints is generally better than using shorts because java uses 32-bit values internally anyway even for bytes unless in an array so using ints will avoid unnecessary conversion to from short values in the bytecode

another reason to prefer string.format is that .net strings are immutable and doing it this way creates fewer temporary intermediate copies
16457
i actually like the first one because when there are a lot of variables intermingled with the text it seems easier to read to me

this is for reasons similar to the reasons it s good to learn c like how a strcpy takes more time than copying an integer or why you should use pointers to arrays as function parameters instead of arrays by value
