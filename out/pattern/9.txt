don t get me wrong if you are a beginner books on patterns will show you how a solution is best solved using their patterns rather than another flawed design
11969
that being said you should probably try them out with the particular environment and apps you will be using and see which one is best for you
12400
in some cases i ve found that a bespoke solution is most appropriate or leveraged technologies such msmq to keep costs down
