it is definitely more mac-like than carbon emacs

pyqt - based on qt also very popular and more stable than wxwidgets but costly license for commercial projects
3751
database storage is usually more expensive than file system storage
3829
powershell scripts might be useful too and surely more flexible than xcopy and other dos commands

as lubos suggested you d be doing yourself a favour to look at c# but if you re much more comfortable with java then there shouldn t be any real limitations as the jdbc connector is supported by microsoft
6785
would that be as efficient or any more efficient as having
9650
while i d also like to become more familiar with emacs if only not to be frustrated when i work with somebody who uses emacs i d rather decouple learning emacs from learning lisp

tag xml based ui would seem to be a bit more portable than winforms
11136
it supports embedding images and tables as well as text opens by default using microsoft word and whilst it s featureset is more limited count out any advanced formatting for something that looks and feels and opens like a word document it s not far off
11301
it s more tricky to wrap your head around it but invaluable feature probably to me definitively even more ground-breaking feature than linq itself
12409
but i get the impression you re actually more concerned with performance which isn t really the preserve of unit testing at all

jari komppa has a good tutorial about them but you could use a more object-oriented approach with c++ than the c code he presents
14296
i think most users even today are more familiar with http than ftp and for that reason you should stick with http by default unless there s a compelling reason to use ftp
15091
technically ruby is more sophisticated than java or c# being closer to smalltalk in terms of oo purity and closer to lisp in terms of meta-programming facilities
17713
i suspect that a ss js solution that supports more recent ecma specs would be no more cumbersome than using other scripting languages for the task
19110
most of the time writing the code itself is quicker and more effective than writing about the code because their programming intuition is tuned to the task
19245
is iis 7.0 much more stable than iis 6.0
20966
most of the time writing the code itself is quicker and more effective than writing about the code because their programming intuition is tuned to the task
21093
but i ve found that when executing 1000 concatenations or less string.join is even more efficient than stringbuilder
22074
in my mind illegalargumentexception seems more specific than using a npe since it s telling me that the problem was with an argument i passed to the method and not with a value that may have been generated while performing the method
22824
i believe this is more efficient than casting back and forth
25455
or is there at least a way that s more efficient than using plain text boxes
26600
edit i kept thinking after posting because it s a little more complicated than sizeof for valuetypes for example reference types can have references to other objects and so on.
26851
if anything i find working with svn easier and more intuitive than perforce
26851
perforce does have support for many other oses but our non-windows devs feel more comfortable with svn too
27756
if such a function exists use it it is almost guaranteed to be more reliable and more efficient than any hand-crafted code
27942
i m embarking on a path to becoming more familiar with c c++ but should i go much lower than that into assembly
29557
i ve read time and time again that tdd test first is more difficult with mstest than it is with other testing frameworks such as nunit mbunit etc.
30415
it s much more flexible than partitioning or lvm
31425
the long answer expanding on what the op said is to be more compatible with apache and mysql postgresql
32675
to me padding just sounds more inner than margin
33729
the reason why they chickened out was that java was significantly older and more widespread than .net when they introduced generics
36769
he told me that symbian was the worst of the lot - it caused far more headache than any other mobile platform
36914
something like jquery or yahoo s yui think how many people hit the yahoo javascript in a day and the variety of browsers is just way more road-tested than any snippet you or i come up with
38089
in my experience these things lead to more evil bugs than any effective performance increases
38335
it s slightly more complicated than this
38645
is there a more efficient way than using fieldnames and a for loop
38965
and normally database space is much more expensive than file system space
39138
they re both a little old and more nxy than windows
40509
you probably can find some balance point at which maintaining the buffer is more costly than processing all the cells
41046
actually the trace macro is a lot more flexible than outputdebugstring
41277
it s more complex than with codeigniter but there s already a primer on how to do exactly that in the zf documentation
42945
the argument is more complex than this read yegge s article is weak typing strong enough for an interesting overview
43729
for it is more complex as this is multiline pattern
44216
of course things are a lot easier especially when you want to do more complicated things with jquery
44513
in an sql query is not really more troublesome than typing select businessname from .
44789
it is not a requirement that the work translates extremely well to gpu programming as we are willing to accept modest performance improvements better little than nothing right
45695
ok so i demo d refactor pro and resharper i m more comfortable with resharper so that s what i bought
46005
clearly i m leaving out details like how to determine when you reach the end of the file in the event that your file isn t a multiple of page_size for instance but it really shouldn t be much more complicated than this
47168
context while it s true that http overhead is more significant than parsing js and css ignoring the impact of parsing on browser performance even if you have less than a meg of js is a good way to get yourself in trouble
47304
you can do some more powerful things with named url patterns they re very handy
47577
emacs.app feels more zippy than aquamacs to me but its just bare cvs-emacs and doesn t come with the same amount of stuff you have to install your own auctex etc.
47601
it is more addictive than stack overflow - i ve found that with my google type habits - i need the more expensive subscription so i can look at any book at any time - but i d recommend the trial to anyone even remotely interested
47972
how is duck-typing more productive than static typing
47977
it s not that duck typing is more productive than static typing as much as it is simply different
48016
there are some things that you can do in emacs that make it more powerful than vi but not all of them are even programming-related
48016
since i posted this i have come across ways that using emacs has made me more productive than using vi
49482
depending on your needs awk is more flexible than cut
