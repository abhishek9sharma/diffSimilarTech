you lose views stored procedures trigger etc but it isn t hard to copy a table that only uses base types from one db to another.
135
if you are just copying data and or you need custom code anyway to convert between modified schemas between the two db s i would recommend using php 5.2+ and the pdo libraries
195
i recommend setting the create one file per object on the options tab you can then commit these text files to svn and make use of svn s diff and logging functions
583
personally i prefer int string double etc
629
the page also recommends using lambda unless you specifically want the error tolerant behavior
723
thanks to this surprising behavior as well as less typing i tend to favor using lambda over proc.new when making procs
798
i would also recommend rhino mocks if you are doing any sort of tdd
835
documentation is rather sparse and google und mainly offers modifying the .sln project file which is what i want to avoid in order to be able to manually build this project later - i would really prefer p outputpath
1073
also sanity checks such as verify your run-time libraries match release vs
1226
c and c++ compilers will generate a warning when you compare signed and unsigned types
1276
at what point does a mysql database start to lose performance
1337
i prefer syncback as it allows you to set up very explicit rules for just about every possible case and conflict at least more so than the other two
1340
do you mean that from a set of n colors you need to pick m colors where m n such that m is the best representation of the n colors in the m space
1646
i prefer scripting it to avoid the mistakes you can make using the management studio
1669
i am most familiar with c c++ java and ruby so i prefer resources that involve one of those three but any good resource is acceptable
1971
i think programmer comfort is my main reason to choose python but i think perl is still better supported
2017
i would generally recommend svk over plain subversion anyway as it makes a lot of things nicer
2333
choose text status display in the category pane then check the option show line numbers and close the preferences
2360
go to system preferences keyboard and mouse then choose keyboard shortcuts
2544
optionally when you are finished debugging and starting to make changes you can go to the debug menu and choose either stop debugging or terminate all
2560
i would recommend using flash and it s flv video file format for embedding your video unless you have very specific requirements as far as video quality or drm
2712
i can recommend confluence and here is why
2767
can anyone recommend any good add-ons plugins for microsoft visual studio
3026
right click on your code click on insert snippet ctrl + k x and then choose prop form the list
3043
the set is x which still matches rule 2 one + number of items in
3119
i am not aware of any plugin that does it natively especially since mono users seem to prefer monodevelop
3428
if just an ide i would recommend netbeans or radrails
3659
personally i prefer xhtml 1.0 transitional
3751
databases win out where transactional integrity between the image and metadata are important
3862
if you re working on a project i heavily recommend using a distributed vcs
3862
i recommend git because it s blazingly fast but is has been criticized as being too hard to use
3929
this might be a bit of a long shot but if you re using or planning on using sql server 2008 i d recommend having a look at the new filestream data type
4037
i d recommend subsonic if your project works with the activerecord view that the database is your model
4219
it s hard to beat apache subversion free
4284
i don t know of any free sms services you usually buy bulk sms seses and use an api to send them out
4403
i recommend go with xenph yan above and just create an new one
4597
if you do choose this route however you ll no doubt have to learn xaml which is a markup language that drives wpf applications
4753
here s a link to download the consolas ttf files if you want to install this mac win linux
4931
both are annoyances so you get to choose which you think will annoy your users less
5022
i myself prefer svn but this is a good one for quick use
5417
so my answer to the poster is no there is no business reason to prefer css over tables
5519
if you re going to be using linqtosql for development i would recommend using an int as a primary key
5598
wsdl is popular for code generation but for front ends like php and rails they seem to prefer rest
5962
i prefer partial classes as opposed to regions
6078
when it comes to full-text searching for my money nothing beats lucene
6120
compare each companyname to each locationname and come up with a match score use levenshtein or some other string matching algo
6161
i would also recommend json as being the most compact text-based format
6502
you can compare this with the timezone rules you think you should be using
6659
but i would recommend unitils a great wrapper for junit testng dbunit easymock regardless of which route you take
6738
i believe your best solution is to buy find a set of icons for use in your projects
7005
i would say that unless your application is a quick an dirty one-off you will gain immense flexibility and end up with a better design if you choose wcf
7112
i would recommend using background images
7129
then from the develop menu choose show web inspector and click on the console link
7211
as i d potentially have to do this more than once i d be grateful if anyone could recommend any useful tools or at least any easily-replicated method
7484
i also prefer lambda because it s less typing than proc.new -
7497
i highly recommend this tool very useful for the price.
7557
instead of j# i would rather prefer ikvm to convert my jars to .net assemblies as well as access java apis in c#
7908
this is fine for editing a record or displaying a record but if you want to say display a list of the cities for all the contacts in your database you could do select city from ... and only get the cities
7999
i was always bad at design but after reading a lot about usability simplicity design and starting to analyse google s design and other designs based on simplicity my uis started to suck less
8006
you could probably also jigger this to print from a web browser that you run from the service though i d recommend building your own shell ie rather than using a full browser
8034
if you want to restore the database to the very latest data like if your doing a system disaster recovery and you cannot lose any data then you want to restore that backup and then all the transaction logs created since that backup
8264
from there you can select which exceptions break
8433
i prefer using firebug for projects i can t use visual studio 2008 on
8436
to save an icon you can right-click on the icon in the folder tree and choose export
8727
if you have nix experience and are developing on windows i would recommend using it for that simply because you ll only have to remember one set of commands
8747
also if you could please recommend any books on the subject that you find useful
8756
i ve looked at templates like the one joe hewitt has made and also seen some templates i can purchase which i haven t done yet
8780
if the per-record processing load is not high you may be surprised how little performance you lose file io will almost certainly be handled in a compiled c library so the interpreter overhead may be relatively low
8790
the reason i need this is that in my utils build file the step to select which code to copy to the jar is based on relative paths so as to avoid hardcoding paths in my ant file
8964
on the mac i recommend using firefox camino
9018
i need to do hard resets regularly which means that i lose this information and spend a lot of time setting
9026
i ve got 3 scanners on this machine and the twain drivers software for all of them suck like blocking the screen during scanning
9031
plus i would recommend this since you are trying to be careful and use a machine close to your production environment
9152
there s lots of stuff that i d add to it in terms of better reports searching and the like but i can definitely recommend fogbugz
9218
it s important to follow security best practices wherever possible but you don t want to make things unduly difficult for yourself or lose sleep worrying about keeping up with the latest exploits
9222
if it contains enormous amounts of text xml or binary blobs then take the time to select each column individually
9260
you can buy external esata raid boxes in the 8tb capacity range for 2600
9589
i m looking for a tool which can generate makefile for a c c++ project for different compilers gcc microsoft vc++ borland etc and different platforms win linux mac
9594
yes i highly recommend this one
9713
i recommend using the second with the modification that you store the system and user values in one table
10197
actually linq has skip and take methods which can be combined to choose which records are fetched
10232
they do a great job for us and i would highly recommend using maven over ant
10232
so if you re in that position i would recommend using the flexunit tasks available here ant task
10260
can anyone recommend any new killer asp.net features that might have gone unnoticed
10456
the click sound in question is actually a system wide preference so i only want it to be disabled when my application has focus and then re-enable when the application closes loses focus
10558
i favor python but both are pretty simple
10664
i would thoroughly recommend ndepend for static analysis but just be warned that you ll probably need to put aside a day or two to actually analyse the truckload of information that it provides as well as work out what all the stats actually mean in terms of your code
10705
i prefer this version for its conciseness and ability to add in new tick points
10726
personally i prefer scons over both of them
10729
ical can be complicated so i recommend using a library
11053
rather than the somewhat standard single character aliases i tend to favor short word aliases so the above example s sql ends up looking like
11064
personally i prefer aliases and unless i have a lot of tables they tend to be single letter ones
11474
i would recommend using drop-downs for dates as indicated above
11588
sharepoint lets you create tons of separate wikis but i d recommend having one big wiki for everything
11662
of course someone that knows he prefers c# won t ask and c# is probably the right choice for him
12292
categorization of templates depends on settings for example if you choose c# settings all of a sudden all other languages move to an other languages tree
12351
choose any three
12379
what i did when i had a similar problem to solve was trying to guess regular expressions to match lines
12400
in my experience it s difficult to beat biztalk 2006 r2 for bang for the buck but it does imply the use of a microsoft technology stack
12574
then hopefully they re updated after the implementation is done so that they match what actually was done implementation never matches design exactly
12586
the rss brand very much defines the entire feed category though so on the rare occasion that someone does know enough to choose they will tend to choose rss because it s got the name. they will also tend to choose rss 2.0 because it s got the bigger number
12586
the rss brand very much defines the entire feed category though so on the rare occasion that someone does know enough to choose they will tend to choose rss because it s got the name. they will also tend to choose rss 2.0 because it s got the bigger number
12680
i would recommend this book
12785
i would recommend having a suite of tests that runs the timer as well as the real action
12927
going forward i went ahead and added the eclipse profiler plugin and i ll be looking over the different open source profilers to compare functionality
12938
i personally prefer having choices
12980
i recommend either or both of which also give you variable storage like memcache
13038
i recommend which was my inspiration for trying out testing-based development
13306
i d recommend testing it for yourself
13429
i recommend having a look at the programmers stone
13455
i would definitely choose svn over cvs if only because people who learned source control using cvs tend to use svn delete then svn add instead of svn move
13561
i need to display list of categories on every page and to be able to choose items from a specific category to be displayed
13569
i prefer pdo for the single reason that it allows named parameters for prepared statements and as far as i am aware mysqli does not
13580
so you call components action from view which then choose view to render
13607
could someone recommend any good resources for creating graphics user interfaces preferably in c c++
13861
choose show log under tortiosesvn
13886
if that means you choose labview go for it
14063
you could do this using system.reflection.emit however i d recommend mono.cecil
14124
the perl built-in is select which is a pass-through to the select system call but for sane people i recommend io select
14179
if you want something just a step above notepad for quick efficient editing i would recommend notepad2
14268
however if they have to download several files with one go i prefer ftp because it s much more easy to manage
14268
there are some nice broswer extensions as _l0ser mentioned but i prefer ftp for mass file-transfer
14273
be careful with this - you should favor composition over inheritance
14420
in mastering regular expressions from jeffrey friedl great book it is mentioned that you could use p letter which will match unicode stuff that is considered a letter
14483
it s easy while in the paper-and-pen or whatever non-code equivalent you prefer stage to overstay falling prey to the dreaded yagni syndrome
14488
some day i work in a company that use vss and in other companies that use other less unknow scm but i prefer use svn someday i ll try git for active development for me and my group
14510
it allowed you to choose any installed font to work in
14621
files that might need ability to compare versions
14706
i prefer using an ihttphandlerfactory implementation and have full control over all incoming urls and where they re mapped to
14821
there is no compelling reason to choose ftp over http anymore and there are a few small advantages to http as others have pointed out
14851
i would definitely recommend picking up a book or two if you are new to the field
15018
for interaction with svn i ll prefer ankhsvn
15072
i recommend bitnami for testing out different stacks
15323
while csla doesn t exactly match any of the patterns described in that book it most closely resembles active record although i feel it is short-sighted to claim an exact match for this pattern
15323
i didn t fully recommend csla for my last project because i believe the scope of the application is too large for the benefits csla provides
15343
regardless of the method you use make sure you manually destroy each of those items in the array before you delete pbuffer as you could end up with leaks
15385
amusing to note that microsoft designed the class designer to be a useful replacement to useless uml uml diagrams being untrustworthy once they lose synchronisation with source code
15630
it not only prevents update and delete without a where which you re not worried about but also adds an implicit limit 1000 to select statements and aborts selects that have joins and are estimated to consider over 1 000 000 tuples --- perfect for discouraging cartesian joins
16118
right-click the toolbox click choose items from the context menu browse to your dll and select it
16140
assuming i can pick any piece of the app what are some factors to consider that would make that piece better or worse as an osgi guinea pig
16218
i prefer using jquery for ajaxy stuff like that
16400
i prefer this anyway because debugging with the integrated web server can give you a very false impression of how your application will interact with the iis security model
16438
another reason to prefer string.format is that .net strings are immutable and doing it this way creates fewer temporary intermediate copies
16512
so i prefer having all the relevant parts visible at once instead of having to scroll to another method named something like checkmatrixatrow x
16567
i ve used both and prefer nant
16581
i have used both msbuild and nant and i much prefer msbuild mainly because it requires a lot less configuration by default
16591
i would highly recommend picking up a copy of effective java and reading through item 7 obeying the equals contract
16643
what this does is that it matches any character up to the point that it encounters an opening paranthesis
16643
if you do not want to match spaces only alphanumerical characters you could so something like this
16643
which would match any letter within a-z both upper- lower-case number as well as hyphens and underscores
16664
i use and recommend dreamhost for both their prices and customer service
16714
whether you choose xsd and or schematron depends on what you are trying to validate
16816
if you need to compare instances for equality then that is what you do
16871
i prefer distributed version control for personal projects because they eliminate the need for a server
16875
otherwise i would recommend using some sort of regex validation before accepting inputs from forms
16940
admittedly this might not be a problem on larger screens but my employer is abit tight and refuses to buy monitors larger than 19inch this means that i dont have much screen real estate to view all the visual studio windows and my code at the same time or two pieces of code at once
17041
i prefer var when the type is defined on the right side because it is more terse
17042
jeff wrote a post on this saying he favors var
17359
this would beat having to deal with very long email messages which contain header data and often have word-wrapping issues etc
17475
i highly recommend using a scripting language to complement c++ on day-to-day tasks
17665
i also do not recommend using hypervisor if you like usb devices
17744
i also recommend this book
17756
sun s java code style seem to prefer naming labels in the same way as variables meaning camel case with the first letter in lower case
17908
i meant that i d like the consumer to be able to choose which endpoint to bind to
18104
could anyone recommend any tools that can be used for this
18262
related but values are values are kept in separate columns and you have know your special types a head of time sql query to compare product sales by month
18307
which to choose depends on exactly what you re looking to do
18856
i recommend python as it s based on abc which was invented for the purpose of teaching programming
18959
for each partition found in proc partitions acquire drive serial number via hdio_get_identity syscall number of blocks from proc partitions and drive offset sys blocks drive_path partition_name start compare this to the windows information and if this matches - store a windows drive letter along with a linux device name
19010
the company loses nothing and gains a potential for gain mdash
19030
then i loop though each valid-filename regex if it matches append it to a valid dict if not do the same with the missing-ep-name regexs if it matches this i append it to an invalid dict with an error code 2 missing epsiode name if it matches neither it gets added to invalid with the malformed name error code
19030

19128
i don t like keeping it enabled because then it will instill hesitation in users to select any menu item in fear that they ll just get an error message making them feel stupid for not realizing that they couldn t possibly perform that operation at the time
19307
i would like to recommend this jquery plugin though jqmodal
19943
in conclusion i don t recommend switching from php but i do recommend accommodating the developer s interest in some way at work
