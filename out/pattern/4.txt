you lose views stored procedures trigger etc but it isn t hard to copy a table that only uses base types from one db to another.
135
if you are just copying data and or you need custom code anyway to convert between modified schemas between the two db s i would recommend using php 5.2+ and the pdo libraries
195
i recommend setting the create one file per object on the options tab you can then commit these text files to svn and make use of svn s diff and logging functions
583
personally i prefer int string double etc
629
the page also recommends using lambda unless you specifically want the error tolerant behavior
723
thanks to this surprising behavior as well as less typing i tend to favor using lambda over proc.new when making procs
798
i would also recommend rhino mocks if you are doing any sort of tdd
835
documentation is rather sparse and google und mainly offers modifying the .sln project file which is what i want to avoid in order to be able to manually build this project later - i would really prefer p outputpath
1073
also sanity checks such as verify your run-time libraries match release vs
1226
c and c++ compilers will generate a warning when you compare signed and unsigned types
1276
at what point does a mysql database start to lose performance
1337
i prefer syncback as it allows you to set up very explicit rules for just about every possible case and conflict at least more so than the other two
1340
do you mean that from a set of n colors you need to pick m colors where m n such that m is the best representation of the n colors in the m space
1646
i prefer scripting it to avoid the mistakes you can make using the management studio
1669
i am most familiar with c c++ java and ruby so i prefer resources that involve one of those three but any good resource is acceptable
1971
i think programmer comfort is my main reason to choose python but i think perl is still better supported
2017
i would generally recommend svk over plain subversion anyway as it makes a lot of things nicer
2333
choose text status display in the category pane then check the option show line numbers and close the preferences
2360
go to system preferences keyboard and mouse then choose keyboard shortcuts
2544
optionally when you are finished debugging and starting to make changes you can go to the debug menu and choose either stop debugging or terminate all
2560
i would recommend using flash and it s flv video file format for embedding your video unless you have very specific requirements as far as video quality or drm
2712
i can recommend confluence and here is why
2767
can anyone recommend any good add-ons plugins for microsoft visual studio
3026
right click on your code click on insert snippet ctrl + k x and then choose prop form the list
3043
the set is x which still matches rule 2 one + number of items in
3119
i am not aware of any plugin that does it natively especially since mono users seem to prefer monodevelop
3428
if just an ide i would recommend netbeans or radrails
3659
personally i prefer xhtml 1.0 transitional
3751
databases win out where transactional integrity between the image and metadata are important
3862
if you re working on a project i heavily recommend using a distributed vcs
3862
i recommend git because it s blazingly fast but is has been criticized as being too hard to use
3929
this might be a bit of a long shot but if you re using or planning on using sql server 2008 i d recommend having a look at the new filestream data type
4037
i d recommend subsonic if your project works with the activerecord view that the database is your model
4219
it s hard to beat apache subversion free
4284
i don t know of any free sms services you usually buy bulk sms seses and use an api to send them out
4403
i recommend go with xenph yan above and just create an new one
4597
if you do choose this route however you ll no doubt have to learn xaml which is a markup language that drives wpf applications
4753
here s a link to download the consolas ttf files if you want to install this mac win linux
4931
both are annoyances so you get to choose which you think will annoy your users less
5022
i myself prefer svn but this is a good one for quick use
5417
so my answer to the poster is no there is no business reason to prefer css over tables
5519
if you re going to be using linqtosql for development i would recommend using an int as a primary key
5598
wsdl is popular for code generation but for front ends like php and rails they seem to prefer rest
5962
i prefer partial classes as opposed to regions
6078
when it comes to full-text searching for my money nothing beats lucene
6120
compare each companyname to each locationname and come up with a match score use levenshtein or some other string matching algo
6161
i would also recommend json as being the most compact text-based format
6502
you can compare this with the timezone rules you think you should be using
6659
but i would recommend unitils a great wrapper for junit testng dbunit easymock regardless of which route you take
6738
i believe your best solution is to buy find a set of icons for use in your projects
7005
i would say that unless your application is a quick an dirty one-off you will gain immense flexibility and end up with a better design if you choose wcf
7112
i would recommend using background images
7129
then from the develop menu choose show web inspector and click on the console link
7211
as i d potentially have to do this more than once i d be grateful if anyone could recommend any useful tools or at least any easily-replicated method
7484
i also prefer lambda because it s less typing than proc.new -
7497
i highly recommend this tool very useful for the price.
7557
instead of j# i would rather prefer ikvm to convert my jars to .net assemblies as well as access java apis in c#
7908
this is fine for editing a record or displaying a record but if you want to say display a list of the cities for all the contacts in your database you could do select city from ... and only get the cities
7999
i was always bad at design but after reading a lot about usability simplicity design and starting to analyse google s design and other designs based on simplicity my uis started to suck less
8006
you could probably also jigger this to print from a web browser that you run from the service though i d recommend building your own shell ie rather than using a full browser
8034
if you want to restore the database to the very latest data like if your doing a system disaster recovery and you cannot lose any data then you want to restore that backup and then all the transaction logs created since that backup
8264
from there you can select which exceptions break
8433
i prefer using firebug for projects i can t use visual studio 2008 on
8436
to save an icon you can right-click on the icon in the folder tree and choose export
8727
if you have nix experience and are developing on windows i would recommend using it for that simply because you ll only have to remember one set of commands
8747
also if you could please recommend any books on the subject that you find useful
8756
i ve looked at templates like the one joe hewitt has made and also seen some templates i can purchase which i haven t done yet
8780
if the per-record processing load is not high you may be surprised how little performance you lose file io will almost certainly be handled in a compiled c library so the interpreter overhead may be relatively low
8790
the reason i need this is that in my utils build file the step to select which code to copy to the jar is based on relative paths so as to avoid hardcoding paths in my ant file
8964
on the mac i recommend using firefox camino
9018
i need to do hard resets regularly which means that i lose this information and spend a lot of time setting
9026
i ve got 3 scanners on this machine and the twain drivers software for all of them suck like blocking the screen during scanning
9031
plus i would recommend this since you are trying to be careful and use a machine close to your production environment
9152
there s lots of stuff that i d add to it in terms of better reports searching and the like but i can definitely recommend fogbugz
9218
it s important to follow security best practices wherever possible but you don t want to make things unduly difficult for yourself or lose sleep worrying about keeping up with the latest exploits
9222
if it contains enormous amounts of text xml or binary blobs then take the time to select each column individually
9260
you can buy external esata raid boxes in the 8tb capacity range for 2600
9589
i m looking for a tool which can generate makefile for a c c++ project for different compilers gcc microsoft vc++ borland etc and different platforms win linux mac
9594
yes i highly recommend this one
9713
i recommend using the second with the modification that you store the system and user values in one table
10197
actually linq has skip and take methods which can be combined to choose which records are fetched
10232
they do a great job for us and i would highly recommend using maven over ant
10232
so if you re in that position i would recommend using the flexunit tasks available here ant task
10260
can anyone recommend any new killer asp.net features that might have gone unnoticed
10456
the click sound in question is actually a system wide preference so i only want it to be disabled when my application has focus and then re-enable when the application closes loses focus
10558
i favor python but both are pretty simple
10664
i would thoroughly recommend ndepend for static analysis but just be warned that you ll probably need to put aside a day or two to actually analyse the truckload of information that it provides as well as work out what all the stats actually mean in terms of your code
10705
i prefer this version for its conciseness and ability to add in new tick points
10726
personally i prefer scons over both of them
10729
ical can be complicated so i recommend using a library
11053
rather than the somewhat standard single character aliases i tend to favor short word aliases so the above example s sql ends up looking like
11064
personally i prefer aliases and unless i have a lot of tables they tend to be single letter ones
11474
i would recommend using drop-downs for dates as indicated above
11588
sharepoint lets you create tons of separate wikis but i d recommend having one big wiki for everything
11662
of course someone that knows he prefers c# won t ask and c# is probably the right choice for him
12292
categorization of templates depends on settings for example if you choose c# settings all of a sudden all other languages move to an other languages tree
12351
choose any three
12379
what i did when i had a similar problem to solve was trying to guess regular expressions to match lines
12400
in my experience it s difficult to beat biztalk 2006 r2 for bang for the buck but it does imply the use of a microsoft technology stack
12574
then hopefully they re updated after the implementation is done so that they match what actually was done implementation never matches design exactly
12586
the rss brand very much defines the entire feed category though so on the rare occasion that someone does know enough to choose they will tend to choose rss because it s got the name. they will also tend to choose rss 2.0 because it s got the bigger number
12586
the rss brand very much defines the entire feed category though so on the rare occasion that someone does know enough to choose they will tend to choose rss because it s got the name. they will also tend to choose rss 2.0 because it s got the bigger number
12680
i would recommend this book
12785
i would recommend having a suite of tests that runs the timer as well as the real action
12927
going forward i went ahead and added the eclipse profiler plugin and i ll be looking over the different open source profilers to compare functionality
12938
i personally prefer having choices
12980
i recommend either or both of which also give you variable storage like memcache
13038
i recommend which was my inspiration for trying out testing-based development
13306
i d recommend testing it for yourself
13429
i recommend having a look at the programmers stone
13455
i would definitely choose svn over cvs if only because people who learned source control using cvs tend to use svn delete then svn add instead of svn move
13561
i need to display list of categories on every page and to be able to choose items from a specific category to be displayed
13569
i prefer pdo for the single reason that it allows named parameters for prepared statements and as far as i am aware mysqli does not
13580
so you call components action from view which then choose view to render
13607
could someone recommend any good resources for creating graphics user interfaces preferably in c c++
13861
choose show log under tortiosesvn
13886
if that means you choose labview go for it
14063
you could do this using system.reflection.emit however i d recommend mono.cecil
14124
the perl built-in is select which is a pass-through to the select system call but for sane people i recommend io select
14179
if you want something just a step above notepad for quick efficient editing i would recommend notepad2
14268
however if they have to download several files with one go i prefer ftp because it s much more easy to manage
14268
there are some nice broswer extensions as _l0ser mentioned but i prefer ftp for mass file-transfer
14273
be careful with this - you should favor composition over inheritance
14420
in mastering regular expressions from jeffrey friedl great book it is mentioned that you could use p letter which will match unicode stuff that is considered a letter
14483
it s easy while in the paper-and-pen or whatever non-code equivalent you prefer stage to overstay falling prey to the dreaded yagni syndrome
14488
some day i work in a company that use vss and in other companies that use other less unknow scm but i prefer use svn someday i ll try git for active development for me and my group
14510
it allowed you to choose any installed font to work in
14621
files that might need ability to compare versions
14706
i prefer using an ihttphandlerfactory implementation and have full control over all incoming urls and where they re mapped to
14821
there is no compelling reason to choose ftp over http anymore and there are a few small advantages to http as others have pointed out
14851
i would definitely recommend picking up a book or two if you are new to the field
15018
for interaction with svn i ll prefer ankhsvn
15072
i recommend bitnami for testing out different stacks
15323
while csla doesn t exactly match any of the patterns described in that book it most closely resembles active record although i feel it is short-sighted to claim an exact match for this pattern
15323
i didn t fully recommend csla for my last project because i believe the scope of the application is too large for the benefits csla provides
15343
regardless of the method you use make sure you manually destroy each of those items in the array before you delete pbuffer as you could end up with leaks
15385
amusing to note that microsoft designed the class designer to be a useful replacement to useless uml uml diagrams being untrustworthy once they lose synchronisation with source code
15630
it not only prevents update and delete without a where which you re not worried about but also adds an implicit limit 1000 to select statements and aborts selects that have joins and are estimated to consider over 1 000 000 tuples --- perfect for discouraging cartesian joins
16118
right-click the toolbox click choose items from the context menu browse to your dll and select it
16140
assuming i can pick any piece of the app what are some factors to consider that would make that piece better or worse as an osgi guinea pig
16218
i prefer using jquery for ajaxy stuff like that
16400
i prefer this anyway because debugging with the integrated web server can give you a very false impression of how your application will interact with the iis security model
16438
another reason to prefer string.format is that .net strings are immutable and doing it this way creates fewer temporary intermediate copies
16512
so i prefer having all the relevant parts visible at once instead of having to scroll to another method named something like checkmatrixatrow x
16567
i ve used both and prefer nant
16581
i have used both msbuild and nant and i much prefer msbuild mainly because it requires a lot less configuration by default
16591
i would highly recommend picking up a copy of effective java and reading through item 7 obeying the equals contract
16643
what this does is that it matches any character up to the point that it encounters an opening paranthesis
16643
if you do not want to match spaces only alphanumerical characters you could so something like this
16643
which would match any letter within a-z both upper- lower-case number as well as hyphens and underscores
16664
i use and recommend dreamhost for both their prices and customer service
16714
whether you choose xsd and or schematron depends on what you are trying to validate
16816
if you need to compare instances for equality then that is what you do
16871
i prefer distributed version control for personal projects because they eliminate the need for a server
16875
otherwise i would recommend using some sort of regex validation before accepting inputs from forms
16940
admittedly this might not be a problem on larger screens but my employer is abit tight and refuses to buy monitors larger than 19inch this means that i dont have much screen real estate to view all the visual studio windows and my code at the same time or two pieces of code at once
17041
i prefer var when the type is defined on the right side because it is more terse
17042
jeff wrote a post on this saying he favors var
17359
this would beat having to deal with very long email messages which contain header data and often have word-wrapping issues etc
17475
i highly recommend using a scripting language to complement c++ on day-to-day tasks
17665
i also do not recommend using hypervisor if you like usb devices
17744
i also recommend this book
17756
sun s java code style seem to prefer naming labels in the same way as variables meaning camel case with the first letter in lower case
17908
i meant that i d like the consumer to be able to choose which endpoint to bind to
18104
could anyone recommend any tools that can be used for this
18262
related but values are values are kept in separate columns and you have know your special types a head of time sql query to compare product sales by month
18307
which to choose depends on exactly what you re looking to do
18856
i recommend python as it s based on abc which was invented for the purpose of teaching programming
18959
for each partition found in proc partitions acquire drive serial number via hdio_get_identity syscall number of blocks from proc partitions and drive offset sys blocks drive_path partition_name start compare this to the windows information and if this matches - store a windows drive letter along with a linux device name
19010
the company loses nothing and gains a potential for gain mdash
19030
then i loop though each valid-filename regex if it matches append it to a valid dict if not do the same with the missing-ep-name regexs if it matches this i append it to an invalid dict with an error code 2 missing epsiode name if it matches neither it gets added to invalid with the malformed name error code
19030

19128
i don t like keeping it enabled because then it will instill hesitation in users to select any menu item in fear that they ll just get an error message making them feel stupid for not realizing that they couldn t possibly perform that operation at the time
19307
i would like to recommend this jquery plugin though jqmodal
19943
in conclusion i don t recommend switching from php but i do recommend accommodating the developer s interest in some way at work
20058
as for resources i d highly recommend msdn magazine
20140
i would recommend using linq or an orm tool to interact with the database
20143
unless some mssql guru comes to the rescue i recommend submitting the problem to the vendor
20169
just in case you might need to this may help if you need to grab unicode arguments on win32 2k xp etc
20192
there are lots of good reasons to prefer iis over the cassini server articles by dominick baier
20192
another reason why i would not recommend cassini
20222
i prefer optparse to getopt
20276
i d prefer using a regex but i m for regular expressions
20478
i used an enum containg the sql keywords select insert ... and basically parsed each line iterating over the enum to determine if any sql was present
20603
it s case insensetive and should match statements that span across multiple lines too
20682
the problem with encoding semantics in your hierarchy is that you lose flexibility
20895
i would recommend using a subreport
21118
however rico mariani .net optimization guru made up a quiz in which he stated at the end that in most cases he recommends string.format
21532
i can recommend ninject
21584
i would recommend using the win32 api function netlocalgroupgetmembers
21765
a search plugin written in perl that beats vim s internal grep implementation and externally invoked greps too
21934
why does java choose this strategy and what is the benefit from this
22115
it would be really cool to be able to specify a regex for strings so that my generator spits out things which match this
22134
i prefer textmate on os x
22292
i would recommend fiddler but if you re on linux or something then you ll need to use wireshark to figure some of the things out
22304
i can t recommend any good php frameworks for that though
22325
i d also recommend downloading some of the plethora of apps on django pluggables and seeing how they do it
22338
so how have people tended to choose names logos and branding
22397
i would probably favor invoke over begininvoke as the latter will result in the code being called asynchronously which may or may not be what you re after but would make handling subsequent exceptions difficult to propagate without a call to endinvoke
22480
you make it non-greedy by using when using the latter construct the regex engine will at every step it matches text into the . attempt to match whatever make come after the
22480
this means that if for instance nothing comes after the then it matches nothing
22615
if you have all of the data connections set up you can configure rules to select which connection to submit to
22640
some folks prefer dateadd d 1 activitydatemidnight instead - but it s the same thing
22693
then just compare server time with stored time
22693
if the events times can change between users and even per user it may make development and debugging easier if you choose option 1
22829
this is by the way very helpful to choose tags and appropriate spelling avoiding the subversion vs
22900
select the entire column and right click and select format cells select text from the list of options
22904
thomas owens re source control yes but that s not source control in the same sense that i can check in a .cs file or .cpp file or whatever and go and pick out any revision i want
22917
if your database is medium sized then visual studio has some nice project integrations with built in compare data compare database refactoring tools database testing framework and even data generation tools
22970
i would recommend using ad-hoc sql unless you can find a specific reason not to
23111
i did it for an old job and when given a choice i would choose php
23193
if you prefer lisp you can try to power through the 99-problems in lisp which you can do in any language really or you can watch the lectures from the people who wrote sicp
23273
it loses points for being about standard ml when ocaml f# and haskell are seemingly more popular
23814
of the three i prefer option #3
24019
as an independent developer i would not recommend lamp when all of the client s assets exist on windows
24125
i just want it for 1-3 videos so i prefer free but am willing to pay if have to
24137
as well as the performance penalty of having to search the php include path it defeats opcode caching
24258
i don t know the answer to your question but i would highly recommend add-in express for doing the addin
24259
the root source code is available so you can grab this implementation if you want
24299
but - as always - i would recommend python for great fun when unpaid
24454
i heavily prefer cakephp for php django for python rails for ruby
24602
a lot of people recommend wacom
24648
can you recommend any good books
24682
one thing to note though if you pick minix it is designed for learning
24715
if i want to match red i should get apple and firetruck
24803
for books i strongly recommend linux kernel development by robert love
24892
i can also recommend watin
24959
i prefer firefox for debugging firebug etc
25072
so why would you choose mysqli over pdo
25247
i ve found both to be excellent although i prefer cygwin slightly as i m able to tail files over the internet efficiently without crashes tail for win32 has crashed on me in some instances
25291
note that when using this method you will lose any listener that you may have previously registered on the editor.editordocument
25474
if your only need is to inspect some assembly i would recommend mono.cecil which is very lightweight and fast
25701
i ve worked with jdom as well and there s absolutely nothing wrong with it although i do prefer xom
25727
i d recommend rdiff-backup
26082
if you re using sql server to back a web application you probably don t have any choice unless you want to buy a cal for every user or computer that hits your web site you need to purchase processor licenses
26112
you have more devices than users accessing the database buy user cals
26112
you have a lot of users accessing a server through an small set of devices buy device cals
26232
or if you prefer use the special query syntax provided by the c# 3 compiler
26285
for java i highly recommend core java
26345
i have a regex that handles most cases though i believe it does match html within a multiline comment
26383
thus i prefer contract to this one
26423
for windows application desktop or ce i d recommend using the taligent model-view-presenter version without the interactions commands and selections e.g the controller presenter performs all the work
26428
while i use 7zip on my windows pc for convenience i tend to prefer bzip2 for speed vs compression
26448
whatever algorithm you choose either it s broken and you ll run into problems with #3 later or it works and then #1 should work just as well
26634
you d also need to compare this across multiple blogs of that type as you want to make sure that it s not something specific to the skin or theme in use on the blog only
26703
what if you used a combination of the captcha ideas you had choose any of them - or select one of them randomly
26725
for more information on application.cfc including all of the various special functions available and every little detail about what and how to use it i recommend this post on raymond camden s blog
26803
this means that i send stuff on my home server over to my webhost and all files databases on my webhost back home so i m not screwed if i lose either my house or my webhost
26830
when your application exits .net will kill any threads with isbackground true
26832
i would also recommend using the as keyword instead of casting
26943
i would recommend using a javascript toolkit i use mochikit but it isn t for everyone to get some of the harder work done - use unobtrusive javascript techniques if at all possible unlike what i use in this example
26963
i recommend using something more along the lines of
27140
it seems to me that most web pages contain very similar construction and that it should be possible to in many cases pick out where the repeated headers and side columns are
27212
another option is to use a library which has some nice facilities for comparing objects - i use and recommend mochikit
27247
could you recommend manual or guides about epoll library
27260
as far as javascript libraries are concerned this one and prototype are probably the most popular if you re looking to compare jquery to something else
27294
because i have to parse the xmlelement i m using a huge 10-15 cases in the real code switch to pick which child class to instantiate
27343
you can mix and match java and javascript in your rhino run scripts so if you know a little java it shouldn t be too hard to get this running with text-streams as well
27440
better performance can be bought with more ram and cpu and more appropriate database design and clever stored procedure tricks and so on - and all of that is cheaper and easier for random-website-x than agonizing over which to pick mysql or postgresql and specialist tuning from expensive dbas
27445
then i ld recommend postgresql hands down because it has a lot more features which make your db layer much more customizable so that you can fine-tune it to any requirements you might have
27508
red gate s sql compare product not only allows you to do object-level comparisons and generate change scripts from that but it also allows you to export your database objects into a folder hierarchy organized by object type with one objectname .sql creation script per object in these directories
27529
hard to compare mysql and postgres
27785
would match http or https just fine
28003
i have a large database and would like to select table names that have a certain column name
28105
since you are using only asp.net 2.0 i would recommend ajaxpro will which create the .ashx file
28233
anyway i d do something like this note i prefer exists to joins but you can re-write them as joins if you like
28327
it ll help you pick colors that work well with each other
28343
when such a case appear it would lead to lose instances in treesets for example
28517
ended up using the date class problem then became making that work with the rails select helper - which didn t happen just generated the html myself
28551
does this have to match bundle identifier
28617
since windows console is far from great i d not recommend using it
28693
various classes have been renamed to match hibernate 3.2 names
28698
its not the best thign in the world but it beats writing ddl
28843
i prefer slickedit for my ide but the only way i can get it to update the tag files to incorporate code changes is to recreate the project and or run start a re-tag manually
28868
you start to lose time trying to figure out if something like a performance issue is related to the orm or to your code
28928
no matter what ide editor combination you choose for hacking on source files i recommend using ib where you can
29134
although a bit esoteric i prefer and recommend mochikit
29268
in addition to other people s suggestions i d recommend either acquiring a copy of sicp or reading it online
29474
the reasons i prefer this approach are
29542
if you can find out the on screen position of the part of the page you are interested in you could compare this with the position of the mouse when you receive the drop event
29545
that might slow things down a bit so i recommend setting up a continuous integration server like cruisecontrol.net and having it run code analysis on every checkin
29656
which one of them you choose depends on whether you want the file to be opened as a c library file stream which tmpfile does or a direct file descriptor mkstemp
29770
the second is bicycle repair man which i guess wins points on name
29789
some program such as process explorer appear to elevate a running process when you choose show details for all process in the file menu in this case but what they really do is start a new instance and it s that new instance that gets elevated - not the one that was originally running
29819
however there are some tools which can compare word documents so if you set up your version control client to use these tools for comparison you can have some fun
29856
in the past i have run apache and mysql to match this install in 32 bit mode even stripping out the 64 bit stuff from apache to make it work
29875
explanation it matches either a single letter except p followed by an optional whitespace and more characters or multiple letters at least two
29917
this will now deal with p tags with or without attributes and the closing p tags but will match pre and similar tags with or without attributes
29953
you can compare this with other machines on which perl runs
29965
but a regex to match html tags that aren t
30097
some people prefer mvc for better testibility but personally most of my code is in the middle layer and easily tested anyway.
30148
does this mean i lose out on the performance benefits of assemblies in the new version of the framework
30183
i can select target framework though 2.0 3.0 and 3.5 not that i see any use of that for this particular problem.
30237
i would recommend using something like 7-zip if your folders contain hidden system files folders
30248
that would mean asp.net sets the textbox to cause a postback submit the page for anything the might cause the textbox to lose focus including the enter key
30261
edit textchanged event is only triggered when the textbox loses focus so that can t be the issue
30280
provided this question is properly tagged you can select lamp server option during installation of ubuntu
30353
since the required information for the route content pathinfo is entirely satisfied always no required data at all in this route and it s near the top of the route list then all your attempts to map to unnamed routes will match this pattern and all your urls will be based on this content
30427
the reason that i recommend using a separtate partition for home is that when you want to completely switch distros or if the upgrade option on your distro of choice for whatever reason doesn t work or if you just want to start from scratch and do a clean system install you can just format and boot and leave home with all the user data intact
30670
i cannot recommend this as the way but you could create a com-callable wrapper for your c# library then create a vb6 activex exe project that delegates calls to your c# library
31053
however this is inelegant and would destroy any r+ r n already in the text although they are not likely to exist
31054
i would recommend activemq from apache
31914
i recommend using apache commmons logging as your logging interface
31922
for python i recommend pylons docs book
32011
briefly you right-click on your project and select add existing item
32016
i tend to prefer using the new linq syntax
32019
creates a new command mcd that creates a new directory and then changes to that directory i prefer pushd to cd in this case because it lets me use popd later to go back to where i was before
32161
i would recommend using the unicode character for a non-breaking space instead of an entity just for that reason
32342
i would also highly recommend using a logging framework
32621
the sdk recommends using vebirdseyescene.getboundingrectangle but this returns bounds of up to two miles from the center of my scene which in major cities still returns way too many addresses
32704
this would most likely be faster because in the other case almost every letter matches r so it would capture that and then look for the n after that
33181
it is fast but you would need to compare activemq and msmq for your traffic to know which is faster
33188
if you can edit the sp to select xml you can append xml_info to the query to get the schema back
33343
it may be useful for getting the feel of how a livecd is composed but i would probably not recommend using an ubuntu livecd
33433
i don t use p4v much but i think the equivalent is to select hide local workspace files in the filter dropdown of the workspace view tab.p4 help fstat
33612
this is sort of a silly question but i prefer rhino mocks as it represents a more complete understanding of mocks vs
33707
the message stream is slow - this is to save power and also because all the satellites transmit on the same frequency and they re easier to pick out if they go slow
33748
the reason i specifically recommend using one of these libraries is that they were designed to be relatively easy to use in existing applications you get support a community and all sorts of upgrade paths options
33831
just add 1 line per process you want to kill save as a .bat file and put in in your startup directory
33887
doing it in code allows you to selectively choose which cookies are httponly and which are not
34089
if you prefer java based tools the java compiler compiler javacc is a nice parser scanner
34149
i d recommend hpricot for ruby or beautiful soup for python which are both excellent parsers for html
34150
i would also recommend using this for testing webservices and its free
34196
i would not recommend writing your own xml parser unless you feel the need for the intellectual exercise
34295
if it is emacs you want i would recommend aquamacs more mac-like or carbon emacs more gnu-emacs-like
34345
once inside room b each prisoner gets to open 50 boxes he chooses which one he opens
34377
in visual studio source control explorer right click on the directory you want to compare and select compare
34474
i prefer phpunit now but when i started out i used simpletest as i didn t always have access to the command line
34509
sorting these in c# is easy - just break it up into and then compare sequence values in turn
34520
one process loses out and must wait for the other to finish
34589
i would recommend using a vcs that has been designed with frequent merging in mind from the start
34757
i ve seen and done implementations for initial random passwords that pick random words and numbers as an easier and less error prone string
34816
i use if for managing my active directory hyper-v twitter some keyboard automation hosting powershell in a winforms app to grab keystrokes and a ton of other stuff
34848
the thing is that the error message with this validator sucks value is empty but a non-empty value is required
34882
when you want to check if the cookie needs recreating re - serialize the object and compare this new base 64 string against the one stored in a member variable
34892
all prisoners are however required to never pick any box twice
34899
i recommend tortoisesvn
35138
if you destroy user input you can never get it back and if they make a mistake they can edit and fix later
35198
the says to match any character other than
35348
choose any 1 bit of a b and use that as a mask -- in more detail choose x as a power of 2 so that x a b is nonzero
35420
is there any program os x win linux or php no problem that lets me monitor and resolve replication issues
35451
i wish every time that they would store them in a db and let me choose where to save that file
35676
subversion is complicated to set up -- if you have no experience with version control at all i d recommend using a distributed vcs because they don t require any server configuration
35780
i recommend wxwidgets or qt
35907
can anyone recommend components that will jazz up my ui
35908
anyway i would not recommend using zwopendirectoryobject
35960
i don t know that any of these are a slam-dunk reason to choose post - unless the amount of data being sent exceeds the querystring length for some major browser
35991
if you have made changes to a model and wish to alter the database tables to match use the sql command to display the new sql structure and compare that to your existing table schema to work out the changes
36063
the quick and dirty is selecting your files using ctrl in project explorer view right-click them choose replace with.
36325
simply right-click on the revision you want to revert and select revert changes from this revision
36342
thanks to my daily backups i didn t lose any work or productivity
36552
i d strongly not recommend rolling your own encoding
36655
honestly if you want an mvc framework for asp.net i would pick castle monorail
36816
my most pertinent experience was writing code to compare any two data entities of the same type in a large object model property-wise
36886
i recommend python for s60 as good way to explorer the capabilities of the nokia s60 symbian platform
37089
when launching a thread or a process in .net or java is there a way to choose which processor or core it is launched on
37117
is there a way to choose which processor or core it is launched on
37162
web browser print dialogs default to portrait so for every print job the user has to manually select landscape
37185
the .net situation is considerably nicer with socket.beginread socket.endread where the continuation is passed directly to socket.beginread and that s where you pick back up
37276
i generally prefer jquery which i find to be a little more intuitive in my head anyway but i would use mootools if slick animation is the most important requirement
37282
i have found that indy while a simpler concept in the beginning is awkward to manage due to the need to kill sockets to free threads at application termination
37309
i highly recommend dwr if you going to be doing a lot of client-server interaction
37400
the reason why i would choose ubuntu is because it s the one i ve had the most experience with and the one i can easily find help for
37415
i would recommend xubuntu
37555
the problem with this is that ontextchanged gets raised when the textbox loses focus which causes problems because of the postback
37620
i recommend nose
37672
aside from going through the entire thing one table and relationship at a time and creating the whole database from scratch by hand can anyone recommend any tool utility method for converting the visio database model into a sql script that can be used to create a new db in sql server
38077
out of those three i d recommend doctrine
38099
mike ...the need to kill sockets to free threads...
38333
my problem with hyper-v is that it kills performance on some things on the host os especially a v stuff
38583
i recommend mixing in a few packages from debian unstable feeds
38612
everything works great and users are able to add orders using the numerous dropdownlist controls to choose items from the list
38762
davidg recommends using dicts
38802
as for an orm i d recommend doctrine
38864
i need this because i have a product that has to choose which adapter to bind to
38993
if i were to do a list of files and match any that end in either .sty or .cls how would i do that
39000
will match any string ends with .sty or .cls
39266
i personally prefer amfphp for larger datasets and plain xml for smaller stuff especially since they introduced e4x way better xml handling in actionscript 3
39342
in oracle you can look at the explain plan to compare variations on your query
39565
xen for example typically recommends using a specific range of addresses 00 16 3e xx xx xx
39583
do you prefer client side transaction handling transactionscope in .net over server
39594
i prefer client-side transaction handling where available
39858
so i can t recommend this technique for forward-compatible or cross-implementation portable code which really means it should be avoided entirely
39963
if you select sha1 they look like this
40194
i can no longer recommend tapestry as i did previously
40209
i cannot choose this answer but this is the answer that i the questioner was looking for
40221
the code above will leave only the flag1 bit set if it is set at all then compares this result to flag1
40238
in short this happens when a lower priority task uses a mutex to grab a resource a then tries to grab b but is paused because b is unavailable
40496
if a process doesn t come back i recommend strace to analyze how a process is interacting with the operating system
40749
basically a continuation is the ability for a function to stop execution and then pick back up where it left off at a later point in time
40764
under what circumstances should i choose each over the others
40852
for more powerful text editing you can of course use your favorite text editor but then you lose intellisense and live syntax checking so it s a big trade-off
41010
i prefer codeigniter because of its simple design
41045
as a general rule i prefer using value rather than pointer semantics in c++ ie using instead of
41255
i would recommend using the bigint data type as this goes up to 9 223 372 036 854 775 807
41272
there doesn t seem to be an easier way unless you re willing to buy mamp pro
41362
i would recommend gnu x
41425
i prefer using my own loop to iterate over each line and use one simple regular expression to determine whether a line is the start of a new entry or not
41465
some other reasons to choose firefox
41604
i prefer using a top-level namespace for the application and sub namespaces for the components
41618
i would recommend using qt
41624
some people prefer using using just for single elements
41774
right click on the trunk folder and choose either checkout if you want to update from svn later or export if you just want your own copy of that revision
41913
if you want to ensure it is always free then choose gpl or another copyleft license
42406
i definitely recommend weka which is an open source data mining software written in java
42425
for a captcha system i heartily recommend recaptcha
42478
i highly recommend wireshark for traffic analysis
42656
it s useful for when you want to choose which method to use for a given argument based on its type at runtime rather than compile time
42697
i would personally learn ironruby because i prefer the way ruby works over python and since it s one of the same then choose which language you prefer
42699
whichever you choose take a look at ironeditor -- it s great for playing around
42734
i recommend downloading it pointing it at your index and seeing what s in there
43029
i greatly prefer using a for loop in this situation compared to tracking the index with a local variable
43170
after this you simply select any products belonging to any of these categories
43188
if you have any interest in real time systems and you should at least understand the differences and reasons for real time os s then i d also recommend microc os-ii by labrosse
43256
if you are gonig down the plugin route i tend to prefer subversive over subclipse
43264
if they are on different drives and the drive containing the data fails you can apply the log to the last backup so you don t lose any data
43414
as to web application frameworks for python i recommend turbogears 2
43515
i would honestly recommend using one of the many libraries available for ajax
43515
i use prototype myself while others prefer jquery
43721
except i tend to prefer delegates for this as they don t clutter up your class hierarchy with stuff like iclock .
43729
one approach can be to first run whole of you code to match multiline comments and then take out only the parts not matching .
43733
i would recommend munin
43804
are separate gems uploaded for each platform and the gem software selects which one to pull down
43835
i highly recommend using one of these web frameworks for any real project because of the convenience and features and documentation etc
43928
if you compare exception handling to traditional c-style return-value checking this caching effect should be taken into account as well the question is usually ignored in discussions
43943
can pick which version of the .net
43943
feature-set to match this
44032
i also recommend ffmpeg but the command line suggested by john boker has an unintended side effect it re-encodes the file to the default bitrate which is 64 kb s in the version i have here at least
44034
i set up a little ajax app that compares any number of catalog instances to a master and shows the diffs
44181
how can i select this column from both tables and return it as a single column in my result set
44251
there are multiple known implementation available but i would recommend hibernate or toplink as good starting points
44298
however the textbox can still lose focus and remain in an invalid state
44298
not allow the textbox to lose focus until it contains a valid value
44362
lostfocus will trigger when the textbox loses focus
44454
i recommend this articly by joe celko for more on keys
44577
otherwise i prefer using visual studio s capability to put traces in the code as special breakpoints you insert a breakpoint and right-click it then select when hit... and tell it what to display in that case
44638
ok rails is actually pretty good but there is just a little bit too much magic going on in there from the ruby world i would much prefer merb to rails
44674
if just integration you are after i will recommend mule
44715
postpones this decision the longest and chooses semantics based on the most contextual
44750
i have yet to see any ide for .net which beats this one
44759
although i have tinkered with lego mindstorms and enjoyed it in the past i would thoroughly recommend xna game studio for the following reasons
45404
i would definitely recommend git
45475
i ve got around the problem by creating regular anchors appending queries to their hrefs and checking for them at page load but i d prefer c# to be doing the grunt work
45502
or and i prefer this one
45508
i would also recommend mercurial
45530
the selectors level 4 spec allows you to select which part of the select is the subject
45641
i recommend using ip addresses as well
45717
if you re using ms vc++ i can highly recommend this free tool from the codeproject
45770
it s not going to win any design awards but it will work if you have a large or unknown number of possible classes
45770
and in sql2005 you can still use xpath in your sql queries to select rows based on some property that is stored as xml
45886
it s so nice to be able to right click on a function call and choose go to definition rather than having to dig around to find the file where the function is actually implemented
45908
right click on project and select unload project right click on unloaded project and select edit
45995
tools- options select projects and solutions tab
46079
prefer jquery if any library at all
46120
if the configuration manager option is not available to you then i recommend using the following properties from the project
46129
when i come to commit my changes i select the missing file and the new one and select repair move from the right click menu
46146
looking for a string to pass to string#matches string that will match ipv4 and another to match ipv6
46146
looking for a string to pass to string#matches string that will match ipv4 and another to match ipv6
46171
here s a regex to match ipv4 addresses
46193
i choose alt - shift - t which this dialog box likes to call shift - alt - t for um tree i guess
46198
i personally prefer dottrace but that may just be because that is what i used first and there has never been any good reason to switch
46247
then you can compare each number four integer compares should take no time compared to walking the string
46300
to see these go to the properties for a project click on the compile tab and then choose build events...
46327
i d recommend any kind of community software that s semi-established well documented not too often in the news because of security issues and offers api to extend its base
46583
first i highly recommend using source control like subversion cvs or git
46785
heres an implementation of this i ve used to pick out special replace strings from content and localize them
46915
i read this detecting when a flex application loses focus but was not very clear.
46971
i personally prefer simpletest
47165
i would recommend using subversion
47475
if unit-test names can become outdated over time and if you consider that the test itself is the most important thing then is it important to choose wise test names
47477
in your example i d recommend naming like
47601
should i buy this book
47641
the chrome installer currently does not allow the user to pick where the application is to be installed
47659
but the general opinion is that m2eclipse is still better than q4e but q4e is getting better each new version and maybe will surpass m2eclipse soon
47668
i can recommend sphinx
47717
you compare each new operator with the one at the top of the stack if the one on top of the stack has higher priority you pop it off the operator stack pop the operands off the number stack apply the operator and push the result onto the number stack
47766
in fact i generally prefer stubs and use mocks when necessary.
47879
i think it s not fair to compare createprocess to fork since they are not interchangeable
47879
it s probably more appropriate to compare fork exec to createprocess
48016
i prefer emacs to vi but i m comfortable in both
48068
you often see magic numbers embedded in file formats because files can be sent around rather promiscuously and lose any metadata about how they were created
48114
i hastily read it at first and mistakenly thought you were indicating to sequentially choose each element with fixed probability k n which would have been wrong - but your adaptive approach appears correct to me
48141
this algorithm will select unique indicies of the items list
48247
i can wholeheartedly recommend writing such a process with a simple perl client using the mail mapclient module
48318
when .net code enumerates windows it s pretty obvious that first visible window top level window will match this criteria
48320
which of these three would you recommend using and why
48356
edit lots of edits apologies implementing idisposable and calling a.dispose from where a loses scope doesn t work - my dispose implementation still has to call either .close or .disconnect true or .shutdown both but none of those unbind the socket
48458
folder heirarchy would match package heirarchy
48507
i would also recommend having the build server on a completely seperate machine
48572
i couldn t recommend this program more
48665
i would recommend ektron cms400.net -- it s an excellent cms with great built-in translation
48805
some e-marketing tools claim to choose which web page to display based on where you were before
48876
i won t go into the details on why but they prefer apache bsd or mit style licenses
48905
i would prefer citations if you have them so i can read understand the explanations
49002
why prefer composition over inheritance
49002
when should you choose inheritance over composition
49040
i m not saying i recommend any of these but they might work
49066
how can i easily rename the underlying windows folder name to match this new project name under a tfs controlled project and solution
49070
another very pragmatic reason to prefer composition over inheritance has to do with your domain model and mapping it to a relational database
49082
either way i prefer having a searcher that class
49105
i recommend this book
49504
otherwise you d have to alter the regexp in rewritecond to match any character which should still work due to the anchoring but this certainly feels safer
49562
in other words if i were working with this in expression blend or mobiform aurora i would be able to select the chart from the logical tree or select any of the individual pens to edit their properties
49610
can anyone recommend either open source or commercial alternatives that support 64 bit native c++ mfc applications
49679
i can highly recommend this book
49806
if i have several of these windows open at once and i click one with my mouse when they disappear they cause my application to lose focus it switches focus to the app behind the current one
49933
a simple javascript program compares instances against it and a simple xsl transform yields the create or alter statements
49943
if and only if your application is relatively light i could recommend ants profiler
49948
where d matches any digit use 0-9 if your regex engine doesn t support it.
