i d like a similar function class for c++ or c# which can generate more than 32 bits of randomness and which low-order bits are equally as random as high-order bits
635
for the books generating xml is much easier than parsing
875
also it s much faster than svn
1145
it s trivial to do if the search and replace strings are the same length or the replace string is shorter than the search string since i have enough space allocated
1174
judging by your example property would you be better of with a class approach for the final level and real properties
1339
i if destination does not exist and copying more than one file assumes that destination must be a directory
1347
you will probably find better support with nant
1347
i would learn both and use which every fits more smoothly with your environment
1949
additionally there would be some table classes that would exist in more than one datacontext

as matthew stated you really shouldn t bother an rss feed more than the producer allows but you can use http headers to check for changes in a very light way which is something rss2email does quite well
2310
if you have more than one project you might want to replicate this kind of structure under each project
2369
this is an alternative way datareader is faster than this one
2384
the stream contains more information than i m trying to read since i m not interested in data at the end of the file

superficially it might seem a little like a mathematical function mapping reals to reals but a c++ function can do more than just return a number that depends on its arguments
2562
i found the production of wmv much better and easier than flv because all windows flv encoders i tried are not really good and stable whereas pretty much every tool can natively output wmv
2703
previous version would fail for input string longer than 4000 chars
2862
i m not sure how lightweight it is but it certainly feels snappier than eclipse
2901
also any forms that you show non-modally will continue to run alongside your main form which will enable you to have more than one windows that do not block each other
2938
joey i believe anything is lighter than eclipse
2984
from what i understand it does a bit more than just syntax analysis
3112
the problem is that the value will be a scalar when there is only one value and it will be an array reference when there is more than one value
3455
another option is vmware fusion which is much better than parallels in my opinion + windows xp + sql server management studio
3801
my impression is that the cpu in a webserver does not need to be that fast because requests are usually rather lightweight so having more slower cores should be a better choice as we got many small requests
3932
they recently also added a personal license that is significantly cheaper than the corporate one
3974
values with more than two digits might not work as expected for either your original solution or the x100 trick
4238
and of course if you are only wanting to profile a single application each commercial package has a 15 or 30 day trial more than enough time to pinpoint any issues in an existing application
4299
that would be more secure than enabling clr support in the database server
4305
something like mediatemple - which won t host the worlds fastest websites but for the price is far better than shared hosting

4392
it has to be easier than this though
4401
this is cleaner than using a two-step approach of generate script plus run
4593
i dont think that mondrian is better than ssas but i do know that its free and you independently distribute it
4661
i have more than one openid as i have tried out numerous
4932
further edit the reason the second option would print integer is because there is no widening into a larger primitive as an option so it must box it up thus integer is the only option
5264
in other words the image if smaller than the dimensions allotted on the design surface will be anchored to the top left corner not in the center
5264
my report will know the url of the image at runtime and i need to be able to center this image if it is smaller than the dimensions specified in my designer
5270
in addition to being more lightweight than ssms you can also practice writing linq queries- way more fun than boring old tsql
5310
considering that i don t think using more than one datacontext would do any harm- in fact creating different datacontexts for different types of work would help make your linqtosql impelmentation more usuable and organized
5345
and once you ve learned to work with the page layout system it s usually no harder than table based layout
5354
following these two simple rules is worth more than most user interface usability guidelines
5474
accessibility is important and maintaining semantic x html is much easier than maintaining table layouts but that #1 spot on google will bring home the bacon
5683
from my experience vmware is waaaay better than virtual pc if you can convince your company to use it you wont regret the switch

anything requiring slightly more than simple addition is going to involve pointers and they are sure to get it
5739
from what i understand - it s all client side and requires nothing more than their jar file
5949
assuming that the web app in question is secure enough to prevent people entering other numbers to view other users without authorization a simple sequentially-assigned surrogate key also leaks the total number of instances older than this one in this case users which might be privileged information
6134
how can i best identify the ones that have run for longer than an hour or so
6369
how do i call my stored proc with more than 1 value in the list
6413
but palmsey is more correct especially if your page could have the possibility of more than one master page
6553
when it does break i go back to one higher than where i was previously so if it broke at the 75th floor i go back to the 51st floor and drop the second marble and move up a floor at a time until it breaks at which point i know the highest floor i can drop from with no marble breakage
6805
note 2 you ll want to profile this because it ll be bigger and slower than the solution you ve already got
6906
i ve heard it said that java is more like write once debug everywhere but that s probably as true as or even moreso than c#
6911
i think there are larger problems than performance to worry about
6913
my goal is to create a centralized piece of code for managing several ui components in a particular way and then be able to use that both the ui layout and the logic in more than one place
6980
it s a lot easier than using a cursor and seems to work fairly well
6987
add an .ico file to the application section of the properties page and recieved the error thats been described when i checked the icon file with an icon editor it turn out that the file had more than one version of the image ie 16 x 16 24 x 24 32 x 32 48 x 48 vista compressed i removed the other formats that i didnt want resaved the file just with 32x 32 and the application now compiles without error
7018
tons more lines of code much faster than the awk script
7039
you can start diving into some funky effectcs and even consider using the gpu for more than it was originally intended
7090
other things to consider with the files i ve tested png compresses better than jpeg
7257
the try-catch method is the quickest if the object does hold an int and by far the slowest if it doesn t even slower than gettype
7265
but i think you are within reason to do it and it s probably going to be a whole lot cheaper than having to fire him and recruit someone new
7290
i don t know how you can be more non-technical than that except by saying turing complete means able to answer computable problem given enough time and space
7478
if it s being examined on a regualr basis writing to a table amkes the reporting back much easier as it s trivial to reverse the order and only show the last x events for the current time period
7487
for the sieve you can do better by using a wheel instead of adding one each time check out the improved incremental prime number sieves
7492
more scalability problems would surface at the second stage and even more - after the launch
7858
however like it has been mentioned any convention is better than no convention
7917
i m importing some data from a csv file and numbers that are larger than 1000 get turned into 1 100 etc
7937
does anyone have an even better solution than this one
7939
yes join usually is worse than no join at all when it comes to performance but join usually is better than fake join by first reading the whole table a and then using the gained information to read and filter table b

if there are more than 4 you are right 4s and s would be the same but with fewer than 4 chars in g s would be left justified and 4s would be right-justified in a 4 char field
8247
it s limited to 4gb files on windows and it s likely slower than just using a platform-specific call like getfilesizeex or stat64
8356
or anything faster than o n then the try catch solution would be faster of course
8450
it handles way more than just icons as well
8462
i find the bit-shifting easier than typing 4 8 16 32 and so on
8599
and it goes without saying that it needs to be smaller than xml and faster to parse
8762
everytime i ve used those they have given me much better results than srgb alone
8910
you can get warnings errors when the same row has been updated by more than one user
8941
create an interface and implement the interface in the extension methods which would probably be cleaner than a bit fat switch
9144
you still have to compile but compile times will be shorter than c++
9247
if you re calling a stored procedure 30 000 times you have far bigger problems than connection pooling

torn reads can occur on any value whose fields add up to more than the size of a pointer
9723
it was designed as a vector graphics package and is compatible with more browsers than svg and the canvas tag
9788
partition i section 12.6.6 of the cli spec states a conforming cli shall guarantee that read and write access to properly aligned memory locations no larger than the native word size is atomic when all the write accesses to a location are the same size.
9788
so that confirms that s_initialized will never be unstable and that read and writes to primitve types smaller than 32 bits are atomic
9796
that said i have much more experience with ss than oracle so ymmv
10103
john s answer referencing the cli spec indicates that accesses to variables not larger than 32 bits on a 32-bit processor are atomic
10112
i ve never found anything i like more than cygwin
10285
vb.net shouldn t be much slower than c#
10339
unless you re communicating with a lot of other native c dlls or so on c# is likely to be between 5 slower to 5 faster than c++ std string really kills you if you re using it

10550
once you know where the keys are you probably just want to practice typing out text and a program like that won t really aid any more than notepad apart from counting your words per minute and giving you something to type
10552
i originally had more bitmasking going on instead of comparisons but i seriously doubt bitmasking is any faster than comparison on modern hardware
10661
is the action output caching faster than page output caching
10713
i don t have a thorough analysis but it was definitely faster than sax
10756
more than 1 responsibility its an integration test
10764
however this is not really much more than obfuscation since your code is likely to be stored in some source repository somewhere
10911
wpf also apparently has poor performance on pre-vista machines when more than one wpf process is running
10995
there s nothing worse than having text you cannot read properly.

11034
that said tfs is a server connected model so it ll always be a bit slower than true offline source control systems
11049
if you have column names that occur in more than one table specifying the table name as part of the column reference is a must and thus a table alias will allow for a shorter syntax
11088
working with some low level code occasionally you need to work with bytes that have unsigned values greater than 128 which causes java to interpret them as a negative number due to the msb being used for sign
11290
therefore it s not any faster than page output caching
11588
no point in writing up all your docs twice and watching things get more and more out of sync
11646
it has the same flaws as many other wiki packages e.g difficult to reorganize without orphaning pages but is as good if not better than other wiki packages i ve used
11661
it is definately a lot safer than passing void around
11689
i m looking for discussion and what issues are important more than i m looking for hard answers
11704
for serious wiki users then you probably need something more than the sharepoint provided wiki - either via an extension or a dedicated wiki product
11974
basically something better than this
12140
this works better in any case much better than having all those objects need some global settings object --- that of course effectively makes unit testing impossible disadvantage can be that you sometimes need to set a dozen of properties or that you need to let those properties percolate into sub-objects
12166
it s newer than py2exe and handles eggs quite well
12184
if you want to provide general-purpose data that the receiver might want to do unforeseen weird and crazy things with or if you want to be really paranoid and picky about i18n or if what you re sending is more like a document than a struct or if the order of the data matters or if the data is potentially long-lived as in more than seconds xml is the way to go

the second part of my questions is whether unit testing would be is easier with linq
12815
implementing features became so much easier after writing a test and we were able to make major architectural changes to the system with all the confidence in the world that everything still worked the same as it did yesterday
12852
on consumer sites you could also be hand-wavier under a minute
12857
i m using the database because that way i can detect when pages timeout which happens a lot more than i d like
13094
that might be more overhead than it s worth
13197
i don t know anything better than an iframe
13214
it s possible for a thread to be in more than one state at once therefore the threadstate property is actually a bitmap of possible states
13295
when coding i use many variables and don t do more than one step on a line
13463
if person a is running the project but person b and c want to make changes and share those changes with each other it becomes much easier with distributed source control
13870
i think that this approach is much easier than hooking api calls and much less intrusive
13918
if that article goes over your head have a look at this documentation first and then re-read the original article i found the article made much more sense after i d used the event library
14201
i mostly just use notepad++ but i like babelpad when i need to open a file in a unicode path or when i need to have more control over unicode stuff
14210
in general enterprise moves slower than consumer
14310
i m having problems using textures that are larger than the opengl window or the display size as non-display render targets
14374
it s more than a smtp server you can send thousands of emails from - not sure if that s what you re looking for
14404
it goes on in some more detail with diagrams and all
14607
most documentation that will be viewed by more than one pair of human eyes
14690
it s also easier to make backups - cloning a repository to another location machine disk means i can just push the changes to that location which is even easier with a default push repository
14759
this contains a lot of different pieces of advice for getting more speed out of mysql
14989
adopting a contrary standard is going to cause more grief than it s worth even if it s something generally recommended
15034
it should have more than enough ram to generate the resources

if you have a sql statement like the one above that may change data in more than one row you might want to include a cursor to update all records affected by the trigger
15195
if it s technical people without a cs background they ought to be told about the halting problem which is undecidable and is simpler than counting and classifying the remaining bugs
15222
if the internal implementation was say a linked list then a simple for loop would be quite a bit slower than a foreach
15232
so it appears fairly consistent for is quicker than foreach and arrays are quicker than generic lists
15310
i am aware that microsoft has a rule of thumb stating that a ssrs report should take no longer than 30 seconds to execute
15323
that said once the physiological leap is taken it more than makes sense - it seems inappropriate to structure objects the old way
15601
if you re in the more than two monitor club you ll need two video cards as well
15635
is there anything more annoying than having to stop and wait for your tools
15660
with a pointer being wider than a character and all the processing associated with indirection you d be mad to use that particular pattern that way in a word processor
15667
generally visual studio vs is more advanced and performs significantly better than eclipse - at least the versions of vs that i have seen
15874
using ints is generally better than using shorts because java uses 32-bit values internally anyway even for bytes unless in an array so using ints will avoid unnecessary conversion to from short values in the bytecode
15899
do anyone have a better way than this

here s the wikipedia entry on branches since they probably explain things better than i can
16381
gethashcode should be a lot quicker than equals but doesn t need to be unique
16471
concatenation didn t even register as 1ms which is why i output the timer ticks as well
16480
if it contains numbers or any other non-string things dates i d use string.format because it gives me more control over the formatting
16551
it s a lot lighter weight than xml
16696
they are both relatively easy to install - although i seem to remember webalizer being a little easier than awstats and they both have varied configuration options to let you decide exactly what you want to get out of them
16797
i found factor css - complete with source code but i think it does way more than i d need
16914
the pen is more than one pixel thick
16940
admittedly this might not be a problem on larger screens but my employer is abit tight and refuses to buy monitors larger than 19inch this means that i dont have much screen real estate to view all the visual studio windows and my code at the same time or two pieces of code at once
17033
a more robust and cleaner approach than the line line idea would be to simply use namespaces and embed xhtml content
17048
boot can be smaller than 1gb this is just my standard will not become full ever size
17311
if you want to perform more complicated operations like reading the output of the external program you may be better served by the popen system call

generating c code is as easy as generating html just use print or equivalent which in turn is much easier than writing a c parser or html parser
17703
server-side programming has been around for a lot longer than client side and has lots of good solutions already
17730
if you put these in one table and you want to allow users to have more than one photo or cv then you need two link-tables to associate files- users and files- cms_pages
18033
personally i think going with the whole package of components is a better deal as it s only 289 and comes with many useful components
18076
there are some gotchas in terms of p invoke calls not always working across 32 64 as well as managed directx not working well under 64-bit but on the whole i think its something people are going to be doing more as time goes by
18132
finally what are thoughts on using nhibernate which has been around for a long time and may be more mature than the ado.net entity framework
18167
unfortunately i ve reached a point in my development where i need more than the token sample records that are currently in the staging database

what if you need to scale your app by load balancing more than one web server
18864
i can tweak the limbs and leaves of a tree easier than i can alter it s trunk
19007
surprisingly in both products creating tables isn t as easy as it should but both are faster than reportviewer and handle extremely well multi-column reports barcodes and aggregate data
19373
all that said an algorithm that should work would be to determine a minimum volume amplitude threshold and duration say 10dba for more than 2 seconds and then simply do a volume analysis of the waveform looking for areas that meet this criteria with perhaps some filters for millisecond spikes
19398
in the second case which is common practice there are three conditional statements which is obviously slower than just having one
19492
i suspect that this should go some way towards helping solve some of our problems but i can still see some advantages of having more control over the build projects
19545
much better than the reverse of munging different things together
19555
sqlite is used in more applications than any other db
19555
it seems to be higher performance than sqlite which probably has more to do with it being run on an smp machine and making use to different threads

i haven t done any proper benchmarks but i tried out several other components and found that spreadsheetgear was considerably faster than xlsio which i was using before
19692
using a new language in production code is about more than easy syntax and high-level capability
19814
this is for reasons similar to the reasons it s good to learn c like how a strcpy takes more time than copying an integer or why you should use pointers to arrays as function parameters instead of arrays by value
19908
worked fairly well just a little slower than i like
20083
i think the key for most new programmers especially children who are more than apt to losing interest in things is instantaneous feedback

i d like to avoid this however since it would make my abstract class file a lot bigger than i d like it to be
20286
this would allow me to see what advertising is working and from where with a somewhat finer grain than google analytics would
20648
i suppose it may be a little more work than the value converter but it is another option
20752
of course shells do more than that like piping input and output but you should be able to accomplish the basics using fork execve and waitpid
20866
if you only need 50 of them and you re not low on memory then separate bools is pretty much always a better choice than a bitset
20975
it s possible for an application to have more than one appdomain so that may or may not do what you want
21035
second mover advantage - just as microsoft built a better java with .net they re able to look at how you d design a ria plugin from scratch today
21037
depending on how you want the output to look a subreport could do or you could group on id property1 property2 and show the items from your other table as detail items assuming you want to show more than just count
21037
carlton jenke i think you will find an outer join a better performer than the correlated subquery in the example you gave
21093
the stringbuilder.append method is much better than using the + operator

is this better than the python approach
21985
i would say that a 3rd party encryption tool is not safer than the .net framework encryption algorithms these libraries just help you doing your job faster

and while plain vim is still more than capable neovim is a promising restart and it s modernised a few old warts
24235
coderush is way more than refactoring
24429
it throws an exception if it waits more than 120 seconds because you may get caught in a situation where the file is never released
24455
this allows better control over nested loops

our experiences is that you can potentially get much better performance than typical relational databases
24499
db4o s text searching is far far slower than sql full text indexing
24564
i have found that visualsvn is about 50 slower than running svn as a native service
24583
for longer than msbuild and has more
24645
quite the contrary i have been in the situation more than once where i want to extend a class but couldn t because it was sealed
24689
i bet your cache is heavier than serving the pages straight
24846
boxing can be a bigger concern than unboxing
24948
this is most useful where you have if conditional statements as exists can be a lot quicker than count
24948
in some implementations mostly older such as microsoft sql server 2000 in queries will always get a nested join plan while join queries will use nested merge or hash as appropriate
24957
as i usually use uml more as a communication tool rather than a modeling tool i sometimes have the need to flex the language a bit which makes the strict modeling tools quite unwieldy
25081
however in c++ if using other types that provide their own ++ operators the prefix version is likely to be faster than the postfix version
25105
and of course the bsd man pages which are an excellent resource as they are maintained to a far greater extent than your average linux man-page

25386
i think it was fowler who said imperfect tests run frequently are much better than perfect tests that are never written at all
25519
also there could be more than 1 anchor tag in the string
25750
for dictionary keys this makes a huge difference because if i can see the two pointers are pointing to the same thing that s much cheaper than having to do a whole string comparison to make sure the strings have equal value
25768
it s a lot simpler than xml easier to use and mind-numbingly trivial to implement
25776
this method won t be faster than a line by line copy but it will save coding and it will be more resistant to changes in your database or code
26046
if you have to go to disk the performance hit is many orders of magnitude greater than memory
26126
i used to have more problems with javascript differences but after i started using javascript libraries such as jquery i stopped having any serious problems with that
26195
so my question is this has anyone out there found a decent solution for this that does more than this script
26284
or you might have instances living and working longer than you expect
26325
grapefrukt i detest the flash components they typically cause more grief than time saved however in this case i had a lot of cue points and navigation stuff going on with the video files and the flvplayback component was the best solution i found
26539
of course you can t do this if your breaking conditionally in more than one place which i ve done on occasion
26566
i always have it set to on for the reasons above but if you have more than 1 result set in your proc it could mess up client code
26756
your job may be made a bit easier by using the squish library to decompress the blocks for you
26836
bigger than it was at the last checkin
27030
the objects have 8 total properties but each object will not have a value for each and the arrays are never going to be any larger than 8 items each so maybe the brute force method of traversing each and then looking at the values of the 8 properties is the easiest way to do what i want to do but before implementing i wanted to see if anyone had a more elegant solution
27054
the friction of keeping your changes in your local branches and not publishing them is typically lower than publishing them in some branch on a publically available server
27168
chartdirector is fantastic and supports more than just java and .net
27202
for my projects deleting chaff from a checkout has always been faster than checking out a fresh working copy
27212
edit the answer kamens gave deserves consideration as well since a single function to compare two given objects would be much smaller than any library to do what i suggest although my suggestion would certainly work well enough
27258
our site already uses jquery for some things so i ll probably use jquery for making requests since in my experience it seems to perform much better than asp s ajax framework does
27360
in a one off situation where i just need it here i think using some handrolled reflection code is a better approach than having an additional library to link against and only calling it one place.
27443
in most regards postgresql is slower than mysql especially when it comes to fine tuning in the end
28119
if you re looking for more control over the format of the string then printf is your answer
28176
definitely a better approach than using a cursor
28228
once you get over the fact that up-arrow and down-arrow are replaced by esc k and then j you ll see that vi mode offers more than emacs mode for command line editing in bash

vmware is beefer and sucks more of the system s performance away by default also seems to perform somewhat better than parallels but can have serious graphical problems depending on your setup particularly if you try to use unity mode
28317
i am not even seeing any performance issues as the hardware in the macbook pro is much better than the hardware i had in my previous laptop
28443
inaccuracy with floating point numbers doesn t come from representing values larger than double.maxvalue which is impossible excluding double.positiveinfinity
28561
the price might be having to give credit but that would be way cheaper than actually writing and debugging the software
28580
explicit is better than implicit
28876
it has many tutorials and makes it all easy way easier than opengl in my opinion
28981
this will usually give more than enough precision unless you need to mix both huge scale planets and microscopic level basketballs in the same world
28984
i ve actually done a small test like this in python on a website i maintain and found that they are almost equivalent in speed with the procedural approach winning by something like ten-thousandths of a second but that the oo code was so significantly cleaner i didn t continue the exercise any longer than one iteration
29092
i don t know the implementation details of the stack overflow authentication provider but that cookie data is probably automatically used to verify your identity at a lower level than the vote controller method
29114
if you want to run more than one command at the same time use quotes and semicolons
29265
now iterate between 3 and 4 with more and more functional prototypes and more specs with more details
29293
that is precisely why you should not have more than one datacontext
29395
it s quite a bit bigger than xxd and is distributed under the gpl
29408
i m not even sure that s foolproof but it s certainly much better than javascript
29444
if the type has more than one constructor then you may have to do some fancy footwork to find the one that accepts your string parameter
29504
since we never read more than this only affects the last two bytes
29614
it would probably be more work than it s worth but you can use static c# vb variables in a sql clr udf so i think you d be able to do what you want to do by simply incrementing this variable every time the udf is called
29686
the problem is sometimes i get http timeouts presumably because the request runs longer than executiontimeout 110 seconds per default
29763
i think memory consumption was about 50 mb bigger with eaccelerator then it was without when i did my benchmarks
29777
i have a solution in visual studio 2005 professional edition which in turn has 8 projects.i am facing a problem that even after i set the command arguments in the project settings of the relevant project it doesnt accept those command line arguments and it shows argc 1 inspite of me giving more than 1 command arguments
29922
the dct is heavily used in video compression as the human visual system is must less sensitive to high frequency changes therefore zeroing out the higher frequency values results in a smaller file with little effect on a human s perception of the video quality
29962
it s highly customizable and imho easier than cruisecontrol
30189
elements can belong to more than one class so you can do something like this
30193
html is a really complex language which is one of the major reasons that xhtml was created which is much simpler than html
30277
added oh one more thing temporary indexes are not only physically slower than a table scan but they would destroy your concurrency
30306
but to your original question adding and dropping an index for the purpose of a single query is only beneficial if you do more than one select during the query for example the select is in a sub-query that gets run for each row returned
30397
the groups that we have set up deal more with function such as manager employee etc
30428
but we need a bit more than just session clustering
30535
define data types for each component of the name - note some cultures have more than two names
30660
that for some data is not in sync meaning the master holds more data than the slave

since the question asks about making life easier with mstest and not about alternatives here are my mstest tips
30707
while having a background window flash its taskbar button is better than having it automatically come to the top and steal input focus flashing taskbar buttons are still very intrusive

i have a form that is longer than the screen so a vertical scroll-bar appears as expected
31245
i hope you have weighed the upgrade you are doing against just rewriting from scratch -- as long as you are not intending to extend the app too much and you are not primarily responsible for maintaining the app upgrading a complex workflow-based app like you are doing may be cheaper and a better choice than rewriting it from scratch
31271
if its only for word processing then perhaps docbook might be a little lighter than odf
31273
you have to cast each object into a new list though that becomes much easier with linq
31384
you can also add a second python installation but that also causes more problems than it s worth imo
31542
if you re interested in seeing how the delegate pattern is used in real-world code look no further than cocoa on mac os x
31711
how can i plot a by-road journey of more than 25 points on a virtual earth map
31800
i m building a restful web service which has multiple uris for one of its resources because there is more than one unique identifier
31824
you can then have more control over the xml outputed
31896
this will only get worse over time
32021
yes a-za-z will be much faster than setting the regexoptions.ignorecase largely because of unicode strings
32131
if you need to count and then loop you may be better off with a list
32427
i assume at this point that there isn t a better way than find-replace to increment these version numbers in all of the script tags
32450
i assume at this point that there isn t a better way than find-replace to increment these version numbers in all of the script tags
32495
it will be very helpful for you down the road when you re apps have more interaction with the database throughout and you want to minimize code duplication
32656
in addition to that i find that the svn path is almost always shorter than my file paths so it s less to type
32712
this might prove to be faster than shelling out and you may encounter other situations such as this that need to be implemented specifically for windows
32747
i need to set a string variable to today s date preferably without the year but there s got to be a better way than building it month- -day one piece at a time
32771
hopefully your sales_office exists to serve more than 1 client and will continue to exist for a while at least without any clients
32932
much faster than grep for finding files by name
32982
however undoing this is harder than single-line comments
33026
if you are absolutely stuck using .net 2.0 rtm then validators.dll is better than nothing
33243
the easiest way to generate elegant html and css is to use mvc framework where you have much more control over html generation than with web forms
33246
writing in file is slower than writing in memory so a commit will be slower if performed for many operations in a row rather then for a set of coalesced updates
33246
ps i know for sure that in a scenario i ve seen in a certain application changing the number of coalesced updates from 5k to 50k makes it faster by an order of magnitude 10 times faster
33292
i think it s much better than soapui at least on mac os x
33502
doing 2d should be even easier than this
33587
c++ may be faster than java this is debatable fwiw but you ll get platform independence a lot more easily with java
33587
c++ may be faster than java this is debatable fwiw but you ll get platform independence a lot more easily with java
33587
i doubt that .net would be much faster than java they re both vm languages after all but the big problem with .net is platform independence
33623
yes caching to a database is slower than caching on your webserver
33628
it would solve this problem pretty well it s much faster than a database and is also excellent for caching pretty much anything else too
33689
writing plugins for ie is much harder than for ff i wouldn t go down that path unless forced to
33729
that s why .net generics are better than java generics
33729
that s why .net generics are better than java generics
33759
i don t think it s worse than procedural stuff
33815
it s certainly going to be a lot easier than hacking wordpress to have wiki features especially with the sort of granular permissions you re describing
33858
i would only use uint if you absolutely need the ability to count higher than int but without using the extra memory long requires it s not much more memory so don t be cheap -p
33893
would this be better handled by javascript
33929
to use a classic example though more c-ish than lisp the factorial function illustrates tail recursion
34177
if you want more details please shout but i suspect pablo s blog will have more than enough info for you to steam ahead
34280
digging around the ruby-lang.org documentation page will get you more stuff than you can probably stand
34303
i believe it is a restriction of iis that you can only run more than one website on server versions of the windows os
34329
if you have the expertise use native frontends it ll effectively double the job you have to do for ui but from my experience non-native ui is a little bit clunkier than their native counterparts
34338
i found simpletest was even easier than phpunit to set up
34424
this could be much cleaner with jquery
34538
another thing a more robust framework will give you is the ability to do more than just use innerhtml to replace items in the dom
34583
using ant also makes it possible to do more than just compilation when building and conditional compilation only compile a swf or swc if the source code has actually changed
34708
the final result was a code that was much smaller than a guid and looked random even though it absolutely wasn t
34756
you may have the option to keep more than one version of the library you have and reference a specific version instead of pulling hairs figuring out which version is used by which project
34984
also make sure that you re doing the sanitizing from a trusted process - javascript anything client-side is worse than useless security integrity-wise
35187
this is usually caused when using a build system like apache ant that only compiles java files when the java file is newer than the class file
35248
that would be better than downloading an exe every time they wanted to download a large file
35338
if you use the whole package that tfs offers bug tracking builds reports etc then tfs is a pretty solid choice certainly better than rational
35616
when the process closes the file the os deletes the inode because there are no more directory entries pointing at it and no more processes with the inode open
35677
i ve heard of an xmpp gateway protocol but it s unclear if this is any better than the client solution
35710
this will enable your application to scale better than doing processing server-side
35757
in my opinion python is more than ready for developing complex applications
35768
if you re not open source then gtk+ would be the cheaper option as qt is only free for open source use whereas gtk+ is lgpl
35777
it would be fine to use it for stack overflow which has three developers and i guess no more than 30k lines of code
35834
for example firefox could be running but could be more than one window
35967
a light os install with a static file optimized server will perform faster than apache or iis on a heavy os
36019
this wouldn t work with more than one folder without multiple instances but it would probably do the job
36342
if my computer dies i ll always have a full bootable back-up that is no more than 24 hours old and incremental back-ups no more than an hour old
36398
since hbase and hypertable are all about performance being modeled on google s bigtable they sound like they would certainly be much faster than hive at the cost of functionality and a higher learning curve they don t have joins or the sql-like syntax
36424
it is really easy to write multi-threaded code that performs no better than the single-threaded code it replaces
36777
storing this outside the scope of the page in the session state or cookie may cause problems if more than one browser window is open
36802
this should be fast enough and i believe is simpler than building a voronoi diagram
36870
more than one return is better than huge arrows and guard clauses are generally ok
36870
more than one return is better than huge arrows and guard clauses are generally ok
36943
it s possible and actually i m hoping that the middle compression method will always be better than the list or the bit array or both
37173
there is no issue in having more than one segment but there can be a big problem if you try to merge two segments which have 1mil items in each and you have a watcher thread which kills the process if it takes too long...
37194
for those kinds of children and if it s your own child who you can teach one-on-one you could do worse than javascript - it has the advantage that you can do real stuff with it right away and the edit-test cycle is simply hitting refresh in the browser
37276
i have found mootools to be pretty slick for animations just a little smoother than jquery
37409
i came into the scene more than six months after this and it was stil flooded with bugs
37456
the bin packing problem partition a set into a minimum number of sets where each subset is smaller than some limit
37567
it s far from perfect as not everyone is doing it and we have multiple product versions in use but better than nothing
37687
make a regular expression replace more than one match answer to the specific problem
37786
i could write more but as you can see i struggle to be concise
37970
typing of enum values being more than a fixed enum but less that a full blown class already has been mentioned just want to advocate
38082
since hitting the mdb uses file-based operations it s pretty easy to end up with a corrupt database if you have anything more than a trivial db
38198
i believe a float is smaller than a double so it might be to prevent overflows caused by not knowing what decimal format to use
38246
but from my .net experience i know it would hold up just as well if not better than current production ruby applications
38524
personally i tend to be of the opinion that if you need to return more than one value from a function you should reconsider if you re doing things the right way or use an object
38533
btree files are often much faster than relational databases
38595
in our tests it was 4x faster than memcachedotnet and almost 2x faster than enyim with a lower memory footprint
38647
when using the entity framework does esql perform better than linq to entities
38689
there s nothing worse than using a technology stack that doesn t have a feature you really really need
38863
perhaps there is a better solution than this though
38905
i don t think composition is always better than inheritance just usually
38931
for quite some time i ve been using profont mainly because it allows a lot of lines fit into a given height a lot more than say consolas or others
38936
as you say there s no adobe-created way to do this but you might have better luck with zinc it is similar to air but provides real os integration of flash-based applications
38954
of course there may be more than one interface that would get you there
39011
it s a google developer tool which bundle majors javascript libraries and make it easier to deploy upgrade and make them lighter by always using compressed versions
39031
the wal logging operates on the page level which is much lower than the table level and doesn t even know which page holds data from which table
39036
the simple truth is that an interface is nothing more than a contract that a method is implemented
39251
for fetching data or at least the fetching of data that is coming from more than one table you can use stored procedures or views because the results will not be anonymous so you can return them from an outside method
39309
a java application bundle on os x is nothing more than a directory containing your .jars and a number of configuration files
39344
table variables and temporary tables where available will often be better than using a large source table
39473
i get the impression that it s not exactly a match made in heaven but a decent speed increasy would be better than nothing
39579
which is used of course only for values of h greater than zero
39598
apple have recently announced opencl which they claim is much more than cuda yet quite simple
39616
i like tools that will perform more than one task notepad++ is a great notepad replacement and has a document monitor plugin installs with standard msi that works great
39638
i wasted more time than i d like to admit debugging problems that turned out to be related to the various configuration size settings on both the client and server
39946
can someone give me a short and understandable explanation shorter than the definitions on wikipedia here and here
39961
all chrome does is separate multiple components different tabs plug-ins etcetera into separate processes but i can t imagine a single page having more than one javascript thread
39961
i don t think it will ever be implemented in the language itself since true multi-threading is only useful if the browser can run a single page multi-threaded or even more than one core and the difficulties there are way larger than the extra possibilities

i don t see how your type string option is any safer than using object or struct
40128
i don t see how your type string option is any safer than using object or struct
40142
it would also be faster than dictionary lookups for parameter values
40249
guids will certainly be slower and use more memory than standard integer keys but whether or not that is an issue will depend on the type of load your system will see
40358
i don t know how well it will do with really large tables but visual studio is much quicker than sql management studio for basic table operations
40512
that makes hashtable slower than hashmap
40631
i like it better than flex builder
40631
i like it better than flex builder
40663
are there any other tools libraries strategies for validating a larger than normal xml file
40705
i d like to avoid this because system may have a newer version than python 2.4 or may have python 2.5 but no python 2.4
40878
this makes hashmap better for non-threaded applications as unsynchronized objects typically perform better than synchronized ones
40904
actually it d be worse as the mysql manual doesn t seem to indicate it supports d
41069
here the first argument is the window that owns the dialog box the second is the title of the window and the third is the default path to start at you need the at the end otherwise it ll start a directory higher with the user s home folder selected
41100
you can have more than one oracle instance on a server
41156
the strings are longer than full alphanumeric strings to compensate for using fewer symbols
41312
that said one thought would be to check if iis is configured to run in web garden mode more than 1 process executing your application which would break your locking logic
41367
2 maybe the need to scale will not outpace moore s law and maybe upgrading hardware will be cheaper than refactoring
41370
to summarize i ve argued that xemacs has a much lower market share poorer performance more bugs much lower stability and at this point probably fewer features than gnu emacs

as per this comment in a related thread i d like to know why levenshtein distance based methods are better than soundex
42049
i find them useful when you always deal with two or more objects as a set
42108
it is a bit of a hack but it s a lot easier than other options and you won t need a 3rd party lib to do it though if you prefer a cleaner solution there probably are some kind of 3rd party tools out there you could use
42148
if you use an xmltextreader class it will technically be faster than using an xmldocument which parses the entire file and builds a dom for you
42286
it seems like there should be something shorter than this
42519
update nick s answer is the most straightforward but is there a way to do it better than n 2
42629
my current database was completely awash with countless small tables of no more than 5 rows each
42640
i use it all the time for oracle and have had good results often better than oracle s tools

these two things should have taken the programmer no more than 5 days of work or else you are looking at too much code to review for the this step in the process be done thoroughly
42757
nothing worse than having someone beaver away in the dark for several days weeks months only for you to find that they ve implemented something in completely the wrong way technique style etc
42888
an xpath style api might be better than a dom api in that case - it might you decouple the nodes from the tree a bit more and treat the mutated tree more intelligently
43037
if your core requirement is a data-interchange format lighter than xml then you might want to consider using json instead of yaml
43084
i ve also read that due to the way that infopath works it can not handly more than one schema for each namespace
43088
it has a better implementation than this one which i leave here just in case someone s interested in seeing how one might roll your own calculator
43201
if you required the store name to be a higher priority than the function itself in the url
43223
or alternatively is there a way to allow certain block to run at a faster speed than the rest of the application
43478
there s no way to do this a lot easier with jdk methods but as apocalisp has already noted you re not the only one with this idea you could use ioutils from jakarta commons io it also has a lot of other useful things that imo should actually be part of the jdk.
43524
it s much slower than vc6 say
43548
+1 for visualsvn being better than ankhsvn having tried both and +1 for the fogbugz add-in

i can run eclipse which is java which is memory hungry and slower than native code and this is still way faster than vs 2005
43863
the absolute value of the result is strictly smaller than the absolute value of the second operand
43898
i do find the syntax of .slice to be cleaner than using the selector filters though
44062
i may be channelling spolsky not sure if he s said this but using vss is actually worse than not using source control at all
44195
union will be slower than union all because union will filter out dups
44218
there is an addition in 3.5 sp1 that allows better interaction between directx and wpf d3dimage and one way to get to that is through xna
44478
if there are common batch activities like delete all older than x date for instance i would write a static method on a collection class that executes the batch update or delete
44558
if you re up for it a full blown di framework with swappable configurations is the way to go but i think this is at least better than using globals.connectionstring
44644
ideally we would have better control over this situation and we are trying to get control over it but that is taking a while
44691
nightly backups of work folders to servers will prevent losing more than a days work
45002
i cannot seem to find a way to build either a custom sort or a custom scorer that can rank exact term matches much higher than other prefix term matches
45234
and preventing more than one flashing operation at a time on a given window would be nice too
45313
i experience that on several different machines with plugins without plugins with vb.net or c# solutions of many different sizes closing the solution in vs 2005 generally takes significantly more time than actually building the solution
45498
although i couldn t recommend doing this as anything more than a short term fix or for small one-off tasks
45527
database indexes perform better than fs trees when more number of items are to be stored
45547
paragraph widths larger than your display make a web site completely unusable
45611
that was easier than writing the deletion query i d have needed to do this in sql -- removing whole slices of the database isn t a normal operation so the schema isn t exactly adapted to it
45636
if your c c++ code is portable to nix few things are better than valgrind
45890
is there an easier way than this though
46123
but if c f is greater than c c then the code size is going to increase

46178
unless you choose an int representation that s longer than the string collisions will always be possible no matter what conversion you re using
46185
the remote debugging experience on newer vs versions is a lot smoother than old versions in my experience
46216
if you have a string of more than 4 ascii characters or more than two unicode characters then there are more possible string values than possible integer values
46216

46224
i doubt that doing comparisons on big integers would be substantially faster than doing string comparisons in the first place
46224
in any case if your strings are around 10 characters i doubt that comparing say a bunch of 32 bit hashes will be all that much faster than direct string comparisons
46244
or something more robust by using a library such as jquery
46544
dvcs achieve better merges by tracking the parent revisions of merges
47156
although i believe it s much easier by utilizing filter
47279
the only ones i ve found is produced by oracle corp and as such are little more than advertising pieces pushing their technology of the moment

bottom line jruby has its merits multithreading solid platform easy java integration but given that interpreted mode is the only mode that worked for us in practice it may be expected to be no better performance-wise than c ruby

it will depend on the browser s ability to solve this situation if it can t divide the parent s box by 3 without remaining will it draw a 1- or 2-pixel space or make 1 or 2 spans out of three wider than the rest
47659
about q4e i have been reading a lot of good stuff about it and seems the next versions will do a lot more than m2eclipse with a better dependency management and even visual graphs
47735
for those who don t have it enabled you can always make the submit button for the hidden form visible and instruct them to press it if it takes more than 5 seconds
47795
really what s going on here is that whether you use a stub or a mock in some cases you have to couple to your code more than you d like
47865
since the address space of the new process is already up and running this is should be cheaper than calling createprocess in windows and having it load the exe image associated dlls etc
47895
in programming a magic number is a value that should be given a symbolic name but was instead slipped into the code as a literal usually in more than one place
47895
this is sometimes helpful but can also create more complexity than it s worth
47964
it is clear that at least historically the need for unix-based systems to have fast process creation is far greater than for windows systems
47990
use 1ull if number is wider than unsigned long
47990
promotion of doesn t happen until after evaluating where it s ub to shift by more than the width of a long
48001
superclass name more than a qualified
48012
is asp.net mvc that much better than php with tools like cakephp
48031
if does cost you a tiny bit of performance for accessing the table but this is no worse than any other virtual function call
48035
so the only other problem you mentioned and that i can think of is the security of it but it shouldn t be too difficult to make it secure and it s obviously a lot more secure than using eval
48035

48053
perhaps someone can confirm this but i thought the difference is 5-10 time slower than with an integer division operation
48097
simple queries may be easier with hql while using the specification pattern you may find the criteria api to be a better fit
48097
hql is more my style and it s better than sql - it s object based not schema based and seems to work better for me for simple getx methods
48098
creating proper destructors for each class will make the deletion a little cleaner than massive loops throughout the code

48103
a side effect of many division routines is the modulus - so in few cases should division actually be faster than modulus
48110
to give a bit of background when learning my way around a new system i frequently find myself wanting to discover where some particular value came from but searching the entire code base turns up far more matches than i can reasonably assess individually
48180
the amount of overhead in trashing your buffer and reallocating memory is smaller than the overhead of going out to the network and doing an odbc read some make the buffer fairly small and change it often rather
48210
its all-java version for example cannot play mpeg-2 mpeg-4 windows media realmedia most quicktime movies flash content newer than flash 2 and needs a plug-in to play the ubiquitous mp3 format
48259
what s funny here is that the binary tree search appears a little probably not statistically quicker than the cil switch instruction
48319
for the reason mentioned above i ve had the project to implement my own collections library for .net but i ve stopped this project after the first benchmark revealed that even a straightforward non-thread-safe generic vector implementation is slower than the native
48431
i m not real familiar with svn i ve never used it - so i can t comment that mergeing is worse with tfs - and haven t hit the merge bug ben s reported - but i ve had great success with branching and merging using tfs
48431
if you have developers who need or want to often be disconnected from the network for long periods of time - you are likely better off with svn
48448
6 if you do more than just .net java work eclipse etc go with svn
48462
it has high overhead and is slower than arraylist so you shouldn t use it except for a large amount of data when its hashing speed becomes a factor
48462
treeset keeps the data ordered therefore is slower than hashset
48797
i think a place where singleton will make more sense than the static class is when you have to construct a pool of costly resources like database connections
48897
learning flex may be interesting and useful but is it more useful to you than more experience with .net technologies
48912
sockets operate at a higher level than raw packets - it s like a file you can read write from
48929
the read call may block until the requested number of bytes are read but it can return fewer bytes than what was requested
49031
to me this is better than having the main form perform creation of the object and to be so tightly bound to it
49290
abstract classes cannot define mix-ins -- a class cannot extend more than one parent
49356
if so is there a better name than projects
49381
all of the hyperlink controls with the class name nolink will automatically have all of their urls removed and the link will appear to be nothing more than text
49428
some of the more advanced java bytecode obfuscators do much more than just class name mangling
49443
a feasible architecture would probably be to use a sip trunk they optimize on using voip as much as possible and thus can provide much lower rates than a gsm provider generally does
49492
explicit is better than implicit
49565
this is why iterative development and iterative releases work so much better than waterfall
49611
you really can t get much easier than visualsvn for version control on windows
49953
java has much better performance than python and has way better tool support
49953
sometimes those things matter a lot and java is the better language than python for a task
