i d like a similar function class for c++ or c# which can generate more than 32 bits of randomness and which low-order bits are equally as random as high-order bits
635
for the books generating xml is much easier than parsing
875
also it s much faster than svn
1145
it s trivial to do if the search and replace strings are the same length or the replace string is shorter than the search string since i have enough space allocated
1174
judging by your example property would you be better of with a class approach for the final level and real properties
1339
i if destination does not exist and copying more than one file assumes that destination must be a directory
1347
you will probably find better support with nant
1347
i would learn both and use which every fits more smoothly with your environment
1949
additionally there would be some table classes that would exist in more than one datacontext
2033
is slower than by reference since the system has to copy the parameter

as matthew stated you really shouldn t bother an rss feed more than the producer allows but you can use http headers to check for changes in a very light way which is something rss2email does quite well
2310
if you have more than one project you might want to replicate this kind of structure under each project
2369
this is an alternative way datareader is faster than this one
2384
the stream contains more information than i m trying to read since i m not interested in data at the end of the file

superficially it might seem a little like a mathematical function mapping reals to reals but a c++ function can do more than just return a number that depends on its arguments
2562
i found the production of wmv much better and easier than flv because all windows flv encoders i tried are not really good and stable whereas pretty much every tool can natively output wmv
2703
previous version would fail for input string longer than 4000 chars
2862
i m not sure how lightweight it is but it certainly feels snappier than eclipse
2901
also any forms that you show non-modally will continue to run alongside your main form which will enable you to have more than one windows that do not block each other
2938
joey i believe anything is lighter than eclipse
2984
from what i understand it does a bit more than just syntax analysis
3112
the problem is that the value will be a scalar when there is only one value and it will be an array reference when there is more than one value
3455
another option is vmware fusion which is much better than parallels in my opinion + windows xp + sql server management studio
3801
my impression is that the cpu in a webserver does not need to be that fast because requests are usually rather lightweight so having more slower cores should be a better choice as we got many small requests
3932
they recently also added a personal license that is significantly cheaper than the corporate one
3974
values with more than two digits might not work as expected for either your original solution or the x100 trick
4238
and of course if you are only wanting to profile a single application each commercial package has a 15 or 30 day trial more than enough time to pinpoint any issues in an existing application
4299
that would be more secure than enabling clr support in the database server
4305
something like mediatemple - which won t host the worlds fastest websites but for the price is far better than shared hosting

4392
it has to be easier than this though
4401
this is cleaner than using a two-step approach of generate script plus run
4593
i dont think that mondrian is better than ssas but i do know that its free and you independently distribute it
4661
i have more than one openid as i have tried out numerous
4932
further edit the reason the second option would print integer is because there is no widening into a larger primitive as an option so it must box it up thus integer is the only option
5264
in other words the image if smaller than the dimensions allotted on the design surface will be anchored to the top left corner not in the center
5264
my report will know the url of the image at runtime and i need to be able to center this image if it is smaller than the dimensions specified in my designer
5270
in addition to being more lightweight than ssms you can also practice writing linq queries- way more fun than boring old tsql
5310
considering that i don t think using more than one datacontext would do any harm- in fact creating different datacontexts for different types of work would help make your linqtosql impelmentation more usuable and organized
5345
and once you ve learned to work with the page layout system it s usually no harder than table based layout
5354
following these two simple rules is worth more than most user interface usability guidelines
5474
accessibility is important and maintaining semantic x html is much easier than maintaining table layouts but that #1 spot on google will bring home the bacon
5683
from my experience vmware is waaaay better than virtual pc if you can convince your company to use it you wont regret the switch

anything requiring slightly more than simple addition is going to involve pointers and they are sure to get it
5739
from what i understand - it s all client side and requires nothing more than their jar file
5949
assuming that the web app in question is secure enough to prevent people entering other numbers to view other users without authorization a simple sequentially-assigned surrogate key also leaks the total number of instances older than this one in this case users which might be privileged information
6134
how can i best identify the ones that have run for longer than an hour or so
6369
how do i call my stored proc with more than 1 value in the list
6413
but palmsey is more correct especially if your page could have the possibility of more than one master page
6553
when it does break i go back to one higher than where i was previously so if it broke at the 75th floor i go back to the 51st floor and drop the second marble and move up a floor at a time until it breaks at which point i know the highest floor i can drop from with no marble breakage
6805
note 2 you ll want to profile this because it ll be bigger and slower than the solution you ve already got
6906
i ve heard it said that java is more like write once debug everywhere but that s probably as true as or even moreso than c#
6911
i think there are larger problems than performance to worry about
6913
my goal is to create a centralized piece of code for managing several ui components in a particular way and then be able to use that both the ui layout and the logic in more than one place
6980
it s a lot easier than using a cursor and seems to work fairly well
6987
add an .ico file to the application section of the properties page and recieved the error thats been described when i checked the icon file with an icon editor it turn out that the file had more than one version of the image ie 16 x 16 24 x 24 32 x 32 48 x 48 vista compressed i removed the other formats that i didnt want resaved the file just with 32x 32 and the application now compiles without error
7018
tons more lines of code much faster than the awk script
7039
you can start diving into some funky effectcs and even consider using the gpu for more than it was originally intended
7090
other things to consider with the files i ve tested png compresses better than jpeg
7257
the try-catch method is the quickest if the object does hold an int and by far the slowest if it doesn t even slower than gettype
7265
but i think you are within reason to do it and it s probably going to be a whole lot cheaper than having to fire him and recruit someone new
7290
i don t know how you can be more non-technical than that except by saying turing complete means able to answer computable problem given enough time and space
7478
if it s being examined on a regualr basis writing to a table amkes the reporting back much easier as it s trivial to reverse the order and only show the last x events for the current time period
7487
for the sieve you can do better by using a wheel instead of adding one each time check out the improved incremental prime number sieves
7492
more scalability problems would surface at the second stage and even more - after the launch
7858
however like it has been mentioned any convention is better than no convention
7917
i m importing some data from a csv file and numbers that are larger than 1000 get turned into 1 100 etc
7937
does anyone have an even better solution than this one
7939
yes join usually is worse than no join at all when it comes to performance but join usually is better than fake join by first reading the whole table a and then using the gained information to read and filter table b

8051
if there are more than 4 you are right 4s and s would be the same but with fewer than 4 chars in g s would be left justified and 4s would be right-justified in a 4 char field
8247
it s limited to 4gb files on windows and it s likely slower than just using a platform-specific call like getfilesizeex or stat64
8356
or anything faster than o n then the try catch solution would be faster of course
8450
it handles way more than just icons as well
8462
i find the bit-shifting easier than typing 4 8 16 32 and so on
8599
and it goes without saying that it needs to be smaller than xml and faster to parse
8762
everytime i ve used those they have given me much better results than srgb alone
8910
you can get warnings errors when the same row has been updated by more than one user
8941
create an interface and implement the interface in the extension methods which would probably be cleaner than a bit fat switch
9144
you still have to compile but compile times will be shorter than c++
9247
if you re calling a stored procedure 30 000 times you have far bigger problems than connection pooling

torn reads can occur on any value whose fields add up to more than the size of a pointer
9723
it was designed as a vector graphics package and is compatible with more browsers than svg and the canvas tag
9788
partition i section 12.6.6 of the cli spec states a conforming cli shall guarantee that read and write access to properly aligned memory locations no larger than the native word size is atomic when all the write accesses to a location are the same size.
9788
so that confirms that s_initialized will never be unstable and that read and writes to primitve types smaller than 32 bits are atomic
9796
that said i have much more experience with ss than oracle so ymmv
10103
john s answer referencing the cli spec indicates that accesses to variables not larger than 32 bits on a 32-bit processor are atomic
10112
i ve never found anything i like more than cygwin
10285
vb.net shouldn t be much slower than c#
10339
unless you re communicating with a lot of other native c dlls or so on c# is likely to be between 5 slower to 5 faster than c++ std string really kills you if you re using it

10550
once you know where the keys are you probably just want to practice typing out text and a program like that won t really aid any more than notepad apart from counting your words per minute and giving you something to type
10552
i originally had more bitmasking going on instead of comparisons but i seriously doubt bitmasking is any faster than comparison on modern hardware
10661
is the action output caching faster than page output caching
10713
i don t have a thorough analysis but it was definitely faster than sax
10756
more than 1 responsibility its an integration test
10764
however this is not really much more than obfuscation since your code is likely to be stored in some source repository somewhere
10911
wpf also apparently has poor performance on pre-vista machines when more than one wpf process is running
10995
there s nothing worse than having text you cannot read properly.

11034
that said tfs is a server connected model so it ll always be a bit slower than true offline source control systems
11049
if you have column names that occur in more than one table specifying the table name as part of the column reference is a must and thus a table alias will allow for a shorter syntax
11088
working with some low level code occasionally you need to work with bytes that have unsigned values greater than 128 which causes java to interpret them as a negative number due to the msb being used for sign
11290
therefore it s not any faster than page output caching
11588
no point in writing up all your docs twice and watching things get more and more out of sync
11646
it has the same flaws as many other wiki packages e.g difficult to reorganize without orphaning pages but is as good if not better than other wiki packages i ve used
11661
it is definately a lot safer than passing void around
11689
i m looking for discussion and what issues are important more than i m looking for hard answers
11704
for serious wiki users then you probably need something more than the sharepoint provided wiki - either via an extension or a dedicated wiki product
11974
basically something better than this
12140
this works better in any case much better than having all those objects need some global settings object --- that of course effectively makes unit testing impossible disadvantage can be that you sometimes need to set a dozen of properties or that you need to let those properties percolate into sub-objects
12166
it s newer than py2exe and handles eggs quite well
12184
if you want to provide general-purpose data that the receiver might want to do unforeseen weird and crazy things with or if you want to be really paranoid and picky about i18n or if what you re sending is more like a document than a struct or if the order of the data matters or if the data is potentially long-lived as in more than seconds xml is the way to go

the second part of my questions is whether unit testing would be is easier with linq
12815
implementing features became so much easier after writing a test and we were able to make major architectural changes to the system with all the confidence in the world that everything still worked the same as it did yesterday
12852
on consumer sites you could also be hand-wavier under a minute
12857
i m using the database because that way i can detect when pages timeout which happens a lot more than i d like
13094
that might be more overhead than it s worth
13197
i don t know anything better than an iframe
13214
it s possible for a thread to be in more than one state at once therefore the threadstate property is actually a bitmap of possible states
13295
when coding i use many variables and don t do more than one step on a line
13463
if person a is running the project but person b and c want to make changes and share those changes with each other it becomes much easier with distributed source control
13870
i think that this approach is much easier than hooking api calls and much less intrusive
13918
if that article goes over your head have a look at this documentation first and then re-read the original article i found the article made much more sense after i d used the event library
14201
i mostly just use notepad++ but i like babelpad when i need to open a file in a unicode path or when i need to have more control over unicode stuff
14210
in general enterprise moves slower than consumer
14310
i m having problems using textures that are larger than the opengl window or the display size as non-display render targets
14374
it s more than a smtp server you can send thousands of emails from - not sure if that s what you re looking for
14404
it goes on in some more detail with diagrams and all
14607
most documentation that will be viewed by more than one pair of human eyes
14690
it s also easier to make backups - cloning a repository to another location machine disk means i can just push the changes to that location which is even easier with a default push repository
14759
this contains a lot of different pieces of advice for getting more speed out of mysql
14989
adopting a contrary standard is going to cause more grief than it s worth even if it s something generally recommended
15034
it should have more than enough ram to generate the resources
15077
if any of our projects ever has enough loc that building takes more than trivial time doing this will also gracefully degrade in the direction of a daily build

if you have a sql statement like the one above that may change data in more than one row you might want to include a cursor to update all records affected by the trigger
15195
if it s technical people without a cs background they ought to be told about the halting problem which is undecidable and is simpler than counting and classifying the remaining bugs
15222
if the internal implementation was say a linked list then a simple for loop would be quite a bit slower than a foreach
15232
so it appears fairly consistent for is quicker than foreach and arrays are quicker than generic lists
15310
i am aware that microsoft has a rule of thumb stating that a ssrs report should take no longer than 30 seconds to execute
15323
that said once the physiological leap is taken it more than makes sense - it seems inappropriate to structure objects the old way
15601
if you re in the more than two monitor club you ll need two video cards as well
15635
is there anything more annoying than having to stop and wait for your tools
15660
with a pointer being wider than a character and all the processing associated with indirection you d be mad to use that particular pattern that way in a word processor
15667
generally visual studio vs is more advanced and performs significantly better than eclipse - at least the versions of vs that i have seen
15874
using ints is generally better than using shorts because java uses 32-bit values internally anyway even for bytes unless in an array so using ints will avoid unnecessary conversion to from short values in the bytecode
15899
do anyone have a better way than this
15949

here s the wikipedia entry on branches since they probably explain things better than i can
16381
gethashcode should be a lot quicker than equals but doesn t need to be unique
16471
concatenation didn t even register as 1ms which is why i output the timer ticks as well
16480
if it contains numbers or any other non-string things dates i d use string.format because it gives me more control over the formatting
16551
it s a lot lighter weight than xml
16696
they are both relatively easy to install - although i seem to remember webalizer being a little easier than awstats and they both have varied configuration options to let you decide exactly what you want to get out of them
16797
i found factor css - complete with source code but i think it does way more than i d need
16914
the pen is more than one pixel thick
16940
admittedly this might not be a problem on larger screens but my employer is abit tight and refuses to buy monitors larger than 19inch this means that i dont have much screen real estate to view all the visual studio windows and my code at the same time or two pieces of code at once
17033
a more robust and cleaner approach than the line line idea would be to simply use namespaces and embed xhtml content
17048
boot can be smaller than 1gb this is just my standard will not become full ever size
17311
if you want to perform more complicated operations like reading the output of the external program you may be better served by the popen system call

it may happen that more than one vendor agrees to implement the same extended functionality

generating c code is as easy as generating html just use print or equivalent which in turn is much easier than writing a c parser or html parser
17703
server-side programming has been around for a lot longer than client side and has lots of good solutions already
17730
if you put these in one table and you want to allow users to have more than one photo or cv then you need two link-tables to associate files- users and files- cms_pages
18033
personally i think going with the whole package of components is a better deal as it s only 289 and comes with many useful components
18076
there are some gotchas in terms of p invoke calls not always working across 32 64 as well as managed directx not working well under 64-bit but on the whole i think its something people are going to be doing more as time goes by
18132
finally what are thoughts on using nhibernate which has been around for a long time and may be more mature than the ado.net entity framework
18167
unfortunately i ve reached a point in my development where i need more than the token sample records that are currently in the staging database

so too could an open source project get more done than a dedicated team if you have a project exciting enough to draw in participation
18837
if you had more than one file that matches .sh you d get a syntax error from find
18838
what if you need to scale your app by load balancing more than one web server
18864
i can tweak the limbs and leaves of a tree easier than i can alter it s trunk
19007
surprisingly in both products creating tables isn t as easy as it should but both are faster than reportviewer and handle extremely well multi-column reports barcodes and aggregate data
19373
all that said an algorithm that should work would be to determine a minimum volume amplitude threshold and duration say 10dba for more than 2 seconds and then simply do a volume analysis of the waveform looking for areas that meet this criteria with perhaps some filters for millisecond spikes
19398
in the second case which is common practice there are three conditional statements which is obviously slower than just having one
19492
i suspect that this should go some way towards helping solve some of our problems but i can still see some advantages of having more control over the build projects
19545
much better than the reverse of munging different things together
19555
sqlite is used in more applications than any other db
19555
it seems to be higher performance than sqlite which probably has more to do with it being run on an smp machine and making use to different threads

if you want to use the merge-tracking of subversion 1.5 over more than one project at the same time you should use a single tree without externals
19672
i haven t done any proper benchmarks but i tried out several other components and found that spreadsheetgear was considerably faster than xlsio which i was using before
19692
using a new language in production code is about more than easy syntax and high-level capability
19814
this is for reasons similar to the reasons it s good to learn c like how a strcpy takes more time than copying an integer or why you should use pointers to arrays as function parameters instead of arrays by value
19908
worked fairly well just a little slower than i like
