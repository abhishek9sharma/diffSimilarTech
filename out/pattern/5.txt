usually from the business tier i can return a typed dataset or datatable which can be serialized for transport over asmx
53
which means that unreferenced memory will be freed up whenever the runtime feels like it typically not unless there s a reason to run since it s an expensive operation to execute
72
i want to format my existing comments as rdoc comments so they can be viewed using ri

73
in practical terms it means that the names used in external references will not be mangled like normal c++ names would
169
maybe it should be calculated on-the-fly or maybe you would like to use a different type for the backing store
170
this seems to have automated deployment capabilities from source control to production
175
the only requirement is that this should be done programmatically
234
can this easily be emulated in sql server 2005
265
should project level references be excluded from checkin
332
my philosophy would be to go ahead and make both structures accessible to the client in a polished way just under the assumption they would be used in tandem
555
they can be read from disk sniffed in network traffic lifted by a cross-site scripting attack phished from a poisoned dns so the client sends their cookies to the wrong servers
633
i have been unaware of the issues until now on using managed code to interface to mapi although the c++ code in the component should be unaffected by this error as it is unmanaged
650
i would like the version property of my application to be incremented for each build but i m not sure on how to enable this functionality in visual studio 2005 2008
695
that could be implemented through triggers or application code
717
i wrote a windows service using vb that read some legacy data from visual foxpro databases to be inserted in sql 2005
750
what i was thinking of can be achieved using list comprehensions but i thought that there was a function that did this in a slightly neater way

797
for anon users the dates could be displayed as utc or gmt or some such
885
to allow a function to modify its arguments they must be passed by reference
938
i found a discussion that indicated the text needed to be preceded with e as such
971
the player is even extremely skinnable and can be controlled with javascript
1069
on the downside source deltas can t be used to identify when the bug was introduced - there are a lot of code changes in the repository
1130
if that field is a non-key field doesn t contain unique entries then the entire table space must be searched at n block accesses
1130
whereas with a sorted field a binary search may be used this has log2 n block accesses
1171
yes i should have been a bit clearer on what i mean by efficiency
1248
jeff your code is nice but could be clearer with constants as suggested in code complete
1266
thus the object on the heap cannot easily be changed in c# without creating a new boxed copy of a new int value
1376
the application will only be deployed on windows machines
1462
not only are strings likely to double in length on translation the entire ui may need to be inverted hebrew
1528
i know about icustomtypedescriptor and icustompropertyprovider but i m pretty certain those can t be used in silverlight
1619
honestly these days any self respecting web host that supports python and mysql ought to have mysqldb pre installed
1773
for example none of those numbers nor likely any combination of them can be used to tell you exactly how many such processes can run at once in a given amount of free memory
1936
if i use the viewdata parameter my post parameters will be changed to get parameters
1993
i m sure i could use ruby to extend emacs if i wanted to but emacs was designed to be extended with lisp so it seems to make sense to use it in that situation
2036
a this file will be added to version control after commit
2036
a+ this file will be moved after commit
2036
d this file will be deleted after commit
2067
in some cases the model can also be used to turn a data source into a higher level abstraction as well
2099
the same can be done in nunit excpet the attribute names differ slighty
2328
so again i need a way for the page viewstate to be updated on callback after the ajax method is fired
2379
so when using icallbackeventhandler you have two obstacles to overcome to have updated state management for callbacks
2538
but you could have invented monads
2538
in fact faced with various problems in functional programming you would have been led inexorably to certain solutions all of which are examples of monads
2538
note that monads let you do more than handle side-effects in particular many types of container object can be viewed as monads
2554
a small pitfall is like in java that objects passed by value can still be changed using their inner methods
2554
but when needed parameters can also be passed by reference using the ref keyword
2560
other alternatives are quicktime windows media player or even silverlight microsoft s flash competitor which can be used to embed several video formats
2598
basically if your site still works with javascript turned off then anything you add with javascript can be considered progressive enhancement

group by forces the entire set to be populated before records are returned since it is an implicit sort
2723
any random project folder can be expected to find at least one folder name project old and one named project
2754
when the setter is called such a validation service should be utilized to sanitize input into the object
2804
this is great for the visual appearance of the application because you can size the window however you want and the image will always be displayed using its best fit
2867
there is an issue with this method in that you already have to have accepted the rsa finger-print
2901
you can however pass an applicationcontext instad of a new form to application.run method and applicationcontext can be used to launch several forms at once
2928
one way to solve this is load the configuration in _global.asax.cx.application_start_ if the configuration is invalid you will be notified of this with the means of an exception
2928
your site won t start and instead you will be presented detailed exception information in the yellow screen of death
2933
python works on multiple platforms and can be used for desktop and web applications thus i conclude that there is some way to compile it into an executable for mac windows and linux
2980
these can be run by any user running os x
3045
this piece of data one of the columns gets updated in spreadsheet a but needs to also be updated in spreadsheet b
3152
extension methods that relate to basic data types int string etc or generics that have a wider application could be packaged and distributed across projects
3290
you could add some ajax-y goodness that reads a hidden form filed value requests a verification key from the server and sends that back along with the response but that will never be populated if javascript is blocked disabled
3290
you could always implement a more traditional captcha type interface which could be disabled by javascript and ignored by the server if the scripted field if filled in.
3308
you could try it is more for gui testing rather than a data layer testing application but does record your actions which then can be played back to automate tests across different platforms
3318
the collect method which can be applied to any enumerable object
3388
this can be configured to fill your database with sensible looking test data
3511
according to bodmas multiplication should always be done before addition therefore 17 is actually the correct answer according to bodmas and will also be the answer which your calculator will give if you type in 2 + 3 x 5
3610
when you view the log right click root of project tortoisesvn show log you can see the bug id that each checking corresponds to 1 and you can click the bug id number to be taken to fogbugz to view that bug automatically if you are looking at the actual log message
3776
that way each of these forms can be laid out in its own designer instantiated one or more times at runtime and added to the empty area like a normal control
3776
once they are added they could be flipped through using hide show or bringtofront sendtoback methods
3824
if server software like iis and apache couldn t run requests in parallel it would mean that every page request would have to be dished out in a queue fashion...likely making load times unbearably slow
3913
you can get an idea of how many rows are going to be scanned and what indexes are going to be used with explain syntax
3929
the blobs can be accessed using either a database connection or over the filesystem

i personally though it could be called overkill use a free single user license version of source gear fortress which is their vault source control product with bug tracking features
4171
worked awesome for me and have heard nothing but goodness about it
4234
so my company stores alot of data in a foxpro database and trying to get around the performance hit of touching it directly i was thinking of messaging anything that can be done asynchronously for a snappier user experience
4270
your ruby 1.9 example can be shortened a bit further
4384
here long would be printed haven t checked it myself because the compiler choses widening over autoboxing
4403
the appropriate --defaults-file setting can be found using the services manager
4420
leave password blank nothing after the colon you will be prompted when launching it
4597
you could also use managed c++ to write .net gui applications but i ve read in a few places that managed c++ wasn t really intended to be used in this manner
4614
the first parameter of the method needs to be prefixed with this in the signature
4639
.net versions can be installed side-by-side so it won t disrupt any legacy apps
4646
unfortunately the statement .net versions can be installed side-by-side so it won t disrupt any legacy apps isn t entirely true
4678
md5sum should be installed by default on most unix type machines and wikipedia s md5sum article has links to some windows implementations
4725
also i want to add even if you find places where lisp will make sense you will probably not convince anyone else that it should be used over java c++ c# python ruby etc
4922
here long would be printed haven t checked it myself because the compiler choses widening over autoboxing
5224
your httpservletrequest object has a getparameter string paramname method that can be used to get parameter values
5278
andalso operator makes sure that only if the left side was true the right side will be evaluated very important since ifx is nothing x.go will crash
5278
y must be initialized in order for y.dodance to be able to execute
5292
when using the operator both expressions will be evaluated every time regardless if one or both evaluate to false
5329
in our current system however we only have a single type of change request and just use a field to indicate whether it is a bug requirement change etc this field can be used to build report queries
5332
btw i think everyone agrees that tables should be used for tabular data
5337
a change request needs to go through a cycle in which the impact and effort has to be estimated for that change and then it has to be approved for implementation before work on it can begin
5340
it generates an xml file which can then be used to build the gui in a number of different languages
5352
environmental differences can be handled by having different versions of the relevant files in the trunk
5374
i would have thought this would be an easy one to google but i ve been unsucessful
5403
i agree that in this case wether it is to be considered a design flaw or a implementation flaw depends on the actual reason for why it fails to live up to expectations
5494
external incoming requests will be using the host header portal.mycompany.com and be forced to use ssl
5607
with identity page fill factor is pretty useless as a tuning mechanism and might as well be set to 100 - rows will never be inserted in any page but the last one
5719
as others have mentioned lists and tuples are both containers which can be used to store python objects
5754
in contrast to the real world memory allocation cannot be told where to allocate but will find a suitable spot with enough room and report back the address to the allocated memory
5831
basically compare two files designated old and new and produce a patch file that can be used to upgrade the old file to have the same contents as the new file
5831
the most naive algorithm i have made which only works for files that can be kept in memory is as follows
5963
pk generation can be decentralized each client generates it s own pk without risk of collision

i see the command msinfo32.exe can be used to dump a whole load of system version information which we might as well archive
6104
nodes represents objects to be rendered transformations controls groups .
6120
set a threshold score such that any matchscore threshold will not be considered a match for a given companyname
6144
if you now make copies of your changed files do a fresh checkout then subversion will lose track of how your changes should be merged back in
6452
in fact depending on how your executables are built you might be forced to install the framework and the service packs
6567
if you were to iterate the first reference you would get a class cast exception because once you hit the foo instance the foo could not be converted to string
6598
also if you re writing a library or something that might be reused using the gc mode locks anyone using the code into also using the gc mode so as i understand it anyone trying to write widely reusable code tends to go for managing memory manually
6612
i should have made it clear in my original question that i was looking specifically to plot real-time data
6658
what i would like to see in new tests though is flexibility in the way the test can be written natural assertions grouping and easily distributed test executions
6671
a suggestion from their documentation is to mark some subset as checkin tests which should be run whenever you check new files in
6679
furthermore the platform dependence regarding the separator character can be gotten around using file.separator file.separatorchar or system.getproperty file.separator
6686
nearly all of them can be used on any html element except for one or two
6899
i know that this can be done using server side cursors ie

if so - perhaps this can be exploited to implement a singleton mutex - which can in turn be used to guard the creation of the real singleton..
6955
objects of pod types 3.9 with static storage duration initialized with constant expressions 5.19 shall be initialized before any dynamic initialization takes place
7043
the wish interpreter should be installed by default on ubuntu
7077
it appears that the guidance in this area may have changed as stylecop now enforces the use of the c# specific aliases
7147
openvpn can of course be run on linux although i can t really offer any experience in doing so
7274
it is in java but could easily be adapted to any language
7303
this was available in vs 2005 with moss extensions but has to be run off windows server with a full moss installation and the correct permissions set
7327
i am not sure why would you say that unit tests are going be removed once refactoring is completed
7482
it hammered some points in that i should consider and it might have swayed my views a bit
7487
it makes a lot of crap that needs to be filtered out
7547
this can be done via sql enterprise manager or like this
7679
however it should also be pointed out that geotools is a large library so if you re looking something small quick and easy it s likely not the way to go
7681
could be used to seek for a known byte sequence representing the desired character representation in utf-8.
7729
the entire file must be transferred before playback can begin
7790
to clarify - this book is geared toward eclipse 3.1 and since i haven t done any rcp development of my own i m not sure how much things have changed

7957
standby allows a database to be brought up for read-only access between transaction log restores and can be used with either warm standby server situations or special recovery situations in which it is useful to inspect the database between log restores
7978
i m a not-designer as well and don t have much artistic sense and honestly cannot be bothered spending days weeks creating a ui for an application
7990
the output could be called a report i suppose but a reporting engine is not necessary
8034
recovery with standby is the ability to restore the database up to a parital date like norecovery above but to allow the database still to be used readonly
8081
basically what you get is a bunch of standard query operators that can be applied to any ienumerable of type t
8142
i just read up on a performance of linq and there is a huge amount to be gained by using compiled linq
8196
otherwise python ships with headers that can be used in c and does a fairly good job documenting the c python api
8353
yes it can definately be done using either merge replication or sync services

8451
cannot be paged to disk
8468
it doesn t have to be curried but writing another function assuming this function is being used in other instances with other variables would be a waste
8476
once the data is in your program it is liable to be paged out
8480
the flags attribute should be used whenever the enumerable represents a collection of flags rather than a single value
8637
the downside to this method is that it requires javascript and if you don t have javascript enabled your comment will be marked as spam however i do review comments marked as spam so this is not a problem
8654
given that you know the accuracy of your measurements you could have the 0.000 text be rendered in less than a thousandth of a second
8740
wouldn t it be simpler to use the built-in php ftp functionality than trying to roll your own

tables in an attached database can be referred to using the syntax database-name.table-name
8865
however this approach is not suitable in cases where the execution time of the tick code is not acceptable error in the timing of the tick since the timer will be disabled not counting during that time
8896
i m happy to be corrected on any of this but to answer your question - yes i have tried
8896
i think it would need educated intervention rather than my unsanitised experimental approach before i could be confident
8940
although the second nic won t be used by linux it is certainly recognised as a nic eth1
8941
could this be done in .net 3.x using extension methods
8987
scalar-valued functions can be called from .net as follows
9013
whole .net programs can be prototyped in ps as well as little oneliners to test functionality of methods...etc
9013
i agree with some of the posters above i consider anything done to setup build envrionments or work with data for dev tasks can be done with ps if not faster easier better but just as well
9049
regions must never be used inside methods
9049
they may be used to group methods but this must be handled with extreme caution so that the reader of the code does not go insane
9074
it seems you re going to be stuck rolling your own
9094
if you essentially talking about a large text field which could be stored as file my preference would be for db storage
9104
i could have sworn that this was possible years ago but i can t find anything that tells me either way now
9144
honestly i doubt that you ve got a lot of incoming developers who suck with c++ but would be awesome with python anyway
9279
i know the same thing can theoretically be accomplished using changedfiles or rsync but i ve always found the tutorials for both tools to be lacking and or contradictory
9372
this problem was however supposed to have been fixed in service pack 1 for vista
9413
the following function print is an example of a function which could be passed to func as a parameter because it is the proper type
9488
it can be achieved by using code snippets some are already built in try typing svm and hitting tab-tab
9537
i would have thought adding versions onto 2.0 would have made more sense altho i suppose it also is hard to get people to get their head around the fact that there are different versions of runtimes compilers and languages

to optimize storage space only document diffs should be kept just like source control software
9687
any field can be searched at anytime and in combination with one or more other fields
9751
but im afraid that if there are too many emails sent they will be marked as spam
9846
but i was also thinking since i was using mvp that i could also do the computationally expensive stuff in native c c++ code while the gui would be done with .net forms or qt or whatever
9859
speaking about the pessimistic model the left client connected for n days scenario could be avoided by setting lock expire date to say one day before lock start date
9950
as a starting point i d be tempted to add tracing log messages at strategic points within your application
9963
i have also learned that indexes need to be treated just like code files and put into source control
10020
notice that the tables of the database opened with open are available using main.tablename any attached database can be given any name at all otherdb in the example above
10103
edit as thomas danecker points out even though the access of the field is atomic s_initialized should really be marked volatile to make sure that the locking isn t broken by the processor reordering the reads and writes
10157
i would also be tempted to put a cancel button on the progress dialog and add a timeout otherwise if the update gets stuck or takes too long then your application will have locked up forever
10280
i guess you could always push the amount of threads available in the pool up but there would be little point in incurring the management costs of a thread that is never going to be given back to the pool
10286
any time you can easily partition processing into smaller jobs each of which can be processed independently worker threads and therefore a thread pool make sense
10286
thread pools do not make sense when you need thread which perform entirely dissimilar and unrelated actions which cannot be considered jobs
10348
given the list of mutexes that are held and a rough idea of the state that they protect assign a locking order mutex a should always be taken before mutex b
10478
i ve found a lot of stuff on google that seems to be focused on writing wysiwyg editors but that isn t what i want and most of it worked in ie but not in ff2 or 3
10600
so the answer should probably be presented in tiers for the size of the application but i m wondering about people s experience with choosing where the disk drives used by the database should reside
10760
integration testing might be performed by utilities such as cruise control
10830
if the column_datetime field is not indexed and is unlikely to be or the index is unlikely to be used then using datediff is shorter
10901
our codebase contains alot of legacy archaic code which must be kept operational
10949
do you write or rewrite once you discover the need for the clone all your unit tests for the class so that they can be invoked with either a virgin object or with a clone of it
10993
the paymentplan to the customer would be mapped using a bag which uses the details table to establish which customer id s mapped to which paymentplans
11002
i should have made that point in my original post - sorry
11064
there s also a practical limit on how long a sql string can be executed - aliases make this limit easier to avoid
11069
do you write or rewrite once you discover the need for the clone all your unit tests for the class so that they can be invoked with either a virgin object or with a clone of it

the database will be clustered with shared fiber channel storage
11251
xmlhttp should only be used client side because it uses wininet which is not supported for use in server service apps
11333
gpl is clearly one of the most popular open source licenses out there and also one of the few that on the face of it can t be applied to asp.net mvc applications
11359
it seems like windows performance logs and alerts might be used for this purpose somehow but it was not immediately obvious to me

since we are looking at doing our wiki in sp i need to know why we shouldn t do it for a group of 6 automation-developers to document the steps in various automated processes and the changes that have to be made from time to time
11532
are there features or apis built into php that will allow me to analyse my codebase - for example reflection token_get_all
11562
thus efficiency can be gained by overloading std swap with a custom type specific implementation
11617
and of course if you are using a modern language you ll probably be forced to use them for some things because they re baked into the standard libraries
11720
so a new virtual machine would be created from a template is fine with the os installed and some base software installed --- a new web site would be created in iis and the web app build output copied to a location on the virtual machine hard disk and iis configured correctly the vm would start up and run
11738
being able to have enum types have values other than int the default
11783
since i m sure it ll be asked the reason for the empty method is a preprocessor directive

if this format is correct the bytes must first be converted to utf-8 characters
11842
the pid can be found either in the task manager view- select columns... or visual studio s attach to process
11854
for example several objects have a damage counter but to make this easy to use in an object list polymorphism could be used - except that would imply an is a relationship which wouldn t be true
11884
if the object can be serialised to xml and can be described in wsdl then yes it is possible to return objects from a webservice

the data should stay cached until iis recycles your application pool
11907
this may be considered syntax but vb.net is case in sensitive while c# is case sensitive
11935
this can be accomplished using multiple inheritance
12046
it seems to be to be wasted effort to include that in your test if you don t actually need to
12185
it s a repository for singletons that can be exchanged for testing purposes
12229
as for the actual question i d say xml is probably ok as plenty of people will be used to using that for configuration
12243
in case it helps most of this functionality will be revealed via web services and we re a microsoft shop with all the latest gizmos and gadgets
12293
you end up doing some unintuitive tricks to optimize the queries that leave you wondering if it would have been more time effective to write the query by hand in the first place
12331
from my understanding subsonic and asp.net mvc can be redistributed for either an open-source or commercial license and you should be fine just as long as you don t use some sort of viral gpl license that needs to gpl everything
12349
although the error message said the specified module could not be found this is a little misleading -- it s not that it couldn t find php_curl.dll but rather it couldn t find a module that php_curl.dll required
12384
like stu said the go statement is client directive not a sql keyword and only seems to be respected by isql wsql osql etc clients and the sql agent
12505
additionally users should be shown the manuals prior to release and asked to preform tasks based upon the documentation to ensure that it is clear enough
12557
lastly lists are not hashable so the type of mapping done with dictionaries hash tables in perl associative arrays in php must be done with tuples
12638
so basically i m building an app for my company and it needs to be built using ms access and it needs to be built on sql server

it seems like everyone is trying to find the java way to do it like you re doing it in php instead of the way it ought to be done in java
12925
closures can be used for any number of reasons one of which is to reduce the sope of helper functions or values
12956
these images can be made clickable too to allow drill down from the screen shot
12961
it s also worth noting that starting with jdk 1.6 update 7 there is now a bundled profiler called visualvm which can be launched with jvisualvm
12995
it can generate documentation in html postscript pdf and man pages so you don t need to be stuck with sandcastle help files
13070
ref the parameter with the ref keyword will be passed by reference
13089
dates can be converted to http valid dates rfc 1123 by using the r format string in .net
13089
http dates need to be gmt not offset - this can be done using the touniversaltime method

the function will be called with each member in the array passed as its own argument
13100
any changes to the value of an out or ref parameter will be passed back to the caller

back to my first cs 101 i started with notions of what an algorithm was by building a tequila sunrise a step by step process that could be repeated at any time with the right ingredients that will result in the same output from there we move on to basic math functions using scheme like ehaskins was saying.
13195
i think your best bet is to write the best mime handler you can parse a message throw away everything that s not text plain or text html and then force the command in the incoming string to be prefixed with command or something similar so that you can find it in the muck
13224
i ve included a mobile web form in my asp.net project i thought that it could should be seen just for my mobile users but i realize that it can also be seen from any browser i don t see problem there cause i could diff the access using httpbrowsercapabilities.ismobiledevice true and transferring to the appropiate aspx page but it results that when i access to the web form from my mobile device it is identified as ismobiledevice false and sends me to another page

scripts are created to migrate all customer data to a new database if needed and then only that customer s connection string needs to be updated to point to the new location
13409
for those who haven t read the book slack is what google s 20 time is you re given some slice of your day week month year on which to work on things that are not necessarily directly related to your day-to-day job but might have an indirect benefit obviously if you work on stuff that s totally not useful for your job or your company your manager probably won t think very well of the way you spent the time -p
13412
20 of the day should be used for private projects and research
13423
my hope is that someone familiar with webobjects might have done this already and have some insight that would save me some time
13470
would the expression be changed in any way if the were removed
13521
it uses webdav to communicate with http servers and can be configured to connect to private servers
13537
i was wondering how this could be accomplished and looked around a bit and saw someone say that it could only be done by either
13541
it s like having the cake and eating it too the speed factor is there since when using the enter key no unnecessary tabing must be done to get to the correct field and using the enter key next to the numeric keyboard makes it really smooth
13582
for example there was a recursive function call the developer had created in the cake project which instantiated the entire cake object every recursion and this would have taken out the server had it gone live under load
13607
i missed two important points first this will be used cross platform including homebrew on a sony psp
13746
if the future really will be written in labview c++ programmer won t have much trouble crossing over
13757
without such control you have to rely on the server to provide a listing which 1 may be disabled for security reasons 2 is non-standardized in its format 3 will be like lubos said fragile to parse scrape
13806
i have successfully hooked createfile with the detours library from msr but createfile never seems to be called with file i am interested in snooping on
13817
its still slow compared to debugging with eclipse pdt with xdebug
13832
does anybody have vb nant tips
13844
well i think you might have missed the r or miscounted the backslashes.
13941
i know that there s a function that can be used in cocoa apps nsbeep but i don t think that has much anything to do with this
14034
i don t do any dts type work or anything like that so there might be some use cases for using trigger there but if anyone in any of my teams says that they might want to use a trigger they better have prepared their arguments well because i refuse to stand by and let triggers be added to any database i m working on
14039
i think they re fine for house cleaning tasks like populating audit data created by modified date etc and in some databases can be used for referential integrity
14051
i used a trigger as a temporary fix to add an extra dummy byte a space to the end of the data solving our problem until a proper solution could be rolled out
14053
it s arguable how much test duty should be carried out by the dev in the third example but i argue that it s most efficient for the dev because all of the related minutiae from many layers of documentation and code are already in her short-term memory
14058
databases expose themselves via tables and keeping tables and rows consistent can be done with triggers
14065
if these two steps cannot be done try using a weakreference they are usually perfect for these situations but they come with overhead
14135
a script can be called to move the files into production
14147
an interesting article shows how this might be done and this shows how hook scripts can be used with subversion
14181
for example a unit test might have guybrush threepwood move toward a door pathfinding open the door use command fail because he doesn t have a key in his inventory feedback pick the door key pathfinding + inventory management and then finally opening the door
14232
this can be used to generated stubs to execute from php and you can then go about rewriting the .net code into php in an incremental fashion
14259
fit for example uses html tables that can be written in word
14261
don t be afraid of mxml
14265
visual c++ express edition will need to be configured to build for windows platform
14273
inheritance should only be used for polymorphism when it makes sense from a modelling point of view
14312
an own appdomain can also be used to filter assemblies and types that you don t want to load

i want to set tab stops for my indents and lining up function signatures and rows of assignment statements which could be specified in points instead of fixed character positions
14515
we use nunitlite although i think we did have had to add some code to it in order for it to work
14549
linq can of course be used to call stored procedures
14577
the stored procedure builds up a result set in a #temporary table which is all ready to be returned except that one of columns isn t terribly human readable it s an alphanumeric code
14656
i am considering all get requests that we wish to be cachable be requested over http with the body encrypted using asymmetric encryption where each client has the decryption key
14656
anytime we wish to perform a get that is not cachable or a post operation it will be performed over ssl
14908
the engine is usually very open and there are a lot of algorithmic tweaking to be done that can dramatically affect performance
15082
remember though that any public-facing method property or field can be accessed via reflection or in a derived type in a seperate assembly
15091
java and .net programmers are pretty much a commodity now so can be offered for less cost
15119
for an idea what might be involved take a look at this tutorial from adobe for photoshop
15139
edit yes gears and cookies can be used for local storage but you can t easily get access to files and other objects the user already has around
15171
i m thinking specifically python scripts to be called by cron
15277
particularly seeing as the sprocs probably aren t in source control and therefore can t be accessed via web-based scm browsers and so on
15323
that said i am sure there are many smarter people out there than me that may have tried this with greater success
15372
if you require the size for other calculations where the number of elements may not be known you can use sizeof a 1 and multiply by your required element count
15388
so there might be a reason why a new codec would be installed in windows without .net inherently knowing about it
15412
now don t get me wrong - i believe srp to be the key to most good oo designs but i feel there are cases where this principle can and should be broken just like database normalization rules
15457
in my opinion it is not so important to follow specified standards when you make these drawings that just complicates things and results in fewer figures being made
15600
you might get back a response which could clearly be shown to contain every row in one or more tables which is probably not what they want
15712
there were some excellent suggestions already but i just wanted to mention that perl can also be called can call to c c++

this will force the project to be rebuilt if any of the others change and you won t have to mess with any other pre post-build events
15798
how can that be done in python
15810
they ll still be there show all files in solution explorer but they won t be included when building the project

a much bigger performance improvement can be achieved by using better algorithms for example keeping the list sorted and doing a binary search
15904
a simple linked list can be used for this

for this particular use case a fitting library i imagine allowing users to define mathematical functions guassian lorentzian etc. as python functions which can then to be passed an interpreted by the compiled code fitting library
16248
i d like to implement a way of recording the version of a project within code so that it can be used when testing and to help track bugs
16320
i ve seen projects where the classes in the db layer have just static functions in them and other projects where those classes need to be instantiated to get access to the member functions
16324
the webserver at hostone.com can be configured to redirect easy in apache not sure about iis etc
16369
it should have modify permissions and these may need to be reapplied if you are overwriting files
16463
formatting is easier to optimize for the compiler although the second will probably be refactored to use the concat method which is fast
16463
however this could be amended in future versions
16504
it can be applied in-line like this evaluates to 50
16514
lambda functions should not be confused with anonymous methods
16514
anonymous methods can t be read and so the logic can t be translated out as it can for lambda functions
16515
i started with labview about 2 years ago and now use it all the time so may be biased but find it ideal for applications where data acquisition and control are involved
16568
it would also be interesting to see how this can be achieved using the native functionality of the following databases
16643
however his can easily be stripped away using the trim command in php
16662
both are licensed as gpl+exceptions to state explicitly that applications which merely use the openjdk libraries will not be considered derived works
16680
the interesting thing with c# s lambda syntax though is that on their own their type cannot be infered you can t type var foo x y x y but depending on which type they re assigned to they ll be compiled as delegates or abstract syntax trees representing the expression which is how linq object mappers do their language-integrated magic
16727
how can this be coded in gwt
16746
thus when debugging you can get the debugging feed when you want to see completed transactions you go to the transactions feeds etc
16758
i also have been following the thoughts of stephen walther on mvc and i think this post is great to repopulate the fields with the data submitted for it to be changed before submitting it again
16816
to be honest in java there is not really an argument against overriding equals
16825
this could be implemented in c# as a treenode base class with a derived leaf class and a derived treenodewithchildren class and if you want even a derived emptynode class
16853
sample usage can be found on this blog post

iis6 compression - most likely you need to specify file types to be compressed like .jpg .png .gif types etc
17120
before leveraging cruisecontrol to it s fullest extent you need to create an automated build script that can be run by msbuild or nant
17204
this can be done either by having your assert handler support a callback mechanism or your test asserts contain a try catch block
17263
i really am interested in why people believe shell scripts should be avoided in mission-critical applications but i can t think of a compelling reason
17292
the brand really depends on the platform most likely php rails asp but most of them can be found by typing cms into google
17313

the one propertygroup is where all the configuration happens and things can be customized like excluding certain projects from the build or adding new test assembly masks
17365
command line options for mutt can be shown with mutt -h
17389
cc can simply be replaced by bcc if you wish to send blind carbon copies
17389
similarly symbols such as signs will need to be written in hex code
17417
this can be resolved by using a more advanced integrator such as verlet
17505
encapsulation would only be broken if this could be caused from outside the class if your would proclaim i m a friend of class foo .

also be sure to store or be able to calculate the mimetype for each file so it can be served correctly back to the browser with the correct http headers
17732
there s a discussion going on over at comp.lang.c++.moderated about whether or not assertions which in c++ only exist in debug builds by default should be kept in production code or not
17732
an assertion is error pure and simple and therefore should be handled like one
17732
since an error should be handled in release mode then you don t really need assertions
17737
but in this context it should be pointed out that linux is not completely posix compliant

for example the idea of a customer may consist of a main record in a customer table combined with all of the orders the customer has placed as well as all the customer s employees and their contact information and some of the properties of a customer and its children may be determined from lookup tables
18941
the current compatibility still has much to be desired but this should eventually become usable in all browsers
19042
without using diagrams we would have had to take the time to go one by one through the students code files looking for problems
19096
this needs to be ported to .net
19138
expressions can be evaluated to get a value whereas statements don t return a value they re of type void
19138
function call expressions can also be considered statements of course but unless the execution environment has a special built-in variable to hold the returned value there is no way to retrieve it
19150
thus expressions can be used in statements but not the other way around
19152
yield can be used to replace a normal return in a function
19152
they may be used in place of a list comprehension to save memory list comprehensions create a list in memory that is destroyed after use if not assigned to a variable but generator expressions can create a generator object.
19224
this blurring of expressions and statements occurs in all the c-derivatives c c++ c# and java which still have some statements like while but which allow almost any expression to be used as a statement in c# only assignment call increment and decrement expressions may be used as statements
19302
i was under the impression that events should always be fired from virtual onxxx methods that take an eventargs parameter
19393
you can use the deprecated carbon apis with other languages like java but new applications for osx really should be developed in objective-c
19396
yes recycling every few hours would help hide the problem but they ought to be debugged and fixed properly .

edit as others have mentioned the same thing can be accomplished using reflection which might actually be closer to what you would like to be the case - for example the above method replies on the concrete classes being inside the same file as the abstract class which probably isn t very convenient

it can be assumed that leaf nodes will stay as leaf nodes interior nodes will stay as interior nodes and the whole thing will remain as a proper tree

attributes can also be used in aspect oriented programming to inject manipulate objects at run time based on the attributes that decorate them and add validation logging etc
20670
your code was fine except for the base 64 encoding bit which you mentioned was a test the reason the output may not have made sense is that you were displaying a raw byte array doing tostring on a byte array returns its internal java reference not the string representation of the contents

as an example on a gaming web site i worked on recently there was a summary display of some stats about recent games this was all based on dirty reads it was more important for us to include then exclude the transactional data not yet committed we knew anyway that few if any transactions would be backed out we felt that on average the data would be more accurate that way
20890
values in the data can be changed and rows can appear or disappear in the data set before the end of the transaction
21008
i have had to maintain code that was refactored down to one and two line methods with seemingly meaningful names but the reality was there should have been comments to give the bigger picture of what was going on and how the methods related to other things that were going on

fortunately i spotted it but it could have resulted in serious problems especially since the very uncommon corner case that it was supposed to catch turned out to be a lot more common than i anticipated
22003
whenever iboutlet is used in program text it will be replaced with nothing at all
22026
then in the event handler method you can load the assembly that was attempted to be resolved using one of the assembly.load assembly.loadfrom overrides and return it from the method
22026
what it gives you is that the location of each and every assembly that the clr fails to resolve can be determined and loaded by your code at runtime.

i think the same pattern can be used for sequential operations sequential commands
22216
you want to start extracting your data access code so that it can be replaced with orm functionality without disturbing too much
22266
this technique can probably also be adapted to .net by making scopeguard implement idisposable and sprinkling using statements as needed
22298
it seems to be inspired by hibernate
22407
fortunately arrays are quite flexible and can be used as hash tables as well
22418
finally you can kind of emulate a binary tree with an array with the potential to have wasted space

there are lots of gotchas that have to be taken into account
22535
they can be used to add tables add columns migrate data from an old to a new column format then drop the column insert master data rows such as user types etc

should senior developers be exempt from unit testing - or should they be allowed to use lackeys to implement them
23714
i would argue that from a tdd purist standpoint one that thinks that unit tests should be written before implementation senior developers should be writing more unit tests than lackeys not less

boost is another library which has a lot of features that can be recognized as derived from functional programming
25008
also due to lsp liskov substitution principle one can use derived class where base class is expected and this is actually imposes the greatest impact from use of inheritance code using base class may be given an inherited class and it still has to work as expected

how might i write an even worse big-o sort without just adding extraneous junk that could be pulled out to reduce the time complexity
25592
without testing it myself i would see this as strong evidence that all non-ascii characters in source code will likely be considered lowercase
25606
also a sample mvc controller method can be found here which basically uses the jsonresult action type like
25656
and truth to be told it s kind of fun and not all that difficult once you get the hang of it

in the no-cost category newer versions of gzip and bzip2 are supposed to include large file support someone on the internet tells me that bzip2 1.0.1 and beyond is large file compatible thanks to cyril pilsko while gzip 1.2 can be patched which the dowloadable binaries are and the gzip 1.3 beta includes support
26485
it s absolutely foolish to not design by contract when doing anything in an soa realm and it s always helpful if you re working on any sort of modular work where bits pieces might be swapped out later on especially if any black boxen are involved

the trace macro can be used to output diagnostic messages to the debugger when the code is compiled in debug mode
27628
so using the out-the-box trace from mfc you won t actually be able to read any trace text because it won t even be written out
27638
additionally the aforementioned parsing process can be extended through reader macros that let you customize the way your compiler turns text into s-exps

this can be used to submit data to post s
28411
as an array the data will be sent as multipart form-data which is not always accepted by the server
28448
note that ant properties cannot be changed once set so you override a value by defining a new value before the default value
28464
even though that really isn t a huge problem when you re using a dependency injection framework it still feels that there are certain properties that really don t need to be interfaced out just for the sake of interfacing them
28467
as for using arrays with boost i personally haven t done this but i know the functionality to expose arrays to python using boost is available - this might be helpful

was the original url in the post but should not be used for .net 2.0 and above
32346
on a large project we can have devs writing tests that fail based on issues reported by users
32376
ideally this library supports the b-tree index to be stored manipulated as a disk file so that large trees can be built using a configurable ie minimal ram footprint
32390
then again if it can be tied to javascript you might as well hash the password on the client-side before sending a request to the server
32404
i won t necessarily have to implement this part but i need a rough idea how it would be done in order to decide whether to design along these lines
32440
i do it using the pythoncom libraries that come included with activepython or can be installed with pywin32 python for windows extensions
32536
you should however be familiarized with user interface design specially with ease of use and terms as goal oriented design
32666
that can be added with editor macros or a code-processing script
32666
edit the verbose check could be added this way as well but i think it s significantly easier to automate the addition of a single line
32851
the libraries will be written in c#
32898
the error would have happened when sqlite3 was require d before the migration finished so it looks like they ve fixed the issue
33000
ianal but it seems some corrolations can be drawn to having your car stolen and someone commits a crime with it
33000
you will be investigated and can be determined innocent if you have some alibi or logs showing your machines were not responsible for that traffic
33023
regions and code folding is really all about providing a way to easily group sections of code that can be collapsed folded hidden to minimize the amount of extraneous noise around what you are currently working on
33077
tuneup is a free service whereby you download a plugin and when you run your application it injects a panel at the top of the screen that can be expanded to display detailed performance metrics
33107
in fact this cheaty approach to be extended to borrowing colour schemes from applications that are already out there that have colours schemes you admire -
33172
ienumerable is great because it can then be processed by linq operators
33172
note that the file is read character by character with the code deciding when newlines are to be treated as row delimiters or part of a quoted string
33256
ps - this question should be tagged as objective-c not c since nsenumerator is a cocoa class and the new for .
33265
if i understand this right these operators can be used in types which i want to use instead of a boolean expression and where i don t want to provide an implicit conversion to bool
33405
you pretty much need to keep the same data context available throughout the lifetime of the operations you want to perform if you re ever going to be storing changes which are to be .submitchanges d later as otherwise you will lose those changes
33434
killing and restarting your nis server can have funky effects on particularly non-linux clients so be careful doing it willy-nilly
33452
you have a seperate gui system which will be passed these parameters in a generic fashion but the catch is that it needs to present the gui component specific to the concrete type of the parameter class
33456
for session cookies it doesn t seem to be supported in tomcat yet
33456
a somewhat involved work-around for now can be found here which basically boils down to manually patching tomcat
33566
slightly off-topic but one feature of findbugs that i think is very useful is to be able to annotate the parameters of methods to describe which parameters should not be passed a null value
33566
the annotation describes your intention for how the method should be called aiding documentation
33570
some reports that i ve been working on that used to take two hours simply to export have been cut down to under a minute
33578
this kind of session tracking is very likely to be done using a combination of a cookie with a unique id identifying your current session and the website pairing that id with the last ip address you used to connect to their server
33598
you may be surprised - mono does have a system.data.sqlclient namespace so you may not have much work to do
33603
thus you could have a resizemypage function defined somewhere in the javascript and it would be run whenever the browser is resized
33611
one of the typical concerns is i m writing this awesome library which is supposed to be used like so
33656
you have two choices embedding values into a table allows versioning multiple items that can be queried or having an explictly named object such as a table or somesuch you can test for
33681
their scope can be limited in cmd scripts with setlocal and endlocal
33689
you d then be tied to firefox though
33729
in other words code that was compiled on java 5 can still be deployed to java 1.4
33743
instead clone the templates you want to have customized variants of
33746
the other team said that this was not industry standard and that attributes should only be used for meta data
33746
i searched for the mysterious industry standard that was mentioned but the closest i could find was the xml attributes should only be used for meta data but said the debate was about what was actually meta data
33755
it is arguable either way but your colleagues are right in the sense that the xml should be used for markup or meta-data around the actual data
33757
i would have done something like
33928
basically tail recursions are able to be optimized into iteration
33948
edit emmett - the width could just as easily be applied via css
33960
how can this be done in java
33973
in the vein of programming questions suppose there s a collection of objects that can be compared to each other and sorted
34008
for internal code ie code that won t be referenced in any interop manor with other languages i vote for using unsigned when the situation warrants it such as length variables as mentioned earlier
34023
i think that i should have been more clear with my original question
34035
an introduction about how to use it against an informix database can be found in this article
34090
unless you really want to understand the algorithms by writing your own you d be advised to use libgmp under c
34177
while i hate to give an answer i m not 100 certain of the lack of responses so far makes me think a potentially correct answer might be okay in this case
34195
in particular if you want the extra text to be ignored you can use overflow hidden as a css property on the text
34287
the other possibility is that the project is open and running in debug mode on another instance of visual studio - although i suspect you will allready have ensured this is not the case
34294
other developers must have come across this before in delphi
34322
i know that webtests can only be recorded using the tester edition of vs
34415
there are some good documents to be found regarding this for example here
34418
what services must be started before this one what user it runs as
34506
i know this example is trivial but if i have a vector of complex data that is going to be always the same for all derived class but is needed to be accessed from base class methods
34509
all their input is parametrised and the like but i can t change the format - if they put in rec2 and rec10 they expect them to be returned just like that and in natural order
34538
your function here can only be used to replace one element with the response from the ajax call
34566
in other words the default implementation of object.gethashcode is going to be based on reference equality since there are no real instance fields to use and therefore does not guarantee unique return values for different objects
34578
adding particularly long sleeps can also be used for debugging to try and force a particular order of events
34578
the sleeps should be removed after debugging
34638
for column based security we could perhaps have secured to either assist in query generation or perhaps use an aspect to filter the information returned
34645
hard limits mark the maximum value which cannot be exceeded by setting a soft limit
34681
there are very clever attacks that can be performed by forcing collisions in a hash
34716
you probably need to think about how you re going to handle any thread safety issues and it might be overkill for this particular application but it might work for you
34780
this approach is pretty brute force but it is simple and can probably be duplicated in any imperative language
34855
however if you re against this for some reason you could also write a function to create date pickers for all text boxes in your template div to be called after each duplication
34896
i am leaning more towards the first method because any data that came from user input must still be approached cautiously where the cleaned data might still unknowingly or accidentally be dangerous
34924
i haven t done any high-tech audio stuff using flash so i was wondering if anyone knew if it was possible to do
34926
has to be done with inline vb.net
34990
it has the capability to specify operations which can be recombined into roles or assigned directly to users
35008
if all servers in your cluster will host a replica the home directory in iis can be configured to go against the local drive d
35012
thanx to daniel but i needed it to be done inline .

35110
since dbsprockets is likely to be incorporated into turbogears it will likely be maintained
35136
i use this quite a bit - be forewarned this implementation is a bit naive there are some potential problems with it depending on what you are serializing and how you use it on the client particularly with datetimes

for the few cases where we really needed unique constraints we made sure we used replace instead of insert mysql proxy can be used to guard for proper usage .
35449
this step can be used to show how a simple data structure or array can represent the game board simple input to get user commands moves simple output to display the game board and prompts etc

i know design patterns in a software context usually refer to oo based design patterns but i mean design patterns in the broader sense of the term common clean solutions to common problems tasks
35672
you ll also find that common ides either come with subversion support or have plugins which can be installed which allow most version control operations to be performed within that environment
35688
example code for this can be found via any search engine or via google code search
35690
qa should be done on each branch before it is merged to the trunk
35722
can this be done with c and shell scripting
35776
there s far less idioms required to be involved in writing good python code than in writing good c++.
35798
what techniques can be applied to detect polymorphic and metamorphic viruses
35803
of course these detection techniques are also known to virus creators and can easily be bypassed using a bunch of random unharmfull code executions before the actual payload
35807
i d imagine a generic xslt for xsd- sql once written could be applied to any such scenario and would be cross-platform too
35876
someone should be assigned to aggregate user comments and reports and discern which are actual bugs and which are duplicates and which give some sort of clue on how to replicate them
35880
the child container the nav list in your case should be positioned absolute and forced to occupy the whole space with top 0
35887
for the users it s probably more about how you ask the questions and letting them know that you require certain ones to be answered or which ones you d find more helpful then you d probably get better responses
35995
you need to watch out for using mysql s built in timestamp function like current_timestamp or cur_date because they will be called whenever the query is actually executed

maybe i should have asked what s the best tool to use for versioning photoshop and related files
36124
the access 2007 runtime can be obtained free from here which makes distribution less expensive
36126
the popup window can be closed using the onclick html event as follows
36291
if it doesn t then the property code queries the database and computes it then stores the value in the _total field so that it need not be recomputed the next time it s requested

dual-licensing works for developer-tools code libraries that have to be linked distributed with commercial software
36364
the method above adds two objects of the same type and can be used for any type t that has the + operator available

if you re on an intranet windows authentication can be handled for free by configuration alone
36464
it can be used to bypass javascript validation and check whether the server side is doing its thing
36469
you can add a suffix to the generated commands so that you can have standalone ruby 1.8 and ruby 1.9 builds both at the same time

if there are large files to be cached i d look at ensuring your content engine supports if-modified-since
36501
rpc methods such as named pipes can be used to communicate to a master process should this be required
36682
but my question here is why do they need to be declared as static in the containing class
36689
dp should be registered before any class which uses that db instance created
36714
can be made more readable imho like this
36734

setredirecturl would be called in any action that produces links forms which need to redirect to a given url
36813
when and how should table stats gathering be performed for oracle version 9 and up
36821
position relative will cause any contained elements to be positioned relative to the #wrapper container and position absolute will cause the #legend div to be pulled out of the flow and sit above the map keeping it s bottom right edge at the bottom of the #wrapper and stretching as required to contain the marker descriptions
36870
depending on the project or coding guidelines most of the boiler-plate code could be replaced by macros
36908
such function accepts only 3 positional arguments and everything after can only be passed as keyword arguments
36911
foo can be invoked like foo 1 2 3 4 5
36911
bar can be invoked like
36927
gathering stats should be done whenever there has been large changes to the data content for example a large number of deletes or inserts
36989
however the variable value already has to be enclosed in quotes which means that you need a second set of quotes and the inner set has to be escaped
37024
also some tools some o r mappers expect object data to be represented by properties and do not recognize public or protected member variables
37029
it is generally accepted that the use of cursors in stored procedures should be avoided where possible replaced with set based logic etc
37029
i haven t done any extensive testing but is this what others find
37072
if so there is little reason to poll the db to find out if you need to reindex just index as you insert or create an queue table which can be used to tell lucene what to index
37093
you say that objects can be modified at any time by a third party but i would still suggest you use immutable return objects here and instead have a separate thread event log you can subscribe to to get noticed when objects expire
37103
note the effect i want can be achieved by using inline elements white-space no-wrap that is how i did it in the image shown
37103
this however is no good to me for reasons too lengthy to explain here as the child divs need to be floated block level elements

the job when started will actually be passed a file descriptor to the socket by launchd when it does a simple check-in
37474
if you don t catch the exception terminate will be called which will end the program similarly to abort
37632
in dynamically typed languages the use case described above is less necessary since the compiler will allow any method to be called on any object failing at runtime if it does not exist but the second case of looking for methods which are marked or work in a certain way is still common

i tend to use enum for avoiding magic numbers this can be overcome by const i guess but enum allows you to group them up
37968
you have a reason to want the type to be allocated in stack space
37975
all the information you need can be found on wikipedia and msdn s wpf site

that s the default type for a floating-point constant - if you wanted them to be float s then you would use the f suffix
38287
i ve yet to see an operation that can t be done using a global function or an instance method

if this isn t possible in java is there some way to do it that could be called from java
39064
can somebody provide the smallest code snippet for a c++ dll that can be called from .net
39065
since the resource files don t have an namespace at least as far as i can tell they can t be accessed like regular classes
39091
in order to take control over the properties that you want to be cached you can call refreshcache passing the properties that you want to hang around

that linq-to-sql was not designed to be used in this way
39252
if the wording was predicates should apply const functions... or something like that then i would have concluded that const volatile functions were not ok

it would also be quite easy to automatic the creation of the history tables and triggers to maintain assuming it would be done via triggers

i will admit i am not totally a fan of it but i ll play devil s advocate really that is one of the main advatages and pushing this idea can be kinda neat

the classic trick to detect a vm is to populate the itlb run an instruction that must be virtualized which necessarily clears out such processor state when it gives control to the hypervisor then run some more code to detect if the itlb is still populated

39636
help basename can be extracted using the nifty n option
39683
this can of course be mitigated by having your validation logic return only a mention of the first failure etc
39683
the same validation rules should be used wherever validation occurs - if client-side validation passes then it should never fail validation later on pre-save business rules foreign key violation etc.
39693
this can be used to render filled polygons like triangles for things like 3d model rendering

the key point is that mutexes should be used to protect shared resources while semaphores should be used for signaling
40238
if there are multiple bathrooms one might be tempted to key them alike and make multiple keys - this is similar to a semaphore being mis-used
40238
i suppose a semaphore can be used in such situations but rarely are there real-world situations where the analogy actually holds - it s more often that there are several of the same type but still individual resources like the bathrooms which cannot be used this way
40284
it really just comes down to whether or not it is appropriate for you to set these default values or if your objects should be specced out at construction all the time
40295
can this be done without registering every address in the subdomain or is it possible to register a single ns record of ntdomain.local that points to the windows dns server

40410
because the natural number 0 cannot be decreased calling p on a semaphore containing a 0 will block the execution of the calling process thread until some moment at which the number is no longer 0 and p can be successfully and atomically executed
40410
as mentioned in other answers semaphores can be used to restrict access to a certain resource to a maximum but variable number of processes
40464
it is of course in an early beta so it s missing a lot of the things people would need or at least feel they need like plugins cross-machine synchronization of data could be done with plugins cross-platform support ie

recursive search algorithms can sometimes be implemented using a queue rather than the process s stack the search has to backtrack from a deadend and take another path - these backtrack points can be put in a queue and multiple processes can un-queue the points and try other paths

bugzilla is more of an issue tracker than a request tracker but it can be configured to handle email-based status tracking
40868
any page-wide resources you need have to be declared using a similar syntax
40873
hopefully someone can help or i might be forced to use the solution
40914
will soon be run by hudson ci server
40914
deltas and dumps have to be reviewed before beta test
40934
considering there s a lack of embedded compilers i d be surprised to find full embedded ides
40959
this lets you concentrate on the interface under test and be reasonably sure that all implementations will be tested without having to do a lot of manual implementation
40959
for xunit.net i created a type resolver library to search for all implementations of a particular type the xunit.net extensions are just a thin wrapper over the type resolver functionality so it can be adapted for use in other frameworks
40981
mmattax i m looking for property that can be called from client-side javascript
40987
additionally the caller might have instanced components from the library multiple times and for resource contention or threading issues want to provide a different logger callback for each one
41009
unfortunately on that article and basically everywhere else there is no explaination of how to use irapistream in .net i have found c c++ documentation but my desktop app needs to be written in c#
41100
in the relational world null should only ever be read to mean i don t know
41142
it can be done with xpath 1.0
41156
care must be also be taken to use identifiers that are long enough to make collisions unlikely given the anticipated total number of identifiers
41156
according to their specification uuids are not designed to be unpredictable and should not be used as session identifiers
41279
i ve got bunches of auxiliary files that are generated by code and latex documents that i dearly wish would not be suggested by spotlight as potential search candidates
41279
so can spotlight be configured to ignore say all .log files
41290
it was my understanding that attempted access from other threads would be told to wait until the lock was released
41386
ignoring how many other things must be done to each car for example it may take a fixed number of steps to calculate the position of an individual car for n cars it takes n 2 visits to cars to run this algorithm
41405
i ve been thinking that rather than adding the common library as a project reference perhaps we should start developing the common library as a standalone dll and publish different versions and target a particular version for a particular project so that changes can be made without any risk to other projects using the common library
41414
in order to get this to work the class varargs has to be implemented to override that returns a proxy object which in turn overrides operator
41427
if you re dealing with linq to sql and the orderby is an expression tree it will be converted into sql for execution anyway
41473
some ideas of how the api can be used include
41473
in most situations the api is fast enough to be used in interactive applications
41492
for example what is the default property of the vb6 control commandbutton and how would i found out any other controls default
41492
for example what is the default property of the vb6 control commandbutton and how would i found out any other controls default
41514
now the c# team has released a coding guideline stating that var should only be used to capture the result of a linq statement that creates an anonymous type because here we have no real alternative to var
41524
it will be duplicated for each branch tag in your revision control system remember in most svn system copies are cheap
41593
there s a difference between broken code and unfinished code and whether the test should be addressed immediately depends on which circumstance this failing test exposes
41598
they can be used like this
41598
they can be used like this
41660
otherwise it would have been something like reduce make_and l make_true .
41801
especially being in the constructor where there is only one thread that can call a constructor unlike with methods where it could be shared across threads and be accessed from any thread that is shared
41814
in which case the _servletcontextproperties will be replaced with any context-params specified in the web.xml
41847
identity columns must be replaced with sequences -- not technically t- or pl but just sql
41919
here you re giving freedom to the code itself that it will always be used for free purposes
41928
finally i enclosed and this is dirty my apologies lines 1417 to 1474 with a try catch block swallowing the exception
42007
the synchronization is going to be a little messy perhaps but it can be simplified if each app has its own framebuffer and the sync program points the video controller to the correct framebuffer inbetween frames when switching to the next app
42087
if you want all of those words to be printed out on their own use print instead of printf
42146
i m also interested in a broader answer that could be applied to any networked applications
42167
are users with restrictive firewalls like that likely to be permitted to install and run a .exe file from your website
42206
was the previous user a local admin or power user that could have masked this problem
42283
the wsdl can be parsed using the standard .net xml classes
42397
can be written like this
42397
can be written like this

there is no defense to be found in scanning urls for dangerous strings
42489
when i wrote my question title stackoverflow suggested me several related questions and i found out that there was already two similar questions
42596
there is no defense to be found in scanning urls for dangerous strings
42655
however it is executed before triggers and cannot be used to return trigger-generated values
42666
no code yet but i mention it as there may be code in firefox to do this in the future
42751
all those details may be specified externally either programmatically in a service host or via the config file
42790
so if cron runs a shell script which defines an environment variable using the first syntax before running some other command the other command will never be executed because sh bombs out trying to define the variable
42879
my main pause is that there are ton s of customized datagrids in the app as it is written now and since so much of the code needs to be rewritten to use gridviews .
42907
i think that most rdms can be accessed from c code now days
42936
i was wondering if there s any way that data could be loaded into ram so that it doesn t have to be accessed from disk
42949
the power of what can be done with dynamic languages is really what makes them so much fun to work with in my opinion
42951
when things go wrong your program may be stopped but this rarely happens if you ve done a few tests
42959
it s pretty ugly and would have to be invoked in place of the basic showdialog call but it should work
43015
jonathan holland is this something that can be done from .net
43029
because of that most collections are able to be traversed using an indexer and the for loop construct
43040
the only thing you might have missed was whether or not you wanted to make a backup of the 2003 project just in case
43089
they can also be used in windows but there are probably better more native solutions for that platform
43090
so for the expression rule | 0x80 the result will be an int since 0x80 is an int and rule which is a byte can safely be converted to int
43199
yet firebug reports that the page is served up in utf-8 so presumably the form submission request would also be encoded in utf-8
43204
this can be traversed in linear time
43213
i don t think it can be done using existing simulink blocks
43244
i agree with you i don t think it can be done i m afraid
43324
i might not be worried except i do plan on scaling this app in the future
43341
in contrast dmigrations takes the stupid approach it requires you to explicitly state the changes in a sequence of migrations which will be applied in turn to bring a database up to the most recent state that reflects the underlying models
43377
its width will be worked out based on the pixel width of its content and will be calculated after the contents are rendered
43383
in sweden for example you will have to be certified by pci payment card industry where your internal and external security will be tested a long with a lot of other things
43393
the hibernate query language doesn t feel right to me seems too much like writing sql which to my mind is one of the reason to use an orm tools so i don t have to furthermore it s all in xml which means it s poor for refactoring and errors will only be discovered at runtime
43456
one that will be called in get
43472
if you append a span containing ellipses to the end of each query a simple logical test in javascript with a bit of css manipulation could be used to hide show them as needed
43491
all commits of this branch will be related to this functionnality
43530
you re using field.index.un_tokenized so no analyzer will be used for indexing i think
43703
i believe the second part can t be done in css alone and will need javascript
43720
there may be some overhead in providing the clock to the class that relies on it but that could be handled by any number of dependency injection solutions using an inversion of control container plain old constructor setter injection or even a static gateway pattern
43750
the sql profiler tool is only available with the standard and enterprise version of sql server however all version can be profiled using the tool
43808
this issue can be solved by synchronizing the access on the java side - you only let one thread begin fetching the ids at one time
43813
not sure if it can only be used inside biztalk - it does says it is a .net class library
43871
if the present system uses vba to create the powerpoint presentation perhaps much of it could be transferred to access
43928
if you compare exception handling to traditional c-style return-value checking this caching effect should be taken into account as well the question is usually ignored in discussions
44136
again this can be simplified by using a function to populate the temporary table.
44137
also while it may be leaking it may be by design meaning that the browser might not have reclaimed the dom elements yet and released them
44152
to define unit tests which will automatically be noticed by django s testing framework put them in a module called tests which can be either a file named tests.py or a directory called tests
44171
i d still be concerned about inlining however
44298
configured this way any non-empty strings which cannot be converted to decimal result in a validation error which will immediately highlight the textbox
44339
even simple things like making it obvious what can and cannot be clicked can be overlooked or too subtle
44396
when the dependency downloaded does not have attached javadoc i manually add a link for the javadoc in the .classpath file so that i can see the javadoc for the dependency in eclipse
44421
when i try to run the code from the server i get a dcom source error message that states the machine-default permission settings do not grant local activation permission for the com server application with clsid 000c101c-0000-0000-c000-000000000046 to the user this security permission can be modified using the component services administrative tool. i have modified the permissions using the component services tool but still get this same error
44546
one of the biggest causes that i have found for email to be flagged as spam is dns
44586
i would probably rely on an issue tracking system for this purpose and make sure to tag each change that needed to be brought forward into the trunk code
44599
looks like it can t be done from bash
44602
having evaluated these i could have made a proper value judgement on whether cvs svn were worth their free price tag
44619
the default url will appear to be www.example.com as this default host as set in actioncontroller integration session
44620
it should also be pointed out that you can specify your controller action and params to the .form helper and if they fit into your routing rules then no query string parameters will be used
44647
however we use private branches to ensure that check-ins can still be made while this is in progress and that other check-ins don t have to interfere
44656
i know i can have thread b periodically check in thread safe way to see if a flag has been set by thread a but that makes the code more complicated
44715
i.e. are there other occasions where a ruby method cannot be invoked without self
44715
disagree either ruby could or could not be implemented without any further
44778
the cases and should be mapped to s and respectively.
44799
some of these tools do not have apis we can program against
44809
this can be setup on firefox as well
44821
does this mean that my executable can only be run on windows mobile devices instead of any generic windows ce installation
44827
and let s be honest you ll rarely create an empty string array without wanting to add at least one element to it
44870
it appears to be caused by using annotations from a 3rd party library like junit and not including the jar with that annotation in the javadoc invocation
44936
by reducing the comparisons to integral types and string and those things that can be reduced to integral types and are intended to they avoid potential issues
45005
from what i gather from reading the javadocs it looks like this allows a spring webservicemessagereceiver to be invoked using a jms client instead of a web services client
45087
so objects that have to be finalized are moved to a special queue to be cleaned out by a different thread the finalizer thread - which if you kill makes all kinds of bad things happen
45258
it s great as a standalone library though it can also be used with jquery yui prototype and gwt
45264
does anyone know of any existing packages or libraries that can be used to build a calendar in a django app
45348
depending on the stage of the page lifecycle the label control may not have been loaded yet
45364
a null-defined macro is a macro which will be replaced by nothing will be removed by the preprocessor
45439
perhaps this is something that can be done via wmi
45470
the need is to be able to expose services on the perl infrastructure which can be called by java .net applications seamlessly
45501
this file is just xml and it can be edited programmatically by anything that knows how to parse xml
45512
all the swap algorithms will be spending most of their time waiting for data to be fetched from memory
45618
err wait that is to support openid authentication in a rails application you are writing not to have run an openid endpoint in rails
45656
so when you re running a query that can be operated on any type of person just query the personview view
45713
remotesoft makes a tool that compiles a .net application into a package that can be run without .net installed
45795
what you want can be achieved using dependency injection
45827
is there an html tag to do it or does it have to be done via javascript
45847
also there is and article titled simulate a windows service using asp.net to run scheduled jobs at that uses an expiring cache to simulate a timer
45847
it claims it can be run on any hosted site
45923
it s downloadable in a simple text-format that can easily be parsed to auto-generate the blacklist
45963
this type of system is also further complicated if you are working with c++ objects because polymorhpic classes can be deleted in varying ways causing trickiness in determining the true base pointer that is being deleted
46007
there isn t any sort of unique identifier that can be used to tie records together and the data quality isn t always that good - there will always be typos people using different names joe vs
46029
also i ve decided to use log4net to log all of the errors and warnings so that each method can be declared void and doesn t need to return anything
46029
for some background the program will be written in either c# or vb.net and the tables will more than likely be stored in either access or sql server ce

the form will be used to display information to the screen
46043
the contents of the method can be disassembled using javap -c
46043

46043
again all this can be shown with javap -c
46053
i like the sound of combinatorial tests in mbunit i ve tried the abstract base class interface test technique with nunit and although it does work you d need to have a seperate test fixture for every interface a class implements since in c# there is no multiple inheritance - although inner classes can be used which is pretty cool
46088
may also be called rename by tortoise but svn move is the command in the barebones svn client
46155
how can an email address be validated in javascript
46165
you can then have ssrs export the report to about 10 different formats and send to the client including pdf excel html etc
46184
interface methods can t be labelled public
46210
this does invariably mean that the problem has exponential running time but could be solved using machine-learning heuristics
46210

46233
furthermore list comprehensions are generally preferred to map thus i d expect generator expressions to be preferred to imap
46282
i need to create a utility which will allow the user to generate a new configuration file that includes both the class library configuration as well my own configuration so new objects will be created which were not read from the .xml file
46353
a request to resolve a domain name if it can t be resolved by any other dns server will filter up to the tld
46386
chris brings up a good performance hit since the top 10 query would be run for each row
46404
the select top 10 query will be executed for each row in the table which could be a huge performance hit
46461
this could be as simple as calculating the maximum number of points that could realistically be earned per time unit of play or transmitting game logs back to the server to make sure the scoring is correct
46491
certain characters have special significance in html and should be represented by html entities if they are to preserve their meanings
46491
if you require all html character entities to be translated use htmlentities instead
46539
from the look of the code is seems like you might have been prototyping this in sql studio or similiar right
46539
from the look of the code is seems like you might have been prototyping this in sql studio or similiar right
46584
since a binary reference can t be debugged stepped into one would be forced to replicate and fix issues by extending the existing test projects rather than testing and fixing within the context of the consuming application alone
46639
a post would be used for any operation which is neither safe or idempotent
46639
typically a post would be used to create a new resource for example creating a new so question though in some designs a put would be used for this also
46777
also i will let the users do some actions without even visiting the site at all just send an email with command domain.com and the command will be carried out
46777
i can not have the script be called by random people visiting the site as that solution won t work for several reasons
46777
i think i would like to hear more about the possibility of having the script be run as response to an email coming in if anyone has any input at all on that
46883
most of these are geared toward creating pdfs but they should have read capability as well
46946
the long answer can be found here covariance and contravariance
47027
once a reference to a singleton object is obtained it can be used just like any other object
47081
the path argument to execv is the path to the application you wish to execute not the current working directory which will be returned by getcwd or the shell search path which will be returned by getenv path

using recursion to find a node by id could be done somewhat like this note i typed this in the textbox it may be wrong
47171
a double is a long float and floating point arithmetic should never be used for financial calculations
47202
everyone who is developing code to be released into production
47276
mips has special instructions lwl and lwr which can be used to access 32 bit quantities from unaligned addresses
47320
application memory can also be swapped out so the simple fact that one process has it in memory makes it potentially possible for it to end in the swap file
47474
as specified in the css syntax the width property can be given as percentage which is stated to be a number
47475
if unit-test names can become outdated over time and if you consider that the test itself is the most important thing then is it important to choose wise test names
47662
for warnings to be flagged to php natively would require changes to the mysql mysqli driver which is obviously beyond the scope of this question
47678
godi can t seen to find the gl gl.h file though i can --you can see that it is checking the suggestion
47781
if you need an interface with multiple methods to be mocked go with a mock framework
47805
in case of dynamic libraries you could just have used ldd on the resulting executable and be done with it
47871
edit if you got a comment-rss feed you may have luck using a mechanism that counts xml nodes like xpath s count
47908
the choice shouldn t be made on performance but on the message content and compression techniques
47909
if receipt must be verified tcp is your best option
47913
this can be done using crel
47958
the disadvantage are that it can be cumbersome to package your app up as a .egg file
47990
the xor operator can be used to toggle a bit
47994
lgpl is fine any modification to lgpl content has to be released under lgpl but using the code content is safe
47997
a good motivation to monads is sigfpe dan piponi s you could have invented monads
48006
is the functionality that it offers over vim going to be paid back in productivity increases in a reasonable timeframe
48017
can someone explain the mechanics of a jump table and why is would be needed in embedded systems
48019
if your problem is what to name exposed internal classes maybe you should consolidate them into a larger class
48033
a jump table would be used to draw characters because it would take too long to load a bitmap from memory and use a for loop to shove the bitmap out
48083
when a record is clicked in the gridview it shows up in the form and it can be edited in either the gridview and or the form by setting some properties
48103
so in that vein here s a very low level look at the math of modulus for an example of x which should show you how simple it can be compared to division
48154
whether or not this is a problem depends on what you re doing with the text if the order doesn t matter it s fine or if the generator adds text to the stream in the order it will be displayed it s fine
48157
from their help text it looks like both can be used to configure static routes
48180
in fact i was all ready working my way to understanding that it could be done for list or report view with listview_getcountperpage and i would use you way to get it for for the others though i don t need the listview_approximateviewrect since i will all ready know the new size of the listview
48244
for one it requires the csrss to be notified about process creation which involves lpc
48244
that said i see the overall slowdown in the sum of all those little things that have to be done in addition to the raw creation of a process va space and initial thread
48297
and if there s nothing else to be done the queue is now empty it returns a minus
48343
i think your interpretation is correct - you would not be allowed to download and execute javascript code in v8
48436
this can be secured by security role
48444
exceptions can be thrown from finally blocks but in that case the exhibited behaviour is almost certainly what you want
48454
another thing to add with that approach - you may have decided over time that you want to refactor the way your application is organized folders etc and this will give you an oppurtunity to do so
48475
ideally the lookup of all items that are tagged with at least a set of n given tags should be done using a single sql statement
48507
perhaps this can be alleviated with proper tuning and seperate physical drives - but i d think in the long run it would be a lot simpler to just either use some old hardware - or spin up a small virtual machine on a seperate host for your builds
48508
getting help knowing how to search for the right information in my experience is the single most important thing that has to be taught about c++
48651
in fact you could argue that abstract classes give you slightly more since they allow you to both require implementations to satisfy your code you must implement start and provide default implementations i have a standard paint you can override if you want to -- with interfaces implementations must be provided which over time can lead to brittle inheritance problems through interface changes
48657
sorry i should have been more complete in this answer
48670
that chunk or memory would be given back to the system and so can no longer be reliably read
48704
the function returns a handle that can be used to access an object
48781
but it s likely to be right down in the noise - particularly for languages which allow unnecessary parameter passing to be optimized out
48794
i need to embed partial view into my masterpage that will list pages and articles filtered with some criteria and be displayed on each page
48832
then everything inside the quotes should be treated as text

ajax -- compatibility problems across browsers may be mitigated via ajax libraries though
48907
increased encapsulation consider two top-level classes a and b where b needs access to members of a that would otherwise be declared private
48907
by hiding class b within class a a s members can be declared private and b can access them
48931
i think these can be stored using the jquery.data function
49056
the member m_nstate may not be changed either unless declared with the keyword mutable
49102
however you ll also need to respond to the wm_hotkey message - i m not sure if there is a way to get access to the wndproc of a wpf window or not which can be done for windows forms windows
49282
as noted in answer by joseph pecoraro you might want to watch for strings that are valid non-decimal numbers such as those starting with 0x for hex and 0b for binary and potentially more tricky numbers starting with zero that will be parsed as octal
49379
or should such sensitive components be built in native code for example vc++ and call them via jni
49388
in mysql when you use match on your indexed column each keyword you supply will be given a relevance score calculated roughly by the number of times each keyword was mentioned that will be more accurate than your method and certainly more effecient for multiple keywords
49400
so i have to ask do you really need hardened protection like you are seeking for your application
49400

in this case you would not want to use the c formatter as this would have inserted the currency symbol and further separators which were not required
49518
basically once the tcpclient.connect method has been successful it will have created a mapping between the physical mac address of the embedded system and the route it should take to that address which network card to use
49518
i don t believe that all messages then sent over the tcpclient connection will be sent out via both network cards
49555
we recently switched to feature based development using trunk branch code management we have a one project running well with scrum but its hard to get this approach adopted by the wider masses
49572
as discussed earlier scrum and other agile techniques can be introduced step by step

one final note you can t rename a folder that you haven t mapped or that you haven t done a get from
49791
in addition to finding bugs in your code such as guaranteed null pointer dereferencing infinite loops etc. static analysis can be used for security analysis of the code
49793
the strongest assumption here is that all your objects can be treated partly like the same ie they implement the same interface iconfigurationobject in the example or belong to the same inheritance tree
49937
how is it different from static code analysis ie what can it catch that can t be caught in static
49953
they can be passed as parameters to other functions defined inside other function and have lexical scope
49957
in the previous example if an exception was thrown in the performactiononumanagedresources method although the performanotheractiononumanagedresources method would not be processed the using block will still implicity invoke the dispose method on dc ensuring the realese of any unmanaged resources
49984
during the static analysis it is difficult to impossible to know what files will be passed as input what web requests will come what user will click etc
49988
this also could be used for writing batch scripts and writing batch scripts is programming
