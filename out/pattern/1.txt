on the other hand reading the csv file doing something with the values and then serializing to xml does make sense well as much as using xml can make sense.
233
i m not familar with delphi 7 but i m sure there are some registry editing libraries in there that you could use to modify this value
695
it could be as simple as writing to a notification table that lists what table and which row were modified
931
these are linux boxes so i checked with grep constant_tsc proc cpuinfo
971
encoding flash video is actually very easy with ffmpeg
1066
sven you reached the same conclusion as i did i found the shockwave flash object all be it from a slightly different route but was stumped on how to load the files from somewhere other than file on disk url
1069
i wonder if this is going to make it as slow as under purify et al
1320
i cannot answer the still supported portion of your questions but i would say if you are already comfortable with nant then it s probably viable
1665
i really agree with this - if you can reuse it it should be in a separate project
1667
have some portions of the source code that are part of the project but not deployable by default or at all unit tests extra plugins etc.
2245
i haven t experimented too much with this but depending on the layout you use for your gui your button could look completely different
2777
while i admit it s not as elegant as using a pipe it works
2872
i m not sure this is even possible with windows forms
2999
solving this problem with a graph isn t difficult but it can create a lot of extra work and difficulty if you re not comfortable with using them - of course that shouldn t discourage you from doing it especially if you are learning about them
3203
spend a few hours with it and you ll discover it s not so bad with plugins and themes
3965
this was really helpful with phpbb before 3.0 they ve since fixed this but it s still a good idea i think
4060
that is the official best practice in my company because external links have caused so much trouble with maintainability
4611
it s not as nice-looking as foreach but it has the advantage of being able to start at the second element
4629
this is really simple with javascript
4768
fortunately this is fairly straightforward with xming
4959
you are probably familiar with wildcard notations such as to find all text files in a file manager
5025
any suggestions or is this even necessary with sql server
5640
i found a fairly elegant solution with telerik s radajaxmanager
5745
but we have had very good results with nevron
6178
this makes putting the evaulation before the for statement just as good as any other way of doing it
6454
it s almost as simple as flat files but you do get a sql engine for querying
6559
that s why there s extension methods for ienumerable like convert that allow you to easily supply conversion for the items stored inside a collection which could be as simple as casting from one to another
6578
i m reasonably comfortable with c s malloc and free concept but cocoa s references counting scheme has me rather confused
6582
oh and git repositories are very efficient with storage space as compared to subversion
6765
i m going to start a new project - rewriting an existing system php + sql server from scratch because of some very serious limitations by design
6765
i am really fond of technologies that java offers - particularly spring framework and wicket and i am quite familiar with java from others projects and assignments before
6770
having too many icons can be just as bad as having some ugly ones
6779
but you shouldn t have too much trouble with java and sql2000
6971
as a sidenote keep an eye out on google for wpf shader tutorials it now uses the same technology to allow customer shaders in wpf applications and tutorials for that i believe are largely compatible with xna
7221
its test framework is as good as nunit but you can t use its code coverage tools or anything else
7611
there is very likely already is one out there but i m not familiar with any
7700
i think iis is fully manageable with wmi or some com objects that can be easilly used from a jscript wsh script
7842
the size of the set could be as big as n n-1 2 for example if x 1 2 4 ... 2 n
8204
this is the equivalent of process.start svn info... if you re only familiar with .net
8486
you can t really protect against memory access
8854
since you are already familiar with c and c++ i would recommend learning how to write a simple windows gui app using charles petzold s book
8895
alas this is only available for framework 3.0 and 3.5 but something similar can be implemented fairly easy with weak references
9013
you re building on your knowledge already hard won with .net languages using ps
9144
i do find it worrisome that you ve got developers who are so bad with memory management that you want to switch languages
9160
i actually encouraged the company i work for to begin tracking bugs with software specifically fogbugz and have been very pleased with fogbugz
9160
but we really haven t had any problems integrating fogbugz into a team that was totally unfamiliar with any bug tracking software
9191
the drive seems to be spending most of its time seeking backwards and forwards between the two files presumably reading very little after each seek
9191
varying this has had no effect so clearly the amount the os is physically reading after each disk seek is not dictated by this number
9641
it certainly helped me test out the webservice but it didn t much help with using the wcf service in my .net 2.0 application
10202
you can do more powerful and complex things though such as search for a keyword jump to the beginning of the line mark go to end of the line m-w to copy then jump to another buffer then c-y paste then jump back to the other buffer and end your macro
10752
am i misunderstanding integration tests or is there really just very little difference between integration and unit tests
10969
i ve had really good luck with posting that value in google to get a sense of what the error code means
11002
however we also need to maintain very fine control over gpu performance which i guess automatically rules out wpf and hardware acceleration
11399
i m not familiar with webobjects but i see you have java listed in there
11471
i m not yet very familiar with wpf but i see this as a question about sorting and filtering collections
11704
i ve played very briefly with sharepoint wiki plus
12184
there s nothing wrong with xml it s reasonably human readable as much as yaml or json or ini files are but remember its intent is to be read by machines
12241
its both as simple and as complex as this
12313
we ve gone through so much pain with tfs msbuild using tfsdeployer custom powershell scripts etc to get it to do what we were able to do with nant out of the box
12367
if you re using cocoa it s fairly easy with nsstring
12813
highly recommended for anyone doing pretty much anything with svn
12815
implementing features became so much easier after writing a test and we were able to make major architectural changes to the system with all the confidence in the world that everything still worked the same as it did yesterday
12826
as an aside comments like that solution is good but surely you can note it s not as good as can be
12875
there are open source options here as well such as sharpmap and many others google can help out that can use the free tiger maps for the united states as the data source
12937
imperative languages like java and c# solve a certain set of problems pretty well but it also helps to think in a functional manner sometimes such as with haskell and lisp
13387
i didn t do this at first but then i was getting bad results where the type of the data wasn t immediately apparent such as ip numbers or an entry like xyq 3.9 sp1
13432
i think you would be perfectly fine with targeting just 2.0 and above someone who would use your library would most likely be doing new development and using at least asp.net 2.0
13600
for people not familiar with wmi like me here are some links
13866
instead of resorting to display block note that ie7 does some seriously odd things with whitespace
14106
i m very uncomfortable with this since i was the one who taught everyone the shop s programming language they all got out of college not knowing the language and as luck would have it i m very proficient with it.
14920
if that works as expected then i m not familiar with any reason why it would function differently inside a container
15121
what you really need to do is start with something that is not nearly as big as stack overflow
15261
i m not familiar with pylons but if causing the connections to intermittently do a select 1
15694
of course this configuration will still need to be tested but it should be as simple as testing if the install initial run works on xp with sp2+
15727
also there are a lot more tools included with xcode et al such as instruments and shark that you simply can t get with vs unless you open your wallet and even then imho aren t as good
15918
let s see if my take adds anything not certain by any means...
16948
this way getting started is as easy as svn co project followed by nant build
17044
you still have the same problem that types are subject to change and as much as refactoring tools are helpful for that it s not ideal compared to not having to change where a type is specified except in a single place which follows the don t repeat yourself principle
17300
for peak fitting you ll almost certainly need to use arrays which will complicate things a little but is still very doable with ctypes
17414
be very careful with security if you go this route
17623
including microsoft.visualbasic is much neater by comparison
17726
secondly security might be an issue - if some are to be publicly viewable such as profile photos for example but others are not such as cvs then placing them in different directories would be easier to manage
17726

17986
overall i am quite impressed with this particular configuration and i am already much more impressed with it than i have ever been with visual source safe
18539
as great as linq is though i think any orm system would allow you to do away with that dreck
19169
there are probably just as many pitfalls with this approach because windows will be running while all of this is in operation
19225
at the end of the day i was not impressed with accurev s interface or the so-called streams
19256
i ve become quite fascinated with liquibase
19384
i don t know if it s still in print but i found navigating c++ usefull but i was also very comfortable with pointers from pascal
19565
- the way it s phrased makes about as much sense as which java
