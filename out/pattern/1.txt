on the other hand reading the csv file doing something with the values and then serializing to xml does make sense well as much as using xml can make sense.
233
i m not familar with delphi 7 but i m sure there are some registry editing libraries in there that you could use to modify this value
695
it could be as simple as writing to a notification table that lists what table and which row were modified
931
these are linux boxes so i checked with grep constant_tsc proc cpuinfo
971
encoding flash video is actually very easy with ffmpeg
1066
sven you reached the same conclusion as i did i found the shockwave flash object all be it from a slightly different route but was stumped on how to load the files from somewhere other than file on disk url
1069
i wonder if this is going to make it as slow as under purify et al
1320
i cannot answer the still supported portion of your questions but i would say if you are already comfortable with nant then it s probably viable
1665
i really agree with this - if you can reuse it it should be in a separate project
1667
have some portions of the source code that are part of the project but not deployable by default or at all unit tests extra plugins etc.
2245
i haven t experimented too much with this but depending on the layout you use for your gui your button could look completely different
2777
while i admit it s not as elegant as using a pipe it works
2872
i m not sure this is even possible with windows forms
2999
solving this problem with a graph isn t difficult but it can create a lot of extra work and difficulty if you re not comfortable with using them - of course that shouldn t discourage you from doing it especially if you are learning about them
3203
spend a few hours with it and you ll discover it s not so bad with plugins and themes
3965
this was really helpful with phpbb before 3.0 they ve since fixed this but it s still a good idea i think
4060
that is the official best practice in my company because external links have caused so much trouble with maintainability
4611
it s not as nice-looking as foreach but it has the advantage of being able to start at the second element
4629
this is really simple with javascript
4768
fortunately this is fairly straightforward with xming
4959
you are probably familiar with wildcard notations such as to find all text files in a file manager
5025
any suggestions or is this even necessary with sql server
5640
i found a fairly elegant solution with telerik s radajaxmanager
5745
but we have had very good results with nevron
6178
this makes putting the evaulation before the for statement just as good as any other way of doing it
6454
it s almost as simple as flat files but you do get a sql engine for querying
6559
that s why there s extension methods for ienumerable like convert that allow you to easily supply conversion for the items stored inside a collection which could be as simple as casting from one to another
6578
i m reasonably comfortable with c s malloc and free concept but cocoa s references counting scheme has me rather confused
6582
oh and git repositories are very efficient with storage space as compared to subversion
6765
i m going to start a new project - rewriting an existing system php + sql server from scratch because of some very serious limitations by design
6765
i am really fond of technologies that java offers - particularly spring framework and wicket and i am quite familiar with java from others projects and assignments before
6770
having too many icons can be just as bad as having some ugly ones
6779
but you shouldn t have too much trouble with java and sql2000
6971
as a sidenote keep an eye out on google for wpf shader tutorials it now uses the same technology to allow customer shaders in wpf applications and tutorials for that i believe are largely compatible with xna
7221
its test framework is as good as nunit but you can t use its code coverage tools or anything else
7611
there is very likely already is one out there but i m not familiar with any
7700
i think iis is fully manageable with wmi or some com objects that can be easilly used from a jscript wsh script
7842
the size of the set could be as big as n n-1 2 for example if x 1 2 4 ... 2 n
8204
this is the equivalent of process.start svn info... if you re only familiar with .net
8486
you can t really protect against memory access
8854
since you are already familiar with c and c++ i would recommend learning how to write a simple windows gui app using charles petzold s book
8895
alas this is only available for framework 3.0 and 3.5 but something similar can be implemented fairly easy with weak references
9013
you re building on your knowledge already hard won with .net languages using ps
9144
i do find it worrisome that you ve got developers who are so bad with memory management that you want to switch languages
9160
i actually encouraged the company i work for to begin tracking bugs with software specifically fogbugz and have been very pleased with fogbugz
9160
but we really haven t had any problems integrating fogbugz into a team that was totally unfamiliar with any bug tracking software
9191
the drive seems to be spending most of its time seeking backwards and forwards between the two files presumably reading very little after each seek
9191
varying this has had no effect so clearly the amount the os is physically reading after each disk seek is not dictated by this number
9641
it certainly helped me test out the webservice but it didn t much help with using the wcf service in my .net 2.0 application
10202
you can do more powerful and complex things though such as search for a keyword jump to the beginning of the line mark go to end of the line m-w to copy then jump to another buffer then c-y paste then jump back to the other buffer and end your macro
10752
am i misunderstanding integration tests or is there really just very little difference between integration and unit tests
10969
i ve had really good luck with posting that value in google to get a sense of what the error code means
11002
however we also need to maintain very fine control over gpu performance which i guess automatically rules out wpf and hardware acceleration
11399
i m not familiar with webobjects but i see you have java listed in there
11471
i m not yet very familiar with wpf but i see this as a question about sorting and filtering collections
11704
i ve played very briefly with sharepoint wiki plus
12184
there s nothing wrong with xml it s reasonably human readable as much as yaml or json or ini files are but remember its intent is to be read by machines
12241
its both as simple and as complex as this
12313
we ve gone through so much pain with tfs msbuild using tfsdeployer custom powershell scripts etc to get it to do what we were able to do with nant out of the box
12367
if you re using cocoa it s fairly easy with nsstring
12813
highly recommended for anyone doing pretty much anything with svn
12815
implementing features became so much easier after writing a test and we were able to make major architectural changes to the system with all the confidence in the world that everything still worked the same as it did yesterday
12826
as an aside comments like that solution is good but surely you can note it s not as good as can be
12875
there are open source options here as well such as sharpmap and many others google can help out that can use the free tiger maps for the united states as the data source
12937
imperative languages like java and c# solve a certain set of problems pretty well but it also helps to think in a functional manner sometimes such as with haskell and lisp
13387
i didn t do this at first but then i was getting bad results where the type of the data wasn t immediately apparent such as ip numbers or an entry like xyq 3.9 sp1
13432
i think you would be perfectly fine with targeting just 2.0 and above someone who would use your library would most likely be doing new development and using at least asp.net 2.0
13600
for people not familiar with wmi like me here are some links
13866
instead of resorting to display block note that ie7 does some seriously odd things with whitespace
14106
i m very uncomfortable with this since i was the one who taught everyone the shop s programming language they all got out of college not knowing the language and as luck would have it i m very proficient with it.
14920
if that works as expected then i m not familiar with any reason why it would function differently inside a container
15121
what you really need to do is start with something that is not nearly as big as stack overflow
15261
i m not familiar with pylons but if causing the connections to intermittently do a select 1
15694
of course this configuration will still need to be tested but it should be as simple as testing if the install initial run works on xp with sp2+
15727
also there are a lot more tools included with xcode et al such as instruments and shark that you simply can t get with vs unless you open your wallet and even then imho aren t as good
15918
let s see if my take adds anything not certain by any means...
16948
this way getting started is as easy as svn co project followed by nant build
17044
you still have the same problem that types are subject to change and as much as refactoring tools are helpful for that it s not ideal compared to not having to change where a type is specified except in a single place which follows the don t repeat yourself principle
17300
for peak fitting you ll almost certainly need to use arrays which will complicate things a little but is still very doable with ctypes
17414
be very careful with security if you go this route
17623
including microsoft.visualbasic is much neater by comparison
17726
secondly security might be an issue - if some are to be publicly viewable such as profile photos for example but others are not such as cvs then placing them in different directories would be easier to manage
17726
secondly security might be an issue - if some are to be publicly viewable such as profile photos for example but others are not such as cvs then placing them in different directories would be easier to manage
17986
overall i am quite impressed with this particular configuration and i am already much more impressed with it than i have ever been with visual source safe
18539
as great as linq is though i think any orm system would allow you to do away with that dreck
19169
there are probably just as many pitfalls with this approach because windows will be running while all of this is in operation
19225
at the end of the day i was not impressed with accurev s interface or the so-called streams
19256
i ve become quite fascinated with liquibase
19384
i don t know if it s still in print but i found navigating c++ usefull but i was also very comfortable with pointers from pascal
19565
- the way it s phrased makes about as much sense as which java
20021
from other questions here such as this one or this one i can see that i m not alone and that this is not a trivial problem
20649
it s a very specific problem with this code i doubt it will be useful for someone else but here it goes
20944
they must be doing some really crazy stuff with javascript to get it to work notice how neither the parent nor the nested anchor tags have a name or href attribute - all functionality is done through the class name and js
20962
i think silverlight and xaml is preferable to actionscript and though i m not familiar with actionscript ide s i am familiar with vs2008 and expression web blend and they are very good development environments and getting better all the time
22031
scraping stack overflow is especially easy with shoes and hpricot
22057
in my opinion as long as normal username password account creation is offered alongside openid average internet users will naturally begin to try and eventually stick with using openid
22800
true it s not as advanced as aero et al but that doesn t always matter
22873
explore functional programming with haskell
22912
we ve had pretty good luck by writing our own malloc and free functions
22940
explore functional programming with haskell
23148
in my admittedly limited experience with ssis it is quite good at rapidly getting something up and running but frusteratingly limited in getting something that feels like the most elegant efficient solution to a programmer
23190
i am having an especially hard time with this because i cant visualize 20 dimensions p
23339
i would go with flex for a nice clean straightforward approach - especially if you re already familiar with flash and actionscript 3.0
23402
anything thats as good and as stable and as feature-rich as gigaspaces
23718
i m not familiar with cherrypy so i can only suggest you look for an apache module for cherrypy
24127
personally i have very good experiences with camtasia
24299
having only developed programs with .net through mono using c# and ironpython my experience with ides only involve emacs and experiments with eclipse and monodevelop
24531
it s as painless as svn can be on windows
24762
since subversion uses an update edit commit cycle rather than checkin checkout you will need to be especially careful with binary files
25182
also i went with where in since i didn t feel like opening up the analyzer
25275
i am not familiar with ruby on rails but the following is untested php code
25287
but reference material is pointing to the fact that this is not possible by design
25499
i m looking for something as simple as ado.net s sqlcommand class with it s executenonquery executescalar and executereader
25532
i want something as easy as set up one template and subsequent pages derive from the template and override content regions similar to master pages
26126
i find that i need to make very few changes since i don t do anything extraordinarily complex with css
26131
i find that i need to make very few changes since i don t do anything extraordinarily complex with css
26621
if you are not familiar with mvcc you will be shocked that you were ever able to live without it
26762
is it as good as any other or is it pretty solid with good features comparatively
26802
my biggest gripe is that the performance of the server under windows is no where near as good as under nix and if you are using a nix server they do not officially support the option for case-insensitive filenames meaning you either forgo support relating to filesystem errors or setup a trigger that prevents people adding foo.cpp if foo.cpp exists
26851
while i did like the tools for example visual diff and merge and the admin bits we had some really tiresome issues with binding as chris mentions
26905
i ve also had pretty good experiences with aptana ide though and i hear that intellij is good if you don t mind paying the price
27254
it could be that prototype or mootools or extjs are as good as jquery
28405
on top of that readability should probably be more highly preferred than performance in this case
28635
some of this confusion also comes from the fact that functions they call might take pointers or even smart pointers as arguments when references would perhaps be better clearer
28668
i m quite handy with sql and if somebody could point me to some filemaker plug-in that could give me sql access to the data within filemaker i would be pleased as punch
28762
not possible with linq as calling .count ... does enumerate the collection
28992
abstraction this is especially true with linq-to-entities
29463
i m not good with c c++ at all so maybe someone can clean up my syntax or be more specific
29529
anyway i m not familiar with log4j and don t know whether you can inject your own serializer into it
29660
and even if you wanted to do something as kludgy as using context_info see you can t set that from within a udf anyway
30116
i dont t know asp.net mvc but i am very familiar with mvc pattern
30281
is as good as django or ror
30284
i dont t know asp.net mvc but i am very familiar with mvc pattern
30458
otherwise i ve had very little trouble with php on windows
30720
you can probably find a combination of tools object-relational layers or other data access tools which will do a lot of that for you but setting up the tools is going to be as much hassle as writing the code
31142
i ve not familiar with using either of these but try searching msdn for splitbutton or dropdownbutton
31631
git has become as ubiquitous as any single tool can be and you really would only be cheating yourself to not use it unless you just really want to use something not-git
32303
this needed some explanation which i later wrote-up as seam is the new struts
32947
the reportviewer control should work just fine with sql server 2008
33438
but some of the data i have to show on some forms has to come from text files and by text files i mean human-readable files they can be csv tab-delimited or even a key value pair per line since my data is as simple as this but my preference of course is xml files
33484
also i just wanted to share this question because i m totally impressed with freebase and think if people haven t looked at it they should
33615
i ve had pretty good luck with this using pure c++ code to read and write out datafiles this could be a third party library of some kind even and then my c++ cli code converts copies the c++ data into .net types in memory which can be consumed directly as if i had written the read write library in c#
33618
there s a potentially serious problem with this code because it ignores the character encoding specified in the string which is utf-8 by default
33670
i m not really familiar with aptana but in eclipse you can expand whats being installed and uncheck anything you don t need
34812
this integrates very easliy with iis websites
34941
for perl at least the first option is sufficient i m not familiar with php
35464
i m also not sure why you think the fact that this is valid c++ code is helpful when attempting to figure out why it doesn t compile as c
35509
if you try it ll slowly grow to be just as complex as bosh but without the benefit of third-party library support or standardization
35731
so i say subsonic makes sense in small apps but maintenance on subsonic apps gets pretty hairy we have especially hard times with overlapping validation code and pre post in code triggered events
35759
even code that s as simple as printing an error message with a format string can fail at runtime because of mismatched types
35879
i am only familiar with php
35960
different browsers have different max lengths for get requests - but none of them are as large as post
36075
while there are lots of ways to auto-generate code for something as simple as this i believe you could write a simple xslt that takes in an xml representation of the enum and outputs the code file
36593
i think you will be very impressed with sql buddy
36711
i would say you should have as many as required or any that make the code cleaner such as guard clauses
36800
not exactly analogous to nunit but very good with nice features including test auto-discovery and a watch the tests and code - when something changes rerun the tests that failed last time
36840
provide real unsubscription upon click on unsubscribe
36858
as horrible as it looks the git gui and gitk commands are as good as any
36990
if you re not familiar with mocking it sounds like a lot of work
38129
but you will need someone good with linux to handle this and preferably good with this precise technology
38130
i m not great with xml but i like vaibhav s idea of generating straight from a schema rather than using a template
38201
i ve had rather terrible experiences with mysql as a back-end
38352
i m thinking about using xml but i m not familiar with querying xml db fields
38384
as far as i understand they re not nearly as performant as iron python that is developed by the same team
38521
nothing feels quite so bad as tracking down a critical problem to code you added help track down critical problems.
38533
btree files are often much faster than relational databases
38629
also backing up those websites would be as simple as ftp the entire thing
38705
also backing up those websites would be as simple as ftp the entire thing
38825
i m not familiar specifically with cakephp but this kind of thing seems to happen anywhere with fixtures
39343
openoffice has a basic interpreter which is largely compatible with vba
39464
disclaimer i m not very familiar with c# so these are general answers
39489
that way when you decide to point the package to another sql server it is as simple as editing the alias to point to the new server no editing necessary in the ssis package
39598
i m not sure what exactly to make of that but the khronos group the guys working on the opengl standard are working on the opencl standard and is trying to make it highly interoperable with opengl
40009
if the modification is as simple as writing to a port ie
40244
i m looking for something that is almost as easy as writing a normal pipe
40308
i have written code for palmos and it s about as painful as writing raw win32 code in c
40422
ok is this as easy as wrapping an ajax autocomplete around a dropdown
41015
they have been very picky with this - and have not accepted my attempts to integrate with linkedin yet they tell me i have to wait with everyone else apparently my applications are not high-profile enough
41082
i realize that foss is your primary desire and i definitely agree with this
41181
consuming twice as much ram as firefox
41277
if the designer is not familiar with smarty i think it s almost the same as if you use the existing codeigniter templating system which leaves everything to php actually
41386
note that this concept is only concerned with scalability - not optimizing the number of steps for each car
41457
is this as simple as spelling
41720
so start with mvc and you will easily be able to move in to webforms if needed
43010
i m not familiar with java regex but documentation for the pattern class would suggest you could use
43053
i have an impression that spring.net never really took off or at least not as much as castle project monorail
44291
again it s not unbreakable by any stretch of the imagination but it s completely invisible to the naked eye
44443
i guess i was wondering if postgresql or mysql have any obvious advantages in these areas i am primarily familiar with oracle
44973
is it currently possible with pre release of ironruby to run rubygems
45008
it s not very difficult with javascript though
45383
there is no magic in the clr to call dispose methods automatically other than tracking objects that contain finalizers and storing them in the finalizer table by the gc and calling them when some clean up heuristics kick in by the gc
45408
is it something as hacky as mapping the mnemonic instructions to binary codes stuffing it into an char pointer and casting it as a function and executing
45417
is it something as hacky as mapping the mnemonic instructions to binary codes stuffing it into an char pointer and casting it as a function and executing
46079
only disable after user clicks the submit button but before the posting back to the server
46123
never implement functions as macros for the following reasons
46296
i m not familiar with bazaar but git doesn t track file renames
46586
should these be considered as dangerous as goto
47177
the getsystemloadaverage and disk space querying methods are only available under java 6
47235
while i m very familiar with asp.net i ve not seen this extension before
47628
now disassemble with javap -c included in the sun jdk
48003
imagine trying to use something so simple as map in java and no i don t mean the data structure
48010
if this is not about porting but creating you should really consider opengl as this api is as powerful as directx and much easier to port to mac or linux
48431
i m not real familiar with svn i ve never used it - so i can t comment that mergeing is worse with tfs - and haven t hit the merge bug ben s reported - but i ve had great success with branching and merging using tfs
48448
but unless the other languages are a small part of your shop just stick with svn
48508
i ve had quite good experiences with this order of teaching in the past
48561
given that you are on a shared host it is improbable that you can access to that file and even if you would access it it is probable that it contains then entries for all the websites hosted on the given machine setting up separate logging for each virtualhost is certainly possible with apache but i don t know if it is a common practice
48733
any thoughts on whether there is anything fundamentally wrong with this design or if anyone is doing this and has had better luck with working with hibernate on the reloads
48772
i have never hand-coded object creation code for sql server and foreign key decleration is seemingly different between sql server and postgres
48882
i am not familiar with apache cxf but the following should be applicable to any java servlet based framework
48974
i m not familiar enough with c# or ruby to know what their version of decorators would be
49786
i already have the parser and most of these will be hand written so i decided against xml
49859
you can become quite good with sections of it though and be super productive very quickly
