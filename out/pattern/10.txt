if i m developing a single project on my pc laptop git is better because it is far easier to set up and use
1261
however i ve heard a lot of people say that svn is better
1384
that is where nhibernate comes in as it gives you lightweight pocos that are unrelated to your database model but the setup time is much longer
1517
aquamacs has a more irregular schedule but it s seen some pretty major updates over the last year

i think programmer comfort is my main reason to choose python but i think perl is still better supported
2017
this is more or less the perfect use case for svk
2068
view is more loosely coupled to the model
2614
here is a good way to remember the process that each of them follow that i use when trying to decide which is better for my circumstance
2678
it sounds like git is more complicated to live with

because of this it is more or less assumed that if you have any message loop it must be available for the lifetime of your process
3050
even the canonical factorial function example is better implemented with a loop

if how ever you have a list of users which is access more often than is written to then i would firstly create a clustered index on the column that is access the most usually the primary key
4064
you can also cache in memory which is much more efficient

which one is better suited i run windows so the platform-independence of vmware does not count and easier to automate
4833
edit strchr is better only for one char

just a bit of a question is the reason they are choosing grails because groovy is closer in syntax to java than ruby or because they want access to java
5400
also make sure to let him struggle though some of the tougher problems nothing is more satisfying than the moment you figure it out on your own
5403
a change request is more like but we need to consider this other thing as well.
5645
and since c# is more widely used you can easily find java -- c# tutorials on google or check out and watch some videos
6099
the database backup requirement is more interesting though and one that i ve come up against more than once
6144
this is no more dangerous or critical than the normal odd file problem and can be because of various problems like a subversion program dying mid-change power-disruption etc
6215
of course using a csv parser is better but just for the fun of it you could
6531
assigning functions to the prototype is better for public methods because all instances of the class will share the same copy of the method
6582
subversion 1.5 just added merge tracking but git is still better
6852
the newly encoded file is longer and when comparing the binary of the before and after the data hardly matches up at all
6906
i ve heard it said that java is more like write once debug everywhere but that s probably as true as or even moreso than c#
6933
in cocoa it is far more common to return objects to a caller that are autoreleased than it is to return objets that the caller itself needs to release
6972
having said that these three blocks of code have very different external behaviors so comparing them is like asking whether quicksort is more efficient than adding an item to a red-black tree
7091
uint32 is much more readable and writeable than unsigned long long which is the equivalent for some systems
7482
this makes it more complicated if you ask me
7678
a table in a db is really the set of that entity it makes more sense once you re using set-logic
7994
having the right interaction model is probably more important
7994

8228
so this is it more than programming but google found nothing and you guys are just the right kind of geniuses
8596
less power consuption which is better for the environment
8626
a real deployment of a grid is more complicated but i just need something portable for development
8753
there is also my flexunit automation kit which does more or less the same for flexunit
8780
which is more important quickly getting the programs to work or getting the programs working quickly
9152
ontime is more an alm tool - it s trying to do everything
9274
is that mdb2 goes much further to
9304
i know this is more a philosophical subjective questions but is there any reason to use these auto-properties except from saving five lines of code for each field
9752
not the most optimal solution a table lookup is faster

i ve used sql server express on the past projects but time and time again i hear people saying that the product from oracle is faster and more powerful
9860
sql express is also more install and forget than oracle

which is more efficient for the compiler and the best practice for checking whether a string is blank
10949
i need to be able to generate a deep clone of this object - so i write a clone method and implement it with a simple binaryformatter serialize deserialize - or perhaps i do the deep clone using some other technique which is more error prone and i d like to make sure is tested
10951
i would tend to be of the opinion that if you re after performance improvements your time is much better spent elsewhere tweaking your schema optimising your queries and ensuring good index coverage
11074
unit testing a full code generator is more like integration testing than unit testing if you ask me
11136
it supports embedding images and tables as well as text opens by default using microsoft word and whilst it s featureset is more limited count out any advanced formatting for something that looks and feels and opens like a word document it s not far off
11662
c# is more java like and probably c++ like
11679
from what i have read this is more portable than stricmp because stricmp is not in fact part of the std library but only implemented by most compiler vendors
11902
where possible i transpose the objects into xml - this means that the web service is more portable - i can then access the service in whatever language i just need to create the parser object transposer in that language

we had setup tortoisesvn to use _svn following the recommendation that this works better for visual studio and have also installed tortoisesvn on the build server in case it is ever needed
12140
this works better in any case much better than having all those objects need some global settings object --- that of course effectively makes unit testing impossible disadvantage can be that you sometimes need to set a dozen of properties or that you need to let those properties percolate into sub-objects
12394
clearly the using statement is no longer applicable so the programmer would have to manually call dispose when he or she is done with the resource
12412
bash is the better interactive shell in my opinion.
12822
people say that imagemagick is much faster
12875
however this route is somewhat more complicated and possibly less performant if all you need is a radius search
12965
most modern email is more complex than that though
13064
this is more difficult than it looks
13210
.net 3.0 and .net 3.5 did not change the version of the clr so using asp.net 3.5 is a more complicated thing that it sounds like it should be at first

significant optimization is better done by caching strategies and optimizing your database access
13678
the team captain thinks that labview is better for its ease of learning and teaching
13706
wow i m not sure we re talking migration here anymore - the difference is more like re-writing
13746
as a postcript i d say that c c++ is more suited to robotics since the students will no doubt have to deal with embedded systems and fpgas at some point

that narrows the field a lot if you care to guess the company. i know joel s opinion and my experience leads me to partially disagree for the same reason that a white hat hacker is more effective finding security holes certain kinds of errors are more effectively found by white box testers who know how to write code and therefore what the common mistakes are - for example resource management issues like memory leaks
14394
the shorter names makes it more readable to me as well
14422
even this badly-auto-translated japanese tutorial is more useful than the rest of the documentation i could find
14530
so the question is this for simple data retrievals which approach is better linq-to-sql or stored procs
14568
once again this is more so i don t have to scroll through a lot of text when i just want to review some event handlers
14688
a leak means that the object is no longer accessible to you or to the os framework and will not be freed for the lifetime of the operating system s current session
14926
i must admit that i m not sure wether this performs better or worse than the normal asp.net repeater onitemdatabound cast code but anyway here s my 5 cent
15002
string just looks more like c c++ style
15011
i am not going to debate which one is better
15089
as andrei points out metalscroll is a better alternative
15091
technically ruby is more sophisticated than java or c# being closer to smalltalk in terms of oo purity and closer to lisp in terms of meta-programming facilities
15193
performance is generally better from the point of view of network traffic - if you have a cursor or similar then there aren t multiple trips to the database
15198
your time is probably better spent setting up processes to minimize bugs than trying to estimate how many you have
15788
what s a better ajax toolkit for .net that can provide equal or better set of functionality that is more scalable straight forward and completely customizable
15887
make sure that everyone is aware that the wiki is even more informal than email..
16320
which is better and why
16408
the larger your data set and the smaller m is the more likely you ll get a collision .
16455
what that means in the long run is that when you come back to make a change to your string format you will either have the ability to pop in and make a few adjustments to the format string or wrinkle your brow and start moving around all kinds of property accessors mixed with text which is more likely to introduce problems

the spring dm google group is no longer active and has moved to eclipse.org as the gemini blueprint project which has a forum here
16877
apparently visual svn is much better but costs money
16908
if you really need to write a good hash function that minimizes collisions more than the default implementations available in the standard languages you need an advanced degree in mathematics
16973
if you have any choice in the matter consider using relax ng as your schema syntax it is much more readable and maintainable
17043
other times using the full class name is more helpful as it documents the code better than var does
17181
which one is better
17390
following the official extension promotion path multitexturing is no longer an optionally implemented arb extension but has been a part of the opengl core api since version 1.3

perhaps because javascript is a more powerful programming language than those two
17713
i suspect that a ss js solution that supports more recent ecma specs would be no more cumbersome than using other scripting languages for the task
17812
this is more likely to happen if your projects are in separate solutions and can therefore be compiled separately
17970
the friend keyword lets me create an accessor function which is more concise than always having a getinstance method on the class

i ve never used crystal so i can t tell you which is better but i get the distinct impression that ms tried to rush ssrs out the door
18543
it s not free like the microsoft clr profiler but is faster and more to the point in my opinion
18669
i know the original solution is performing faster but i think this one is much cleaner
18876
this isn t any more elegant than what you have stipulated so i wonder if any of the django or rails guys can provide any input
18884
secondly i d suggest using document.getelementbyid display-name .value instead of document.forms as it won t break if you rearrange the html and is more the commonly accepted standard of what to do
