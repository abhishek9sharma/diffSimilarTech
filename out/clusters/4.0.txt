innodb is affected by the primary key much more than myisam and it could make a noticeable difference
ok there are some cases where myisam is faster than innodb but rarely enough that it s worth putting up with the lack of acid-compliance
there are some situations when myisam is infinitely more efficient than innodb when manipulating large data dumps offline because of table lock
edit for the read-performance this link shows that innodb often is actually not slower than myisam
while myisam can be faster for some queries innodb is usually quicker if properly tuned
myisam is often faster than innodb in terms of raw performance mostly because it is not acid
not sure why people think myisam is more performant than innodb - it s a conundrum wrapped in an enigma
innodb is often slower than myisam being a transactional db engine with acid properties
myisam has proved to be faster than innodb for me
as for reliability i think that postgresql is more reliable especially when compared to mysql using myisam - innodb is a lot better here
innodb is more reliable than myisam
innodb consumes more disk space than myisam -- typically 2x-3x
innodb is transactional so inserts will generally be slower than myisam
then i thought about innodb but then i read that myisam is better with many write operations
i did a search online comparing myisam and innodb but all of the articles i read judged myisam being faster than innodb on select queries
it is possible that the config of your innodb engine is more efficient for your searches than the way you have myisam set up
innodb has better performance than myisam though innodb needs more attention to tuning the configuration innodb supports atomic changes transactions foreign keys and innodb is much more resistant to corrupting data in a crash
but when myisam is really better than innodb
in my opinion myisam use to be faster than innodb now they are pretty much the same in speed
put another way let s say i start with a new innodb table and insert 20 gb of data assuming that 20 gb incorporates all the excess innodb stuff i realize data stored in innodb is larger than myisam then i delete all data then i insert 10 gb of data
innodb would be a better choice than myisam for a high-write table
innodb is much much stricter than myisam
innodb uses row level locking while myisam can only use table level locking that is why innodb has crash revovery is better than myisam
also innodb is slower than myisam unless myisam is blocking for a huge select
mysql mariadb is slightly worse than postgresql
oracle has kept improving innodb by so much that they declare that it is better than myisam in virtually all situations
innodb scales better than myisam
myisam table is much faster than innodb but no rollback is possible
myisam supports longer rows than innodb does
myisam is more space friendly than innodb you can start with that one
you are right because myisam is really faster than innodb
also note that some mysql engines are faster than others for example myisam may run faster than innodb at expense of the lack of real foreign keys
i have heard that myisam performs better than innodb on read-oriented tables
there may be some exotic corner cases where myisam performs marginally better for certain workloads table-scans or high-volume insert-only work but the default choice should be innodb unless you can prove you have a case that myisam does better
a better solution is not to use myisam for tables where the data is constantly changing - innodb is much more bulletproof and as paul correctly points out you can use transactions on innodb tables but not on myisam
innodb not only has the advantages you list but it is also faster than myisam in many benchmarks
myisam is better for high read volumes innodb for high update volumes due to table vs row locking
if you are not using transactions while storing or updating tables switch table type to myisam its quite faster than innodb with much less overhead
innodb is more strict in data integrity while myisam is not as
myisam is faster for certain queries and supports fulltext and spatial indexes while innodb is transactional and more concurrent
myisam is not faster than innodb anymore for most types of queries
innodb has better crash recovery while myisam is poor at recovering
often myisam is fine in certain other cases innodb is better
innodb tables are about 4x bigger than their myisam counterparts
edited to add myisam is faster than innodb because it is simpler
myisam is the perfect choice since the database is almost only used for reading and myisam is significantly faster that innodb
firstly i switched from innodb to myisam which is better designed for mysql spatial extensions
the lone exception is myisam which is an older mysql storage engine which does not support transactions is more prone to corruption and generally tends to perform worse than innodb
innodb has better crash recovery while myisam is poor at recovering data integrity at system crashes
in some benchmarks i see that myisam is faster than innodb but seems i have a little improvement
therefore accessing myisam consumes less resources than innodb
innodb is usually much better than myisam at tables being available while insert update and delete are happening because innodb uses row level locking for updates whereas myisam uses table level locking
innodb is slower for read only databases because it has features acid compliant row level locking that myisam leaves out
innodb performance has been improved to the point where it is hard to come up with a benchmark that says myisam is faster
as well i used innodb engine but myisam is better if most of the queries are select and you are not going to do many writes
however innodb tends to be slower as myisam
as you are no doubt aware from your searches innodb is primarily better than myisam for high volume inserts not counting non-comparable features like foreign keys or full text searches which are exclusive to innodb and myisam respectively while myisam is primarily useful for tables which are read more often than they are written to
anyone who thinks myisam is faster is either not tuning innodb correctly or has such small data that who cares
i am not sure if this is no longer true myisam is faster than innodb for reads
myisam has historically been viewed as faster than innodb but for recent versions of innodb that is true for a much much smaller set of use cases
myisam is faster than innodb for reads myth
in innodb the count s when where group by or join is not used execute slower than in myisam because the row count is not stored internally
also i can t see your table engine but myisam is better for full text searching rather than innodb
since myisam is better on selecting while innodb is better on writing
yes it is an old wives tale that myisam is faster than innodb
one thing is that if your inserts are not in the order of increasing primary keys innodb can take a bit longer than myisam
2 - i have read about myisam vs innodb the conclusion for me was that myisam is faster when it comes to read-only whereas innodb is designed for tables that get updated or inserts more frequently
i considered changing them to innodb to make the database 100 the same but then read the myisam is faster
oh and just incase you were thinking innodb is slower than myisam - the myisam implementation i tested was twice as slow in all counts
since you don t do updates i think myisam would be better than innodb in this scenario
it is said that if you have a mostly read based application you should use myisam as it is better than innodb
plus you have to make your tables myisam which is generally less suitable than innodb
myisam delivers better read performance compared to innodb at the cost of being less acid compliant
innodb was faster when data was present already and generally performed better except for hdd-space - myisam is smaller on disk
but innodb has improved dramatically in the past few years and in most cases today innodb performs faster than myisam
have you considered changing to innodb - it has much better concurrency support and in some contexts will run faster than myisam
myisam is more prone to locking problems than innodb i believe
myisam generally performs faster because it lacks certain functions innodb has such as rollback... but it has only table locking
innodb is a safer acid compliant engine with some integrity features that myisam lacks
myisam is slightly faster than innodb and implements the fulltext index which is quite useful for integrating search capabilities
innodb is harder to tune since it has more knobs but a properly tuned innodb system can often have higher throughput than myisam due to better locking and better i o patterns
also mysql version starting from 5.5 - innodb performs faster than myisam
some people have said that for reads myisam is faster but recent improvements in innodb have either alleviated or eradicated this difference
generally speaking innodb is slower than myisam as innodb is atomic while myisam is not
this is a huge performance boost look like myisam is much more quicker for fulltext in mysql than innodb
3 a first of all if you haven t done yet change the storage engine to innodb which has row level locking and in newer versions of mysql has more optimization than myisam has
myisam is still widely used in web applications as it has traditionally been perceived as faster than innodb in situations where most db access is reads
finally even if somehow you could manage myisam to perform better than innodb that doesn t mean innodb is inadecuate at all
after testing it seems that myisam is faster than innodb when using when there is no where clause
first question is it normal that innodb is much slower 7x slower than myisam for such usage
innodb is actually faster than myisam in quite a few cases so it depends on what your application s mix of selects updates concurrent queries indexes buffer configuration etc
but in certain scenarios myisam works better than innodb
innodb is newer while myisam is older
almost always innodb is a better choice than myisam
innodb handles inserts with composite primary keys quicker than myisam
nothing is 100 safe but innodb properly used is a lot safer than myisam against data loss and corruption
now the response i got from my boss is that i need to prove that innodb will run faster than myisam
try using innodb instead of myisam innodb has more optimization tricks for select statements especially if you only select indexed fields
myisam tables have smaller footprints than innodb ones myth
even this blog from 2007 shows benchmark results that innodb is on par with or faster than myisam under most workloads
you insert in there but never select from there as far as i know today myisam is better than innodb in this case
on myisam tables in some cases the subselects tend to be faster than grouping by queries due to the fact that grouping by in myisam is quite expensive due to sorting materialization overhead
please notice that counting with where is not slower with innodb than it would be with myisam
innodb is more complex while myisam is simpler
generally you can have as good performance for reading as in myisam in innodb tables - you just can use count without where clause and you always should have a suitable index for where clauses as in innodb table scan will be slower than in myisam
myisam is actually better than innodb for spatial data btw because it also supports r-tree spatial indexes but not as powerful queries as postgis. if you just need points though innodb or myisam b-trees are adequate
there are several q a for why is innodb much slower than myisam but i could not find any topic for the opposite
i currently have myisam and i would like to stay with it because it had far better performance than innodb in my case but i heard that innodb has acid transactions
with innodb there is less time lost from table locking while myisam is faster in table readings
innodb when tuned well performs better than myisam
you will need about six times less disk space to store and memory to process your dataset compared to innodb or about 2-3 times less than archived myisam
so for such an application is it will innodb be a better choice over myisam
the comment of hanky that linked to myisam versus innodb tells you more about the differences
use myisam usually much faster than innodb if your data base isnt transaction oriented
this also affects how it is stored which leads to myisam being slower than innodb on insert due to myisam requiring a full index re-write on every insertion
myisam is much faster for reads but since it locks the whole table for writes this is where overall throughput drops compared with innodb
innodb implements mvcc multi-versioning concurrency control so locking is much more complex than with myisam
a last suggestion is to convert your db from myisam to innodb but i think this requires some investigation because it not always the case that innodb is faster
sometimes i got asked on some interviews what benefits does innodb have against myisam and when myisam is better than innodb
to answer the real question why is myisam slower than innodb i can t give an authoritative answer
note however that for high traffic websites we do modify the joomla core and we also switch the tables from innodb to myisam regardless what others might think here myisam is much faster than innodb
myisam is better than innodb when you don t need those advanced features and storage speed is more important than other concerns
after all innodb shouldn t be slower than myisam when using count + where but that s exactly what is happening here
it is a massive over simplification in some cases and plain wrong in others to say we know that myisam is faster than innodb
in general is myisam faster than innodb
the script was tested using myisam and it indexes products relatively fast much much faster than innodb
myisam used to be faster years ago but if you use any reasonably current version of innodb then innodb is faster for most workloads
you can also use compression on the tables to keep them smaller but innodb is vastly better than myisam at data integrity
innodb delivered 4.6x higher throughput than myisam while achieving
innodb has a higher resource consumption rates then myisam so keep that in mind
speed does matter here myisam is still slightly faster than innodb especially for reads
the engine is myisam i ve heard people recommend switching to innodb but many others said myisam is faster with large amounts of data in terms of counting and innodb better for safe transactions
i know innodb is heavier than myisam but just how much more
this is one way in which innodb is sometimes better than myisam
therefore innodb can handle higher levels of concurrency better than myisam
i heard correct me if i am wrong that innodb is better for tables that will be updated a lot because of row locking opposed to myisam s table locking
if there are more than one innodb tables that need a composite auto_incrementing primary key add an extra primary key to the myisam table
myisam is more susceptible to data corruption than innodb and usually innodb performs better because it caches both data and indexes
in many discussions and even in mysql documents it has been mentioned that in case of updates innodb performs much better than myisam
postgresql is faster than mysql s innodb
innodb is slower than myisam but in which cases
innodb is relatively newer than myisam and is transaction safe
and now i have learned that innodb uses more memory at-least while reading than myisam engine so i am trying to change the default engine of mysql to use myisam
myisam is faster in data warehousing situations such as full table scan reporting etc.. but innodb can actually be faster in many cases with normal oltp queries
i don t want to use myisam because innodb is more advanced
we know that myisam is faster than innodb when we don t have many concurrent updates inserts
innodb does support transactions and referential integrity but the trade-off is that it is a bit slower than myisam
why is innodb so much slower than myisam in my case
there is a difference between the different storage engines though myisam is faster for a lot of select innodb is faster for a lot of insert update because it uses row locking instead of table locking and the way it handles indexes
innodb is a better choice as myisam is really old engine and would fade away in near future
to our suprise innodb took hours more than myisam
innodb tables are even slower than myisam tables for inserts and the delayed key write option is not available
myisam uses less memory than innodb and the actual data files are often quite a bit larger for innodb
innodb seems slightly faster than myisam but this is really marginal
i heard myisam is faster but others say innodb can be fast also but it takes abit more to optimize it
for an oltp type system innodb is usually more sensible than myisam did you check the contention before trying a different engine
select queries in myisam runs 2x faster then in innodb but the updates and insert queries are much slower in myisam
myisam has some problems with many recordings and other bugs and innodb is now better
during my tests of innodb v myisam i found that when i did resolve any contention issues the innodb model was 40 slower than myisam
furthermore i do not have control over the engine â myisam or innodb innodb performs better due to row based locking instead of table as in case of myisam
innodb provides more complex keys structure than myisam foreign keys and regenerating keys is really slow in innodb
if your database has a large innodb buffer pool and a small key buffer then innodb performance is going to be better than myisam performance especially for large tables
myisam is often faster than innodb but isn t safe to use in a production environment for critical data
innodb is more strict in data integrity while myisam is loose
you can also try using innodb since it s said is better than myisam handling bulk inserts with data already on it
innodb is also being developed more than myisam
while on antiquated hardware myisam was a necessity on modern hardware innodb actually performs better
while the myisam type takes around 10mb average of 15b for each row the innodb type takes more than 30mb average of 44b
most of the literature that says myisam is better faster whatever then innodb is old literature
so that means that in practice an innodb write will take 3 times longer than a myisam write
in this area i think innodb s change buffer does a better job than myisam s do it now
in a thread i came to know that myisam is faster for reads innodb is faster for writes
i know innodb tends to be a bit slower than myisam on counting but this is far too long
myisam inserts are going to be faster than innodb so if you re logging data and retrieving it later that will be a win
innodb is more resistant to table corruption than myisam
3 mysqlhotcopy inly works on myisam tables and in most applications you are better off with innodb
newer versions of mysql 5.5+ have extended innodb to support all the features that were previously only available on myisam such as fulltext and geospatial indexing and innodb performance is usually considerably better than myisam when configured properly
in fact oracle is so sure that innodb is better that they removed myisam from 8.0
myisam also tends to store data in less space than innodb
database performance of the innodb is not necessary faster than the myisam engine
tuning innodb which is the better engine requires adjusting different values than myisam which is often the fast-but-unsafe default
if there are many modifications of the data it s said that innodb works faster because it uses row locking instead of table locking like myisam
myisam for reads may well be faster than innodb
myisam is faster when the query is simple but it s much slower in a high concurrent environment as its table level lock comparing to innodb s row level lock
although 4m isn t that many rows with contention and depending on your structure and database engine it may take a while i think myisam alters take longer than innodb because myisam requires whole table locks and handles concurrency less well
in general it seems as though the concensus is to primarily use innodb but there are still some areas in which myisam is much faster than innodb
someone just told me that innodb is much better than myisam
myisam is faster but does not support the use of transactions like innodb does
as you know myisam table sizes are about three or more times smaller than same innodb tables
and it s rarely faster than innodb since innodb uses row locks and mvcc as opposed to myisam s full-table locks
the trope about myisam being faster than innodb is a holdover from code that was current in the mid-2000 s
innodb doesnt read number of rows from stored cached value like myisam does if column is not null cause innodb is more optimized for writing than reading opposing to myisam
if you use insert and update high performance uses innodb over myisam is better
innodb is slower than myisam for most uses but can perform faster in certain conditions due to a better locking mechanism
innodb is more scalable and myisam doesn t support any of the properties of acid
i am trying to compare the myisam and innodb write read performance but i am suprised that the myisam s read is much more slower than innodb while its write is much more faster this is totally opposite compared to what i have learned
there are other optimizations available but general rule is that innodb will be quicker than myisam is even with table growth
mostly innodb is better choice than a myisam
innodb is more concurrent than myisam since it provides row-level locking
innodb -- more effecient than myisam because of the way the primary key is clustered with the data in innodb
innodb has more overhead but uses row-level locking so that reads and writes can happen concurrently without the problems that myisam s table locking incurs
am i right that innodb is better for frequent concurrent updates and inserts than myisam
innodb shouldn t be much slower than myisam
at the beginning the insert performance of innodb is almost 50 times slower than myisam and tokudb is 40 times slower than myisam
1 in mysql engines myisam is better or innodb
their conclusion innodb has 30 higher performance than myisam on average
