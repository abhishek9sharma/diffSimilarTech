i m new to sever-side programming.some people told me that web.py is more suitable for beginners like me than djangosecond in order to add or update the value of listview in general extends arrayadapter is much easier than implements baseadapter because of arrayadapter support add remove insert method by itselfi recommend to take a look on tastypie which turned out to work even nicer than piston it helps you also with things like versioning your api and mamange multiple endpoints niclyi found jqplot easier to use with more options and better documentation than flot or graphaeli m always having to tune the code for gcc g++ differences - usually the given version of g++ is just more limited in what it allowsthere is icefaces which provides more semantic support than richfaces .also you can try nitobi suite which also provides similar kinda solution.if you are not satisfied with any of these i suggest try to write your own part extending the sun facesoverriding equals and gethashcode gives it better meaningsince spsite takes a longer url you may also be able to open the right spweb as well using site.openwebalso in my experience at least settimeout offers a much more aesthetic experience than setinterval or requestanimationframethe gles recording examples uses mediacodec rather than mediarecorder but the idea is the same and it should be much simpler with mediarecorderlingpipe probably also has something built in but nltk is much easier to usebut as well as infobright if you re going commercial then checkout vectorwise it s quicker and similar pricedi ended up using gulp-ruby-sass that while is a bit slower than gulp-sass is rich with features such as loadpaththen when you extract the keys of each object you can compare using _.isequal function by provided by lodash instead of underscore.js usually lodash has better performanceif the list is populated all at once from sorted data sortedlist is faster than sorteddictionaryhowever the transition from the initial touchesbegan event to the first touchesmoved is less obvious sometimes the device waits a whileone advantage of this approach over using a larger than 32-bit unsigned integer for the calculation is that it can be extended to work with bigger integersâ â â with 64-bit integers and uintmax_t integers â â by changing the constant from uint32_max to uint64_max or uintmax_maxalthough build.gradle has a higher priority so the value in androidmanifest.xml will be ignored by gradlew while building your applicationyou can use a similar but perhaps slightly better path with pdfrw -- you can run pdfrw in conjunction with reportlab and import the pdf you exported from pydot and use it as a form xobject similar to an image on the reportlab canvasaggregate-functions is more general version of sumwhen you put images into hdpi folder their appearance is smaller than from mdpi and ldpiyou will need more include paths in here if you are dependent on more than just qtcore and qtgui but i just put those too for simplicityyou can also upgrade to django development versioning it has more versatile list_filter implementation see which can be used for providing advanced admin filters including or-queriesaccording to this answer the isotope plugin might work better than masonry for media-queried resizesplease consider also to use xtend for code generation that s much nicer than stringtemplate and integrates smoothly with xtext infrastructurewel i have used both orika and dozer i can say orika is at least 10 times faster than dozer in my project after the replacementwhile i haven t used nscollectionview myself my gut feeling is that there s probably going to be a greater overhead with numerous nsview s compared to ikimagebrowserview which uses the standard coupling of an nsview with an nscell -like reusable drawing mechanism to help improve performanceit d be really nice if scala-ide supported tighter integration with sbtthe draggable is covering more than one droppable element and at this point there are multiple event.target.id s being coveredkibana focuses more on logs and adhoc search while grafana focuses more on creating dashboards for visualizing time series dataif you are decoding some formatted file rather than something like a programming language attoparsec or similar might be better than parsec or uu-parsinglibsee the solution of how do i make apps smaller with qmake and macdeployqt on how to do thisthe number of requests orientdb could serve is consistently 3 to 5 times lower than neo4jother useful pieces would be jdbi for database access much simpler than hibernate or other full orms async-httpclient for doing calls to other web servicesalso vert.x has little bit better benchmarks than nettyliquibase seems to have everything flyway has and more flexibility when it comes to rollbacksi ve also noticed that qtwebengine is significantly faster and more stable that the old qtwebkit based widgetsbut i get compiler warning c4309 truncation of constant value in vc++ 2010 whenever the argument to put is greater than 0x7fignoring the cost of providing sorted input the oh of sortedlist is smaller than the oh of sorteddictionaryhowever a linkedhashmap is faster as seen here treemap has o log n performance for containskey get put and remove according to the javadocs while linkedhashmap is o 1 for each.because most of the case zero-altitude distance is quite larger than altitude itself so normally you can ignore altitudethe second way i thought is testing for icollection instead of ienumerable since ienumerable is more of a potential collection than an actual oneas far as i can tell qt-designer is more powerful than any wxpython counterpart like boa constructor and pygladeit is said that phpquery is often faster than querypath because of fewer overall featuresqvector will usually give better performance than qlist because qvector always stores its items sequentially in memory where qlist will allocate its items on the heap unless sizeof t sizeof void and t has been declared to be either a q_movable_type or a q_primitive_type using q_declare_typeinfobtw for extra credit if you are using ios 3.2 or 4.0 or later use the uipangesturerecognizer class to handle the drag and drop logic - the drag and drop motion is a lot smoother than overriding touchesbegan touchesmoved touchesended .i d say that pyglet is actually more evolved than pyopenglwebclient is sometimes easier to use than webrequesti recommend you not to use grouplayout is really hard instead of you can try to use gridbaglayout it s simplieri haven t used parse.com but i think firebase is easier for a beginneralternatively use the java.time classes if you re using java 8 or joda time otherwise - both are much better options than java.util.date and java.util.calendarso if the gtk scrolledwindow is smaller than the gtk drawingarea inside it the scrolled window should change to scrollable - but the problem is that it does not workit is similar in spirit to keras which is built as a high-level api on top of theano tensorflow cntk although the main difference is that lasagne implements only one backend allowing it to integrate more deeply with theano featuresfor those commenting that cstdio is obsolete personally i like it more than iostreamhowever vim comes by default with another plugin which does a lot more than nerdtree called netrw help netrwaside you should probably look into using a jslider which seems more natural than using a jscrollbar for value adjustmenti m more familiar with easymock than mockito so i had to do a little diggingthe thing is like ratingbar is smaller than the textview i don t get a correct aligmenti have to convert the qstring of the file s contents to qbytearray in

adams iboutlet and ibaction is nothing more than a void typedef and will only be used by compilerfor academic documents you may use restructuredtext or asciidoc which offers more features than markdowni have created a php form with multiple checkbox and there is a script that controls if the sum sum of all checkbox values is greater than a specific number.if yes a sweetalert box appears.the problem is that when i click the ok button on the sweetalert i want to remove the last checked attribute and to remove that value from the sum to execute the script again and display the right results.i cannot figure this out..any ideas will be helpfulhttp 2 is even better than spdy and check this article for a use case regarding spdyor would a tool like typemock be better suited than moq in this caseunfortunately qtwebengine has much worse and poorer integration with the rest of qt facilities than qtwebkitor switch from org.json to something that performs better such as gson or jacksonwhen things get complex an autoresetevent or manualresetevent is usually more sensible as they are less time critical you get through the gate regardless of orderingnotepad++ which is often recommended are even more broken than sublimetext 2 which i find to be pretty good actuallyalso i tried installing pathogen and that worked for some bundles but would not work for perlomni.vim because it was an ftplugin and pathogen was not appending the bundles correctly and after research i saw most people saying vundle was better than pathogeni can convert full string to upper or lower by using toupper or tolower .but how can i do this.hope your help with this.thank youjsdom jquery offer complete set of tools but cheerio is much fastergethashcode should be a lot quicker than equals but doesn

the efficiency benefit in using switch statements is indeed smaller than in compiled-languagerelevant discussion here as well is fb_graph or koala ruby gem better than facebooker2 using the facebook graphjava seeks to find a compromise between a purely compiled-language with no portability and a purely interpreted-language that is significantly slowerthat s because the multiplication oprator has higher precedence than additioncreating an instance of the namedtuple is easier than creating a dictionaryregarding the padding itâ s more tricky as cryptojs does not list pkcs#5 as supported and java does not list pkcs7 in fact it lists very little so it might be implementation depended which padding algorithms the aes provider supports but at least nopadding is supported by both java and cryptojsi tested orika and it was a lot faster but was slower than dozer with small collectionslinkedhashmap is faster for insertion because it wonâ t have to unnecessarily compare values while inserting like treemap as stated by ejpwell obviously you created an implementation qabstracttablemodel which has a little bit more specialized interface than qabstractitemmodeltried comboboxes with qsqlquerymodel without threading to improve performance but experienced it works much slower than qstandarditemmodel in our project qsqlquerymodel works very fast with such amount of data with qtreeview for exampleinterpreted-language are inherently less performant than compiled-language - c will generally outperform python - some operations more than othersin my experience avassetexportsession is slightly more performant than using avassetreader and avassetwriter for a straight forward format a - format b type conversion however that said it s probably not by enough to be too concerned aboutedit i can only reproduce this error when i have a tabcontrol with more than one tabitemand for rest if you need more than the webclient webrequesti too had a similar requirement initially i used uilabel and then i realized that uitextview is betterin case if updatepanel takes more time to process set asyncpostbacktimeout property of your scriptmanageryes i understand that ienumerable is much more lighter rather than ilist but anyway there is a lot situations where we need to have ilist instead of ienumerable and in this approach we need to cast ienumerable to ilist isn

mendoza commented splitting by s+ instead of would resolve any issue with the number being delimiter by more than one spacesthis isn t entirely scientific but if i set .browser.safari false in safari or google-chrome then .scrollto no longer works on any element with any parametersthe first question is qtablewidget or qtableview which is more suitable for this jobcarnigorm and puremvc are good choices but my personal opinion is that robotlegs is far easier to work withif you have access to lodash or underscore.js it is even easier with pluckyou might have better luck with a uicollectionview instead of a uitableviewnote if you are constantly adding removing items from existingholdings then you could use sorteddictionary which should be faster sortedlist is faster for accessing elements but takes longer adding removingyour use cases are actually much easier than the skip-lists algorithmically because you avoid most needs for varlength paths by keeping the tail to queue cards to the end directlychqrlie has pointed out in the comments that this method could also lead to erroneous comparisons for extremely close dates fractions of a second since if difftime mktime date_1 mktime date_2 is less than 1 in magnitude the value will be converted to 0 upon return thus comparing as equali think you should use gitkraken it will be better than smartgit on ubuntufor my project packery

to usein your viewdidload on the second view or viewwillappear is probably better set the background image to the image you put in the propertyalso consider using uilabel instead of uitextview if you don t need to edit information inside since uitextview take longer to allocate and init and are generally slower than uilabelthis one is more promising than revmob because banner positioning and event callbacks appear to be possible but due to marmalade and cocos2d-x s gl conflicts this might turn out to be just as bad a solution as iwgameadsbut if you will look at the accuracy level stanford-nlp have more accurate detection than opennlpsecondly i did not use ienumerable because it is more generic than icollection and does not even have simple properties like countwriting in a compiled-language java or c++ in your examples would almost certainly give better performance than an interpreted-language like phphistory.js does everything pjax does and better so no need to mix the twoif you get curious and discover the putimagedata function in the canvas 2d api please note that drawimage is much faster which might be unintuitiveif you re open to using lodash which is a better version of underscore.js imo this can be expressed fairly simply using flattendeep on each element of your multi-dimensional arrayone step up from that would be using the ccurl couchdb cloudant curl tool that wraps your curl statements to cloudant and makes them less verbosethe ardalahmet solution is not the right one if you need different backgrounds for each uinavigationbar when you have more

user-agent string by defaultthere may be some exotic corner cases where myisam performs marginally better for certain workloads table-scans or high-volume insert-only work but the default choice should be innodb unless you can prove you have a case that myisam does betterember.js would make things even simpler than backbone.jsif that doesn t work i ve had better luck with gulp-sass and gulp-sourcemapsgiven that this is 4 years old and lodash has more or less taken the place of underscore.js i thought i would share this solution using lodashafter googling i found that we can t add images on more tab in uitabbarcontroller because more tab is automatically displayed by uitabbarcontroller when uitabbaritem is more then 5the easiest solution is to just replace underscore.js with lodash which has even more features than the latest underscore.jsnotice my use of illegalargumentexception instead of nullpointerexception - the illegalargumentexception is more in line with what you re hoping to achievethis is important because if the int needs more precsion than 52-bits the precision is too low for a doubleif you want to use a continuous gesture that tracks the user s finger you can use uipangesturerecognizer rather than uiswipegesturerecognizer and i think animatewithduration is better than catransition in that casebut the post method okhttp is more slower than httpclient s

the endian conversion functions you could use the qdatastream functionality with any qiodevice which is much easier and more intuitive in my opinionmockito has been around a lot longer than scalamock and is much more actively maintained because of it s much larger contributor basei ve used both uploadify and plupload both are nice plupload has more bells and whistles though and has things like html 5 drag drop from desktop supportedalthough it depends on your project size and requriments i recommend devxpress and telerik web windows .i ve used componentart telerik devxpress and i think telerik is better if u are developing web applications.and devxpress are better in winforms.by the way while developing in some cases i came across especially performance problems in telerik products.nevertheless telerik is good choice for web developmentat the qualities i m recording 720p or 1080p the file size of an hevc-encoded video should be 40-60 of an identical h.264-encoded video

subset-sum problem is hard more precisely it s np-complete which means that your variant is hard too it s not np-complete because it s not a decision problem but it is np-hardcrfsuite is faster than crf++ and it can deal with a huge training dataunfortunately i m pretty sure you ll not find any packages or projects that migrates a joomla web site to laravel or maybe codeigniter which is much older than laravelby default when you scale a qgraphicsscene larger than the qgraphicsview in which it is displayed it will show the necessary scroll barsyou will probably find that bitvector performs

pointthe only solution i have found is to restart emacs aquamacs which is obviously less than idealboth a renderscript and opengl are used for getting high performance graphics and animation s.but still opengl is the best option to get high performance graphics because it is well documented and you will have more control over the glsurfaceview .but in renderscript some of the classes are depreciated in the current versions .its almost not possible to make a rssurfaceview to transparenti double checked the build.gradle s and synced the gradlew files once morebut on the other hand

that s ok but when drag apperas the listboxitem becomes wider and move other items it s not oki have seen a lot of post where they are claiming that ember.js is much better than sproutcore but looking at the differences i have seen that the widget support is not there in ember.jsavcapturesession is far more rudimentary compared to avaudiorecorder - it does not provide any recording facilities by itself for example and so if you wanted to also record the audio you would need to use an avassetwriter to save the sampleswhile smartgwt has much more sophisticated widgets than gwt you still can t use uibinder in conjunction with it which is why i rejected using smartgwti have had issues with dynamically created nodes that use filters and animatemotion has been a bugged in google-chrome for way too long... we use ff5+ as our interactive interfaces for this reason safari is getting better toothe other question why not use a concurrenthashmap here since it will provide some concurrent writes to different mapentries and provide more concurrency than readwritelockhowever the qwidget gauge1 is always bigger than the other one.i want to use a qgridlayout because the application has to work on

teststhe -match operation removes those lines that don t start with an sha1 hash and the -replace operation collapses adjacent spaces into a single delimiter so that convertfrom-csv won t create empty fields when there is more than 1 spaces in a rowi think jedit is equal to or better than notepad++instead of hooking into keypress events and such perhaps working with the built-in events like onpause onstart ondestroy etc is more suited to your needsdbcontext is much simpler to use than objectcontext and will serve the most common development needsnote using treeset instead of hashset would give directly sorted arraylist and above collections.sort could be skipped but treeset is otherwise less efficent so it s often better and rarely worse to use hashset even when sorting is neededliblinear

features of the underlying webrequestso every multiplicative-expression is an additive-expression but not vice-versa and this is what makes multiplication bind tighter than additiontornadoweb and nginx are popular web servers for the moment and many benchmarkings show that they have a better performance than apache under certain circumstancesa way with a partialfunction and implicit which looks more like your mapfirstnot many layout problems can t be conquered using it and its easy to understand as opposed to springlayout groupedlayout etc and far less code and more robust than gridbaglayoutthe reason for this is that and is strong than or it s like in math where multiplication is stronger than addition 3 5+3 15+3 18well jspm is much larger and ambitious project than bowerboxlayout is far easier than gridbaglayout because you don t have to learn how to specify constraintsi read in couple of blogs that in java modulo reminder operator is slower than bitwise-anda better way to do that instead is taking in an ienumerable which is more generic than icollection since icollection implements ienumerable and simply checking it for null and else returning any from linq s operatorsa key-stretching algorithm like pbkdf2 applies a quicker hash like sha512 thousands of times typically causing the hash generation to take 1 5 of a second or sogo to your user directory c profiles youruser there should be a folder called .m2 may be hiddenthus write-heavy data structures are probably better implemented mutably and with something like a skip-lists where you

applicationâ s uiwindow only one of these will get the messages for changes in orientationilist is stronger in that it makes more guarantees than ienumerablei am using calayer s because as suggested in documentation calayer s are lighter than uiview and i have hundreds of themfragment primary support more dynamic large ui screens like tablet.because tablet screens is much larger than normal handsettheano is still faster than tensorflow in many respects and supports a wider range of operationsunfortunately i dont understand what you mean by stating ratingbar is smaller than textviewqvector is better than qlist in this case because it s easy to resize itin my testing the slow-down from using tensorflow ranges from about 1.5-3.0 times slower than using theano but its performance will depend on your applicationuse a singletable strategy and if you thing one of the subclassing has more number of fields and need a separate table then mark that subclassing as a secondarytable using secondarytable annotation and use primarykeyjoin there is an annotation for this to join with superclass on pk columnso i went with the alternative approach of using subclasses for uitabbarcontroller and uinavigationcontroller which feels much cleaner and only slightly more verbosei have read many times that one may not use more than one objectoutputstream or objectinputstreamif you re interesting in reducing the size of the resulting cookies you should consider using ecdsa rather than rsa to produce the signatures - ecdsa signatures are considerably smaller than rsa signatures of an equivalent security factorso intutively it appears that to explain the variance we should go for mixture of more than two poisson distributionyou may also find that opencover will work better than partcover as it has 32 and 64 bit support as well as supporting .net2 and .net4 - and copes much better with target processes that spin off more processes to do the actual testingaside from obejctive-c convention and best practices nserror is much more robust and flexibly than nsexception and allows the caller to effectively ignore the problem if they want toas hroptatyr mentioned the multiplication is quite fast and it s much faster than divisionas you can see the keyup events of numpad5 and numpad6 occured earlier than their keydown eventsince ireadwrite implements ireadonly ireadwrite is said to be a subclassing of ireadonly although subclassing is more accurately used to describe a class which inherited a base class rather then implements an interface--for the sake of simplicity they are very nearly the same conceptwith really basic calls to the database iqueryable is way quicker but when do i need to think about using an ienumerable in its placein java-8 permgen was replaced with metaspace which is more flexible in terms of memory usage so you rarely need to tune its size explicitlyother then hiccup and enlive there is the lesser known fleet which is closer to popular ruby php solutionscompared to ienumerable and icollection ilist performs much better for large or dynamic lists because it provides an indexer allowing us quick random accessin the above example the instance of exprbinopadd is a child of the instance of exprbinopmul although precedence of multiplying is higher than precedence of add which results from the

uicollectionview or uitableview but you have to decide what fits better on your app needsin my opinion using isnull nullif is faster than using case whenwith caliburn it is even easier since you just

qlistwidgetsproutcore makes use of bindings better than cappuccino currently doesthe team behind protovis has since created d3.js so this is likely a better option than protovisi think the problem happened because the padding left right of uitextview is bigger than uilabelthe problem is that to do so you need to use objectcontext instead of dbcontext which makes things harderi think it is older than the uicollectionview and therfore explains it for uitableviewlately i have used notepad++ a bit more than vimi m new to protovis although it is no longer under development and d3.js is the newer

packagesyou could put a smaller uiview as subviews of your selectionview and change tha background color of that viewi think the preview function in openkm is more well than alfrescothis one is more for bigloo - is it more functional than eclthe posts you see seem to be logical as jsr286 is a newer spec and there are some features that make jsr268 portlet not a jsr168 portletthe union all with a distinct gives better performance though i believe..in specific i would like the uinavigationbar in the uitabbarcontroller s more view controller to be an instance of my classusually better than filewriter already suggested is to use fileoutputstream which also like filewriter has an append parameter in one of its constructors and which unlike filewriter does not silently assume the default charset encoding slightly bad practice imomy only problem is that is seems that using uicollectionview is a better approach and i have read some seemingly off-hand comments about icarousel being a poor approachin fact each uiview has even more than 1 corresponding calayer2 if your host machine laptop doesn t have more ram then you might want to find alternative android-emulator like genymotion bluestacks which takes less memory than android-emulatormy understanding is that although dbcontext is newer it s not necessarily better than objectcontext it just provides a different api that might be considered simpler but doesn t that depend on the use casebased on the output in this example one conflict is that datalab currently has oauth2client version 1.4.12 installed and the google-api-python-client library requires a version of oauth2client that is greater than or equal to 2.0.0having different ones based upon screens size is reasonable bigger margins on tablet though the mix then would be something like res values dimens.xml and res values-sw720dp values.xmlthis is better than normal findviewbyid because the views are create on compilation and are injected automatically inside the activity at oncreate being way more efficient than your standard initializationthe basic one and i think the simplest is okhttp but you have to understand that okhttp is no more supported but still work when you downgrade your sdkversion the best solution is to use volley or retrofiti have simplified the app so the post is shorter but the basic problem is that if i get test in workouthandler - it cannot recognize methods in wardenstrategies or loginhelper unless i also include those files in the handler they are already included in app.rbi would say behat + mink is more useful for that purposeps i d suggest using lodash instead of underscore.js if possible as lodash development is more active but that s my opinioni d say iqueryable is more suitable for interaction with a database than ienumerable ismy speed test claims that svg is significantly faster than canvas at least snap.svg seems to be significantly faster than fabricjsshellcheck tends to be more explicit than bashin my fragments data handling is taking place starting from oncreate which happens earlier than onstartupdate for our purposes bltoolkit ended up being a better solution than nhibernatewhen i expand the widgets on the left pane by clicking on the controls and the height of the qwidget of the qscrollarea is bigger than then height of the qscrollarea itself the scrollbar appears as expected but it s overlapping the content of the qscrollareathere are many reasons why git-svn is worse and the kde svn2git is superiorpossibly part of the reason of my problems is that the original code from ramnath uses rmaps while i m using rcharts also developed by ramnath as it is more developed better integrated with shiny and of course includes leafletcan anyone explain why heapsort performs better and under what circumstances quichesort would be better than both quicksort and heapsortas of now i think dotcover and resharper combined are less expensive than ncoveror if you feel more comfortable with webclient i personnally prefer it over webrequestdotnetzip is much easier to use than sharpziplib example of zipping all files in folderjanusgraph is a more up-to-date version of titan despite the low version numberbellman-ford as suggested in your question tends to be slower than either dijkstra s or a - it is primarily used when there are negative edge-weights which there are not heremmmm graphicsmagick is somewhat less developed than imagemagick in many respectsyou are better off with jacoco than coberturagrafana is more of visualization only while kibana is for searching the logs is that rightif you still would love to manage onclicklistener i will tell why onitemclicklistener is much better than onclicklistenerkif makes ui testing really easy and useful with lots of great apis that are less complex than xctestfor listening changes into jtextcomponent is there documentlistener if you have to need control over inputed char sings whitespace chars or word s you have to implements documentfilterstargazer is at least in my experience more general than latex from hmiscedit h.265 hevc is even better at compression 50 of h.264 size in some cases but support is not yet widespread so stick with h.264 for nowalso linearsvc class from scikit-learn performs even better than liblinear whch is also surprising considering that it s a wrapper of liblinearsdwebimage claims that afnetworking doesn t cache the image itself but just the http response so sdwebimage is faster in recalling the image from cache and presenting itin this case i used one or more spaces as a delimiter s+the description is related to objectcontext api but dbcontext api is just wrapper suffering same issues actually dbcontext api suffers even more issues in this scenario and because of that i will skip solution with manually setting relationshipsfor example setting the background-color on a transparency element turns it black...rather than the intended color.i haven t played around with it recently but i think bcolz is more flexible here in terms of mixing dtypes but doesn t give you all the pandas dataframe conveniences obviouslyi did a lot of research and most people said that split is better than stringtokenizer and bufferedreadermoles is more often compared contrasted to typemock in that it offers a set of facilities outside of moq and or rhinomocks sweet spotin xda-forums i read about memu - most powerful android-emulator for pc better than bluestacksthan use bcpow on the integer part and bc_exp on the fractions part which now converges from the get-go since the fractions part is smaller than 1here is the blog post about the comparison how tidekit would be better than tidesdklike bruz says cappuccino is probably more freeform at the data layer than sproutcorefor a few bytes passed in just one call probably the bufferedwriter is even worse because it problably later calls fileoutputstreamsorteddictionary offers same advantages than sortedlist but performs better if values to insert are not already sortednaturally interpreted-language will run slower than compiled-language as compiled code can be ran blindly by the cpu where as compiled code needs to be checked ran line by linei have read about ienumerable and iqueryable i have read that iqueryable is better with linq because when you use where clauses it creates the exact query it needs but with ienumerable it retrieves all rows from database and then filters on memory3c why does my uiviewcontroller which is inside my uinavigationcontroller has a longer height than the uinavigationcontrolleri had the same problem with jsdom and switcht to cheerio which is much faster than jsdom and works even after scanning hundreds of sitesfor instance for this really_trivial class i just assume that move semantics cannot offer anything more than return-value-optimization and nrvo already does when copying around instances of iti know summernote does that but fckeditor is a more complete tool than summernote so i cant switch to thattextcontainer s height need to be set depending on the content height for it to work and that is no better than using uitextview or uilabelevidently though mod-alias can be somewhat faster than mod-rewrite all other things being equal of courselubridate is another package from the tidyverse it makes easier work with dates and timesthe division has higher precedence than the addition so what you re calculating is sumaverage1+ sumaverage2 5 which is integer division which is probably not what you wantuse .val and .keyup using keydown doesn t register the newest value it registers the value before so keyup is better to use for thisi was thinking of using the accounts app but django-userena seems better so i created a project zero with pinax and tried to integrate django-userena with iti think a tool like lodash or underscore.js is more suited for something of this natureyou may also want to consider exploring the stringi package which has a similar approach to stringr but has more flexible functionsi don t quite understand why you don t want to use mapply but do.call is probably better anywaysafari comes in at just under 41ms performing better than google-chrome but still not greatthe qtablewidget is slightly easier to implement than the qtableview which also needs a qtablemodel as backend but it has less capabilitiesusing a-star instead of brute force pathfinding will be faster just like how bresenham circles are better than using sin costhe documentation for deactivate method for nsapplication says that i shouldn t call this method directly since appkit knows better how to deactivate stuffthe reason for using this vs .nets jpeg encoder decoder is vastly greater quality and speed is essential and other libraries such as bitmiracles .net jpeg library is tremendously slow even after i added some unsafe code to speed up sections of the library such as reading in the bitmap datai use quadtree more than r-tree and find them super flexiblethis is perhaps a bit cleaner with a setinterval instead of a clearintervalmoreover when .preview div has in a way bigger width than height .page should take heiht as a standart to prevent overflow like youtube player does for examplesorted vector resizable array if getrandom is much more frequent than get putnltk is shy of stanford-nlp in terms of quality of output and for everything other than statistical collocation analysis as far as i can tell stanford-nlp has a broader range of practical algorithmstechnically you can do it dynamically but that would require doing the registration unregistration somewhere more permanent than onresume onpause which i don t think is really what you want.or even easier rather than adding uilabel objects to a uiscrollview you could just use a uitextviewit will wrap the original stream in a bufferedoutputstream which is more efficient which is then wrapped into a dataoutputstream which offers additional nice features like writeint writelong and so oni think datatrigger instead of eventtrigger is more suitable and you need to use x type to specify the bound data to the itemmy understanding is the requestfactory is more efficient and recommended over gwt-rpc but it s more of a data entity persistence framework than a request-response framework like rpcsimilarly you might find using jacoco easier than coberturaglut is much more easier while many of people use sdl or sfml they re more flexible and feature-full than glutienumerable is less specific than ilist ilist implements ienumerable so unless you want something specific from ilist such as .count as you suggest or perhaps add delete etc i d use ienumerablethe result is okay but it is slow.is there any way that i can do this with loops instead of arrayfun because i check for-loop is faster than arrayfunit is scaling the image to it s width but since it s height is greater it is showing the rest of the uiimageview as transparent what you would expect from uiviewcontentmodescaleaspectfit which is what the uiimageview s contentmode is set toso i switched to qgraphicsscene qgraphicsview that seems much simpler to use with animationsfinally if soappy just isn t working for you try suds it s better documented than soappye.g. break with labels as in java or even a more generic goto. continue does not seem more special than other control-structure mechanisms except that it is present in more languagescommon lisp is a weakly functional mixed-paradigm language and scheme is more strongly functional but still not purethe result amazed me in the way that as loops goes over bigger range the performance of c# decreases as compared to c..for smaller range c# shown well performance over c....but as upper range of for-loop increases the c# performance degrades as compare to c..or will every commit pull push takes a longer time as changetsets count increaseputting it in the jar file among the classes or adding its jar-relative path to the class-path entry of the jar s manifest.mf file is more than sufficientmy team is more experienced with api.ai and only starting to learn luisi believe lodash is a better choice over underscore.js more details in this blog postldpi assets will look bad on high density screens but are exponentially smaller than mdpi which is exponentially smaller than hdpi etci am interested in this because the factor oracle is easy to construct with 30 lines of c++ suffix-array needs about 60 and suffix-tree needs 150 and it runs faster than suffix-array and suffix-treeedit this is why autoresetevent does not have a slim version - basically it s because the wait times of autoresetevent are typically longer than manualresetevent so it isn t appropriate to use busy spinninga more lightweight approach than pandas is to use the prettytable moduleor is the do.call with by just typically much slower than tapplynote that mongoose-auth is built on everyauth and they will work fine but i like the flexibility of the strategies concept from passport and the express integration is betteranswering your question a chars is an integer-type of lower rank than int meaning potentially and in practice nearly guaranteed smaller size and value-range and thus pointers to either are different types toosince the parent #wr has more children #con_bottom does not fiti have used restsharp before but refit is alot easier to get runningthanks mikushi for the comment another possibility that i haven t used much is the the xhprof extension it also helps with profiling can generate callgraphs -- but is lighter than xdebug which mean you should be able to install it on a production serveri didn t try it because i m more familiar with kivy s internals and because my end goal was more of a kivy app containing vispy visualisations rather than the other way aroundi can switching between these two screens easily.at the beginning first screens is fully displayed.when i click a button second screens will come from right and first screens goes to the left.but i want to keep the second screens and remember..second screens has less width a portion of the first screen.that means a half of the first screens disappearsudo is better in most respects but still requires a passwd which asroot does notnow the speed of sql server interaction with r has affected because rjdbc is slower than rodbc but its not too badyou d be doing this much easier with domdocument and domxpath instead which works as you d expectmy personal preference is to call setcontentview immediately after super.oncreate so that i know the rest of the oncreate method is less likely to breakhowever the method that returns iqueryable takes 15 seconds while the ienumerable takes less than a secondhowever lately i ve been using tooltipster instead because its integration with jquery validate is somewhat cleanerthis is pretty much the ifloop answer but isnull is slightly faster than coalescei am stunned right now seeing a lodash performing 100-150 faster than underscore.js in even simple native functions such as array.every in chromethere is a very good linq video that i enjoy a lot- it hits more than just ienumerable v iqueryable but it really has some fantastic insightthe system will pick the closest match and mdpi is closer to hdpi than to xxhdpimergesort may use more space than quicksort i m not entirely sure and merge may be better for linkedliststhe problem is that the canvas drawn by cairo is larger than the area of gtk s scrolled_windowcoq is probably the most prominent language of the style but agda has a more haskell-y feel as well as being written in haskell itselfit would be somewhat easier with imagemagick than graphicsmagick as anthony thyssen has put together some excellent examples - but they rely on imagemagick capabilities such as aside-processing in parentheses which graphicsmagick lacksedit .net servicemodel.syndication - changing encoding on rss feed this is a better waythe reason why this doesn t work specifically is because ilist is more specialized than ienumerablefortunately model-glue has tight integration with coldspring a popular bean container for cfml and model-glue 3 makes it easier than ever to use coldspring beans in your controllersi know another plugin named jquery corner is available however it s file size being massively bigger than curvycorners i decided to with curvycornersin arithmetic books and computer software and more-expensive calculators this means 12+ 34 56 not 12+34 56 because multiplication has higher precedence than additionin this case jackson performs better than nashorn which performs much better than org.jsonsome don t take too well to added components for example grouplayout while others do better such as boxlayoutfleet docs say fleet is no longer actively developed or maintained by coreos and link to container orchestration moving from fleet to kubernetessorteddictionary has faster insertion and removal operations for unsorted data o log n as opposed to o n for sortedlisthave a look at sift and surf and at vlfeat which has a good sift implementation and also implements mser and hog and is much smaller than opencvi m trying to push a view controller from a tableview displayed inside a uiviewcontroller that is included in a uitabbarcontroller it s more simple that it looks...i heard geda was faster than both dozer and orika but my only concern is i am not sure if it can be abstracted like dozer and orika as shown in the pseudocode abovean activity that uses fragments is often little more than oncreate calling setcontentviewthe binary-min-heap you have implemented only guarantees that the parent of two children is smaller than both children as chtz has commentedyou can make your life easier by using fputcsv and fgetcsvcan someone if i should use the avfoundation or whether the audiotoolbox library is betterqmainwindow is basically same as qwidget when used as a guess what main window the noticeable difference is that qwidget expects you to have only 1 window in ur application while qmainwindow is more about serving as the most important window which will control all the rest like alert message boxes for exampleit s no more multiplication than addition so is misleading syntax.rjdbc may also be a more stable option in the linux environment especially now that the fetch code has been re-written in java as of development release 0.2-0 on r-forge its performance is on par with if not better than rodbcinstead methods like .live or .on since the former is deprecated are more useful with mouse and keyboard events generally speakingi chose to rely only on pycrypto and pyopenssl since m2crypto is less popular and not well-maintained which is a hazard from both compatibility pypy and security perspectives.net makes this better by separating nullreferenceexception you dereferenced a null value from argumentnullexception you shouldn t have passed in null as an argument - and it was for this parameterfastcgi++ is everything i could hope for for the ajax demands but it doesn t have websockets and i chose websocket++ over libwebsockets since websocket++ is more or less a simple #include so i assumed that i could incorporate it into fastcgi++for example if i click the smaller tabitem the tabcontrol becomes smaller and if i select the bigger one it becomes biggeralthough madprogrammers comment to use a gridbaglayout is an easier solution but knowing about glue and struts can be helpful for customizing the layout of a boxlayoutby looking at the google groups for qjplot and flot the support for jqplot is better lot s of unanswered questions at the flot groupi ve used both robospice is more robust but ion is easier on the eyesif you need more than a simple method call you could just as well create a more elaborate clicklistener implementation that has more than the buttonclick methodyou see there are many reasons why git-svn is worse and the kde svn2git is superiori have been using asihttprequest but it seems to be deprecated and i read that restkit is the newer libraryrunning with azure batch is also an option as the .net will work well and azure batch is cheaper if the custom activity is the only reason for having a hdinsight clusterthat s hard to say.the worst of mergesort is n log2n -n+1 which is accurate if n equals 2 k i have already proved this .and for any n it s between n lg n - n + 1 and n lg n + n + o lg n .but for quicksort its best is nlog2n also n equals 2 k .if you divide mergesort by quicksort it equals one when n is infinite.so it s as if the worst case of mergesort is better than the best case of quicksort why do we use quicksortsince bootstrap-datetimepicker use momentjs it is better to use localized formats from the official documentationis there a more straightforward solution with scalaz maybe with an existing combinatorsunlike the ng-view it s possible that there are more than one ng-controller in the same pagesame effect but this approach is less verbose unlike in case of gridbaglayout and i personally think that miglayout is easier to usenumbers less than zero however you might use the more descriptive negative-number tagjasmine is clearly more bdd focused than qunit although i could see doing bdd with qunit by describing the tests in a behavior-oriented wayedit 31 march 2014 for what it s worth i have found that pdfbox is much better at text extraction than itextsharp notwithstanding a bespoke strategy implementation and pdflib tet is slightly better than pdfbox but it s quite expensiveposting qevents to qobject is faster than using signal-slot invocations because there are no copy constructors called and there s no marshalling done except directly by you upon construction of a qeventalthough jackson s nexttoken will work like skipvalue gson seems more flexible to meif you want to bridge guice and hk2 it s little more complicatedjqplot is free in my opinion has better chart than flot it doesnâ t have eventsin portrait mode your phone screens is smaller than that so screen_is_narrow is true whereas in landscape mode and on tablet it is wider and thus screen_is_narrow becomes falsewe started experimenting with hapijs on smaller services and kind of like it more than expressi know this does not answer your core question why avx is slower but since your ultimate goal is fast popcount the avx - sse comparison is irrelevant as both are inferior to the builtin popcountfrom what i have read the dbcontext is a simplified version of the objectcontext and makes it easier to work withsubclassing collections is dangerous because for example you don t know whether or not addall delegates to add inside the superclass this is explained further in effective java p.71what i know is using iqueryable is better than ienumerable if another query is going to be performedsince a war folder necessarily precedes the creation of a .war archive since a .war archive is simply a zipped up war directory obtaining the war directory is provably easier than obtaining a .war filewhile relational-model can express any finite set of facts since it s equivalent to first-order logic the entity-relationship-model is more limitedi don t see any reason why filechannel could be any faster than fileoutputstream in this casefirst of all qglwidget does everything glut does plus moreinherited is more of an is-a relationship for example a usermodel is-a model thus all properties and methods of a model will be part of a usermodelinstead doing it with lxml which i found to be the fastest somehow even faster than celementtreeit has support for tokenizing lemmatizing

from time to time we have requests that fail with express checkout payerid is missingthat being said a compiled-language like c will almost always be faster than an interpreted-language like javascriptalso as stated by martijn pieters using super super .__str__ is better than doing it the way i did deck.__str__ selffor the record jmock as of today supports more complex scenarios than mockito that s why the initial learning curve is steeperbtw multitasking is really more fast switching than backgrounding in ios.velocity is worse than freemarker and stringtemplate has got its own issuesboth s3 and cloudfront allow domain aliases however cloudfront allows multiple aliases so that d1.mystatics.com d2.mystatics.com and d3.mystatics.com could all point to the same location increasing the capacity for parallel downloads this used to be recommended by google but with the introduction of spdy and http 2 is of lesser importancein choosing heroku is more full-service whereas engineyard is a more traditional service giving you access to boxes but needing sysadmin skillsif you are dealing with docx document docx4j is more convenient than apache-poiqtreeview is known for being slower than a qtableview and consume a lot of memory and you are using a plain table model anyways so try with a qtableviewcompareto defines whether your base student is greater than less than or equals to your studenttocompare and you can define these with any criteria you pleasethis is a good question but should be formulated a little different in my opinion for example why are interpreted-language slower than compiled-languagei have just spent a lot of time working with tlistview in view style mode vsreport and i find it is even more limited than tstringgrid for example it provides no in-place edit supportis there some alternative to jtextfield jpasswordfield that is more suitable for this jobactionlink helpers is more often used to generate url properly based on the actioncontroller route values etc and anchor tag based on htmlattributes etcalso from your requirements autocompletetextview is more suitable than spinnerthere are many reasons why the dbcontext api is better than the older objectcontext api but in your case it may initially feel like a downgradebut really feel this can be done much cleaner with underscore.js or lodash functional programmingusing svn2git might produce better results than git-svn if you have tags or branches.in jacoco 0.7.9 there are jacoco ant tasks and in 0.8.0 there will be jacoco command line interface - both provide more

hypertable is fasterthis can be a major clock-cycle saver since multiplication is often much faster than a division operationsometimes it s preferable because onload event takes longer to fire then domcontentloadedpbkdf2 is arguably a better option than bcrypt scrypt having been much more thoroughly studied and testedfrom the central authority point of view ecdsa also allows better performance on my pc using a single core openssl crunches out more than 6500 ecdsa signatures per second in the p-192 nist curve and only 1145 rsa signatures per second with a 1024-bit keyhowever i wish to use a custom calayer that uses an internal cggradient for drawing instead as this should produce smoother results than cagradientlayer see herethis is another reason why i d prefer rhinomocks and moq over nmock nmock uses the older expectation style whereas rhinomocks and moq both support the arrange act assert approach where you specify you expected interactions as assertions at the end of the test like thisif that is so you might find that timsort runs faster than quicksorti can make this happen with the minimal project where oncreate does nothing more than call super and setcontentviewimo startapp is better than admob especially when using their interstitial adsdivision is faster for unint8 than multiplication in your caselittle bit cleaner than ng-hide ng-show which sets display none to the extra header every timeyou can use a bezier path either in a custom uiview w drawrect or easier with a cashapelayer whose curvature can be controlled via its control pointssounds like you want to use some of the inherited uicontrol methods such as sendaction to forevent this offers even finer control than with uibuttonas a concrete example this boxlayout example is better done using grouplayout illustrated here and herestart with pdfbox as it s text extraction abilities are better than itext sthe error you are getting happens everytime you have more than one qapplication or qcoreapplicationyou can also apply almost arbitrary transformations using .apply and .transform methods although in-built methods like mean std min max is much more efficient as they are optimiseddotnetzip offers native support and has a quite friendly api and is my opinion more flexible than sharpzipliba negative verticalaccuracy signifies that altitude is invalid whereas normally a smaller but positive value of verticalaccuracy actually means that altitude is more precise since it s the vertical distance that it may be off by - i ll leave the discussion as to why this measure is called verticalaccuracy and not verticalinaccuracy for some other timealternatively can i use something far way better and way more secure by using ucma or ucwa or any other api.from my own experience mtl4 is much faster than ublas and it is also faster than eigeni have heard that configobj is easier to use than configparser even though it is not a built-in librarykdtree needs less memory than octree and sometimes is even fastersize qlist performs better than qvector because it doesn t store theim specifically looking to increase speed of a python script just not sure if dpkt or pyshark is

button is worked if there is more than one checkbox present.but it will not worked for single checkboxi d like to use mediacodec to encode the data coming from the camera reason it s more low-level so hopefully faster than using mediarecorderthis does not work because the uiview you are subclassing i assume it is a uiview already is the delegate of its own calayer it cannot be the delegate of more than one calayer at onceadmittedly mrbob doesn t yet have the number of plugins that zopeskel does but since archetypes has been overtaken by dexterity there is less heavy boilerplate code to generatei dont think combining jbehave and testng is a better ideanodevalue is a little more confusing to use but faster than innerhtmlthe problem is that with the code below the jlayeredpane always expands to fit the size of the jscrollpane and in the event that the jscrollpane is smaller than the jlayeredpane it does not provide the scrolling abilityunion distinct is slower than union all but you may need it for de-dupping.if you are okay with lower resolution of the pdf you can try using html2canvas library along with jspdf which is quiet easier approachbut although atom-editor looks so nice and powerful compared to simple editors with realy huuuge number of available packages plugins lighttable is more elegantgenerally ienumerable and iqueryable are even better than ilist as they re more generic unless you want to limit this with good reason of course- similar to piston but i ve had better luck with tastypieif you want to display your file as plain text the widget qplaintextedit is better then qtexteditorika is way faster than dozer and quite close to manual mappinglooking briefly at the list-like combinators for uu-parsinglib i m more familiar with parsec i think you can solve this by folding over the result of the psome combinatorif the uilabel is larger it will then wrap around the uibutton to the next linei m aware that uitextview is much more suitable for this as it implements uitextinput protocol which has all the methods i need but due to a bug in ios i m limited to uilabeltastypie is more tightly coupled to the orm than piston but there are methods that you

more efficient in this case than naive application of dijkstra simplementing the equals and the compareto methods sounds easier than it sometimes really isfor your purpose you would probably be better off with a sorteddictionary class or perhaps sortedlistnamedtuple is faster and significantly more memory efficient than a dictionaryi also found a post that suggests a less brute force method to get the urlroutingmodule to catch the combres.axd routesomeone else in this thread makes a somewhat convincing argument that modulus a primes is better for detecting bit-swappingyou can take a look at timsort which for non completely random data performs better than quicksort they have the same asymptotic complexity but timsort has lower constantson the other hand the wikipedia article on r-tree seems more specifically targeted towards mapping than the k-d tree or quadtreefor this kind of task reading the document into a domdocument and using domxpath is probably more suitableno for-loops or math.pow which is amazingly slow way slower than sin cos etcthe problem with dbcontext api is even worse because dbcontext api doesn t offer methods to change state of independent association so you must revert back to objectcontext api and use objectstatemanager.changerelationshipstatethe first thought is that you could build a uiview showing image and text then attach a uitapgesturerecognizer to it which would be more flexible than uibuttonit fills the gap between scalatra and lift more powerful than scalatra and easier to use than liftthe uiview class methods are convenience methods for

graphicsmagick is a folk of imagemagick which is faster but a little less powerful and has some bugsi was expecting the parent widget to have a little larger sizehint than the children layoutsurely there is some situation in which the bellman-ford approach is better than the dijkstra approachwhether splines or linear trapezodial interpolation is a better fit will depend heavily on your problemhowever i do not know if webstorm has a comparable option like that as it has less functionality than phpstorm or even intelliji ve read that painting to a qwidget is sometimes faster than qgraphicsview but it would by a lot of extra work for the mouse handling i thinkyou can have only one httphandler but can plug in more than one httpmodule to examine and handle the requestsit s a more involved process with namenode assuring that at least dfs.replication.min copies are written to hdfspersonally i really like reactiveui which is fairly unusual but does make getting things right an awful lot easier than caliburnyou might be more comfortable with suds pysimplesoap or flask-enterprise to consume the soap datathe mathematical reason for this is that once the solution 906609 is found it will no longer be possible to find a larger palindrome where the larger factor is less than the square-root of 906609 which is 952.160.g++ seems to work better than gcc in my experienceas shown in sample below for sqlcommand which is more or less same as oledbcommand
