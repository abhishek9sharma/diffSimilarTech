i m working on a wildfly swarm project using wildfly swarm version 2017.8.1 maven 3.5.0 openjdk 1.8.0_141 where users will often upload files way bigger than undertow s default 10485760 bytes 10mb max-post-size settingthe tooling provided with the jdk jstat jconsole jvisualvm is much more reliablecomparison between mockito vs jmockit - why is mockito voted better than jmockitwhy blazemeter is better than jmeteruitableview is much more customizable than uipickerviewuse genymotion or bluestacks for emulator.these third party android-emulator is better performance as compare to builtin android studio android-emulatorscapy is a better performer than dpkti have noticed that ef is slower than linq2sql massive petapoco ado.net and possibly nhibernateenthought-dev is chaco faster than matplotlibwill using shellsort instead of insertionsort inside mergesort yields a faster performanceconclusion diff1 is faster in firefox opera and safari diff2 is faster in ie and google-chromestringtokenizer is faster than stringbuildertcmalloc is faster than the glibc 2.3 malloc.yes iostream is slower than cstdiolodash is definitely not slower than underscore.jsuse swing-x components there is a jxtable which is more powerful than jtableodd that elasticsearch is more tolerant than kibanaeven more oop-like with setter getteris openrasta better than wcfconsider if toggleclass is more appropriate than addclass removeclassi like caffe but the amount of gpu memory caffe use is larger than mxnet i test in resnet-50 with mxnet-memongerbetter for you to use bluestacks android-emulator it is much faster than google android-emulatori set ecpm for inmobi and mobfox higher than for admobactually on intel sandybridge-family at least mul imul 64bit 64bit 128bit is faster than imul mul 32bit 32bit 64biti also have .js files being redirected to javascript engines as well for main.js in google-chrome it tries main.v8.js in safari main.nitro.js in firefox main.gecko.jseach tab contains multiple radgrids as radgrid is heavier than asp.net gridviewthe storage costs in hadoop are much cheaper than vertica netezza greenplum and the likereader writer since jdk1.1 in java are newer than inputstream outputstream since jdk1.0is keras faster slower than tensorflow during trainingthreads in direct2d is more granular than in gdi and gdi+ so that theinnodb delivered 4.6x higher throughput than myisam while achievinga direct2d is slower than gdiwhich java profiler is better jprofiler or yourkitand perl like any interpreted-language is much slower than a compiled-languagegnu gdb fedora 6.8-37.el5 or gnu gdb gdb redhat enterprise linux 7.0.1-37.el5python -m ensurepip --upgrade does indeed upgrade the pip versioning in the system if it is lower than the versioning in ensurepipquadtree indexes are created faster than r-treeupdate graphicsmagick is faster than imagick doesn t means gmagick is better than imagickwebclient is simpler to use than webrequestmore than a qmap of qstring tothis android-emulator works better than bluestackssriwantha mstest is a simpler framework than nunitfor mvvm scenarios a relaycommand or delegatecommand is a better fit than the routedcommand which is provided with wpfhence the alarmmanager which runs much better than a java timertask thingy
