velocity is simpler than freemarkerfirefox gsap performance is still much worse than in google-chrome but google-chrome gsap does still lag every few repeats or so while in google-chrome the css animations do notbeside markdown and restructuredtext there exists also asciidoc which is more powerful than markdown there are f.exif scala 2.10 s reification turns out to be more limited than kotlin and ceylonpacoblaze was written in verilog which like adam said less common than vhdlso arraylist and sort is more effective than treesetheapsort tends to be slower than mergesort for the same reason.example with nunit i have better experiences with nunit than with mstestin doing so the tradefoff is that tcp becomes slower compared to udpimho pagespeed is better than yslowedit for the read-performance this link shows that innodb often is actually not slower than myisamtensorflow is slower than caffe torch etc on gpu because ofcpython is faster than pypy on the two tests slowspitfire and wafi d rather use webclient because it requires less code than httpwebrequest httpwebresponsethe solution from charliefl is approximately 100x faster than underscore.js depending on browser in this case and lodash being up to 2x faster than underscore.jsextfs4 or xfs are between 25 and 40 faster than ntfs or refs depending on the optimizationi think jtable would be better jcomponents as jlist because there you can implements tablecelleditor maybe example with similair output herethe best testdriven.net disables all instrumentation that mstest does so it makes mstest blazing fast - much faster than nunit for exampledisable antialiasing and the performance of direct2d will be on par or faster than gdiyou can also use webclient which is much simpler than httpwebrequest but in order to set a cookiecontainer you ll need to derive from webclient and override the protected getwebrequest methodthis example is in mstest but mbunit is more or less equivalentsvg performance in firefox is slower than in webkit google-chrome and ie10in chrome the object.create - getter setter is fasterbeing queryable the data tables produce faster results with sorting and filtering with their defaultview dataviewbut for the arrays it is better to use for-loop as shown by alnitak than for-inyou then could even make a smooth fading from panel1- panel2 using js see here or easier with jquery fadein and fadeoutinnodb would be a better choice than myisam for a high-write tablethe for-loop is faster than the foreach-loop if the arrays must only bei have more than 20+ textview and imageview in my activity like thisjson-rpc is more pythonic than xml-rpc or shudder soapthen we can simply use foreach for javascript arrays .its a simplest than for loop..but as per the research for-loop is faster than foreach ..this is one of the good explanation for thata variation that uses settimeout rather than setinterval and uses the more cross-browser secure document.location.reload trueparallelizing mergesort is simpler than quicksort in-placefor example quicksort average cost t n.log n and heapsort average cost t n.log n are both sorting algorithms with the same average cost - yet quicksort is typically much faster than heapsortin other words calloc is no more type-wise than memsetthis makes for example javassist or proxetta significantly slower than cglib which simply reads the methods via the reflection api and overrides themit usually performs better than lzf or lzoas you can see from the above tests realloc is consistently faster compared to memalloc memcpy and freeand found out that framerate of createjs easeljs is much worse in firefox than in google-chrome iegraphicsmagick also seems to be faster than imagemagick using better multitaskingi have an issue with serializable in c# .net where if i serializable in one stream multiple references to a same object these references are no longer equal after deserializationpuma also has better concurrency but that threadsafe confgi make webrick multi-thread for meaes can be even much faster than des or 3des when the cpu supports aes-niqlist code is generally less optimized than qvector onei have heard that myisam performs better than innodb on read-oriented tablesnunit is faster as compared to mstestaccording to the performance results at for serialization with databind with strings gson.tojson myobject gson is over 10x slower than jacksonit gives me arraylist but arraylist has a linkedhashmap which contains some more linked hashmaps containing final valuesi usually do this with nested linearlayouts containing a textview and imageview for the icon but obviously using these compound textview is cleanerand simd math libraries for sse and avx however they seem to be more sse than avx2the uinavigationcontroller class seems to handle better rotations than uiviewcontrollerthe damerau-levenshtein algorithm includes many comparisons and int compare much faster than charsadd smaller webview as a subviews to the uiviewhowever arrayfun is just a for-loop in disguise and is often slower than writing loops explicitlyin google-chrome it seems .prototype is faster firefox shows no difference between the two although generally performs slower than google-chromeyou can use string.isnullorempty and toupper method is in general more accurate than tolowerfor example nunit offers more assert methods than mstestapparently google-chrome is pickier than firefoxfrom my tests bitblt is x75 faster than stretchbltas kibana is the webui for elasticsearch it is better make it high availabilityjpql or hql is much more expressive and it s much easier to predict the associated generated sql queryusing strncpy is considered safier than strcpy because the second one can easily cause buffer overrunas a side-effect of implementing proper parent traversal lxml is a bit slower than celementtree for parsingi have found jmeter to be more reliable than soapui or loaduithat s better than setinterval or settimeoutslower than the cstdio ones and extensibility iostream allowsconsequently ironpython is potentially faster than cpython is especially for multithreading scenariosi do know imagemagick better than graphicsmagicktogether resharper was finding more than justcodewhen there are more than one exception-handling in try-catch block rec_catch_exception triggers1- use a sorting algotithm like mergesort or quicksort has better performance with small inputsbinary tree sort in particular is likely to be slower than mergesort or quicksort because of the tree-balancing overhead as well as cache access patterns.ironpython and jython are also jit-compiled although using the more generic jvm and .net jits so they tend to be faster than cpython for this kind of work as wellwhen hdf5 storage can be accessed fast than .csv and when dask creates dataframes faster than pandas why is dask from hdf5 slower than dask from csvis calayer better than uiview in terms of performancei successfully compiled graphicsmagick with q8 but after all it seems about 30 slower than imagemagick 0.3 secsin google-chrome a basic for-loop is faster than i-- and --i while in firefox it s sloweri want smooth fadeout fadein animations instead setting visibility where fadeout is slower than fadein animation so i ve used enteractions and exitaction of datatriggersetinterval is better than settimeout for this taski found a solution to this problem using beautifulsoup at beautifulsoup-where-are-you-putting-my-html because i think it is easier than lxmllxml.html deals with badly formed html better than beautifulsoup is actively maintained beautifulsoup isn t and is a lot faster since it uses libxml2 internallyfont-face bold in firefox is bolder than in google-chromealso setinterval is often better replaced by settimeoutdatamapper is much smarter then activerecordrsa is much faster then ecdsa at verificationtesting with scalatest+scalacheck is much much better than junit testngr-tree are substantially faster than quadtree for window queries like inside contains covers etcbased on why lodash is faster than native foreach post maybe it s justifiable to use lodash in favour of both underscore.js and native foreach to loopjoe duffy s blog implies using substr is more efficient than strspliti find this method simpler than using clearinterval to pause and setinterval again to restartthe listener to the jlayeredpane component makes fast successive calls the listener to the jlist calls significantly sloweri read that settimeout is less cpu resources intensive than setintervalmake textview lower than imageviewalthough quicksort runs in quadratic time as compared to mergesort which runs in linear-log time quicksort is usually faster in practicemostly interpreted-language are a bit slower compared with compiled-language but i guess the difference is almost negligible in coffeescript javascript because of node.jsa for-loop is more sppropriate than a while loopsadd layout_weight properties to sub views as well.assign 3 to imaveview and 1 for textview now imageview always will be bigger than textview 3times and textview can not invade imagevies s spacefurthermore swift is stricter than objective-c when it comes to initialisersthe datagram is larger than your buffer so it gets trucated you get an error return from recvfrom and getlasterror returns 10040 wsaemsgsizetcpdf was always slower than fpdfquicksort is more sensitive to input sortedness in a positive way than mergesortfor semantic zooming you ll notice that d3.js is significantly faster than protovisa multi-character-constant is a literal int uses the character-literal-syntax with more than one chars and has an implementation-defined valueis keras consumes more gpu memory than equivalent tensorflow model traininguiview is more generic than uiwindow and should be preferredi have no idea about appfog but heroku is more than capable for running scrapyxna + monogame --- monogame s performance seems only slightly lower than libgdx can build to most platformshowever converting from nsstring to nsdata gives more reliable json datanunit has better support for parameterized tests than mstestfor something more robust check out highcharts or d3.js or something built on top of d3.js like nvd3.jsi m binding a grid view inside a for-loop which executes more than once.now when loops ends the data in grid view is the data binded at the last run of for-loop i.e all previous binds in the for-loop over overwritten.i dont want this .i want new rows to be inserted at each run of the for-loop ..plz help somebodyit s also easier to use read.zoo instead of read.csv because merging time-series is a lot easier with xts zoo objects0 a do while loops that pre-decrements count --count and compares to zero is better than a for-loop that compares two variablesisnull is faster than coalescethus the for-loop is faster than the foreach-loop if the arrays mustuse the floatvalue nsstring method or a nsscanner which is more powerful and flexiblenunit is more widespread mbunit has the most features but mstest has more manpower behind itthis is because the swift dictionary is more strongly typed than the objective-c nsdictionaryuse either bcrypt on its own or pbkdf2 in combination with your sha-512 although sha-1 hmac is more than enoughmemcpy is more efficient than memmove. in general use memmove only if you have toi found that numpy s 2d fft was significantly faster than scipy s but fftw was faster than both using the pyfftw bindingsworks on some rubies better than others jruby and rubinius are recommended efficiency on mri is decreased due to gvl global vm locka webclient is much easier than a webrequestwsimport is better don t use

nullpointerexception is going to take a bit longer than illegalargumentexception filepath must be supplied or whateverpypy is supposedly faster than cpython while gevent is based on co-routines and greenlets which supposedly makes for a faster web serverin couchdb cloudant this is usually better done as a view than an ad-hoc querythe uipickerview is nothing more than a uiview with one or more uitableview and background and selector viewsaside does this mean rebol is more homoiconic than lispusing getfrontbufferdata in directx method is slower than gdi itselfthe for-loop is faster than the foreach-loop if the arrays must only be accessed once per iteration1.0 faster than a for-loop iterating over an indexed arrays of 1kk elements for 9.0 plusmni can help you with lodash which is a superset of underscore.js and much better than underscore.js when it comes to performance and consistency see lodash vs underscore.jsin addition as mats petersson said memmove is cache friendlier than memcpyfrom my experience mstest is much slower than nunitsince a proper implementation of dijkstra is faster than bellman-ford use dijkstra unless there are negative weight edges in the graphin other words the per-comparison-overhead of heapsort is higher than the one of quicksortthey re good for code-size but often slower than sse avx loopshowever for a variety of fft problem sizes i ve found that cufft is slower than fftw with openmpbetter approach with addclass and removeclass using hoveri have a button that is bottom constrained to the bottom of the imageview however should be top constrained to the bottom of the subtitle textview if subtitletextview is taller than imageviewmyisam is actually better than innodb for spatial data btw because it also supports r-tree spatial indexes but not as powerful queries as postgis. if you just need points though innodb or myisam b-trees are adequatealso your get_int would be better written with fgets or getline if available and strtola uiview is no more than a wrapper for an underlying calayerin 6.7 a graph it shown that states that the performance of a objectcontext linq query is better than dbcontext linq querythe question is avx scalar is 2.7x faster than sse when i vectorized it the speed up is 3x matrix size is 128x128 for this questionthen instead of using datainput outputstream you should use an objectoutput inputstream makes it easier in my opinionhtml5lib parser does a better job than lxml or html.parser handling the debate element in this casei want to add a calayer inside an uiview and this calayer will be smaller than the uiviewtry vtd-xml it is much faster than jdom upto 10x and dom4j or dom and also memory efficientinnodb implements mvcc multi-versioning concurrency control so locking is much more complex than with myisamis there any better algorithm than normal quicksort radix-sort for this problemsorteddictionary has faster insertion and removal operations for unsorted data o logn as opposed to o n for sortedlistgraphicsmagick is not that much faster -- and the outputted file sizes are significantly higher than imagemagickg_new and g_new0 both take the same arguments unlike malloc that takes less arguments than callocthe only way to copy arrays that is more efficient than for-loop coding is system.arraycopybecause hql is more or less superset of jpql it of course works also in hqlas jogojapan said using std ostringstream is a better choicei want to set imageview and textview on same line in linearlayout but the imageview is always higher than the textviewit s possible that jython and ironpython are much faster than cpython as well as they are backed by heavily optimized virtual machines jvm and .net clra quadtree is a simpler data structure than the r-treer-tree are much faster than quadtree for nearest neighbours queriesi think using settimeout is safer than setintervaltechnically mergesort has a better time-behavior î nlogn worst and average cases than quicksort î n 2 worst case î nlogn average case0- less than floating-point less than lt fl for fixed-point comparebut this popular wsgi benchmark says eventlet is way slower than geventlodash is more modular than underscore.js underscore.js around 5kb lodash around 17kb but is generally lighter because you only include the specific modules you needas dimitre says xslt is much better at this class of problem than xquerybeststat is innodb so i have row-level locking and consindering i do a lot of inserts-updates it should be faster than myisami ve written chars counter c extension to python looks like 300x faster than collections.counter and 150x faster than collections.default intfurthermore 3des is much slower than aesbut under what circumstances is the bellman-ford algorithm better than the dijkstra algorithmit works similarly to mxmlc and compc but compiles fasteri have a smaller uiview as a subviews to the main uiview on my uiviewcontrollerafter jgauffin suggestion i used johnskeet code and found that the for-loop with arrays is faster than followingdoes that mean the the view controller has multiple uiview or that the uiview has more than one calayeri noticed calayer had worse performance than uiviewi ve found that in my jtable which is in a jscrollpane nested in a jinternalframe there can be issues with scrolling and resizing when the jtable was larger than the jscrollpanei expected avx to be about 1.5x faster than sseand else is explained why requestanimationframe is better than setinterval or settimeoutafter running a modified version of esailija s jsfiddle test to include the documentfragment it doesn t seem to make any difference in google-chrome or opera for that matter so it appears as though google-chrome is simply slowerif the taskproperty class is decorated with datacontract attribute and with datamember attribute for each property the deserialization is much faster than when it is decorated with serializable attributei tried constraints spacing each imageview with xdp it is ok if all textview are not higher than the imageview but if a textview is higher than a imageview it will overlapthe use of gevent is also a performant option but slightly lower than eventleti also think working with seaborn is much easier using pandas dataframes and not numpy arraysbut because of the overhead in the for-loop and the second arrays it is slower as the before mentioned arr.filter as shown by this jsperfshould i be surprised that the keras theano backend is about 18x - 19x slower than the keras tensorflow backendin safari 10.0.3 cloneelement is 31 slower for the jsperf test mentioned above in google-chrome createelement is 17 slower for meso using easymock with junit should give you better coverage and better tests than junit aloneember.js is larger than backbone.js but thanks to expires cache-control this only matters on the the first loadyou can use setinterval instead but for most animations settimeout is easier to control and more importantly.i performed survey on torque slurm loadleveler slurm is better than torque in handling large nodes but in a single clusteron intel cpus before skylake packed-integer instructions can always run on more ports than their floating-point counterparts so prefer integer opsif the layout is repetitive a uitableview uicollectionview is a better choicei d suggest having a look at openrasta which is much closer to http semantics than asp.net asp.net-mvc isan ienumerable is less specific than an ilistin the experiments and discussion below i find that cufft is slower than fftw for batched 2d fftsso we can use pbkdf2 with sha512 to gain a very significant advantage over the phpass algorithm mainly because sha512 is a harder algorithm with more computation than md5the multiprocessed loops is slower than doing the for-loopyou can also try sklearn.linear_model.logisticregression and sklearn.svm.linearsvc both implemented using liblinear that is more scalable than libsvm albeit less memory efficients than other linear models in scikit-learnthe micro-benchmark included ensures that this solution is not slower than default serializable deserializationbut in firefox the left-collumn gets a much bigger height than in google-chromedeserialization performance is similar with gson over 9x slower than jackson and fastjson about 0.5 faster than jacksoni simplified the 0-9 case in digit_to_char i think str is clearer than the chr ord constructjson jsonb fields support any json-encodable data type not just key value pairs but also tend to be faster and for jsonb more compact than hstorei try to align my imageview and my textview but the imageview is higher than my textviewbecause copying text result from jtextfield is always easier than retyping it from jlabel note that jlabel is not focusablein my personal benchmarks laravel is undeniably faster than codeigniter due to lazy loadingi understand that strtol and strtof are preferred to atoi atof since the former detect errors and also strtol is much more flexible than atoi when it comes to non-base-10key derivation algorithms such as bcrypt and pbkdf2 aka rfc2898derivebytes are much slower than standard hash algorithmssometimes this way is a better than stdout stderr but you have to use openlog closelogfor reading large csv files you should either use readr read_csv or data.table fread as both are much faster than base read.tablefor small buffers hot in l1d cache avx can copy significantly faster than sse on cpus like haswell where 256b loads stores really do use a 256b data path to l1d cache instead of splitting into two 128b operationsthe for-loop is faster than the while loops when n 1000000 each takes roughly 0.105544 and 0.2389421tuning innodb which is the better engine requires adjusting different values than myisam which is often the fast-but-unsafe defaultie firefox higher than baseline google-chrome on baselinethe jni sincos is better than computing sin and cos but the sqrt approach is still fasterthe function isnull is kind of equivalent but coalesce allows more arguments and is standard sql.escaping the quotes with back-slashes works hi there you but embedding apostrophes single-quotes within double-quotes is often easierdatamapper is newer than activerecordalso javassist is recognized to be slower than cglibuiview animation is generally easier and more intuitive to use than caanimationi have 2 more uiview as subviews in scrollcontainer viewas wuliwong said sinatra and padrino are way less complex than ruby-on-railsfirst of them works quite good on cpu intel i7 and on fermi gpu gf 540m cpu time is near to openblas and fermi gpu time is near to cublas about 18ms but this implementation works 10x slower than cublas on maxwell gpu titanx - 5 ms vs 0.4 msbut with setinterval combined with clearinterval it is more straightforwardhttpwebresponse and httpwebrequest are a little bit lower level than webclientnote that while serializable is now optimized deserialization is doubly slower because i deserialize to object to then reserialize to stringi think greenfoot is better than bluej for 8-years oldbut tripledes is older and weaker than aespyquery is based on lxml so it s also much faster than beautifulsoupsenderid and sequencenumber are both int and will take up more than sizeof chars bytes on most architecturesalso pyquery is significantly faster than beautifulsoup in many cases for processing resultsienumerable is less specific than an ilist that is ilist has functions that ienumerable does notin your scenario addclass and removeclass is more suitablei thought graphicsmagick was supposed to be leaner meaner than imagemagickand it s rarely faster than innodb since innodb uses row locks and mvcc as opposed to myisam s full-table locksthing is i believe that cin and cout is faster than scanf anf printf.c++the javadoc of javassist is way better than that of cglibfaster than inplace_add after compilation with gcc -ofast and directly writing a c function taking a int double double is more or less as fast as addlocal with or without #openmp simdthere can be a .txt file on hard disk or a qlist or qstring whichever is a better soluionif you would like a unified front-end for elasticsearch and opentsdb you could consider grafana which has support for both elasticsearch and opentsdb but less functionality than kibana in regard to elasticsearchuse json.net it allows for far greater control over serializable and deserializationhowever ambari-metrics is better than nagios gangliashouldn t a subclassing interfaced be able to take in more than the superclass interfacec and use the same methodthis makes interpreted-language generally slower than compiled-language due to the overhead of running the vm or interpreterelse if you have more than one listview or gridview in the scrollview you need to create a customlistviewor is it just that scapy is slower than dpktthe transmission size is bigger using datacontractserializer but during serializable and deserialization it is faster to use datacontractserializerbetween lxml and beautifulsoup lxml is more equivalent to nokogirialso is jxtable better than jtable for such an applicationworks on some rubies better than others jruby is recommended efficiency on mri is decreased due to gvl global vm lockstrcpy is notoriously unsafe as are it s cousins strcpy_s and strncpy although they are mildly safer than strcpycompilers but it compiles faster than the mxmlc and compc
