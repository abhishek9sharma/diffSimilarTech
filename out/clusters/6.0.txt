callee is too large message is printed by c1 when the size in bytecodes of the method being inline is larger than maxinlinesize 35 multiplied by nestedinliningsizeratio 90 on each next level of inlining
hence memcpy and strncpy work almost the same here and memcpy is more efficient and less prone to error
basically mongodb supports no more than 100 levels of nesting for bson documents
the for-loop is using i as a global variable so if your instance.set_marker function is also using i as a global variable and sets its value to something greater than 6 loops will exit
but there are many citations of real world tests which show that heapsort is significantly slower than quicksort on average
in my limited experience using objective-c code from swift is a more common use-case and fairly trivial
you can also use strtol which is obviously better than atoi
for suitably large examples of each dictionary overcomes the constant factor by which it s slower than std map and will actually do operations like lookup insertion etc
i have also found that a while-loop is faster than a for-loop

its was said that awt is faster than swing as it uses the platform component but due the arrival of faster processor etc ..
quicksort is a partitioning sorting algorithm you might refer to mergesort which also is a partitioning sorting algorithm the biggest difference is probably the speed quicksort is faster even though both of them are o n log n
this means that memmove might be very slightly slower than memcpy as it cannot make the same assumptions
on modern processors floating point multiplication is generally slightly more expensive than addition which is one reason why compilers will typically replace by x+x
the error is because the gridview is being applied to more than one listview
the reverse while loops is generally faster than a for-loop as well
in such a simple arrays you shouldn t be concerned about memory usage but the for-loop consumes less memory than foreach because foreach uses an internal copy of the arrays
rsa has much simpler math and can directly encrypt decrypt data you should never compare rsa and ecdsa
although both approaches are o n the for-loop has a larger constant because of loops overhead
for example when the setter or getter function is more complicated than just the trivial
perhaps a highly optimized and tuned implementation with sse avx multithreading is better for me
the problem is that the server-side selectedindexchanged event triggers earlier than the client-side change event so the data never reaches the server-side
if you cannot tolerate that use getline it s harder to use so use fgets if in doubt
on linux these syscalls are often mmap 2 perhaps with sbrk 2 and since linux systems are mostly free software you could actually study and improve the implementation of malloc musl libc implementation of malloc the more common gnu libc malloc implementation is perhaps more complex to understand
the other option is to use a foreach loops which is slightly slower than a for-loop but works almost equivalently for all practical purposes

you d be better off using mktime for this as it s dumber than strtotime
unfortunately g++ packed the structs significantly looser than gcc which caused significant problems sharing objects between c and c++ code
and has higher precedence than or just like multiplication has higher precedence than addition
since multiplication is of higher precedence than division
the c function strtol is much better make it a habit to prefer that one to atoi
udp is not always faster than tcp

i would make the conditions easier by ignoring capitalization by converting to uppercase before comparison and leading trailing whitespace by using the strip method
if i do heapsort i can create the stack while i m sorting but would this be faster than a quicksort and then build the stack afterwords
reading a line of numbers spaced with white-space except n and then finally terminated with n is possible with scanf and ungetc but not worthy of coding except as an exercise as using fgets and sscanf strtod is far better
x86 is considerably slower a few clocks plus a clock or so per function argument while 64bit is much less because most function arguments are passed in registers instead of on the stack
and is as far as i know faster than the combination of malloc and memset on the other hand malloc alone is faster than calloc
filtering before the grouping by is usually more efficient because it reduces the amount of data needed to process the aggregation
but heapsort is assumed to be on average somewhat slower than standard in-place quicksort
on the last iteration of the outer for-loop ndx is one less than array.length so when you call arrays ndx+1 that is equivalent to arrays array.length which out of bounds since arrays start indexing at 0
since the flow of logic is still basically a loop but the api boundaries of the presenter is a cleaner boundary than view in mvp which helps decouple v and m in mvp than is possible in mvc
1 tcp is connection oriented and reliable where as udp is connection less and unreliable
but if you use public key encryption to encrypt messages you are a limited to small messages -- a 1024 bit rsa key encrypts less than 128 bytes and b going to pay in performance because public key encryption is much more costly than symmetric key encryption such as aes encryption

they are easily generated for udp simply by making the datagram bigger than the mtu
as i noted in comments however if you re willing to rely on posix s strdup then that s cleaner than strlen + malloc + and has the same semantics you take responsibility for freeing the memory allocated for the copy
generally speaking passes in higher-level shader material systems yes higher than glsl cg hlsl like this one are a way of setting up states necessary for multi-pass rendering
but this operation inherently involves division which is expensive whereas computing an address from an array index involves a multiplication and is faster
the level of abstraction of datamapper is way higher than the activerecord s
division has higher precedence than addition
the reason i asking this is because i read tcp is slower than udp because tcp ensures order of packets
but there are some cases especially in iot domain udp is more popular than tcp for its bigger transport overheads

however you can t use a superclass value where a subclassing is expected because the subclassing is more specific
as multiplication of ints has more overhead than simple addition
malloc is faster since calloc initializes the allocated memory to contain all zeros
in my experience udp based code is generally less complex than tcp based code

we propose to use udp over tcp since udp is faster than tcp
memory is a bottleneck to performance ram runs slower than the cpu and if you re paging to disk than it s really slow

the question is a bit wider than serializable deserialization and applies to any situation where some object could be uniquely rebuild from jpa persistent data and vice versa
multiplication is faster division is more accurate
my another question is if i put the data size smaller than mtu into sendto then i can guarantee call sendto once socket only sends one tcp udp packet
note however that doing so means that each encrypted chunk has its own padding and that rsa is much more computationally expensive than aes
modulo can also cause a divide-by-zero and it has a higher precedence than addition
if the hash function is more complex and cryptographically strong md5 or sha1 then it is theoretically not possible
how is aes less secure than rsa in this scenario
for instance strtol is better than atoi and you should be checking each time whether strtok returns null
without parentheses math.exp c b is executed first as division has higher precedence than subtraction -
trig functions should have precedence lower than multiplication and higher than addition
formally it means division cannot have a complexity worse than multiplication
may be because vvcospif it is wrapper under objective-c runtime and converting data structures copying of memory from intel simd - objective-c - swift runtime is slower then tiny cos
interestingly quicksort performs more comparisons on average than mergesort - 1.44 n lg n expected for quicksort versus n lg n for mergesort

however instead of using two nested for-loop you can use count arrays which is more efficient
udp uses datagrams chunks of data which are received whole on the other side unless the size is bigger than the mtu but that s a different story
this redeclaration allows a cleaner way to access and mutate the property internally without resorting to fragile ivar synthesis which is becoming an antiquity now that the compiler does it for you
in this case instead of generating two large matrices with the row and column indices you can use a for-loop on the rows of your arrays it s slower but not as slow as a double for-loop

calloc returns tha address of a block of memory initialized to all bits zero which has the same effect as calling memset but is potentially more efficient
implementing multiplication is easier if you remember an shl operation performs the same operation as multiplying the specified operand by two
2 second loops is and easier for-loop to read
so i feel that on x86 memcpy is faster than strcpy
since a 53-bit mantissa is too large to fit in less than four 16-bit registers or two 32-bit registers performing an addition with a 64bit mantissa isn t any slower than using a 53-bit mantissa so using extended-precision math offers faster computation with no downside in a language which supports a proper type to hold temporary results
a heartbeat is by nature a connectionless contrivance so it goes that udp connectionless is more relevant here than tcp connection-oriented
the multiplication should perform somewhat better than division
however if g is guaranteed to have only non-negative weights g is non-positive weights then dijkstra s algorithm could be better choice over bellman-ford

division has higher precedence than subtraction
but for the example you give it doesn t matter - if it s going to fail it will be in the initial strlen so strncpy doesn t buy you anything in terms of safety and presumbly strncpy is slower as it has to both check bounds and for nul and any difference between memcpy and strcpy isn t worth changing code for speculatively
udp has a much lower overhead than tcp
also addition is faster than multiplication and multiplication is faster than division
because heapsort is actually slower than quicksort for each n
for this reason since calloc uses two arguments of type size_t it can allocate bigger blocks than malloc will ever be able to since malloc takes only one argument of type size_t
notice that memcpy is faster than strcpy unless the source string is much smaller than the buffer s size which is rarely the case with ip addesses.
s will match more than just spaces because it also matches vertical whitespaces like linefeed carriage returns.

also it seems like a for-loop is of greater cost to the compiler than a while-loop
is a leftover after the division which corresponds to result of the modulo

declarative programming is not always simpler than imperative programming
phong is a more nuanced shading model albeit a more hacky one which says that light is composed of ambient + diffuse + specular components
any decent libc will have an efficient strlen that s much faster than looping a byte at a time so separate vectorized strlen and toupper loops are faster
repeater is more light than datalist as datalist creates the view by creating a table whereas repeater doesn t
a boolean would most likely not yield better performance than int since the excel formula engine is dynamically typed
then i tried the metaphone function and it worked far better than soundex
to my mind a for-loop is simpler to understand than traversing the list backwards with a while loops
general consensus including the php docs is that metaphone is much more accurate than soundex when dealing with the english language
which one is faster is indeed a cpu-specific issue or at least how much faster is cpu specific yes division is typically seen as slower than multiplication
it was introduced since the nat traversal for tcp is much more complicated than udp
i used multiplication for both operations because multiplication is typically faster than division

another side note single-quotes inside xpath string looks a bit tidier than escaped double-quotes imo
marcus yes memmove is faster than strcpy and faster than python but why
but as that reference points out murmurhash is way faster than md5 and sha functions although it doesn t do a direct comparison to the object.gethashcode method i mentioned above
chqrlie has pointed out in the comments that this method could also lead to erroneous comparisons for extremely close dates fractions of a second since if difftime mktime date_1 mktime date_2 is less than 1 in magnitude the value will be converted to 0 upon return thus comparing as equal

note that this is one of those cases where matrix division of large arrays takes longer than a for-loop
gcc supports built-in __int128_t and __uint128_t types on 64bit platforms but it looks like formatting support for 128bit integers is less common in libc
the nltk library includes a confusion matrix that is simple to use and produces a nicer output than scikit-learn
i was just going to say radix sort however that could be a bit above what you were looking to implement introsort is generally the accepted sorting solution for data it s a variation of quicksort that switches to heapsort when it reaches smaller sets as it s faster on smaller sets than quicksort
in usual programming practice one wouldn t bother and simply multiplying by the floating-point representation of 180 ï because multiplication is so much faster than division
similar to pmg s solution but still faster because multiplication is faster than division -
the reason udp is faster than tcp is because there is no form of flow control or error correction

i can t say whether toupper or tolower is faster though
in other words calloc is no more type-wise than memset
i admit that gin index on hstore is much more expensive than its equivalent for jsonb but even then it is faster to just do seq scan on hstore than use index on jsonb
you can also look into strtol which is better than using atoi in terms of error checking
rsa is not ment for bulk encryption as it s quit slow compared to symmetric algorithms like aes it s more than a factor of 1000 slower
using a hash or similar to detect if the transmission was decrypted having a salt hash makes it harder not impossible to change or forge message contents
a filesystems such as xfs is more suitable for this
so both can use quic instead of tcp and it s usually faster than tcp hence the name which sounds like quick and is an acronym of quick udp internet connections
secondly the haskell ffi is more powerful that is it does more with less code than ocaml s and more libraries are avaliable via hackage so i don t think foreign interfaces will be a deciding factor
the superclass has a more stringent constraint on a property content blank false than the subclassing content nullable true and i am using tableperhierarchy false
when the sampling rate becomes higher than the free malloc frequencies of a program spikes start to become visible on a graph where the cpu usage seemed smooth
i am working on udp socket programming and i have to stop the transmission in application if requested data is more than mtu value
i ve considered that udp is more suitable for sending a series of discrete data sets but i need the reliability of tcp
xcb is lower level than xlib and allows you to minimise the number of round-trips to the x server leading to lower latency
the various alternatives calloc realloc work roughly the same way calloc is easier to use when dealing with arrays and zero-fills the data while realloc is useful when you need to resize a block of memory
spi is not less limited than i2c in this case
if you need more than integer accuracy but want to avoid floating-point consider using fixed-point arithmetic instead
i ve found that using a simple for-loop iterating over all elements in the string and comparing using charat performs faster than indexof or regex
also the for-loop is more readable than the while loops because it puts all loops variable manipulation in one place
is the foreach loops slower than the for-loop
prepending a salt is also more powerful than directly setting the seed values because in addition to changing the internal state of the hash if the salt is not a multiple of the digest block size then it can also perturb the alignment with which the input is fed into the hash function
these formats allow various data compression codecs note that snappy is now much more popular than lzo and can also provide other benefits such as fast serializable deserialization column pruning and bundled metadata
sctp mapped over udp ipv4 allows more private hosts per public address but udp mappings in ipv4 nat gateways are notoriously tricky to establish and keep maintained due to the fact that udp is a connectionless transport without any explicit state for a nat to track
if you need to load from a well-defined filesystems fat or ntfs this is more tricky you have only 450 bytes of space because 60 of the 512 bytes are used by the filesystems internally for code that interprets the data of the filesystems finds the file containing the code and loads it into memory
as you can see from the above tests realloc is consistently faster compared to memalloc memcpy and free
avoids n calls to malloc free it s faster and simpler to allocate deallocate
as a general rule udp is faster than tcp due to less protocol overhead
notice also the the cpu cache is much more important than processors registers today
bitwise operations are usually significantly faster than multiplication and division operations
moreover this even used to apply to all integral types larger than chars until one of the tcs for c99 standard finally required all-bits-zero pattern to be a valid object representation for int zeros of all types on all c platforms.
with current hardware at about twice the number of active threads as execution units cores ht logical processors however the architecture handles multithreaded execution your cpu starts spending more time scheduling thread execution and managing thread states than it is actually executing the threaded instructions
for-each loops is an iterable form of ordinary for-loop which is a better built data structure
readability is a big reason for functions using recursion rather than loops makes them easier to follow and for using the iteration methods where possible map to transform an arrays values-by-value rather than a for-loop
the map set multimap and multiset are normally implemented as binary trees with red-black balancing rules for example and deque is possibly more impression than knowledge a circular queue in an array exploiting an array-doubling or similar growth pattern
mouseleave div becomes thicker which will cause an almost automatic mouseenter
udp lends itself to real-time less latency than tcp
your macro with memset and memcpy was not any safer than strcpy
most likely a trie is more efficient and you didn t sort your dictionary and it doesn t use a binary tree or ternary tree
for example filtering and sorting takes longer in java
my view is that option 1 is clumsy code and involves unnecessary creation of an arrays even though the for-each loops is more efficient than the traditional for-loop in option 2
a side effect of many division routines is the modulo - so in few cases should division actually be faster than modulo
would an arrays be faster than a for-loop in this case
in a language like c a for-loop is more or less syntactic sugar for a while loops
the justification of realloc is that it s faster than 2nd malloc manual copy free
for example since multiplication has a higher precedence than addition is read as not
even with md5 salt it is weaker besides them
no trivial support for cache accessing ram is faster than accessing disk
but when looping through an arrays it s better to use a regular for-loop
verilog and vhdl allows for more optimization
looping with a for-loop is nothing more than a basic iteration of an arrays using a for-loop
in practice this means that tcp is better suited for continuous transmission of data whereas the more lightweight udp can be used when reliability isn t important
note that json representation of mongodb document could exceed this limit since bson is more compact
conan uses a more direct and easier approach to library dependencies management than biicode supporting both binary packages as building from source
however heapsort is slower than quicksort in the average case in the sense that heapsort performs c n log n whereas quicksort has d n log n performance with d being significantly smaller than c the numbers c and d are constants

in this particular case you concluded that a bitwise-and operation of c++ language must be implemented by a bitwise-and machine operation while a modulo must somehow involve machine division which is allegedly slower
sql server is probably smart enough to translate isnull into the equivalent sarg expression but if you are bent on using a function then coalesce is a better choice because it is part of the sql standard allows for multiple values instead of just two with isnull and avoids using quite possibly the most confusing function name microsoft ever devised in isnull
because the division operator has higher precedence than subtraction
however due to unpredictable floating-point precision issues it is sometimes little less than exact integer and in this case it is rounded down too much
also with the for-loop it s considered better to limit the scope of the iterating variable i and to use println you need system.out not just system and you need a string java arrays do not override tostring so something to output the numbers the user entered after loops like

i ve read that aes encryption is more secure than the triple des encryption ms is using in their example above
addition happens to be exact in fixed-point as long as it does not overflow but fixed-point multiplication is no more exact than floating-point multiplication
this is happening because of speed of for-loop which is faster than your time .as loops iterates in time of less than miliseconds and generates values.you can only call it when you want to insert single value to database and don t iterate for values
udp gives smaller latency with many many issues to discuss here of course tcp gives bigger latency
as a side note using toupper is more efficient than using tolower so toupper would be the way to go

scenarios when quicksort is worse than mergesort
you can also user a stemming which is a simpler version of lemmatization
noexcept allows for more efficient code generation in that it does not have to perform rtti on throw exceptions instead if an exception is throw from a call-frame underneath a noexcept-declared function std terminate is called short-circuiting the crazy std unexpected machinery specified by the 98 standard
client-side will also be more responsive than server-side because there s no request-response but that s really only a perceived performance issue for high-latency connections

i have issue with drawing big vbo with vao because the vbo has more than 65536 vertices and my vao is just uint that has maximum 65536
if you need a surrogate primary key using an auto_increment field is better than an md5 hash because it is fewer bytes of data and database backends optimize for integer primary keys
the resulting page identifiers will also be shorter than md5 hash and will only contain digits so they will be easy to include in url query strings etc
also throwing illegalargumentexception makes more sense instead of nullpointerexception when string has blank empty or null values
quicksort usually is better than mergesort for two reasons
you can do the same thing with much cleaner code with chr ord and array_map

you could for example generate a random aes key encrypt it using rsa and store it in the output file and then encrypt the file itself with aes which is much faster and doesn t have any problem with large inputs
counter1 can be used with instanceof and inherited but is more verbose and doesn t have real private properties eg count properties is exposed
following the linux kernel coding gudelines i don t fancy typedef because they tend to make the data definitions opaque if something is declared elsewhere as the typedefined type understanding that is a struct is somewhat more complicated
i ve replaced settimeout with setinterval which is more appropriate for repeated tasks
most importantly you can easily supplement udp with some reliable delivery hand-shaking that s less overhead than tcp
keep in mind that implementing udp traversal is easier than tcp
the coalesce function is used here because it is more portable than nvl or ifnull
where exponentiation has a higher precedence than multiplication or division
the mtu is closer to 1500 and this applies to tcp not udp
c++ allows you to define struct without the struct keyword so the typedef is used less often
so having an unsigned integer is easier because nulling the top bits is enough.
in few words strncmp is safer then strcmp but it is slower too
a for-loop fits better to your requirements than a while loops
remember the tuples are saved into the disk which is vastly slower to access than things in ram
for example matlab multiplies two 1000x1000 matrices in 0.15 seconds on my computer r needs 1 second while c++ armadillo lapack blas needs more than 10 seconds for that
setting it on a many-to-one or many-to-many relationship is more awkward
it is suggested in this so post that c# is more efficient with toupper because microsoft optimized it that way. but i ve also read this argument that converting tolower vs
dr your heapsort is not faster because it isn t actually a heapsort it s a backwards insert sort followed by an in-place ordering reversal
this is why pypy may be slower than cpython sometimes it needs a warm-up phase in which it can actually optimize repeated operations
also for printing arrays i recomend to use the enhanced for-loop it is easier
the point of this cache is to store data that the cpu is using quite regularly to speed up transfer time since the cpu cache is physically closer to the processors then ram is
for example quicksort is faster than heapsort in general although their time complexity are the same

yes but if you think of your diagram as a topographic map the subclassing have higher altitudes than the superclass
tcp streaming for audio can be less helpful than udp rtp as you d have to turn off nagling
if the above is true doesn t this mean that the foreach loops is much slower then the common for-loop since it involves making copies of each element of the arrays
no intel or amd x86 manuals ever guarantee atomicity of anything wider than 64bit except for lock cmpxchg16b so this talk of sse vector loads stores being atomic on some cpus isn t something that you can reliably take advantage of or detect when it s supported
this changes the variable curve so that it now points to the middle of the arrays that was previously initialized so that the follow-on for-loop indexing is likely easier for the programmer to think about and a bit cleaner to write debug etc
also if you have very limited memory processing resources it is worth bearing in mind that udp is a less costly protocol as it avoids a lot of the overheads tcp incurs due to its inbuilt connection management
my another question is if i put the data size smaller than mtu into sendto then i can gurantee call sendto once socket only sends one tcp udp packet
using webclient is potentially slightly on the order of a few milliseconds slower than using httpwebrequest directly

memcmp is simpler than strcmp and can be implemented even more efficiently in places where the strings are known to be properly aligned
nonatomic properties don t use locks but direct ivar is faster because it skips the accessor call
this breaks the inherited and the subclassing is no longer an instance of the superclass

1 i guess dask will be slower than pandas for smaller datasets
use a for-each loops to go through a range it s not as fast as using a variant arrays but keeps things simple and offers better speed than a for-loop
i am wondering if there is a cross-platform allocator that is one step lower than malloc free
from what i read on the net multiplication is usually easier to compute than division
longer answer 64bit x86 has more general purpose registers which gives the compiler more of an opportunity to optimize local variables into registers for faster access

this is the reason why working with the higher-dimensional arrays ends up being so much faster than the for-loop -based code
division is inherently a much slower operation than multiplication
using strncpy instead of strcpy is normally safer but here you alloc eachtime the right amount of memory needed to store inpoint into mpoint so i cant see what s the point

des turned out to be even slower than aes but for my current requirements a much simpler algorythm rc4 is sufficient
i am getting a problem using printf and fgets as in my code printf is written earlier then fget but it does not run it runs after fgets runs
2 however coalesce requires all arguments to be of the same data type thus being stricter than nvl which will first attempt an implicit conversion
this way is better than having getter and setter in base of performance not to have reduntant code of two methods getter and setter
using multiprocessing is probably not going to speed up reading data from disk since disk access is much slower than ram access or calculations

considering most rsa moduli are at least 1024 bit this will be much larger than an aes key
i assume that is parsed correctly because the two operators have different precedences meaning that associativity does not come into play and that your grammar correctly implements precedence although you should note that is a more standard example for showing that multiplication has higher precedence than addition since simple left-to-right parsing of gives the same result as your parser
firstly multiplication and division is actually quicker in some circumstances
here the for-loop header takes actually more time than loops body thus profiling results could be distorted.

yes division is usually much slower than multiplication
also sml has stricter precedence rules than haskell
the difference between the two boils down to the syntax with which objects are instantiated - classical inherited uses the more familiar constructor functions and new operator which hide the inherent prototypal nature of javascript s object creation and inherited properties
the pypy jit for python is also much more complex than cpython but also typically much faster â increased complexity is a fairly typical cost for speed. the four levels of disassembly for julia code give you access to the representation of a julia method implementation for particular argument types at different stages of the transformation from source code to machine code
still you cannot inherited from a as superclass cannot have a lower visibility than subclassing

finally sha1 hash are safer than md5 i tell you that because you used the md5 tag in your post
why is quicksort better than mergesort
as far as efficiency rsa is going to be orders of magnitudes slower than aes so the trade-off you make is that you give up simplicity you give up the simplicity of using aes in favor of some rsa chunking in return for poor performance you get the slower performance of rsa.

it is likely that you could do an sha hash of 100kb in well less than 10 second though and though sha-1 is still theoretically flawed it is of higher strength than md5
png achieves better compression than gif because it applies a pre-filtering step before the lossless compression deflate roughly equivalent to lzw. see wikipedia s explanation of png filtering
memset behaves like strcpy but the difference is that memcpy copied the data as it is byte but strcpy copies the formatted string as well so takes more time than memcpy to execute
to explain why a for-loop is faster than a for in loops is basically understand the underlying data structures used to store the data in memory

integer multiplication is much faster than division
usually i find swift s method naming to be cleaner than objective-c s but init methods can be an exception

when i generate rsa key pairs by openssl it seems like private key private exponent is always less than public key modulo
moreover tcp has more processing overhead than udp
the reason heapsort is slower in practice than quicksort is due to the better locality of reference in quicksort where data elements are within relatively close storage locations

if you re dividing or multiplying by a variable then it s likely that multiplication is slightly faster because the logic is generally more simple
it s worth pointing out that in general the foreach loops is more expensive memory-wise compared to the for-loop see here for details
they say that implements runnable is more preferrable than extends thread

tcp is a slower more reliable protocol than udp is
property declarations are nothing more than compiler-generated getter and setter methods

the reason is that the modulo is slower than subtraction
if you compute modulo a power of two using bitwise and is simpler and generally faster than performing division
mergesort is more difficult to implement in-place but the out-of-place version is very cache-friendly - i suspect real-world implementations accept the o n space overhead - ram is cheap but memory bandwidth is a major bottleneck so trading memory for cache-efficiency and speed is often a good deal

edit basile starynkevitch mentions that strtod is better than atof for this job as it gives the ending character
this is called a strength reduction optimization because division is stronger slower more expensive than subtraction
the way i like to see more than one for-loop in list comprehension is like the nested loops
is there any cpan module that would make this easier preferably with automatic getter setter generation
my question is is fast implementation of pow x 0.5f faster than fast sqrt x
1 okay so it is technically possible to allocate it as one big blob and then wire up the 20-element array to point into the desired offsets into the blob.â â this convolutes free ing though and usually isn t necessaryâ for most use-cases the performance gains would be negligible and you d still need to malloc a separate array of pointers that address into the 2d blob .â â you typically only see 2d-blob allocation when data is massively 2d â such as image data â and access syntax is eschewed in favor of syntax because it s no less efficient than what the compiler would do and doesn t require more than one malloc free pair per blob of data
it requests memory from the os kernel but the request is not satisfied until the memory is written to with memset . this allows for greater efficiency in the system s memory management but it can result in misleading malloc behaviour
udp packets smaller than the mtu will not be fragmented but the mtu depends on more factors such as ip options and vlan headers so it may not be greater than 1500
quicksort consistently has less recursive calls than mergesort
put each token +- of final command string in a list maybe a binary tree works and sort that list to tell the calculator that division and multiplication has the highest priority in the mean time addition and subtraction has lower priority
oddly enough new array size is almost 2x faster than in google-chrome and about the same in firefox and ie measured by creating and filling an array
using a separate icomparaer comparator approach is a more generic form of using a sortkey field with the additional ordering mixed into the comparator because such a field could be used by such a icomparer implementation

but goto is rarely used in modern coding it is not likely to perform any better than a do-while loop after compiler optimizations are applied and it has limitations on how it can be used
keyup is more preferable than keydown because keydown may occur multiple times if user keeps it pressed
the autojit compiler realizes you re multiplying by all 0s and removes the matrix multiplication completely and simply returns a matrix of all 0s in the 1s it skips the actual multiplication part and just does the summation part of a matrix multiplication which is slightly slower than just returning all 0s finally the final one actually forces the compiler to have to do a matrix multiplication since it can t assume the answer
isnull is marginally faster than coalesce
but for 32-bit and 64-bit microprocessors data alignment and bulk data access is key int accesses are frequently much faster than chars accesses and long long 64 bit may be faster still for some systems

decoding nullpointerexception is going to take a bit longer than illegalargumentexception filepath must be supplied or whatever
bower is more similar to npm than to component
like matzi suggested udp gives you lower latency and lower packet overhead as the header is smaller than tcp but on the downside the delivery of the packet to the destination is never guaranteed ie

multiplication is usually significantly faster than division
multiplication and division have a higher precedence than addition and subtraction
i would expect a while loops to be slower than a for-loop since it needs to test a condition before each iteration

try-catch is actually slower if there really is an exception-handling thrown
here for what it s worth is a pipes-csv variant which just compresses each parsed row into an unboxed vector of int s by hand this easier than finding double which is what this csv is really storing using readint from the bytestring package.
i personally think the while loops looks less clean than the nested for-loop
in the case of cryptographic hash functions like md5 it is even worse
additionally if you have strdup then it is much more convenient than strlen + malloc + strcpy with identical result including the same obligation to free the allocated storage when you no longer need it
in this particular case it would just copy the 3 bytes as expected but why use strncpy when memcpy is a simpler solution

also typedef struct is more c than c++
using just the keyfn return a comparable value that matches your requirements is much easier than implementing comparator
in t-sql unary minus is made to be the same priority as subtraction which is lower than multiplication
well we know it is the first one because of precedence - the binary multiplication operator has higher precedence than the binary + addition operator and is resolved first
the private exponent is always smaller than the modulo so you should be able to encrypt it using the raw rsa operation if you make sure to remove the prepended zero
since multiplication has a higher precedence than addition the same convention is used
division algorithms are slower than multiplication algorithms in most cases
since it s an arrays it s better to use a for-loop with a counter variable i which starts from 1
garbage-collection may be slower than malloc and free for programs that allocate at once all the memory they need and work with that
it may be that the kernel heuristics for servering tcp connections is more aggressive than for udp sockets since tcp connections require more state and more continuous processing than do udp sockets

in arithmetic multiplication has higher precedence than addition
it means a declared properties is more than a pair of accessor methods getter setter
to start with i need multiplication and division to take higher precedence than addition and subtraction
have you considered creating an object structure for these files and serializing them java object serializable and deserialization is much faster than parsing an xml this is again considering that these 500 or so xml files don t get modified between reads
aes will indeed yield a considerably faster result than des
as an example of the second option i ll use imshow here because it makes more sense than contourf for random data but contourf would have identical usage other than the interpolation option.
you can use either to create a new memory block which is separate from the original but naturally strdup is simpler since it doesn t require a separate malloc strlen call
using a while loops we can control the flow of i better than a for-loop

don t think of it as udp is faster and tcp is slower because that s just wrong
if you don t need the cryptographic properties then a non-cryptographic hash or a hash that is less cryptographically secure md5 being broken doesn t prevent it being a good hash nor still strong enough for some uses is likely to be more performant
hex is just less verbose and can express anything a binary number can
based on this not created by me the while loops is 22 slower than a for-loop in general
my personal opinion is that it is vastly more useful than strncpy and strcpy

apc is more an opcode caching system than a key value memory database like memcached altough it can be greatly used for both purposes
instead of the above for-loop you can also use the following loops which is even more efficient as this removes the need to find the square-root of the number

one can say udp has a lower overhead than tcp because its packets have a smaller header and therefore take less bandwidth to send the payload the data
strncpy is not safer method to use as strcpy
bufferedreader is useful when is used with large streams such as a file fileinputstream and in all cases the read method returns one character while behind the scene bufferedreader reads more data depends on buffer size from related inputstream and caches it to improve performance

the overheads are typically smaller than malloc free in c or new dispose in c++
hashing is one way you can prove this to yourself by taking an md5 or shasum of a large file since the file s size is larger than the hash output by pigeonhole principle hash can t be restored.
well setinterval and settimeout essentially try to do the same thing but for your case setinterval method will be more accurate than settimeout
if you know the lengths of the strings memmove is a sensible choice - and nominally faster than strncpy because it does not have to check for nulls as it goes
it is worth nothing that in a link where udp and tcp are sharing the bandwidth tcp is better behaved than udp in that it will try to limit itself to avoid congestion

the for-loop just initializes the arrays which that each slot in the arrays is .211 higher than the one before it
furthermore it is handier than google n-gram as for a given phrase it does not simply output its absolute frequency but it can output its joint probability conditional probability and even the most likely words that follow
i suppose this is one of the reasons for the misconception that udp is slower than tcp

allocating more memory with malloc does not prevent the memory error if the free call inside the dosomething method is incommented
binding threads to cores prevents the operating system from moving around threads between different processors cores which speeds up the executing especially on numa systems machines with more than one cpu sockets and separate memory controller in each socket where data locality is very important
you should use a for-loop which is more convenient to loops in an arrays
the ienumerable side of linq which works on in-memory objects that are already in the heap will almost certainly perform better than the iqueryable side which exists to be translated into a native query language like sql
the difference between crc32 and md5 is that md5 generates a larger hash that s harder to predict

based on the order of operations e.g where multiplication is evaluated with higher priority than addition push the operators and operands onto a stack
the reason for not having strcpy i m guessing is that strcpy can be replaced more efficiently with memcpy for constant strings and if the string is not constant strcpy is a bit more complicated than memcpy anyway so not as beneficial to make inline optimisations for

x86 doesn t support higher precision than 80 bits but if you really need more than 64bit for a fp algorithm most likely you should check your numerics instead of solving the problem with brute force
the third line displays the data with the maximum useful precision - an ieee 754 64bit floating-point number has slightly less than 16 decimal digits of precision so all those digits of the literal in math.h are pointless perhaps they can be seen as future-proofing against a possible future redefinition in a format with more precision
historically floating-point could be much slower than integer arithmetic

to use this in a loops you can write a simple for-loop which always checks if the index stil is smaller than the arrays length
theoretically udp should be be 30-50 faster than tcp because it s missing the extra trip for the ack and has a smaller header overhead however in reality there are many cases where tcp would outperform udp just because of congestion control
the function then allocates space to a new pointer with malloc and does a memcpy operation or loop-and-copy although memcpy is probably better
with typical libraries on common modern hardware sqrt is faster than atan2

i would recommend lxml for html parsing it s simple and considerably faster than beautifulsoup can be as much as two orders of magnitude
by splitting mousedown and mouseup there is less runtime parsing no checking events less code per run of each etc
if you use a where clause though it changes the execution pattern to use indexes so in general innodb will be slower than myisam on full unrestricted counts where as the performance matches up on restricted counts
first if you generically want to apply the same function to each element of an arrays and there isn t already a built in vectorized way to do it you could use arrayfun although often a simple for-loop is faster and more readable
while other algorithms like merge sort and heapsort have a better worst case complexity o nlogn usually quicksort is faster - this is why it s the most common used sorting algorithm
if your sorting needs are more complex than asort or ksort as previously suggested then write a function to plug into uasort
alternatively you can use an ssd with file storage in varnish to reduce disk io bottlenecks when using an object cache larger than available ram

but swift is less dynamically typed than objective-c and has less support for reflection
parallel processing is by far a more strict mode of execution of the code-units tasks threads... than just a concurrent run of code-execution simultaneously just by coincidence using more than one cpu or processors core and other shared resources to execute a program or multiple but mutually absolutely independent computational units
note that capturing stdout and stderr combined is actually easier
i was expecting that udp would be faster but tcp is on average two times faster than udp
vector instructions may use array operands that require a higher alignment than any scalar

if your objects are sparse then a quadtree or related data structure r-tree etc. is probably better
the draft c++11 standard tells us that unless stated otherwise the order of evaluations of operands are unsequenced and if the same scalar object is modified more that once by unseqeucend side effects than we have undefined behavior
remember malloc is quite expensive action and free costs even much more than malloc
with one arrays one can do which is easier than a for-loop

it seems the from a readability and usability standpoint the hex representation is a better way of defining binary numbers
indeed floyd-warshall s algorithm is better than dijkstra s in this case the complexity for dijkstra is o m n 2 and in this problem m is much much higher than n so the o n 3 time complexity of floyd-warshall is better
concerning the problem your printpiglatin could use the existing function strcpy or better strncpy which is safer in regards to buffer overflows
i want to write a server tcp or udp which performs more than one task while listening to more than one port
it s because that quicksort is generally faster that people use it instead of mergesort
ntfs is much more complex and time consuming due to the more complex nature of this filesystems
it s far more efficient and cleaner than charindex substr
+ consider that the implementation of tcp stack is much more complicated than udp more instructions are executed there

anyway transmit a salt and hash password is always better than transmit the plain password
std copy to be more efficient than memcpy or memmove because it
for complicated reasons having to do with the internal electronics of the cpu for most modern processors it is faster to perform a direct branch where the destination address is encoded in the instruction than an indirect branch where the address is computed at runtime
yes storing the password even reversibly encrypted is worse than a salt hash of some sort due to password reuse
why it is said quicksort has better constant factor than heapsort and therefore quicksort is better than heapsort in average
at first glance it must be significantly faster because strcpy must be significantly faster than printf

the robocopy command provides a more intelligent exclusion feature switches xd and xf than xcopy does which you could use for your task
any device in the path of communication between the sender and receiver whose mtu is smaller than the packet will drop such packets and reply the sender with icmp destination unreachable datagram too big message containing the device s mtu
in that case some hash functions are somewhat faster than other md5 being one of the fast functions but md4 is faster and it is simple enough that its code can be included in any application without much hassle
the precedence relationship is the same multiplication is higher then addition
this is because quicksort is generally faster than heapsort unless the call depth becomes to deep
i performed survey on torque slurm loadleveler slurm is better than torque in handling large nodes but in a single cluster
since parentheses were used around the addition but not the multiplication we can infer that probably in this language addition has lower precedence than multiplication

i used iperf on two linux machines to send data using both udp and tcp i found that tcp performs better than udp average 65 better
quicksort generally runs faster than mergesort but under some circumstances it can degrade to quadratic running time
the above grammar will make function calls a direct part of the expression with higher precedence than multiplication and division
first of all wouldn t that relate to it returning an object that is a superclass which contains less data than requested because a superclass is not a subclassing but a subclassing is a superclass
so for example if you send a 63k udp packet and it goes over ethernet it will get broken up into 47+ smaller fragment packets because ethernet s mtu is 1500 bytes but some of those are used for udp headers etc so the amount of user-data-space available in a udp packet is smaller than that
instead you can use udp and implement your own scheme for verification of data that is less stringent than tcp
given that it is possible to vastly reduce the likelihood of the worst case of quicksort s time complexity via random selection of the pivot for example i think one could argue that mergesort is worse in all but the pathological case of quicksort
but another added benefit of this approach is that it could make your program run faster since fixed-point integer arithmetic is much faster than floating-point arithmetic
quicksort is implemented well it is typically 2-3 times faster than mergesort or

usually onkeydown is more preferable then onkeyup for such combo
the modulo has a higher precedence than addition
in example sendp method included in for-loop which is slower than making other loops to send packets
however because of additional checks that memmove performs when the buffers are small and surely does not overlap memcpy is better
if we look at the speed of operations multiplication is not drastically slower than addition
the idea is that equal responses will have equal md5 hash and storing hash is a more lightweight process
lastly whenever you want to iterate x amount of times a for-loop is always more readable than a while loops that uses a counter variable

swing has more or less deprecated awt so you should extend jframe instead of frame
i have the impression that the implementantion has something to do with a for-loop and some kind of adaptive delay that gets bigger as loops count increases
the communication between the android app and the pc can rely on a simple tcp socket udp is also a valid option but if you begin in network programming tcp is probably easier to handle and more widely used

2 tcp needs more processing at network interface level where as in udp itâ s not
they also tend to be smaller than their xlsx or xlsm counterparts
early inlining is the compiler s ability to inline a function early on when it sees the call costs more than the inline
this feature allows the processor to execute several arithmetic operations simultaneously often four 32-bit integer operations or four 32-bit floating-point operations sometimes more operations with narrower integers sometimes fewer operations with 64-bit floating-point
tcp is way better then udp for that
on simple low-cost processors typically bitwise operations are substantially faster than division several times faster than multiplication and sometimes significantly faster than addition
it might be better than a for-loop in the terms of readability maintainability but keep in mind that linq usually slower than plain loops tl
my sense is that encode and decode are probably good solutions when you want the data to be recoverable but that unrecoverable hash using crypt md5 is a better approach for stored passwords
if you want to do more columns as a loops you need to increment this value in the same maner you are incrementing r in your for-loop
the division operation binds tighter than i.e is evaluated ahead of the subtraction so you are taking a square root of a negative number

using the powerpivot excel 2010 addin i believe its possible to effectively create this kind of function using dax and mdx has more built-in functions such as median
one of the reasons to do so is that rsa is much slower than for example aes
swift will incur this penalty in fewer situations than objective-c will for instance method calls to swift-only protocol methods do not hit objc_msgsend but if the protocol is declared in objective-c or if the swift protocol is decorated with objective-c such that it can be adopted by objective-c objects as well then method calls to methods in that protocol adopted by swift objects appear to be dispatched via objc_msgsend
it s not a question of is map reduce better than mergesort or quicksort because map reduce is just a tool for implementing a sorting algorithm like mergesort or quicksort in a parallel way

addition subtraction assignment has lower procedure than simply add operation
if a remains the same and b is changing say if your code is in a loop and it s clear that a does not change between two iterations for instance because it s a const variable then the original version can execute faster because multiplication is cheaper than division assuming the compiler moves the computation of 1 .
memcpy is faster than strcpy and also enforces you to specify a buffer size
but it sounds like you want to do nat traversal over tcp which is a harder problem than udp
also note that quicksort is generally more optimal than mergesort see this as well which explains why it s taken advantage of when sorting primitives

what happen when icmp is disabled in an router and when packet size greater than mtu how the router fragments that packet
compared to sleep 3 and usleep 3 nanosleep has the advantage of not affecting any signals it is standardized by pthreads it provides higher timing resolution and it allows to continue a sleep that has been interrupted by a signal more easily
with regard to implementation it also takes advantage of a bit of a non-obvious property of r precedence rules actually this is true of other languages as well such as c c++ and java namely that unary negative is higher than modulo which is higher than binary subtraction thus the calculation for is equivalent to

passive loadbalancing if a physical cpu is running more than one task the scheduler will attempt to run any new tasks on a second physical processors
in certain respects systemc deliberately mimics the hardware description languages vhdl and verilog but is more aptly described as a system-level modeling language

for-loop is widly used and has more advantages over while loops but ther are some cases when while loops is perferable
it seems openmpi has better support for assigning ranks than mpich but setting up slurm and mpich wasn t trivial due to the cluster setup so i m hesitant to start over with openmpi
a similar argument can be made for inlining functions inline is generally faster but will remain in the same big-o complexity class although there is an additional size tradeoff inlining makes your compiled program larger if the code was being used in many places
this is a hold over from older compilers and interpreters on old chip architecture that would do addition slightly slower than subtraction

a for-loop is more suitable to iterate through the arrays
it s generally accepted that lxml is faster than beautifulsoup ref
the inline keyword makes it easier for the compiler to apply this optimization by allowing the function definition to be visible in multiple translation units but using the keyword doesn t mean the compiler has to inline the function and not using the keyword doesn t forbid the compiler from inlining the function
the proper way to copy strings is using strcpy or strcpy_s on windows the difference is memcpy is faster and used in other situations such as pointers buffer management
putting the whole thing in a for-loop makes it neater and ensures that the iterating isread is called each loops
since these are typically orders of magnitude slower than the processors from the cpu s perspective this takes forever
override both methods but make gethashcode more tolerant than equals that means make unequal objects have the same hash code and not the opposite
so i guess fseek should be much faster than fread

disk io will be slower than ram
thing is i believe that cin and cout is faster than scanf anf printf.c++
division is generally on the order of 10x slower than multiplication on most processor families
problem being i have more than one subclassing to my superclass and many instances of each subclassing
this filtering will return only those grouping where the sum of othervalue of the rows in this grouping is greater than zero
i always thought a multiplication is computationally cheaper than a division
couchbase btw also uses binary replication mechanism which will be more efficient than couchdb as long as the couchdb protocol is not utilized for bidirectional data exchange and conflict resolution
i assume that a bit shift operation on a binary number is faster than div so i started pursuing a binary bit shift function to use with binary and hex numbers and that led to num
use strtol it does better error reporting than atoi
your intial hypothesis of toupper being faster than tolower has a logical fallacy
the term is apparently not an exact measurement as it is clear that a double-precision floating-point operation is going to take longer than a single-precision one and multiplication and division are going to take longer than addition and subtraction
of course the relative overhead will be smaller for functions that do more work than one addition and one subtraction per iteration
owl provides more mechanisms for asserting shapes of rdf graphs as does new work on rdf shapes
another example is geometry classes one parametrized to work with 64bit floats another parametrized to work with 64bit integers passing data between them may result both in rounding errors integer can t represent fractions and overflow integer has bigger value range than same-sized float
fixed-point can be much more exact than floating-point as long as the number s exponents remain in range
the only reason i can think of is the objective-c designers micro-optimising storage because the chars will use less memory than the int
according to python.org unary + and unary - operators have greater precedence over addition and subtraction
further as a for-loop it is easier to read as everything initialization loops condition expression to be executed after each iteration are all on one line
i saw that pypy is generally faster than cpython
the ssl handshake overhead associated with https is more than 50 of the bandwidth currently
if you re using typedef you no longer need to write struct all over the place by useing typedef code is more cleaner since it provides a smidgen more abstraction
malloc is far more common in c code than calloc
a concurrent run of a code-execution happens simultaneously just by coincidence using more than one cpu or processors core and other shared resources to execute a program or multiple but mutually independent computational units tasks threads et al
in scheme or prolog it s often less than a page of code
i know c++ have functions that return largest or smallest integer that is greater or lower than a like ceil or floor.is there a function that implement digit limitation of floating-point variable
however be aware of this to cache pixels to disk is several orders of magnitude slower than using ram
multiplication has higher precedence than addition subtraction
division has a higher precedence than addition ergo
in some cases irq constitutes more than 8 of cpu for a process
there are obviously situations where in c++ scanf is preferable to cin i was wondering if there are any situations where printf is more practical than cout
insertion sort for example has an average time-complexity of o n 2 worse than quicksort or mergesort but as an online algorithm it can efficiently sort a list of values as they are received as user input where most other algorithms can only efficiently operate on a complete list of values
for efficiency secondary name node periodically does a checkpoint to update the fsimage so that the namenode recovery is faster
2 i used link1 and link2 to filtering out duplicate users existing in more than one grouping
in some circumstances isnull is faster than case or coalesce
i m more familiar with ocaml than haskell so type constructor may not be the right term
when i use vertex array model looks perfect but when i switch to vbo model looks worse because of vertex normals
i ve reworked it slightly so that the deserialization code looks more like its serializable counterpart
also ram bandwidth is much higher than disk or ssd or network bandwidth and the ram latency is much lower too
produce temporary variable first then filtering grouping with productname a further filtering rank is greater than rank where productname a is located
today s floating-point units are pretty fast and may actually divide faster than an integer unit
division is performed by repeated subtraction therefore needs more level of subtract logic making division slower than addition
this is sometimes easier than yacc bison and usually more intuitive
here is what i am thinking tcp is supposed to be reliable transmission but slow whereas udp is does not provide a guarantee of packet transmission like tcp but is faster than tcp
it will be presumably more efficient than malloc + memset for large allocations
this is similar to operator precedence in mathematics where for example multiplication has a higher priority than addition
in regard to vao and vbo performance i disagree that vbo is faster i suggest to see this link
for if your solving algorithm size is greater than the processors cache size the cpu must retrieve pieces of code from main memory or l2 cache which is a slower operation
what is that key feature in tcp that makes it have much much higher throughput than udp
native javascript sort performing slower than implemented mergesort and quicksort
memcpy can be more efficient than strcpy since rep movs is highly optimized on intel cpus esp
moreover because read is built into bash and this usage requires no subshell it s significantly more efficient than approaches involving subprocesses such as head or awk
it replaces all tags with spaces and str.split splits resulted text by one or more spaces as delimiter
this is why a regular for-loop is better to use for this scenario rather than a foreach loops
adding setter and getter is better
in this context free store is different and incompatible with heap because the new delete free store library is simpler and quicker than the malloc free realloc calloc heap library and thus provides huge memory usage gains to the c++ embedded programmer in a context where you have only 512 bytes of ram
in practice each payloaded buffer will represent 1 udp packet unless your network mtu is smaller then what you have configured on the payload see mtu property
package-private is stricter than protected and public scopes but more permissive than private scope
if we are creating an object of a subclassing and invoking the method of superclass and if subclassing extends more than one class which superclass method should be called
this subtraction operator occurs within the second brackets and so has a higher precedence than the multiplication
because representation of a given problem with a nfa is far easier than the equivalent dfa
switch from using strcpy to strncpy or strncat which i think is better than strncpy
in fact the heapsort algorithm works this way first arrange a random order into heap order and then obtain a sorted order somewhat less efficient than quicksort on average
getting much more information is needed in the packet header for connection less like udp but why the header size of udp is less than tcp
in high-level programming languages the choice between a boolean and an int is really more of code readability supportability than one of efficiency
why is memcpy so much slower than memmove or hand rolled copy on the server
but then normal for-loop is far better for arrays than using for-in which is actually for object
so i guess it s the md5 in the dump output cause the conflicts and the hash value is longer than md5 outputs
hash ids are usually shorter than typical hash created by cryptographic hashing algorithms such as md5 or sha-256 and unlike these hash ids are usually reversible meaning we can decode the original value
the wrapper uses these in such a way that even the md5 implementation is significantly more secure than a simple hash
if end up using the memory anyway calloc is still faster than malloc and memset but the difference is not quite so ridiculous
multiplication is nearly always a lot slower than addition
using a higher key size results in larger primes and modulus which makes it harder to factorize the modulus to get the primes out of it to then reveal the private key
probably more popular than xquery is xpath which is the basis of xslt transform
this is way more efficient than sorting and filtering in php
you should use strcpy or strncpy safer than strcpy to copy the string stored in the array between arrays
shouldn t a subclassing interfaced be able to take in more than the superclass interfacec and use the same method
strncpy is safer than strcpy
because addition is faster than multiplication and can be faster than shift
if there is lot of data exchange then a binary format like protobuf or thrift or avro is better
xapian is slightly more difficult to setup but is much faster than whoosh
with tcp its slightly slower than udp and has more features
you can take a look at timsort which for non completely random data performs better than quicksort they have the same asymptotic complexity but timsort has lower constants
in your code on line in the for-loop does no more point to an arrays --the compiler has no information about the length of the variable that it s pointing at whether it is an arrays a single chars or an int or something else-- but it is just a plain pointer presumably a pointer pointing to a default int
apart from that tcp packets by themselves are not slower than udp packets and data transfer with a simple tcp connection can be faster than with a simple udp connection because flow control and reliable transfer is already integrated and you don t have to reinvent everything again and often worse
tcp is faster for when using a few connections the important difference is that modern nics perform significant amounts of acceleration on tcp and not really that much for udp
so we can see that an optimised while loops is faster than a for-loop by 2 operations however it uses more stack space
floating-point calculations are more expensive time-wise than fixed-point which is why fixed-point remains popular in microcontrollers and embedded systems
the reason for the second case much slower on sorted data is that a while-loop is cheaper than the equivalent for-loop when there are zero iterations
however dsa verification expect verification calls to be 100x issue is about 10x slower than rsa verification
ram is much faster than disk
notice that besides using the filter method or not even with a plain for-loop is much better for performance create a new arrays from scratch instead of mutate the current one multiple times
edit keydown is a little better than keyup for the element bind now enter key fails silently-ish
generally swing is more efficient and advanced than awt
in computer 1 the eigen3 performance is worse because the number of total processors virtual + physical - â due to hyperthreading is greater than the number of physical processors
i am a bit suspicious of the performance because modulo tends to use division which is slower than your subtraction operations
and wikipedia says that snmp can be run over tcp ip but udp is more common
those approach that you are using trys to make a number integer if a fractions part is less than 1e-6 0.000001
by comparison des see section 3.2 and other block ciphers are much faster than the rsa algorithm
from experience i can tell you udp is about 10-15 faster than tcp on dedicated and udp-tuned networks
i just want to learn why fast inversion algorithm is slower than math.h sqrt function
the problem is that tcp creates bigger packages of data while udp uses 8 kb of data blocks
easiest way is to simply recognize that division is nothing more than the multiplication of the dividend y and the inverse of the divisor x
floating-point division is typically faster than integer division on the cpu
using a non-reversible hash such as md5 is much more secure and you can store the hash value as clear text
ironically ancient x86 instruction rep stosq performs much better than sse and avx in terms of memory copy
therefore i conclude that division is faster than multiplication
because sml is eagerly evaluated the execution model is far easier to comprehend and debugging via printf works a lot better than in haskell
you can indeed show that on average quicksort will do more comparisons than heapsort roughly 1.44 n log 2 n for quicksort versus n log 2 n versus heapsort
and keep in mind that the modulo has a higher precedence than addition and subtraction
because there is no confirmation on udp packets it s slightly faster than tcp
for some problems character level n-gram do better than words level and logistic regression parameters
purely in terms of the number of comparisons performed is mergesort always more efficient than quicksort
ever since i did sockets programming on a pdp 11 it s been the case that ip fragmentation will take care of the case where an ip datagram such as a udp datagram is larger than the mtu for the segment allows
that tree is a binary tree in the sense that each node has only two children but the child nodes aren t less or greater than their parent node
rsa is much slower than aes
however heapsort is somewhat slower in practice on most machines than a well-implemented quicksort
can you explain me why in this case the parfor loops is slower than the for-loop
this means that while the two underlying sorts it uses mergesort and insertion sort are both worse than quicksort for many kinds of data timsort only uses them when it is advantageous to do so
i m writing a c# class to perform 2d separable convolution using int to obtain better performance than double counterpart
are writers and readers faster than outputstream and inputstream
also sending receiving data over udp is much simpler than over tcp and it does not require any connections
in some cases on embedded platforms where a fast hash function may not be available these may be more efficient than hmac
so here the unchecked exception-handling is better to use in order not to copy and paste all that ugly try-catch block rethrowing an exception-handling and add the throws clause to the method
so it looks like the simd implementations give a 2x or more improvement over 64bit scalar code although 256 bit simd doesn t seem to give any improvement over 128bit simd and that typical throughput should be a lot faster than 5 gb s
nsstring has a higher level it also inherited form nsobject const on it should have no effect in fact not the same meaning about the no effect on immutable object
multiplication is much faster than division
std ostringstream is much better for that kind of thing
i am confused why tcp throughput is bigger than udp
so if we have a vector and want to calculate a component-wise function over it say sin and cos it is faster to use vvsincos from accelerate because it will pipeline the calculations of sin and cos for all the entries in the vector which is faster than using a for-loop over the vector
your while loops would be better written as a for-loop
it is true that division and modulo a division operation is slower than addition
the calculation language is dax which is an improvement on the horrible mdx - dax reads more like excel functions
for formatting a single numeric value tostring is marginally more efficient than string.format because string.format has a bunch of overhead to parse the format string out of the curly braces and then pass it to tostring
first of udp s datagram is simpler than tcp s one
it appears that you consider modulo to have lower precedence than multiplication and division when in fact it does not
if i d directly say that udp is faster comparatively than tcp that it is used for such applications
my question is why do both integer and floating-point multiplication execute faster than their addition counterparts
if you send a udp datagram larger than the mtu it will be fragmented
strcpy is notoriously unsafe as are it s cousins strcpy_s and strncpy although they are mildly safer than strcpy
if the dominant memory usage is program data structures then i wouldn t be at all surprised to find pypy using significantly less memory than cpython whether or not the jit was enabled
multiplication is a relatively complex operation and is likely to be slower than say addition or comparison
floating-point may be somewhat slower than integer but it s generally
note that the exponent operator has a higher precedence than multiplication and division just like in mathematics
xilinx tools suck but their raw silicon is better than altera
scheme has fewer libraries than common lisp
use having clause to filtering the grouping which is having more than fkey
