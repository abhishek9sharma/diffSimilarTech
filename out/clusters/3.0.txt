linearlayout if its width and height is larger than the screenmy current code will rotate but will crop the edges if the height is larger then the widthif the height is less than the width then it leaves the height at 4 units and scales the width to maintain the correct aspect ratioif the sum of all the listview item s height is greater than the screens height you switching the layout type for one where you have a viewgroup relative layout with a listview without the footer on the top and a linearlayout at the bottom the desired footerand the height is smaller than the width physicallywhich means if viewport width is more than 970 and viewport height is more than 0 serve banner with size 300x250the bottom line is that decoding jpg is going to be slower than say png or gifbut if i give specific numbers for width and height it looks smaller or really huge but not the right dimension where its clear and is exactly same as what was clicked in camera or chosen in galleryif the image is 500x800 it should be presented as is as it takes up the entire available width and height is no bigger then the container s visible heightif you only wants to stretch resize the image to fit to div which is greater than div height or width then use this cssnow the width is here greater than equals to 42.0 and the height is greater than equals to 21.0i would when the height is bigger than the width the width 100 height autoin english when a page is initialized look through every image on the page that has a width and if it s larger than the width of the device erase the height and set the width to 100i want to prevent the two divs to be placed under another if the parent width becomes smaller than the children combinded widthif the image height or width is greater than imageview scale down should be performedif you care about height more than width is a better answerif you have a portrait device the width is smaller than the heightif the intersection height is greater that the intersection width then it is a horizontal collisioni am not aware of any device that can use api 14 with a screens density lower than hdpias your container height is less then the image you have to rely on this otherwise set width height screw background imageis there any way using only css to set a div s height to be never greater than its widthas this height will need to be adjusted as the browser width gets smaller i have tried to call the function which does this calculation on window.onresizei was wondering how to get the height and width of an image if i m rendering it react style so i can process it to flip it to portrait mode if the width is larger than the heightit applies to window objects but also to scrollable frames and elements with the overflow css property set to scroll or auto when the element s explicit height or width is less than the height or width of its contentsps the image source width and height is always bigger than the width and height parameters and the width and height ratio is being preservedi suspect ios just sets the landscape flag if the usable width is larger than the usable heightthe panels itself is larger than the form and is scrollable autoscroll truethis guarantees that the background image will never be smaller or larger than the height but the width is variable to the aspect ratio of their browserit because your border size is bigger than your width and heightwhat i want to do is that everytime the width of the image is wider than the height of the image i want to rotate the picture by 90 degrees clockwise into landscape layout mode save it on app s documents folder and then present it on the screen - this way the picture of the widescreen tv appears 90 degrees rotated but the image aspect ratio is not totally destroyedand opposite if height is greater than width then resize height to 500 pixels and scale width accordinglyi tried mp4 and webm and sometimes the file size after i convert to mp4 is smaller than webm but it is also sometimes larger than the original file sizei need display photo to fill full width and when image is higher than imageview height it can be scroll up and downimplement normal different sized circle packing than resize all circles so the biggest is no bigger than planet max size and the distances between them is bigger than min distance x1-x2 2+ y1-y2 2 mindistance for each pair of circlesmy problem is when i decrease the window width and the text wraps height is higher than image height it starts to align to the top of imagehere s an example of the width being less than the height and then rotated 90deg.if boxes 4 and 5 are together higher with margin than box 3 it should be stretched in height so they are horizontally aligned as shown in my imagethis also explains why this adjustment can be more than 0.5 if the height of the form is less than its width the adjustment can be more than 0.5 the max value is width divided by height but in the other case the max value is 0.5now if the div with has margin 660px from the left it should be hidden because it s margin is higher than the maximum width of the main containerunfortunately 100vw includes scrollbar width so if page content is higher than window height the annoying horizontal scrollbar appearsnow when i maximize the frame and the click the button the dialog opens up with a proper width that matches that of the frame but with a height that is less than that of the jframei m not fully sure how this should work on desktops but i m pretty sure that when you resize the browser the orientation should change provided the height was bigger than the width and after resizing it s the other way roundi ve also experimented with the line-height also when decreasing both height and line-height to 1 px the added height gets worse and font-size i ve put the height and width as attributes instead of inline css a div inside the td etcif width is more than 150 i will reduce the width to 150 and i will calculate the heightthe svg should never be smaller than his width or heightin this case i obviously would like to find the height sequence because the value 60 stands out more than the width or the depthconvert it to png 10-30 smaller than gif on averagethis is for the case when the height of the image is larger than the widthif auto then grid stretches its width and height to fit its content hence why your grid.width is greater than windows widthit depends what is your default stylesheet like if you want to tell the browser that when the width is smaller than 700px apply these styles but as soon as the height goes smaller than 600px over ride these styles with these new valuesyou need to check if xpos is less than height ypos is less than width and both are greater than or equal to zeroyour method might yield performance that is good enough for your needs particularly if your width height is less than the full screen resolutionit might help to reduce your gif file sizes smaller oh and i believe -depth 8 can only be used for png imagesif the width of the bitmap is greater than the height the returned image is in landscape so i rotate it 90 degreesin my cellforrowatindexpath i detect the width of the device and if the width is less than 480 i set the image to the screens width and then set the height to the images height images width screen width to keep the image scaledif i set the page format with height is smaller than width it is treating it as a4 paper and feed the bottom of the paperi believe the aspect ratio is defined as width height so does that mean that the vision framework cannot detect rectangles that have a width bigger than heightif width is way more than height for the 16 9 aspect ratio it s still scaled appropriately just missing the top bottom part of the video in see-able viewthe problem is when a users browser s height is smaller than the popup the overflow css property adds the ability to scroll which is what i want but it also adds its own width inside the popup causing one product to move down to next lineyou do this by dismissing all variations where the width is lower than the depth so for each i w i d i and then dismissing the variation where the height is not the highest nor the lowest of the three dimensions because the other two variations can go one on top of the other and this one can t join inthe height property is working fine in it but width is larger than i specifiedtake screenshot of rotated screen and while uploading turn the dimension to portrait if their dimension is landscape i.e width is greater than heightif you want to use the css3 ui resize feature then your browser decides whether you can make it smaller or bigger than declared width or heighti resize the image if its width is more then 225 and height automatically fix with that widthhowever if the width changes in such a way that the height is now smaller than then view port then i need to check the height and bring it back up to the view port height which should expand the width again but it doesn tthis might be made smoother by setting margin 0 mpx where m is a magical number of pixels that might be close to 1707px - page layout width in px 2 but you would have to try it to seemy issue is if the image height is greater than the width there is a lot of white space left to the right of the image see attached however the height is finewhen height is greater than width set width and auto stretch heightthe panels must be side by side for a large screens but they must be responsive and as the screens gets smaller and switching to vertical orientationjpg png is slower to draw than a bmpi want to add media queries for a div to change position when the screen width is smaller than 820px and or height smaller than 615px so i made thistry with 1 column-count and as text get bigger than available height it will auto split in to second column - columns 1 150pxif the content leads to a width that is less than 100 of the table s containing block then setting the left right margin to auto will center the table within the containing blockif the length of field s meetingpurpose value is less than the width of the textfield it prints beautifully however if the length causes the text to wrap and stretch the textfield the text is baseline shifted down 1 2 x heightbasically you make your cells float with 20 width so 5 per row and height 100 of the container then you can change this height if the parent has more than 5 children cellswhen you fit one side of image to background you will face with two problems first one is screen width is bigger than image s width or screen height is bigger than image height.so you will have empty spacei added animation but this view can t be higher than scrollview height so i need to make this width and height after gesture like viewcontroller s view height and widthand you also set width of .topcolortile div.topcolorcard by 375px it s wrong here you can not set with of child node larger than width of parent column-countfor width i can use margin 0 auto but height is trickier because it would need to make a div absoluteps if i use width 100 instead it will work but will cause some troubles on pages where the height is more than the height of screenthe original image height is higher than its width woo no surprise so faralternatively you could set a width on your draggable which is less than twice the width of your droppable area or combine a set width with one of the above options for a better user experienceplease help...this is the problem of one sony experia model.whose height is more but width is less.this particular layout is working fine where the height and width is almost adjusted in physical devices.like samsung and htci have a gallery with different image sizes the custom layout is below for gallery its working correctly if the image width is les than height but if image height is less than width its not working correctlytexture width or height is larger than the device supportswith jquery you can check if height is larger than width and vice versaif device screens destiny is more than mdpi - use default values folderi want this image to be cropped horizontally if the device width is smaller than image width and to have 100 of heightso the drop-down menus will stretch to fit the width of there parent and if any of their children is longer than that width their width should increase to adaptbecause i have bigger font size for hdpi screens and it goes smaller with ldpi screensit will always be a web format which basically comes down to jpg png and gif with gif being very unlikely because of its limitations gif can contain 256 colors at most and is generally larger than pngtiff â any bit depth any compression lossy or lossless everything including the kitchen sink â and no better than pngi have appbar whose height is greater than device widthif height is bigger than the width it s height won t be 100 only it s width in all cases will be 100it will adapt the video frame height to landscape mode and it will play the video in the landscape mode whether or not a portrait mode is more suitablebut if i look at in the firefox responsive design developer mode the circle takes always more space than it should when the wrapper containers height is larger than its width -topbar portrait height is bigger than topbar landscape height everywhere except iphone 6 plusif image width is larger than height landscape then scale the height to 1024 pixels and scale the width to appropriate value to maintain aspect ratioyou could adjust the height of the iframe if the scrollbars are present just check the iframes scrollwidth against it s offsetwidth and if the scroll width is higher increase the height of the iframe by the height of the scrollbar prolly 5-10px i d have to check to be sureit works well when height is bigger than width but it does not work when width is bigger than heightokay here is the problem i have images of different sizes but that doesn t really matter because their width is always greater then their height and all images are resized to a 100px width height still is different in each imageif the width is greater than 320 or the height is greater than 480 it should scale in a way so that it becomes as close to 320x480 as possible but by keeping the proper proportion of width to heightwhen working with a portrait photo the height is greater than the widthif height is higher than width then do as you re doing nowafter doing this i got error that width and height parameters should be less than width and height of bitmapnone of the above solutions seem to work if the width height is less than the line resolution of quality you selectfor the dragging to be jerky like this the width and height of the stage must be 256 and less than width 1050 and height 293if the image has a greater width than height than it should be as wide as possible to 340pxadd a new row until height is greater than widthso if i set height attribute to 40 i might find myself with images larger than 120 widthset its imageview right margin to negative value so the width of the image is greater than width of the screenthe result is the bitmap is the full height of the imageview and the width is much largerhere is some code for you we are first setting up a picture array to compare against that has very large dimensions we are then looping though your arrays arrays to find an image that has both the width and height that is greater then 130 but the area is less then the selected imagesometimes when enough content items is added this div height is larger than windows and part of div content is not visible at all it stays bellow page marginthis works very well with videos but not with other iframes such as a twitter tweet in which the iframe has larger width than the height leaving an empty vertical spaceas you ve said width of zero and height of 1000 will give you vertical scrolling on a screen smaller than 1000 heightwhy is css adding more than 2.5 margin from the top when only the width is increasedthe third url works fine when the image width is larger than the height landscape but when the height is the largest dimension portrait it resizes the height correctly but the width dimension does not get padded to fill the 600px width but instead becomes whatever size is calculated to maintain the aspect ratiothe caption for the vertical slider demo in the ie documentation erroneously indicates that setting height greater than width will display a range slider vertically but this does not workon the linked example they used a wrapper outside the nav .navbar-wrapper with an absolute placement and a top margin of 20px when the viewport width is larger than 768pxi have report with width size is bigger than height size like landscape but set to portrait in format - page format ireportwhen viewed on a screens wider than a tablet to be responsive according to the smaller screens size like thisalso your css for .character has the width 170 narrower than the height 245 which would be a portrait view but your example shows a landscape viewthis should allow you to solve for your concern about aspect ratios i ve tried using vmin but that does not help as the height of the window is almost always smaller than the widthso can i change the background image for a div when the device width is smaller than heighti use the ctframesettersuggestframesizewithconstraints function to define the size my attributed string will need but the height i get is smaller than it should be and also the width is bigger than the constrainsize.width parametermaking the script that generates the svg smarter to put in appropriate values for height and width is a better solution but for now just settingdespite them being set to the same numbers the column width is much larger than the row heightbut if it is bigger than 25px width or 25px height it needs to be resized to fit into those dimensions keeping its proportionsif the app is running on a tablet or in a landscape view where the screens is larger than certain width i d like the listviews to have the data-inset property set to true and be rendered with rounded corners and bordersor div s width and height is greater than img s width and height.i updated the query to select only images whose width was greater than the height so as to only select a landscape imageif i remove this code the width of green image in firefox becomes smaller but it s still bigger than necessary about 100px the google-chrome images keeps unchangedi d like to do this with media queries so that if someone on a mac with a big monitor has their browser window sized so that it s very tall height is greater than width they would see a header and footeri want to know if the device screen width is larger than heightnegative values for mouse.box x y and values greater than box width and height have mouse outsidetooltip text is more scrollbar is displayed to scroll through toit only seems to display when the height is greater than the widthif width is greater then height then it is landscape orientation and it converts all the values under landscape column into jsoni mean i want to move all the .tif files which result of width height is less more than a certain valuebut there s has got to be a better more elegant way i m taking the length of the wider value between height and width of the rectangle and using every number in between that and 0 and testing that against each of the 4 sides of the rectangle and see if it s in itas you can already see from these dimensions the captured image s width is smaller than its height whereas the uiimageview s width is larger than its height - the proportions are differentif image width height is larger than that of container than image height is 100 of container and image is cropped by widthnote when width more than 320 or height more than height of the view it ll scrollthe first-child column has 10 pixels or whatever the margin size is greater content area width than it s siblingsthe reason your bodies may be numerically unstable is because the ratio of the width to height is greater than the normal sizes of objectsthe button itself has an elevation greater than the imageview and textview so even though they are defined after the button they will still be below it in elevation and be invisiblethe title goes in a h1 for example and the text in a p or div so set these two elements to have a left margin greater than the width of image athe returned url has a profile photo scaled according to your specified width and height and is cropped more or less to the profile owner s intentthis demo illustrate the change from landscape to portrait using css orientation when the window height is higher than its widthmy goal is when inner divs height or width becomes smaller than 100px then automatically re-size containerlandscape orientation is that one where the width is bigger than the heightgives a way to make the margin transparent but they are still there and the plot is smaller than height and width i set in the saved filein the image the square represents a fixed size imageview the rectangle is a textview which can 1 line smaller height than imageview or multiline height is larger than imageviewbutton width is 2px greater in ie7 and button height is 4px greater in ie7if this value is greater than the width height of the above calculation then you need to use this valuewhile on portrait you should set trail and lead constraints as your height is bigger than the width so if you set 0 for trail and lead and 1 1 ratio you are safe that it will fit beautifullyit isn t rendered when either the height or width is less than 200pxit respects both width and height while widht 100 or height 100 works unless the window width height is not smaller then image itselffor images with height larger than width it s the following line that causes errorin the other case when the height is greater than the width then the field at and can be calculated using that arithmetic sum and the rhomboid can be imagined as a rectangle with x-value x and y-value y- w-x-1my camera by default is in landscape mode therefore it takes pictures with a width much larger than the heightset the width of the browserâ s window to make sure the height of the green box is greater than the height of the red boxi m not interested in the height only the width they won t be the same - the size will be dynamic but i can presume the height will be larger than the widthi m looking to take a folder worth of images and have php determine their size and then write their code depending on whether the width or height is highermy question is when we declare box-sizing border-box and the total width of content and padding and border are larger than the width that is declared for the element how does the browser solve this caseif width is bigger than the height it s width won t be 100 only it s height in all cases will be 100suppose you were to choose a new tablet and you wanted it to have 1 a big screens and 2 a screens that is bigger than 20cmfor a quick fix you can check if image s width is bigger than image s heightwhen i run the app the height is more than that i set in my storyboard width is fine but i change the height of the view nowhereworks very well but only happens if the width is less than 600px and the height is less 400px the two conditions have to matchfor example let s say width of one image you want is 200px then also you d like to have some space as margin between images too so let s say if browser width is more than 700px then we ll have images on the same row else we ll have them one below the otherin addition to that you can also check at run time if width is greater than height programmatically set width as match parent and height as wrapcontent and vice versato do so you will also need to check if the new width height is bigger than the original and change all the elements accordinglyeither the width 1348 or height 35667 is larger than max_gantting_sizeyou should first check if maxsizex is greater then the width or the maxsizey is greater than the heightthe big.jpg has more width than height so when it s resized the wrapping containers get the correct new height but they still have the old widththe width is greater than the height so our calculations arebut keep in mind that the gif color palette is way smaller than pngi have the size to 10 less than the width and 10 less than the heighti want to place the footer after both of image and content text whenever the window width is small and the image height is small less than the content textbox heightbecause of the margin the width is more than 100 and the last -element goes into a new linecheck if the image s width is bigger than its heightessentially what this does is check whether your image view s width height is smaller that the screen s width height and if so create an inset of half the screen s width height you could probably make this larger if you want the image to go out of the screen boundsthe text is vertically centered on google-chrome and firefox but on ie 7 and 8 the baseline of the text is centered instead so it is several pixels higher than in firefox .if the width of the browser is more than height it is land scape otherwise it is portraitalso i need the most outer div to have 100 height and width cover the whole page and the descendants to calculate their height accodringly except for those divs whose content height is greater than theirs they should show a scrollbarand a width and height that is less than the size of the element s contents doesn t work very well when tags all need explicit height and widths or where layouts due to lack of float support and erratic treatment of s by necessity need to be based on tables most of the timeso you can get your image coordinates before moving it and you can compute measure of movement in your ontouchlistener class.now if x coordinate of your image plus horizontal movement that you computed be greater than device width or y coordinate of your image plus vertical movement that you computed be greater than device height your image not moveif width is bigger than height print image-horizontal else print image-verticalbut when i try to upload an image with a width higher than the height i see that the lines that output vh vw return zeroi noticed some very peculiar behaviour of the site which is pages whose height is greater than or equal to the max vertical pixels occupy a certain width while pages whose content does not fill the height have a different width even though the code for the menu is exactly the same.why does this happen and what is the remedythe right image doesn t look like a square the width is larger than the heightyou have this issue because height in landscape mode is lower then in portraitvertical position altitude needs one more satellite in view at least 4 so is not always reliable if gps sees only 3 satelitesassuming that the units are the same you ll probably want to set the radius based on the y-data dimension because your figure width is greater than the figure heightessentially i detect if the view s width is larger than the height and if so rotate the view that contains the boxesfor certain constellations switching from a 4-column to a three-column layout when screens size decreases more complex measure may be neededfor example png has better support for transparency than gif or jpegit seems to work by seeing if the width is bigger then the height landscape so it also works on desktop really wellanyway i checked your code ..your mistake that you always calculate knopafmeting based on width that is correct if height is equal or greater than widthas long as the height of the window is smaller than that height plus 30 pixels you set the width of all elements with to 10 less than the width of the first one of themif width of text element is bigger than width of container decrease font-size by some value for example by 0.1px and go to step 3you just set the div with border-radius so that it is a circle and background-color is the more transparency color in the circlei m calculating the width based on the div height if the height is greater than the screen widththis gave the uiimageview a portrait size greater height than width even though the app is locked in landscape modemy children views may be a different width but it not be bigger than parent view#footer s height is more than 800px so the #container should lose its top margin value by touching #footer and continue scrolling the page without that floating divi have found some problems in displaying images larger than 10000px width or height in spark image componentyour imageview in landscape is smaller than portraitto avoid cropping either top if width is more or left if height isi am essentially stating if an has the class of cboxphoto then run the each function to add the class of relative if the image width is greater than x it s height is greater than xif set true then it might increase the width or height if the given width and height are bigger than original width and heightit works fine when the image is square or the width is not too much more than the heightthe motivation is that font size 12 under kde seems to be much larger than under gnomewould calculating text width and then making sure it s less than textbox width height howthe image is resized to some height but i don t know the size of this image so if the width of the image is bigger than width of the vbox this happen part of the image hidden bnow pen style thumb width is much bigger than height show correctlythis is because the height of the second image is greater than the widthwhen you are using the orientation landscape you have to consider whether the keyboard popup will change the display once the width size is larger than the height size the css will consider it as landscapeany suggestions on how to obtain the current size to pass to the method below in which the width would be greater than the height since its in landscape modewhen the window resizes the image width grows with it but i want to change the alignment to the top when the image height is larger than the banner heightthe trick sets a big padding to all columns in this case 10000cm note it must be a number larger than the height of the tallest column and removes extra space with a negative marginnow get the width and height of the uibuttons and compare if the lastpressedbutton.frame.origin.x will be less than width or -width awaythe canvas height is slightly larger than the widththis is used in a situation that view s width height is bigger that its parent s width heighti need to resize the image when the height or width is bigger than 700pxheight works fine but the parent div has image s real width wich is larger then computed widthcheck if object 1 s y + height is greater than object 2 s y + height and that object 1 s x + width is greater that object 2 s xlet say i download image that height or width is larger than 2048pxexample if using dp unit hdpi device will have 1.5 240 160 times larger than mdpimake sure you define to return a size that s bigger than cgsize width 0 height 0if width is greater than height return the proportional height otherwise return the targeti guess it s because the height to width ratio is more than 4 3 so it s cropping the height to give a width of 300i think you had situation like map widget get added to a panel having width and height greater than width and height of map widgetin a two column table where both columns are set to valign top and the text is set to text-align baseline if an image exists in the first row of the second column and the image height is taller than the text itself the text in both columns is not alignedif its height is greater than the one given it should scale down to the desired height and scale the width as wellmedia screen and height less than widthmedia screen and width greater than heightmore likely all images are in landscape layout greater width than height so the visualization is correct from a technical point of viewbut there seems to be a problem while this works for most images some especially those who have a much greater width than height aren t displayedsecond if a notification image is displayed from facebookâ s database and the height is larger than the width and also the height exceeds the maximum image height for the notification the entire image will be resized to fit the maximum allowable height for the notification image leaving white vertical bars on either sidewhen text records in autocompletetext are more than its height automatically vertical scrollbar appears but why when length of text is bigger than autocompletetext width scrollbar doesn t appearthis means that your draggable is the full width of the container which is much wider than the droppable and thus can t possibly intersect by 50if you resize your browser window to still have a viewport with a with equal or less than 1024px but have an height greater than your width the viewport is no longer considered to be in landscape mode but switch to portrait modeyou would then need your height to be 2 times bigger than your widthonce your image have a width higher than height you need to set only the new width and let the browser do the trick with the new heighttake the max of the child s preferred height or a hard-coded minimum whichever is largerif the width is smaller scale the image so it has the minimum width and crop it so it has the proper heighti have a bxslider which is full width of the page when theyre is not enough slides to make it slide i want the slides to center inside the wrapper i have tried using text-align center and margins etc but i still can t seem to get them to center as bxsliders wrapper width is alot bigger than the screen widthbut 3x assets should have a width and height that is 1.5x larger than their 2x counterparts not 2x largerthis makes it more flexible across devices regardless of orientation not to mention width height is more widely supported than orientationfor example detected rectangles should have width which is longer than their height in your casethe drawn circle which as the same radius as the bitmap s width and height is slightly larger than the bitmapthis is a common issue when centering taller children than the parent using the absolute vertical centering methodbitmap data always has a width and a height just take a look at the numbers and if the width is less than the height rotate the image as per alistair3408 s answeri would like to split the image into tiles so that each tiles area must be larger than a min tile area eg 1024 bytes and smaller than max tile area eg 2048 bytesalso ordering by width and height separatelly is much more eficient and produces the desired resultbut if we need a mechanism to animate even if the change is greater than the width height of the map how can we do thatthe box is never too small infact the margin of the adjacent div is bigger than the width of ul divyou ll need to change the width and height settings so that the width is larger than the heighti would like somehow to fit the image to scale it normally without setting up fixed values for width and height so if the width is bigger - scale the height and if height is bigger - scale the widthi have created a chart using highcharts and i want to disable any datalabel if its width is more than height of its bar bar cannot accomodate the datalabelif the height is less than the width then rotate through 90 degreesif you have children that have a smaller height than their parent floats will bring them to the top whereas inline-block will screw up sometimesi am trying to resize the image based on if the height is larger than the width or width heighti do not want to actually cut down the size of an image i just want if the width of an image size is more than the width of webpage then the tool should set its width to my specific given width and the height accordinglyi am more concerned with width and heightwhat i mean is i want the full height of the image to be displayed but if the width is wider than the container allows using bootstraps grid system then just overflow hiddennote also that if you change the height when resizing an event will still fire even if the width is smaller than 300px but the reported width remains the sameso think about the video source file if you can deliver it with a width height that is more suitable for smartphones maybe different files for different display sizessigmoid approximates clamp never smaller than min never larger than maxmost popular video formats are 4 3 or 16 9 so the width is larger then the heightdoing this i run into trouble when the texture width height is greater than 888x888i am trying to use fragments in android and want to display fragment1 when width of display is greater than height of display and fragment2 when height of display is greater than width of display but when using getwidth and getheight android studio is saying that these methods are depricatedmake sure that the parent container has a width and that this width is at least larger than the children elementswidth must be more big than height and want it responsivei have an image in my site which it s height is bigger than it s widthmy problem with this is that the calculation works fine in the portrait mode but as soon as i switch to landscape mode the distance between bottom and button is bigger than in portrait modefor example if width is greater than height then resize width to 500 pixels and scale height accordingly so that original aspect ratio is preserved5- delete all the contours that width is more than its height delete the very small contours the very large ones and the not rectangle contoursi would like that if the width is smaller than 540px the input fields automatically resize to full width with a margin of 10px at both sideswhen width of the image is greater than height set height to a fixed value and auto stretch widthi have a fullscreen image standard 16 9 that scales proportionally unless the users height is larger then the widthbut when the height img is more than 500px or when the img width is more than the width of the carousel the img overflows the carouseli know that obviously a tablet has a higher screens resolution than a phone because it has more pixels dots on the screens from what ive been reading tablet also have a higher dpi dots per inch than phones as wellproportionally the hdpi screens is slightly taller than the mdpi screensthis may be ommited once height is lower than available - thus negative margin may workedit okay so the real problem comes when you try and make your container that fluid because height is harder for a browser to calculate than widthin ff 26 as you resize the width the svg height just keeps getting larger and is never constrained by the divhowever the scrollbar pushes my content to the left by the width of the scroll bar so when i navigate to a page where the height is less then the page height there s a noticeable jump as the page width resizesafter switching to windows 10 i ve noticed that when selecting a lower than normal screens resolution the panel fit mode will default to maintain aspect ratio meaning black bars appearalso make it so it ll always be centered horizontally and vertically and the width will always be 1.5x bigger than the heighti am trying to make all a row of 4 images all have the same height size i already tried to play around with the width and height using css but nothing seems to work the portrait images always end up taller than the landscape ones here s the codewhen i put an h2 tag into this form area ie reports that the box is taller than the height i assigned by the height and margin padding i gave to the h2 tagother approaches like making the element s width larger than height or using scale would result in an elliptical arc and it would also require tweaking to positioning attributes when height or width changesvw for landscape orientation since in landscape the viewport width is higher than its heightfor videos which are recorded vertically height is more than width the transcoded video generated does shrink verticallyit s has the same height but has more widthi have a collapsible panel that was designed in a way that the children green are wider than their parent redbut the problem i am facing if text is doted inside the label it calculates nsstring size less than uilabel size in the below codetry to change overflow hidden to overflow auto this should make it scrollable horizontally if width is bigger than screen and vertical if height isbut the problem is because the screen height is bigger than the width is makes image looks expanded in height like thisessentially my logic is when the window is re-sized and the width is less than 810px then remove all css styling and add margin top items 2 through infinityif the height of the image is greater than the width i just want to crop the heightin both cases plus minus same except in case where is the small checkbox the button is bigger on width maybe it is related with space for checkboxif the height and width is more than what i have declared it has display an error message in the formhowever the height was greater than the width indicating it was still in portrait mode .when the height is larger than the width - things are perfect like thiswhat i d like to do is make the button images slightly larger than the checkbox and have the text checkbox and both button on the same linethe div has a large backgroundimage larger than its width and heightcreate a nxn matrix such that n n is a power of 2 and n is larger than the width and height of the original imagethe image you are using should be less than total width and height of main windowthe goal is to have the top wrapper container green to take on the height of the vertical black wrapper and the left column wrapper to be no larger than the width of the rotated black wrapperi want to change my layout depending on if the width is greater than the heightall that is left is choosing between the two depending on if width or height is biggerthe table contains a checkbox column and a button column button column may contains more than 1 buttonthe code snippet above will check which dimension width or height is less or equal to 1 and it will resize it depending on the screen resolutionjust press save and give it a name and that photoshop image will be saved into a transparent background png file which presents more colors and it s smaller than a gif file and is as good as a jpgi can rotate it to any angle i want but i want to make the rotated square squashed making the height 2 3 smaller than the widththen you might need to check if height is greater than width then use height 100 else width 100 in javascripthi i m working on an application that will be loading images and i m looking to scale each image to it s largest possible size for instance if the image is a landscape image if width is larger than height i would like to stretch the width to fill the width of the phone and scale height to keep it s aspect ratiois there a way to threshold only if the blob size is more than height widthbut when i stretch the width to be larger than the height it crops the image even if i switch to object-fit containi just made the left margin of div2 greater than the width of div1 and it worked for meif you don t want to give padding or margin at all then set the line-height property of headings more than their font-sizeis jpeg format lighter than png or gifbut the problem is on resizing an image with 1920 x 1200 pixels as the height is much smaller than the widthif the width is bigger than the height i want the height to be set to autoin landscape the height is smaller than the widthif so then your job will be easier as the width and height of the image view can be defined by the width and height of the image ie the image view s intrinsic content sizethe above scaling assumes that the height of the grid location is always smaller than the width of the grid locationi extracted the solution from media query for browser size where width is less than heightif the width is greater than the fixed width bump the font-size down and then check the width againif width goes bigger height will goes biggerin between 768 1024 and only when width is longer than heightif the width or the height is bigger than 99 or 98 pixel most of the time i get an error message bitmap size too bigit would work perfectly if the aspect ratio of the div is 1 1 because vmin checks for the lesser value between height and width of the viewport directly and you can t set a custom aspect ratioothers because the width is larger than the height doesn t fit properly.that s why i crop them they must be centered in order to make sencei guess you are able to see the complete layout in portrait just because portrait layout is having more space and your complete layout is fitting well but landscape is having lesser spaceso never height is more than 150px and width is auto to this height to keep it s ascpet ratio and also fit in this divsimilarly if width is greater than height the top position of the rotated image is incorrectnow if i keep it like this the video is stretched and even though it looks like its a rectangle a part from the top and bottom of the video disappear being 1 1 the width and height are the same and the height is bigger that the screenif uiscreen mainscreen knows that i really want the height to be greater than the width whether or not i actually do how can i either query the actual dimensions or query whether the device is in portrait mode or landscapeeach cell is equal width height but is much more simple to use than jtablewhen dynamic div are placed if the content is larger than #bat width and height those content are overflowing.i can hide that using overflow hidden in #bat but i don t want it to be that waya common solution is to float your fixed-width column left or right and give the other column a margin equal or greater than the width of the fixed-width columnthis second snippet is the same as the previous one but now the height is 20 smaller than the width it was equal on the previous example plus have a max-height limit of 100pxi fixed the width and height this makes things easier and then rotated and translated the box to center it within the parentthe sidebar overlaps with main content is because the element .logo has fixed width 150px and fixed left right margin both 40px so the the whole width of the .logo element is 230px which is larger than width of #sidebar element when the page is narrow enough so #sidebar element is expandedand vice versa for the width if it greater than heighti found some info in the internet that core-image process images on cpu if any of it s size bigger than 2048 width or height or bothi m currently using a before element with padding-top 56.25 which works only with respect to the width of the outer div and overflows the outer div if the width is much larger than the heightthe content will be scrollable as soon as its width or height goes greater than 300pxhowever they seem to not resize the page if the height of the content is less than the height of the screen and then the width runs off screenso if an image is in landscape size the width is shorter than the height which throws things offbut uil loads my images correctly when their height is less than or equal to their widthit happens normally when child divs width or height is greater than the parent divexample if there is an object bigger than width and height that i ve set before that object can t be detectedif the widget s preferred width or height is less than the size of this scroll pane it is set to the size of this scroll panesuper is a lower bound and extends is an upper boundit is treating the floated ul as position absolute but only when its height is less than or equal to the negative top margin on its containing parentstart with the full string and the known two-line height of the label and its known width and keep cutting words off the end of the string until at that width the string s height is less than the label s heightif requested width or height of a window is larger than width or height of a screen desktop the function shrinks the values to the screen sizesi m running unicorn which is about 40 faster than thin on celadon cedarthis approach doesn t work when the width of the container is larger than the height as the child overflows the parent as demonstrated in the following snippetin this case if textview is higher then imageview imageview aspect ratio should be intact with max width possible and if imageview i higher then textview again width should be maximal and parent should have height as imageviewit has a uiscrollview that has the same width as the screen but it s height is smaller than the height of the screeni can t really give fixed height widths as i need the images the shrink down accordingly but the right hand side images will move to the next line if the window width becomes less than the container sthe size of the picture seems much smaller than the width 380 height 419 of the uiimagethe number will decrease if the matrix element count is greater than previous height width iterationthe image renders but then when i try to pinch zoom in and out only the height of the picture changes bigger or smaller with the width stuck at the iphone screen widthwhen i specify text-align center for an element with a width that is greater than the width of the text the text is centered within the content box of the element as expectedafter the picture is taken the image is clear but is either shorter than the device height or the width is smaller depending on what device is being usedthe padding and margin are added to that width which makes everything wider than you would thinkas the user types if the text is longer than the width i need the height to growthe image is 120x100 but no matter what i do and how i resize it the excel spreadsheet always shows it spanning multiple rows and distorts it to a much bigger height than widthis set to portrait if the page width is less than the page heightfor example an image of 126x39 pixels will not be displayed as the ratio of width divided by height is greater than 3.0 126 39 3.23if image height is more than 1080 resize it with 1080 height and maintaining width with original aspect ratiohowever setting the maxwidth property of the infowindow should be a value above 247px so that whenever your content takes more than that width the height would increasethis works as i already said on some devices gt-i9000 and amazon kindle hd but on a nexus 4 the images that have a much bigger height than width tend to occupy the whole damn screenscale does not work for images where the height is larger than the widthi m trying use a grid layout but my problem is the layout showing bigger than my screens on the 240dpi tablet 1 5 times biggerso as i said - mdpi also doesn t means that your screens resolution is less than hdpi screens resolutionthe border-radius value doesn t matter so long as it s bigger than the height and width values to get a cirlceif you think about a moment this is exactly what you want - to know if width is smaller than height portrait the opposite landscape or if they are the same squareuse a rectangular element having width greater than the width of the vertical line and a height of 1if the width size is more than height size then the device is a tablet otherwise is a phonethis will wait for your element to be visible the element is displayed and has a height and width that is greater than 0you may think that percent value for width and height means that more percents from original image size but actual meaning of this value defined into specification is percent of size of containing blockwhen the width of the page is greater than the height the device isbut with iframe it is a problem - window height is always bigger than widthi want all of the images to fit inside the width of the text area which will change dynamically with the window size and i want them all to be the same height meaning of course that landscape images take up more horizontal space than portrait ones etcnow if a user uploads a picture with less height than widthmy goal scale an image width if the height is greater than the device heightfor example when the screens size becomes smaller to a tablet or mobile you could do this as an examplethe length of getdata is more than width heightdoes this mean that if or when i resize the width of the web browser on my desktop pc so the width is less than the height of the web browser the portrait.css file will override the current stylei ve come across this website and when you scale the page down to tablet size the logo which is ethan marcotte is in perfect ratio when the screens size gets bigger and smallerbut when i tested my game on tablet it fit perfectly in height but in case of width game view width was shorter than the tablet screens widthif the intersection width is greater than the intersection height the ball has hit in the bottom or vertical sides of the brickmargin using percent doesn t work cross browsers on flex items so if your margin s is more related to the viewport use viewport units vh or vw else you can combine px with css calc width calc 33.333 - 20px to match an equal gutter between the itemssurprisingly if i set the heightmeasurespec to a lesser value than widthmeasurespec still the item height gets larger than the widthnow this works when the width of an image is longer than its height but not the other way aroundif it s greater than the width the height of the textinput will increaseif i have an image whose width is greater than its height rotating that image using this method and then painting it will result in the image being painted vertically above the point 0 0 and horizontally to the right of the point 0 0this xml code works well if the image is a 1x1 ratio or if the height is bigger than the widthmy guess is that they are technically happening simultaneously but that the margin animation takes longer to complete than the width animationso the ring shape will be cropped if the width of the imageview becomes bigger than the heightif the height is greater than the width get the ratio by dividing the new height with the old one and finally multiply the width with the ratio to get the new width if the width is greater than the height you do the opposite like in the example code belowhere is another solution but make sure your image width and height is greater than the imageviewin your case in the 3rd circle the height and width of .bublina not same height is smaller than width thats why border-radius 100 is not making it circlei have an iframe inside a list i m using a slider and on google-chrome sets its size perfectly but on firefox it has a smaller sizecheckbox may be a better fit than button hereif the device width is smaller than height so the device is a tablet or a mobile phone in standard position and rotation usuallymost of my images have a bigger width than height so when i scaled them i just putand then switching their display-properties when the screens is smaller than x pxplease note that in html the radius cannot be larger than width 2 and height 2have you tried setting width to some as per your div and image ratio..just call a javascript to check width of image and of your div then accordingly set css attribute width of image to require percentage using script and height as auto.....and vice versa if height is moreensure that the bounds of the drawable produce a width and height which is greater than 0instead of the reaching 100 width the margin is causing less width for them due to the 20px x 12the gif format is substantially less capable than pngjust calculate the parent width and children container width using jquery and if the parent is wider than children container make a transform across x axis to shift all thumbnails to the left1vmax 1 of viewport height or width whichever is largersafari will display fonts without a specified size significantly smaller than in google-chromeif the button contents width is higher than it s height then the binding will force it s width lowerthe container should hide all what is longer as it width or heightanother layout for larger devices like tablet where the screens width is larger than your imagebut the button in your example is less than 15px wide so even with box-sizing border-box the button s width is pushed larger than your percentagenote this holds as long as the condition that the height is always greater than the width is maintainedto fix it you should set the image background bigger than screen width and height for example if you are using 900x600 in your anchor pane you should set your image to 920x620then it can happen where the height if the actual image is less than the width see attached so here because the fixed height is 250dp there is a lot of white space below the imageto answer your question monopsace characters have often a height two times bigger than their widthbut values from vectors are bigger than pagesize width and heightso this will make width proportional with the height that is set but the problem is when the width is bigger than heightjqgrid button height and width is smaller than normal buttons created using jquery ui button functionbecause the game window can be resized the image needs to be rescaled to a specific size this is easy with the width of the image which is just windowwidth - 128 however the height is harder to pull off because the bottom of the image is supposed to disappear off of the end of the windowto determine whether the image has landscape or portrait format simply check to see if width height is larger or equal to 1now my doubt is when i rotate it to portrait mode from landscape mode since the width of the textblocks present inside the itemtemplate of listbox is already defined when i rotate the it to portrait i am not able to see all the data present it cuts off since the width of the portrait mode is less when compared to landscape modeso that on ipad the view is not stretched but on smaller devices the view can be less than 320 width and have 20 pts of marginif height has a higher value than width the browser will be in orientation portraitthe problem is that all inline child elements get a huge margin above them even if their font-size is much smallerin onsurfacechanged you can check if your width is greater than your height and if it is you can query the orientation using the technique shown herein my highstock bar graph x-axis displays numbers if the category length is less than the max rangecheck that panel width is bigger than oval width and the same with heightx + button.getwidth to it and check if it is less than screen width if yes your x

320px width like iphone 5 the list of items is so long that there s not enough heightthe program does load a picture its width height always bigger than canvas width height and when i make a mouse click on the canvas it returns a x y - coordinates and color grayscale value but it always a coordinates of canvas not an image onesi seem to remember reading somewhere that if report height is smaller than width printout is automatically rotated to landscapei m sure that the width of #div-width-border is always greater than the height of the elementthe first imageview will be working like

not showing horizontal scroll barif the screen width is smaller than the height i need the white circle s radius to be width 2 and if the height is smaller than the width i need the circle s radius to be height 2how can i even get real image size at least height it s more important than width in my case from downloaded imageas of today no browser implements a vertical slider based solely on height being greater than widthhowever if the image width is far smaller than the height the image is centered which crops the topcompared to gif png offers better compression larger pallette and more features including transparencyit is regarded as landscape if the width is greater than the heightpass a value for width that is much larger than that for height and you will get a very wide figurehowever in my experience while this routine will return accurate origin and height information the width is typically longer than it should bethe height width ratio since the height of the text box is relatively smaller than the width and the area of the text boxtherefore assuming the container s width is greater than the image s height margin -50 0 should be enoughfor width larger than device width but height is same as device height the glsurfaceview will start drawing from top left corner which co-ordinate will be 0 0 and the extra image will be out of screen right sidei m trying

mobile showing the images with full screen width but cutting out the image parts which is higher than screen height javascript doing his job without problemcurrently i am using the universal storyboard and want the image to be 3 4 so the height needs to be 33 greater than the widthcheck it out it doesn t matter the width you set to the #content because naturalsize checks the ratio and the

appearmargin .67em 0 applies a top and bottom margin based on the font-size which is fairly large so that explains why the margin becomes larger when you disable the other onei upload expansion code to show photo by android camera on html as normal on some img tag with right rotaion especially for img tag whose width is wider than heighthowever the image is full width but not full height its more

pictures and frames cannot be rotatedhey all i am trying to figure out how to resize an image that has a higher height than widthhowever when i resize the window so that the width is less than the height it no longer renders at the correct x locationi would expect that the output width would be 200 and the height would be something greater than the height of a single line however it producesthe mouseover animation is 200ms longer than the mouseout so if you mouseover and mouseout in less than 200ms total the animations run in parallel and the mouseover one finishes last leaving the color redyou may need to crop if the image height is greater than the width so i decided to crop with dimensions equal to the width from the to left corner most likely you wont miss the face of the person this waybut the model is not fitting properly when the canvas width is less than height aspect ration less than 1right now you say if movetox y is 0 and less than the width height then add acceleration x ya 8-bit png shim is smaller than the same dimension 1 pixel gif and everything will still work as plannedthen when the width or height of the control is less than width or height of given size the suitable scrollbar will be showni am currently using the pagex and pagey event attributes but this is returning a value greater than the width and height of the image itselfis the height of the viewport larger than the widthportrait is taller landscape is widerbut it s easy enough using javascript to check whether the height is greater than the width a signature of portrait modein my actual code i ve set the display to none if the screens width is larger than tablet size because that s the only time i feel like i need the buttonif the total width of the inline boxes is less than the width of the line box the direction and text-align properties control how the boxes are distributed inside the line boxnow what i want is when difference between window width and current width is lower then 6 i want to change height of my elementthe problem i m experiencing is that when i use javascript to grab a portrait photo s properties when it s loading the height is significantly lower than what it should be and the width is bigger than it should bethere is no automatic clipping performed so you have to ensure that parameters top and left are not smaller than 0 zero and left + as well as top + are not greater than the width or height of the destination image respectivelywidth tends to be more knowable than height so on desktop you could do the old switcharoo to change their positionsbeing a rectangular image with greater width than height means it will fill 100 width but cut off part of the heightnew_x and new_y should be divided by the images height width not the container s height width which is wideron release the drawer should slide open if its margin is greater than half its width and should close if its lessif the window is smaller than max width the content fills 100 of the page unless it s smaller than min width which would make the horizontal scrollbar appeari m using the function window .resize to detect if the total width of all open windows plus some margin is greater than the window s width then hide the first chat window or show the last one if there s space for more windowsso the height cw + px sets the height to the size of the width and sets the top attribute to minus cr circle ratio times cw circle weight which results in positioning it either -10 of width when screen width is less than 400px or -30 of width when above 400pxthis will only be added if the screens width is smaller than 480px else the tablet version would show the mobile versionif width or height is greater than 1000px image should be validfrom what i remember there is something to do with the height-for-width drawing model that means when wrapping is enabled gtklabel etc request enough height to reflow the text for wrap-width even if there is more horizontal space available which leaves loads of empty space when the width is wideri m guessing that you are running into a scenario where the narrow width or height is less then 44 44 is the suggested guideline by apple as apparently that s how many pixels a finger touch coverscalling autosize in ie works great when i display the errors on login screen but on ff it returns height to be less than 20px and the modal popup seems to have a width but its height is less than 20#content has a left margin of -500px so when the width is less than 1000px it get moved off to the leftyou can remove the transform s and the margin-left and add a width set as 0 here smaller than the font-size 16px here to the get the effectif children height is greater than parent i need to set height of

and if above allowing itotherwise if the height of the image id greater than its widthjust be aware that screens size categories like xlarge for example aren t tied to a hard number like 10 inches. instead official documentation uses terms like an xlarge screens is defined as a screens that is significantly larger than a large screens such as a tablet or something larger ...check box width and change image width if needed then check if image height is greater than box height if not then doneit looks as though facebook s image upload limits have to do more with the width and height of the image being uploaded rather than purely file size in kb or mbof course this would have the problem that in displays where the width is bigger than the height there will be an area not covered by the videois the width of the viewport larger than the heightfor example if you know that you have no such object whose width or height is smaller than 50 pixel then you will put 50 as the increment in the nested loop either on width or height or both.that is why width is bigger than heightbut if the width is less than the height then the body width is 100with that #scrollable will be stretched to the height of its inmediate parent #scrollable-cover and its large content will render it like an scrollable box but since its width is 20px bigger than its parent which has an overflow hidden property the scrollbar will not be shown because it renders on the 20px hidden at the right of #scrollableanimated png is better than gif if we re focused on file size â achieving a smaller file size was one of the reasons the apng format was designedif the width of the label in interface builder the literal size in interface builder is less than the width of the view at runtime then the height of the container is too largei want to decrease the width when this div not fit s the browser anymore when the browser width is less than 1252+50+50px and i want the height to decrease but still keep the same ratio 1252x805but when the screens is smaller than 900px we switching from fixed to liquid via media query switching to a liquid width will allow our images to scale down our text to wrap and a whole bunch of other great thingsin this case you create a document of which the width is smaller than the height the mediabox is defined as a rectangle in portrait but you rotate that page adding a rotate entry equal to 90 to the page dictionarythis algorithm could be optimized if you rotate points or just exchange x-y coordinates so that width of the occupied area is not larger than its heightwhen a rectangle is drawn with some line width we have 3 sizes the outer size is equal to the clientrectangle size and the inner size is less wider than clientrectangle width and less higher than the clientrectangle heightgl_invalid_value is generated if width or height is less than 0 orif the height is greater than the width it will auto-calculate the middle and give you a perfectly centered square1 check if width is greater than heighthe only animates the margin-left margin-top width and height and sets a higher z-index for the blockthe width of the rect is pretty much as i would expect but the height is considerably taller than i would have expectedcurrently with the 10px top padding the cells in google-chrome look taller than in firefox3-1 if height is more over than width thenso how can i set the image to load as a square and be 100 width if the width is smaller than the height and 100 height if the height is smaller than the widthi have an image where the width is bigger than heightusing px as a measurement would actually be worse - as new tablet have high dpi screens meaning 100px is going to be visually smaller on a tablet than it would on a mid spec phonegif is smaller because it s based on an colour palette of 256 colours rather than the separate rgb values for each pixel or group of pixels in jpg and pngto do this i have created a function that checks the innerwidth and innderheight and if the width is greater than the height then happy daysthe size of the original image is reduced by 2 times recommended for fast decoding till the width or height becomes less than the specified valuesso when your window width is less than 959px your image will have width 100 but also the padding and margin pushing it to the rightsince my top content for the homepage is a fixed height through javascript i tried simply changing the top margin to the difference between the window height and that fixed value when window height is greater than the fixed valuein landscape mode the container s width somehow gets larger than its height as shown belowas per your expectation create a new emulator with height 800 more than the width 480please note - some images will be of greater height than width so any solution needs to work with images of all sizes centreing both horizontally and verticallyfirefox has like 40px less width than google-chrome in columns which is causing problemsif you use auto layout then there is a possibility that the width height becomes less than the minimum values providedhowever when i switching to landscape mode the listview is taller than the screenssince the image is always 100 of the viewport it gets smaller and smaller by height and width because of its aspect ratioso i want to change the height jwheight when the window width is smaller than 992pxor i can set the width to more than 36 and it appears to grow by width-36 but if for instance i set both the height and width of one of these narrow cells to the same number lets say 60px the height of what gets displayed is greater than the width and it appears as a rectangle not a squaremeaning if the height divided by width gives more than 1landscape pages can be created in 2 ways set a width larger than the height or set the page rotation to 90 or 270 degrees for a portrait pagein other words to check if the height is bigger then the widthi suspect that this has to do with the width height ratio of the webview s frame being changed since if the initial height of the webview is greater than content height this will also happenthen when an image is loaded the rectangle s style checks its triggers to see if the image has a height or width that is less than 100pxset the rect smaller than the width and the height of the screenhowever if the image has a larger width than height it will crop the width to the height and center the image and vice versaif the width to height ratio of the image is more than the width to height ratio of the screen then you know you ll be using the screen width and calculating the heightyour and are static which means and are always they same aswell respectively 5.1785714285714 and 2.55625 so width ratio is always higher then height ratioas you can see on this screenshot in my storyboard there are margins around the middle view however on iphone 4 where width is smaller these margins are lower they have lower priority as constraint while view retains it s width heightthe has text-align center so the will be centred if the size of the is less than the width of thei would like to resize the image when the image width is greater than the image height or vice versaturns out â œportraitâ really just means the height is greater than the width and â œlandscapeâ means the width is greater than the heightit will currently resize to the width of its container while maintaining its aspect ratio however even with a wrapper that defines an explicit height it will overspill the container if the width of the wrapper compared to its height is greater than its aspect ratioi have a function def randomrects x y width height x y is the top left corner and width must be less than 90 height less than 70if width is greater than height you know that the orientation changed to landscapehow do i make sure that the uilabel when sizetofit is called returns a width that is less than 320 so only the height is scaled to fit the body of the textbut is it dangerous to assume that while working in landscape mode the window height will always be less than window width and therefore making it the main constraining factorthe problem that i have is that some image the height is higher than width and then the listview looks like thiswhen i try to minimize this page resize it to a size smaller than my screen espicially when it is minimized in a vertical manner where the height of the page is longer than the width the footer becomes blank white and the background-image becomes shorterbut for other images of the same resolution ie width + height but looks a poorer image the returned byte size is a lot less - like 9000 bytes for examplefew are portrait images where the height of the image is like 3 times more than widthif i could find a way to incrementally increase the width or height whichever is smaller of the button and then resize it so it re- wraps_content then this could workand i need the height to always be a little bit smaller than the widththe body width is smaller than page width left margin right margin which according to this link can be an issue how to get rid of blank pages in pdf exported from ssrsthen i crop it if height is less then crop it to height size or width sizeat the beggining i d like to explain my problem well i ve got main container body where width is auto and min-width is 960px width of screen can be bigger than children width there s child container where margin is auto and width 960pxif you want to target any case when width is greater than height i think something like min-aspect-ratio 101 100 or something like this might worki feel that the image background s width looks more than 400 pixels say x and the height is also more than 400 pixels say ythe top image is 100 width of the browser but shorter than 100 height of the browser so the content peeks up a little bit the tops of the two images below are showingalso you need to be careful about your content - in the fiddle you used h4 and p tags and these have a default top bottom margin set by the browser - if this margin is larger than the space available in the percentage height div it will push the content out of vertical alignmentnow if you get these confused and use the height for the width and the height is larger than the width this is going to blow upthe issue is that the first image is wider than body width thus creating a horizontal scroll-bar making window height smallerspecifically i take the image s height and width and then divide both by larger value 300 so that the aspect ratio is maintained and the image is optimized to fit in the space i have designed for it a width that is never smaller than 320 and a height that is always exactly 320if that distance is less than the radius of the circle then you know that the polygons intersects the circleif jqgrid width or height is bigger than viewport jqgrid rows and columns outside it are not accessible in androidif i put image height is more than width i can fill the box easilywidth is always bigger than heighti can t use screens size because of devices like galaxy note with huge screens and some

create a jpanel that is resizable scrollable and contains x smaller inner panelsit looks like you want to resize each jpeg image in a folder to a width of 1840 pixels with keeping aspect ratio for images in landscape format width is higher or equal than heighti want to take an bitmap of a glyph that is smaller than 32x32 width and height are not necessarily powers of 2 and put it into a texture so i can render itit displays ok in google-chrome and safari but in firefox it has more space between the text and the bottom border than between the text and the top borderassuming this is the fix you are looking for your container needs to have a width greater than the width of the button and from there you can add margin 0 autoyou can define more layouts with different width and height.then check the height and width and density of device and use that specific layout for that devicethe setfold function sets the height of the desired element to the window s height or - if the window s width is smaller than the breakpoint 1020 to a default value 999however the margin issue isn t specific to the example when width is less than 340px it s the same on any widthportrait mode sets the smaller side as the width and larger side as height for example 9 16 landscape the sets the larger side as the width and smaller side as height 16 9at a certain enlargement point the image height fits the full wrapper height but the image width is then larger than the wrapper widthi check to see if the window s width is greater than its height in order to determine if the user is holding the device in landscape or portrait mode and i translate the data that the accelerometer provides based on that factthe table on disk is bigger than your ramif you have an image that its height is more than its width it will be shown as suchbut this is no good for desktop because the height may be larger than the width probably quite rare though but the orientation will never changebut the margin is more difficult to include in the width because it is on the outside of the box.slide-container-content has a width that is greater than its containing element - set it to 100 or whatever width you want the text to be and then set your margin autosif either current screen s width or height is less then 15cm image should be scaled preserving aspect ratio in such a way it fit to screenif the width of the screens is higher than 768px use the landscape layout split the screens into 2 applicable in landscape mode for phones and tabletsince table layout have the ability to break the assigned css width height it is better not using it unless it is table-like structure or you want to contents expand the container - so youras long as the ratio of the window s height width is greater than the image s height width you won t have any issues but once the window s ratio is smaller than the image s ratio you ll see that whitespaceor by ensuring the width of your split container is less than the width of the user control after subtracting the margin from each sidethis could happen if your fft size is much larger than the height of the drawing area or the number of spectral lines is a lot more than its widthwhen getting a color at a position make sure the position is less than the width or height of the image not less than or equali m using bootstrap and i ve managed to change the height for the navigation bar when width is more than 768px from 50px to 80pxas you can see if image width is greater than height the script first makes image 128 px heightif the bin width is smaller than zero the bar height might become very largethis works but i want to re-adjust the minimum height to 30px when the screen width is lower than 768pxin case the image s width height is larger than the device s screen width height i want to crop the image so it matches the device dimensions see picture belowsomething traveling faster than the width height of your collidable area won t be reliably detectedsize and more than that height and width window should be resizeuse png or gif it s faster types of imagesswitching between landscape and portrait changes nothing the width is still larger than the screensin landscape it has more buttons in addition to what is there in portrait modeif the height of window ls less than width 2 scrollbar of window is enabledif i set the frame of the tableviewincell to a width larger than the height of the containing cell then it goes heywirewidth should be smaller than height at about 100px - the all works finethe thing is the window showing the files is pretty big wide or tall because you resized it and emacs sees that the width or height is greater than the respective threshold and splits it likewiseedit correcting the max lenght so it is bigger than the min lenghtbut then i noticed after changing a mobile to landscape it would switching back to the desktop mode due to the width of the media query being less than the screens landscape widthi just want to set the custom page width and height page width is higher than page heightand when the width is bigger than the height the height 100 width automight want to consider removing the min-width max-width code so that this doesn t break on devices smaller and larger than the min max sizesthis often affects width more than heightusing jquery of javascript you can get the height of the table and set the div to be slightly smaller than the width you retrieved from the tablefirst if the height is greater than 1000 simply scale both height and width by 1000 heightthe width of the papplet is 100 less than the width and height of the jframei forget if height width or actualheight actualwidth is the more accurate value - you may need to test that onethe mediasize class and all of it s inner classes only have sizes where the height is greater then the widthi.e max-width kicks in when image width is greater than height and its height will be calculated proportionallyso its width is the width of the user s browser minus as much as possible without making them larger than 90 height of the viewportnow rotate it and draw a rectangle again - it is larger because phone diagonal is longer than its height or widthin my site in a table of particular i have to insert a image as background.i did that but the image looks like double image as the image is smaller than cell width and height it is getting overlapthat is to say i want to stretch my image so that the width correspond so that would be an image of 15 90 but i do not want the height to stretch more than the width so the bottom of my image will not appear1 if image s height is greater than width then its height will be 300generate initial square cells that fully cover the polygon with cell size equal to either width or height whichever is lowerif the current height width is greater than inital height width ignore the swipewhen the window is resized the background image shrinks in height once the window is adjusted smaller than the width of the actual photoor if you know that its max width is smaller then the width of the sprite then make it a rectangle with the max width and height of your elementit is regarded as portrait if the height is greater than the widththe width is more arbitrary than the height but i made it a function of the fontsize and the doubling so i could write the shade names in the rectanglesi can t find any way to make the treeview s height smaller or the tabcontrol s largeri have a code which zooms and pans the imageview matrix it works well but i want the imageview to not be zoomed smaller than my screen and i don t want it to be zoomed very much i want to set a limit for zooming and to the same thing for dragging panning it should pan horizontally if image s width is larger than screen and it should pan vertically if image s height is larger than the screen how can i achieve this resultif the image width is less than the image height i want to add class a to that particular image if not i want to add class b to that particular imageas they say above you can resize your browser window to have the height be larger than the width so then the media portrait is truei m having a problem displaying the layout when my imageview and textview takes up more than 3 4 of the screenon devices like the droid the bottom row is squinched in because the table width is smaller than the heighthey so you re last media query is just asking for if the screen is orientation landscape which means the width of the screen is wider than the height of the screenonly elements and which determine the scaling in the x and y dimensions are calculated differently if width is greater than heightit seems like it would be a mistake to simply check if the image s width is greater than it s height and to rotate it to portrait orientation based on thattwo ways to solve this destroy those controls or move them to an invisible region top left to minus values or to values bigger than width height of the parentthis version gives me a fixed 500px height and an image that looses aspect ratio when viewport is smaller than image widthif width is larger than heighti am making a webrtc video call between a mobile and laptop the mobile is in portrait mode so it sends the stream with the height greater than width and the laptop send the stream with the aspect ratio reversedif window height is bigger then window width the we have a portrait or in any other case we have a landscape orientationit s happens when the bug object s n.valeur width or height is more than a page eg a4now additionaly i would like to detect if the printed width is greater than the printed height and then change to landscape printingsimple because the viewport has changed due to the keyboard showing and the final viewport has a height lower than widththe height of 5000 pixels will work as long as the width is not greater than 3353if width is greater than height it is landscapehow would i use imagemagick to resize the image if it is larger than 1500 width x700 height whichever is larger comes first then reside the imageobs the font-size must be dynamic having text height limited by container height when container width is larger than text width and limited by container width when container width is smaller then text widthwhen the height is higher than this threshold both right panels gain additional width and the righttoppanel loses its height much faster than the rightbottompanel when decreasing height of jframei interpred this to mean that for example the width will be 5 8th of the width of the working area unless this results in the dialog which is taller than the height of the working area in which case it will use a wider widththis will resize the original png only if its width was larger than 64 pixels or if its height is larger than 10 000 pixelslandscape width is bigger than heightalternatively you can use jquery filter method to filter all the images which have width greater than height and then add the required class at oncei need the image to take the entire width of the container unless the resulting height is bigger then the available container s viewport heightif the height is longer than the width the screen is in portrait mode otherwise it is landscapeit will look at the image height check whether the height is smaller than the width or if the width is smaller than the height and set either one to the smaller heightthis implies a width closer to 7.3 points and a row height that is more than 12 points approximately 13.7 pointsresize scale image only if the width height is bigger than 1000px so that the resulting image s max width height is 1000px or lessi m wondering if it s possible to automatically arrange the icons so that when the width gets smaller than x the last icon of each row gets pushed to next row so that it grows in heightdelta is there because i have a bigger width than heightif the image height width ratio is not greater than or equal to imageview height width ratio then there will be black space shown as there will be less ratio to match to the imageviewalso i am not posting an image but i tried to set the height and width of the window to 96 in a previous experiment and the height was less than widththe only way i found to be sure that the view is in landscape mode is to test that the view height is less than the view widthfont.getsize text return the width and the height in pixels of the text so my method splits the string in words and verify if the word is greater than the width of the image if not i concatenate the word in a variablewidth and â œlandscapeâ means the width is greater than the heighti am using recyclerview with imageviews in each cell.each imageview loads images from the web and can be square or with more width than height or more height than width i.e any sizes.i am going to display a placeholder for each image while it loads in the background with a progressbar .but the problem is the dimension of the images is unknown and i want to size the placeholders exactly the size of the images like the 9gag app in which the placeholders are exactly the size of the images while loading in the bacground.how do i achieve this in androidtablet mean that the default is that the screens is wider than it is tall.the above code fills black color if the source image width and height is less than 501 if the image is higher than box1 width and height of 600x300px let say 750x750px in this case image should fit in box1 with 600x300pxi have been struggling with this problem during a couple of hours and i have found that the adjustment for the msoshapetrapezoid is a coefficient that must be multiplied by the width of the form if the width is less than the height or by the height of the form if the height is less than the widthif the aspect ratio is 1 then width is larger than height so you then need to assume a square the same size as height as it s the smaller valuethe image height is probably going to be less than the width and really just depends on what type of image you are using and how tall you want the carousel image to bethis prevents all stretching and simply places a black bar on the right hand side when the width is greater than heightif the height is bigger smaller than width don t draw or set visibility falsein portrait view the width is smaller than the heightopening this page with the default android browser i get the clientwidth and clientheight numbers reversed when changing the orientation to landscape i get more height than

you only need to change the width and height values in .circle_holder css the rest will fall into place a width value less than the width of the text would look weirdif the size required for the text height or width is more than max-width split the text into multiple lines expand the shape to fit the text in centerso i am trying to build a website using bootstrap and i am trying to arrange vertical and horizontal videos in a feed with a design where the first 3 and last 3 columns are occupied by a vertical video thus the height being longer than the width and the middle 6 columns being occupied by the horizontal video where the width is the longer sideheight is slightly more tricky for it to work you need to have the parent of the overlay div to have a known widthif i have wider image it crop 500px width and the height is not proportion to the width the same as the height tall image crop to 500px and width is lesser px.our height y is greater than width xi m trying to upload an image from my api to show it as profile picture the problem is from the first time that the user opens the navdrawer the image doesn t load and it makes the entire layout disappear but from the second time it all works and i notice that it happens when the width of the image is less than the heighti.e if the browser height goes smaller the image will scale down while not overlapping or going under the text and staying centre same goes for widththe width of the timetable is more than the height of the timetableif the line is longer than width word wrap does its job but when calculating its dynamic height it fails to include the wrapped linethe width exceeds but height is lessif the total of the angle is less than 180â the triangle must be â œhyperbolicâ on a concave surface which might be the shape of our universei m using a resize function to wrap a div with a container when the browser width is less than 801px or the height is greater than the widthi tried in many ways but i have many problems if the image has more height than width in those cases image should be displayed centered and the remaining space with the background color of the container div i don t want to crop the imageor the tableview is covering it up because the landscape view has less vertical room than the portrait viewyour ratio is a little more than one since your width is longer than your height so your left and right boundaries are essentially something like -1.5 and 1.5 whatever your ratio happens to bebut now when i scale down the background image is not scaled down to smaller sizes if the height is more than the widthtry to make bigger picture with greater width and height in theory to make a plot of a same virtual size it should bethe problem is when i try to upload a picture that has height more than width such asi m trying to add an if statement so i can change the canvas height when the window width is smaller than 750pxin details height is getting larger than expected and event more than widthhow to place 2 div side by side one div is of 75 width and the other is 25 width.one more div with margin 0 autoi m not sure it is the same problem than yours but after some test research i ve found that the problem was triggered by having a div element filled with a ng-repeat with a height greater than screen height inside a main div with height and width set as 100 google mapsworks fine but the problem is that if i resize the window to less than the width 1400 or height 900 of the photos the scrollbar appearsonce the image is loaded into a new picture shape and renamed i want to based on whether the width to height ratio is greater than a threshold resize its width keeping aspect ratio then crop the remaining down to the height and visaversawhen the screen width becomes larger than 500px the contents of the media query are ignored and the margin becomes 20the code that i have so far seems to work as expected when the x-axis of the wrapper is bigger than the y-axis width height but for some reason when the height of the wrapper is bigger than width it gets all distortedlikewise if the height is greater than the width anddiv1 has fixed width but variable height so what i would like is that if div1 height is bigger that the div2 height the div3 stays under div2 and on the right of the div1 like herethat can happen if height or width is less than 1â if the height is bigger than the width i switch the style to max-width 100 and height autotherefor all the images used should be at least 2x width 2x display height which means 4x largeri am essentially stating for the div #colorbox if the has the class of cboxphoto then run the each function to add the class of relative to the if the image width is greater than x and it s height is greater than xas the width gets longer the height increases by the same but i don t want the height to exceed 35px nor start with below 5pxmargin auto when used in conjunction with a width that is less than 100 of the screen will center an elementby default the width and height of a box or container cannot be greater than the width and height of its parent container because the box won t fitas well i resize that added image small or bigger one image size won t go bigger than group height and widthif width is bigger than height this code won t workas you can see before its parent is sized the map_canvas height is zero and its width is larger that you might have expectedok so i m trying to see if an image s width is greater than it s height then apply a class if not apply another classfor example with scrollview.bounces no a horizontal image whose height is smaller than the height of the scrollview but whose width is larger so it can be scrolled from left to right will scroll further to the left than it should when scrolling to the right it stops correctly at the edge of the image although if scrollview.bounces yes it then bounces in from the edge so the image is always cropped on the left when the image is larger in both dimensions than its containing scrollview this issue accentuates and the whole result feels broken which is unsurprising given apple s documented advicethis children height can be greater than the parent containerthe problem i hit is when the width is bigger than the heightif this is the case then height will be higher than width or vice versado i just create a new uiview that is 4px larger than the selected object and and make the selected view a subviews of itvisibility means that the element is not only displayed but also has a height and width that is greater than 0i want to have two columns stacked into one column when the height of view port is larger than the width of the view portthe problem is that on some devices the width is greater than the height and vice versai imagine the error is that your i and j variables are becoming larger than the height and widthfyi whenever you change the google maps height or width it is better to trigger this resize eventbut when i select an area where width and height varies in which height is more than width as the cropped image then i am not getting cropped image as height and width as 160px like as shown belowthe width of the span content plus the left margin is greater than 1000px and so it wraps spans to the next linereturns a nil context if width or height is greater than 320x480according to the exif-information the orientation is 0 so supposedly the picture is not rotated - but since the width is greater than the height the picture is in fact rotatedit also has a padding equal to could also be higher than the width height of the border images to make up for the room they take upthe problem is that your li has a bigger height than your widthso in code where you perform scaling add condition which checks if the content width or height is less or equal container width or heighthowever if the viewport width is less than the height i want the field size to update accordingly and keep the 1 1 ratiosetting height greater than width is needed to get the layout right between browsersautomatically show scroll bars when content is greater than height and width like thisthe diameter of the dot shall not exceed half the height of the aggregation diamond and shall be larger than the width of the lineif an image s height is greater than the width i want to switch to the height crop else keep the width cropin conjunction with a negative margin equal to or greater than the height of the top and bottom borders if any to further remove the elementi try with this code the width is good but the height it s more bigif you need to have both fill the screen when the child is less than the width of the screen then both need min-width 100 and box-sizing border-box and you can remove the display-inline-block from the parentif the image were smaller by both width and height of the containeri am trying to change the size of a thumbnail in wordpress but it keeps making it exactly square even though i want to stretch the width moreso than the heighti m trying to set the height of a image to 150px if the image width is larger than the height and if the image height is larger than the width the width of the image changes to 150px2- if total rows height is bigger than current datagridview height it means there will be a scrollbar..also the same for the other scrollbar columns width is bigger than dgv widthafter that in my case if the width is greater than the height i set the the height to 100 in css and if the height is greater than the width i set the width to 100the problem is if the circle s width height is smaller than 1 2 of the textview height circle width height 10dp textview height 100dp the circle does not scale uphowever an algorith could be something like if the new margin top is greater than the height of the current note and the difference between the offet of the current note anchor and the following note anchor is less than the height of the current note than subtract the height of the current note from the new marginok so your parent are fixed width the children are bigger than the parent element also min-width 150pxanyway i just set the margin to a value a little bigger than the width of the image and overlap is eliminated only in the very specific case we wantchoose whether to divide it horizontally or vertically if its aspect ratio width height is greater than a divide it verticallyso you can change this by editing the frame size of the slider to have a larger height than widthi see that they are squeezed such that the height is more than the widthcontent height is smaller than screens height is because of the virtual key back home switching appbut the measurement is reverse row height shows bigger number than column widthproblem is when i set my windowstyle to none and change resizemode to no resize and run it the height and width is bigger at runtimei think what you re asking for is how to return the information for all the images where the height is greater than the widthi figured that if the image was actually in landscape then it was appearing stretched and truncated because it s width was larger than its heightwhile compact the width is actually greater than the height so was pushing your label off the screenyou can check the width of the image and if the width is bigger than height you reduce the image for the width instead reduce from the height to fill the container something like thatgl_invalid_value is generated if width or height is less than 0i want to create a custom validation but i cant found any documentation about that i know how to get the width and height of an image but i don t know how to validate and prevent to add that file if the width is bigger i want to do that on the front side with the librarywhen viewport height is less than width of squareif you have a div that takes up most of the screen except for the 20 margin on the left and you want that margin to be no less than 100px then you can use a media query to set the margin to 100px when the frame width becomes less than 500px 20 of 500px is 100pxif height is less than what the aspectratio allows to still utilize full width i m clippingthe first media query says that if the screen width is less than 992px the h2 in the item class should have a font-size of 3rem should be red and should have an underlineif the width is greater than the height then andall of the labels have the same aspect ratio the width is 3.5 times larger than the height so i m trying to find contours that have a minarearect with that same aspect ratioas landscape has lesser space than portrait you are able to view only top scrollview so only that portion would be scrollableif a width has been set don t exceed it so if wrap_content is specified and the width is greater than the parent the height will be adjusted else assume you can be as wide as the contentedit this code solves your problem given height is greater than or equal to widththe img tags will have rotateimg class if its width is greater than its heightthe purpose of using a percentage here for me was in using one gradient to support large and small containers with size appropriate stripes while also auto sizing to either height or width whichever is more appropriate for the specific elementi added a margin so that the iframe will stay centered in the div once the width is shorterbasically i have about 30 images with varying height and length not greater than 750px width and 500 px heightthe first row has a height that is much larger than the margin bottom of its .content div so that the margin-bottom is contained and should not effect anything outside of its containerif width is greater than height then you ll most probably in landscape modewhen the screen width hits less that 780px the catalog grid page div just loses its height and the page becomes unscrollablethen you can safely pass in negative values or values greater than width or heightin case the image s width is greater than the phone screen set the width of the imageview to the screen width and scale the height accordinglyi ve tried using vmin but that does not help as the height of the window is almost always smaller than the widthsurely it s not working and it detect it as landscape because width higher than height but in fact image need to rotateq how do i resize the output file to a smaller size with fixed width of 100 px and free height .this below works as well until you pass in a parameter though that is larger than the width or height ofif the screens is bigger than 1024px it should be green my tablet screens is but the background stays yellowin safari the large image appears at the correct height and scales proportionally when the height is changed but doesn t scale correctly when the width is changed less then the width of the imagein between 768 1024 and only when height is longer than widththis code should draw the test rectangles only when the height is less than the width and otherwise the window should remain clearso the row height changes when the browser window width is made bigger or smaller which is what i wantmy children views have their height set to wrap_content i know that the behavior of wrap_content is to fit the content size unless its bigger than the parentif width is bigger than max-width i set the width to max-width and calculate height and then do this again for height by using this simple math formullawhat firefox displays is about 5 inches higher than what google-chrome displaysthe only font-size is on the body tag but what happens is that the div is square but the button has a smaller height than its widthwhen requesting the preview sizes from the camera you always get pairs where the width is larger than the height because landscape is the usual orientation when taking a pictureit test if window.orientation property is supported if it isn t it checks if window height is greater than window widthmy question is how can i call the reorientation method viewwilltransitiontosize manually and pass a size parameter in which the size width is greater than the heightportrait has an aspect ratio greater than 1 1 and landscape is lesswhat is the reason that text s width is smaller than its heightthe height is 3 times larger than width which is unexpectedas you can see what s happening here is sometimes the object falling out of the document because the width or height of it + the randomized percentage is more than document width or heighta right-align fixed width button looks better imhoeverything works as expected with the exception that if the height of the window is lesser than the width the image get cropped even when using containthe animation glitch is seen where the contentsize of the collection view shrinks such that its height or width becomes smaller than or equal to that of the collection view boundsi can handle this using outside position property modifying the margin or padding of an li element if the text height is smaller than the image heightso if is larger than the width should be set to maxwidth and the height should be calculated based on itimages scratch width more than height and does t looks nice.if the window height is greater than the divs height the the size should be based on 100 widthwhat you need to do is dynamically decide which side height or width has lesser value and then resize to that side maintaining aspect ratio and then crop itsince you float the content to the left and the sidebar to the right changing the margin won t have an effect unless maybe it gets bigger than the available width of the gap but certainly not while the margin is smaller than the gap that is already therethis image will not throw an error since both width and height are less than 8 191 and it s pixel count or width multiplied by height is less than 16 777 215i have a div with fixed position and height width is more than the window height width then full page is not appearingyou can then check if the width of the text is greater than 800px and reduce the font-size until the width is less than or equal toperhaps you find it strange since the target droppable s size is much smaller than the draggableif i set the editor to 300 width x 500 height and you type more than the height it should not apply a scroller and you should be unable to write moreso if the parent s height is greater than the width then the child is limited by the parent s width and if the parent s width is greater than the height then the child is limited by the heightthe reason why i m struggling is that sometimes the width is bigger than the height and sometimes the height is bigger than the widththis is because the images i m adding to the carousel are for the most part of larger height than width although i should write the css where it will look the same regardless of the image dimensionsthat will let you know if the picture is landscape because width would be greater than heightie it s height is the height of the viewport and the width is proportionally wider than the viewportupdated to handle cases where image width is greater than heightwhat i do not understand is why the size of the point and the text is not the same and why the margin can be bigger than the width of the figurewidth 110px | height relevant to the width if the height is bigger than widthmake sure the image size before apply filters means width should be less than height because image photos taken from front camera have grater width than length that may cause problem after applying filtershowever you don t specify what function or operation is creating your rotated rects - for example if you used fitellipse it may be that there is some internal detail of the algorithm that prefers to use the larger or smaller dimension as the width or heightsome of the images will be larger than the width of the table height doesn t matterif width is greater than height return the target otherwise return the proportional widthif the bitmap is larger in height or width is larger then canvas size displaywidth displayheight how can i use the camera class to autozoom to fit the bitmap and center it to the canvasassuming the height or width whichever is smaller of your element is less than this total the radii will be scaled down proportionallyin this example media query if the window s width is no greater than 200px .wrapper will be given an absolute width of 160px and a 20px margin either sideif height is bigger than width then this will result in unallocated arrays for some of the in your code as it standsyou should consider if the height is bigger than the width portraitnot only is height of keyboard so large how can height be larger than widthin the case the matrix s width is greater than height it will be padded with 1 s to make the matrix squarethis will effectively only show scrollbar when needed if horizontal content is wider than width or vertical content is taller than heighttry resizing the box to less than 100 width and height in chrome and you will get something similar to these imageswidth - optional but might come in handy because storing height width is quicker than calculating it upon retrievalonce the negative margin is equal or greater than the width of that element further negative margin has no effectbottle thumb height is much bigger than width are only partly visiblesame for the images height values although it is not set in css but when we put width 100 without setting height the image will be respective while still maintaining the aspect ratio yo ucan see that img-0 height is less that img-1 height because the first image has original image of 200px while the second image img-1 has 350px height again the output height is representing the actual and exact height on the screen no matter what the original height isthe mapview s frame is set as the screen s width and height and i found the map view s height is less than the screen heighti m trying to set the dialog to be 180px less than the height and width of the screen.when the view s width is greater than its height it won t be able to make the colorimageview s width equal to the view s width but that s ok since the priority is 750may be you are using the image with the size greater than the width and height mentioned in the textureorange has fixed width and height its bottom must be aligned with the bottom of white and it should be pulled to the right maybe with some offset from the right the height of white must adapt to be not less than height of orangegl_invalid_value is generated if width or height is less than 0 or greater than gl_max_texture_sizeso my intuition says that it is better to have an image where the height is much greater than the widthinside default mainpage you can override constructor and load page with another design if height is larger than widthsuppose if the ckeditor height is 200px and width is 300px then end user should not be able to add more content with height and widthhere is how the regular imageview handles resizing of images if you are using match_parent as width and wrap_content as height i tested with both as match_parent and the results were the same it will not scale the image if the height of your picture is lower than the width which is quite typicalit works fine if the image has equal width ahd height but when the width is greater than the height or vice versa then the trouble comes inthat is because the filloval drawoval methods should actually use a width height that is 1 less than the size of the componentinstead for portrait pictures height longer than width it fits only if i use the mobile screen normally in portrait modethe only thing you have to do is to create an viewport div and define the width and height that is smaller than your canvasi m using divs that have text in them and i want to make it so that when the width of the window gets smaller the height gets bigger so that it can still contain the divbut the code does not function correctly if the width is smaller than the height since l ranges only 1 tohowever i would like the slideshow to be full height if the browser width is more than 767pxfrom your example pictures what you want is not really an average since it s width and height is larger than all the given rectangles but a rectangle that bounds all the given face position rectangles excluding some outliers where i ll define outliers as rectangles that don t overlap any other rectangles in the listbecause of datebox pop-up z-index is less then your box mean dialog box s z-index it shows behind pop-up paneli used the page view webpart and the width is set to 700 px and the height is greater than the height on the flash htmlthe div s width is smaller than the images width so i have used overflow hidden and by the images margin 0 -100 but this way only the first image is set middle the secondas we use less i was thinking about using a condition where i could specify that if the height of the children is higher than the parent s height the background-color is differentwidth return a larger dimension than height which is not correctif the screens density is less than xhdpi i load smaller sampled sizes of the 96x96 image - as 36x36 for

co z i need to keep the images width 100i am trying to rotate some images whose width is more than height about the left-top corner by 90 degreesthis means they won t float next to one another unless you set the width of each so that the combined width + margin + border + padding of both blocks is equal to or less than the width of the containerupon further review it appears to only occur when the image height is greater than the widthif you specify a width to the table centering with margin 0 auto will also work as long as the specified width is less than that of the containing blockall i need is simply to append a w to the end of the div id if the screen width is greater than the height or an h if the height is greateron landscape as the width is bigger than the height you should set top and bottom 0 and ratio 1 1 and center it horizontally in containeri have a view where i need to place an uiimageview and i was told to place it inside a rectangle that takes the screen width and its height is smaller than width fixed sizealso the inner children div have to be wider than the parent div for the scrollbars to workfor flex items the auto attribute value calculates the minimum width height of the item to be no less than the width height of its content guaranteeing that the item is rendered large enough to hold the contentelmonty please look how not only width but height is shorter in ie8i tried to add class and added the background image for that input.but the height and width is aligned bigger than the text box.on trying to change the height the input size reduced as the background img is inside the inputyou can make your radio buttons bigger by changing width and height in the below classif the distance between the center of the circle and all of the vertices is greater than the radius of the circle and all of those distances are shorter than the width and height of the rectangle then the circle should be inside of the rectangleyou re getting confused or at least i am because you re resulting array is height by width not width x height which makes more sense to me so instead of.visible elements have a width or height that is greater than zero. i suppose it doesn t check if an element is into the view or notportrait mode is when the window height is larger than window widthif an image s height is greater than 250px resize it so the width is 250px and the height autowidth or height is smaller by 1px or 2pximportant but in my experience setting 100 to the height property is not as effective as with width as height is more dynamic try the html body thing firstvmin - relative to viewport s width or height whichever is the smalleri want the div to auto adjust for the picture so if the height is greater than the width then the div should adjust to the image s sizei want to maintain the aspect ratio so in doing the width resize the height of the image becomes greater than the height of the screenthe problem is that the width is bigger than the height and i want it to be the same 1 1but the result does not look like a square at all the height seems to be larger than the widthi m using gallery located on sd card when i pick the horizontal image width greater than height it loads the image in image view perfectly fine but the problem is with vertical image height greater than width it show the image in image view rotated on the left side or saying -90 degree from original positioni ve got a responsive ad unit on my page and for some reason it has a height of 60px while i really need it to be 90px and switching to 300x250 when screens gets smallerelse if the width is longer than the height you set the width to 500px and the height to autobecause the width of the screen is bigger than height on monitor the landscape will scale betterif you can get that to work you might want to try progressively removing the height width position attributes from div.header to get the minimal required attributes to get the effect you wantboth of the sides move toward it but in this case never reach it since the width 100 is greater than the height 30you are using the screen size to generate your placeholder image and the width of the screen in landscape is bigger than portraityou just need to use text-align right on the labels with a width that is slightly greater than the label text as the text will be lined up at the extreme right enddefine background-size to value smaller than width and height of the divif the width height percentage is higher than the fixed min-width height then the element wont resize until the zoom

rotate scale and crop every single sprite and draw it in the exactly order to compose the final hight resolution image in a backbuffer then save it in bmp and make some copies in lower resolution as pngif image height is larger than width portrait then scale the width to 1024 pixels and scale the height to appropriate value to maintain aspect ratioinitial value for this property is 100 and as explained in this answer only the corners will get the border image when the sum of left + right or top + bottom offsets is greater than the width or height of the image respectivelyi have added an oversized background image bigger than the height and width of the browser to get parallax effectin general you want to have a range slightly larger than x max - x min and then divide the range into the desired number of binsportrait height is bigger than widthwhat i need to do is change the 515 based on the width of the window if the window width is above 1280 i would like the value for the height to be 515 and if it is below 1280 i would like the height to be 615 and if the width is less than 480 make the height 715this method works great except for one thing if the new height is smaller than the new width the new height and new width successfully get modified but after the imagetoadd.draw rectanglef the size of the imagetoadd still has the new width value instead of the cropped width that is if i can assume that if i draw an image with -20 as its x-value the width gets modified with -20 as welledit this would only be true for diamonds where height is greater than or equal to the widththe device width is bigger than its height so it seems to be invertedyou have given width of 50 with additional margin of 5 to each of the element which is greater than 100 widthi am trying to make my html page tablet compattible by trying to hide the menu if width is less than height it works when page loads but when i change the orientation of tablet the menu div remains at its placeyou can refer the bootstrap official document you can find that the default navbar background described as background-image the priority of background-image and background-color distinct the background-image is more powerful than background-colorthe only problem here sometimes the sum of widths height of board cells are less than the width height of the boardinstead think of the image residing in the left upper portion of a large square the length of the square s side will be the image s width or height whichever is largerin your xml you gave and 10dp both vertical and horizontal spacing and then in your custom view implementation you gave 150 as width and height and 8 as padding basically they conflict try to make both values convenient since the columnwidth you gave is way more less than width you gave in your custom viewokay so i used one trick pony s solution but tried to modify it to create a square image out of a rectangle if the width is less than the height but not stretch the original image and instead center itbut because most monitors have a smaller height than width i used the heightin my current efforts i can make all the columns to be the same height however when i change browser width there is more space added between columnsif the parent has lower z-index than the modal everything in it will be behind the modal regardless of the children s z-indexi have to set it to 4em to make the h2 approximately twice the size of the 1em p in portrait but in landscape it is much biggeri m looking for a way to keep a modal dialog within screen bounds that its height is always less than the screen height and the width is adjusted accordinglythe margin will be greater than the height of the iframeso when the width is less than 540px i ll overwrite the height and widthyou can try giving an id to each one of the divs or style them for margin that is greater than or equal to the image width.assuming you image width is 50px this code shall workbut when the popout pops out the height changes to 800 but the width gets smaller and small every 200 millisecondsas i understood the imagemagick documentation and various other questions and answers on stack overflow the caret should mean that if the image width or height is smaller than those minimum dimensions it s resized to meet them and also maintain aspect ratiothis way you get if the screens height or width is greater than 960px and the dpi is low probably you re on a tabletif the width is greater than the height then scale the image to 200px heightyou have to calculate a ratio like this when width is bigger than heightthe amount of spacing to the right of the uiview when in portrait mode is greater than i want for landscape mode and the distance from the bottom is less than i want for landscape modedevice height greater than device widththe widths of the children is often larger than the width of the parentjtextfield is more than 1 line height and jlabel is not in left sidefor example my image width is 10mm but in height it is 300mm so i want it to appear reflecting this so in this case i would expect it to appear very narrow but tall because the height is so much greater than the widthspan is an inline element and the margin 0 auto for centering only works on non-inline elements that have a width that is less than 100so in simple terms i need a specific css that 1 centers the image vertically and horizontally in the div if its width and height are smaller than the div s dimensions 2 resizes the image automatically if it is bigger than the div s dimensions unnecessary to add it is unknown whether it s width or height is biggereven if i create three versions for ldpi mdpi and hdpi there are more than screens resolutions in that table if there is no matching image it will scale my image and may not retain the aspect ratioit is smaller than the width and height of the screentext needs to be wordwrap if width height is less than text length can be variable depend on font sizethis results in all your elements to be larger than the height and width specifiedthat is repeatedly reduce the font-size by 5 until the total width is less than or equal to 800pxi want the uilabel to have a width of 300 unless the left right margin becomes less then 30of course if the ratio is less than 1 then the width is smaller than height let s say 500px 700px and you will see the white spaces on the left and right of the imagebased on my understanding i hope that is because the size of the tablet screens which is smaller than the desktop that makes the strokes to get hidden inside the area that was not visible on the tablet however the area is visible in desktopsince the screens size is larger than the common mdpi screens sizes 320x480 the text size looks smaller in this emulatorbut our hero will reach really high and far limits i mean so bigger than width and height of background image when flyingthere are two solutions you can a reduce the margins by setting one of the previous par settings or b you can increase the size of the device either by re-sizing the device using the mouse if it s a visible device or if you are printing to pdf for example you can set the device size to be larger by setting height and width parameters when you set up the device as inif the fixed min-width height pixel count is higher than the width height set on the element then the element will be the size of the fixed min-width height and the element size wont look the same across all monitorsthis should work as long as the height is never greater than the widthyou can give it a width height that is larger than the screen sizeif the height could be bigger than width you can addin this one the width height ratio is smallerbut as you can see top side is not fixed it is also moving slightly i want to make top side fixed it should not move like hermes website and want to make this wave continuous instead of just once when webpage loads also i noticed once wired thing that when i keep open my modified version in browser for 5-10 minutes it shrinks in size height width and gets too smaller after sometimethe padding on the #variablesize would have to be equal to or greater than the width height of the imagesimplement getscrollabletracksviewportheight width to return true if height width is less than parent height width and false otherwisewhen the total width of the inline-level boxes on a line is less than the width of the line box containing them their horizontal distribution within the line box is determined by the text-align propertyyou can use different overflow values in css auto should cause a scrollbar to appear when text is bigger than the height width will allow or hidden to cut it offso if the maximum length should be 1000px i have to check if the height or the width is biggeri have one issue regarding uiimageview and uiimage i get confuse on 1 thing ie my uiimageview height 759 and width 748 and i am downloading the images from server that height and width is so so greater such as image height 2048 and width 2500when you are using fittext at that time if the font-size is greater than 100px than you have to set the exact width as per your font-sizemargin auto won t center an element horizontally unless you also set a width that s less than 100its height is greater than widthif image width is more than 1920 resize it with 1920 width and maintaining height with original aspect ratioguys after spending too much time looking around for an easier way to do this i combine the info from research to do it like this simply using the getimagesize function -if the height is larger than the width echo an image tag with a style having a height of 100 else echo the same image tag but with a style having a width of 100try this function.it will reduce the size of the bitmap to 512 if its width or height is greater than 512in other way if width is larger than height it should be width 100 height autothe width is shorter and the height and position is wrong tooif the ratio is bigger then 1 then the width is bigger than height let s say 700px 500px and after resizing the image is filled with white spaces in the top and bottom of the imagemost fonts have a character width less than the height so assuming width height will definitely workyou re probably being hit by the borders or margins on the body element -- you re asking for document.width height effectively but putting it in an element with a border so the total width of the page canvas.width+ left right borders is then bigger than the width height you originally asked forthe problem is if i upload a image thats bigger than the spaces delimiter it gets resizedif the width is wider than the height make your target size 500 x 375 otherwise make it 375 x 500i have a draggable parent element ice cream wrapper which is bigger than the droppable one teethi would be happy applying a class with width 100 to the image and a height auto but the height

but that made it worse with height not on autoand for landscape width of the screen is greater than heightif the height is larger than the width a portrait image the image should be scaled to fit the height of the phone and width should then adjust to keep the aspect ratio i ve had a bit of trouble getting this to work here s what i ve done so far though any help would be greatly appreciatedhowever if i put a jeditorpane below this and have it span the length of the whole window the jlabel becomes larger and grows if i enlarge the windowwhen height is less than all the above mentioned height and width is more than all the above mentioned widthsand the height 100 if the image height is bigger than widthso the image can t go larger than the height or widthin your case this means you are drawing a line from 0 0 to 1 width 1 height which is less than a pixelto scroll or auto when the element s explicit height or width is lesswhen using a samsung galaxy s3 the top status

returned i need to check the dimensions of each image instance and style it according to whether the width or height is longer whilst also keeping its original aspect ratioif the image height is less that the window height start resizing the height and remove the width property to keep the aspect ratiothe rotation point is by default in the center and because your box has a bigger width than height it overlapsmost devices seem to recognize the highest dimension as the max-width but some amazon kindle 2 appear to treat lower dimension as the width and higher as the heightthe printer sees and feeds them as portrait no rotation but the report viewer prints them landscape because the width is greater than the heighttherefore scaling the captured image to fit the uiimageview s width scale by 0.5 means the captured image will be of size 320x568 - its height is larger than the uiimageview s heightthe images enlarged up to the height or width which is smaller of the screenthe values width

height that is greater than zeroif height x length x width 5000 is higher than actual weight then i want this to be used to calculate shippinglikewise if we change img and #clock to have a defined width instead of a defined height then we have a clock that can scale properly but only if the viewport height is greater than the widthor you can group these statements by width as i think thats less important than height meaning less scrolling down for the userset a min width 1 pixel higher than the max width of the next queryif your collection view occupies whole screen then you can simply check if width is more than height and take the result as landscape orientationlet s assume that width of the array is bigger than height otherwise we will split in another directiongif-lib error #pixels bigger than width heighthere s what the video with height greater than width looks likelandscape mode is when the window width is larger than window heighti d say width height is overwhelmingly more commoni have various different image sizes running through the site - some where the width is greater than height and vice versain java we have a restriction that width should not greater than heightshould i just target each images and count the container height and use the remainer as top margin or is there easier solutionso i expected at first time when i set only set background to have this scenario - the view will be with the same ration and will fit the smallest - width or height of course if height is larger than 55dp it will be scaledthis isn t causing your problems since width is greater than height and you stay within the object s memory when doing normal accesses to iti found out that there are a lot of devices in which these constants equal 4096 and at the same time photo camera in these devices allows to take photos which width or height is greater than 4096in this way you force font-size for all elements containing a paragraph p inside a generic col-xs class col-xs-6 col-xs-3 specifically an only when screen width is lower than typical screen width used by xs suffix of bootstrap classesicon s height is greater than widthnote that i am using jquery to set these boxes max-height so they will never have the height bigger than the widththus you can write a script that would look at the width property and act accordingly that being if the width is 32.8 then check the height and apply the logic for if the height is greater than desired see article heremake it very narrow and while its height is bigger than the desired one keep increasing widthif you dont want to crop the image at all or use javascript i think your only choice is to force the text element to have the same proportions as the image with width approximately being 50 larger than height and then adjust the font-size text elements to fit the containerwhich will limit the image height to 600px and will horizontally center or resize down if the parent width is smaller to the parent container maintaining proportionsyou can see if you change the window size of the output the divs will equalize in height when width is greater than 767pxbut the screen always gets rotated to landscape instead of being set to portrait when the width is smaller than the heightthis code is not perfect though because it doesn t support when height is bigger than width easy to fix thoughâon the other hand i uploaded an image with height much greater than width but it doesn t showi have a fixed height on all my images and need to keep the image in proportion as the screen width gets smallerwhat i need is for the wrap1 to only be if they make it smaller than the width of the content then it automatically increases the height of the div so it doesnt go outside the wrap1 div at present it is forcing it down onto second line correctly but div height is a wrongi need to apply a condition in the case that an image s width is bigger than equal to or smaller than height but i m in trouble when i try to compare the variablesbut i can see if i give width as wrap_content then height is less than fixed height because keeping aspect ratio height corresponding to wrap_content width is less fixed heightmargin-auto works for elements with a width that is less than the page width in this case the ul is taking the entire width so there is nothing to center text-align center for the ul and display inline-block are the solution in this casepng and gif are better than jpeg gif probably better than png-211 sadwindowsize must be odd be within 5..255 and not be larger than image width or height in function on the 2nd to last line disparity ...this should work as long as the imageview is larger than the textview in all dimensionswhat would be perfect is keeping the percent height and width while child width is smaller than parent a widthwidth and height gets more and more differenti have tried the following code but it turned out that the height of the chart is very close to but still not quite the same as a4 height - top and bottom margins whereas the width is about 1 cell wider than a4 width - left and right marginsif the image s width and height is less than 400px then don t resize and save the original in resizedi have problem with column height in rows where at least one cell has content width is larger than header widthhow can i detect if the printed width is greater than the printed heightpng has a wider color pallete than gif and gif is properitary while png is noteach item has a border of 1px width so each item has 2px more than the height propertyyou can see in the opencv source code for fitellipse that the height of the ellipse is always larger than the widthif your image s width is larger than its height then mark s solution will leave space at the top and bottom of the screenwhen i add a testview whose width height is bigger than its superview- containerview the frame of the testview including children should be adjusted so that it fits perfectly inside its superviewnow width is always 64px but height is largeras far as i can tell the javascript is only detecting when the height grows greater than the width and vice versanow i want an array which contain those books id s which their height is greater than or equal to their widthjust so you know you want the total width object width + padding + margin + border of both columns to be less than the width of the containerif the height is larger than the width the window is in portrait modeyou are assuming that height is always floor and width is always ciel while in this case height is one less than it should be which is why it isnt completingnext means that the ratio of width to height in devices greater than 960px width should be 1 1meaning if width is greater than screen width image will cover the imageview frame width and takes a corresponding height for that widthi have a div for displaying images placed at the center of a page and below that div i ve added slider displaying image thumbnails using jcarousel clicking on thumbnail images from the slider displays the bigger image inside a div positioned just above the slider and this is done using ajax i mean i m just changing the content of div to display selected image but whenever i click on thumbnail in slider for loading image the page gets scrolled and image is displayed what could be the problem pls suggestsomething like if mousedown position is more than 10px away from mouseup positionthen you can create values folder depending upon height or width and belongs to ldpi or mdpi i.e values-w360dp-mdpi or values-h600dp-mdpii know different engines render fonts differently and but the issue i m having is that firefox renders the font higher than google-chrome - at the size i am displaying the font this is very noticeable 3 or 4 px - which on a button means they re totally misalignedi would advice to check if the width is bigger than the height of the picture taken landscape picture and if that is the case show an alert to the users to explain that just portrait pictures are supportedafter the dialog is created set the new width for the dialog wrapper and start an animate if the current height is lower then the calculatedif the vertical scroll doesn t have the right height make sure that your content width is not bigger than width of the containersafari will expand up to a width of 800px unless the width is already greater than 800 in which case it maintains that width and only modifies the window height3-2 if width is more over than height thenit s close - i m finding if height is greater than width the left position of the rotated image is incorrectif the thumb text width is less that the height of the track the thumb shape will be scaled downthe imageview is bit taller than the textview and so what i do is add padding margins to the bottom of textview to get it align and look like the imageview and textview horizontal centers are alignedeven if the text size is far larger than the width or height of the textviewfor example say your cv point must be a valid coordinate within the image the coordinates must be positive and less than the width heightscott suggested to remove the transform -50 -50 which makes perfect sense if you wanted the div centered in the first place but if you wanted that in there still and have it centered as a square in a rectangle height is smaller than width then 45 by -290you could also do some magic with jquery on orientationchange and toggle some classes when viewport width is greater as viewport heightin picturebox i saw this image left rotated.but if image width is bigger than height there is no problemif requestedsize bigger than max size of the rangei have trouble with the other sizes - more height than widthin other words if either maxwidth is greater than the width of or maxheight is greater than the height of it will return truei have few images thats being displayed now there are some images where the width of the image is greater than the height of the imagespecifically when window width is no more than 680px iframe height should beif your content height and width is less the screen height and width in that case scroll will not appear if content got out of container height and width scroll will comethis also happens on smaller devices between portrait and landscape modes which is really my concernif you want it to scroll the width and height must be larger than the width and height of the scrollview itselfmy assumption is that the library would take a vertical image see that the height is greater than the width and translate the height width config appropriately so the image remains verticali use a directive to set the width and height which are passed into an isolate scope then set the background-image property when i detect the directive top offset is less than the height of the windowtotal width of button in safari web inspector 6px larger than in google-chrome web inspectorin crystal report if i set a user defined size as 4ã 6 it sets the page landscape as height is less than width due to this printer prints page on landscape mode i want it in portraityou just perform the apply the aspect ratio of the image to the imageviews height and if it s greater than the width set it to the widthhowever when i build the apk and run it on my android phone the image is distorted width greater than heighti think your problem is because your view canvas label etc width height is smaller than your imageif the picture is vertical the height should be greater than the widthi brute forced it a bit with forcing the height of the box to always be larger than the widthmy tiles are 32x32 pixels whilst my trees are not going to be one tile but a sprite with greater height than widthi ve tried 2 ways of rotating the image when the width is less than the height both are in this codethis will give all the images a width of 100 and scale height but if the image height is higher then the crop max-height it will not be shownso it needs to downsize the image so that both the width and height are larger than the width and height of the target maintaining aspect ratioin this screenshot the image must be expanded to up and down because its width height ratio is larger than the originalso how can i determine a smaller width and height to which i will resize the watermark image something much less than 150 width 20 height so that it will appear still as a watermark and wont mask the image completelythis would mean that the image should never be more than 100 width but it allows the image to be proportional to the 100px heightthe reason why you would still see distortion is because the original image is wider than the width that you are specifying or height if the distortion is verticalthis properly means if the file is an image of gif or jpeg or png and is less than that sizeheight 110px | width relevant to the height if the width is bigger than heightin order for a block level element to be centered on a page you need to provide a width that is smaller than the width of the parent element it is nested in and then set the margin to be auto for the left and right sidesto do that the div must have a width smaller than the width of the parent container of course it must be display block and have margin 0 autohow can i display a cover image at the top of a web page that stretches when the width of the screen is bigger than the width of the image but that retains a fixed heightthe following code is working without any error but my problem is when i create a thumbnail some times thumbnail are non understandable one some conditions such as width is very larger than height i also tried a code for calculate height automatically.but it won t perfectly worksif the width gets smaller the height should get larger accordingly to display the whole contentmobile devices have greater height than width in contrary computers have greater width than heightdocuments are most likely to be in portrait format taller than they are wide so if the height is greater than the width then do don t have to do anythingportrait orientation is that one where the width smaller than the heightdetermine if the span s width is greater than the useable width of the input element and update the font-size accordinglyyou also need to set a height that is greater than the negative top margin so part of the element will be visible so the user can hover over itwhen you zoom in google chrome some zoom levels cause the children elements to be larger than the parent elementin that font the zero width space is taller than verdana characters are causing added height requirementsrealising that event.pagex would always be at least 1 and never more than 1 less than the width and that event.pagey would never be more than 1 less of the parent s height i added a rudimentary function to expand the coordinate range from 0 to the full width and or heightthere is also a background image on each column that is scaled to fit either the height or width whichever is greateradding margin adds more width making the total width of the two elements and their margin greater than 100 pushing the elements onto separate linesif left is larger than body width or top is larger than body heighthow to set the size of img so that it s max-width is set to 200px if the width is smaller than height the image height is auto in this case to preserve aspect ratio and set max-width to 200px if the width is bigger than heightit is to make it smaller by height and widthin case your image s width height is smaller than form contentpane s width height you might as well do not scale it since the image will fit the screenthese matrixes can be horizontal height of matrix is lower than its width or vertical height of matrix is higher than its widthnow i want to show an error message when the image isn t a png jpg or gif or is larger than 250kthe presence of a tab bar controller was enough to make the height 768 - 20 - 49 699 just smaller than the width 1024 - 320 - 1 gutter 703unless the screen height is less than 580px or width less than 930pxlike changing vw to vh when the width of the page is bigger and vh to vw when height is biggeri have this code for when an image loads in our app and then when the height is greater than the width add a class to bump up the marginwhen i add a margin to the divs the width becomes smaller and the height stays the same so the aspect ratio changesi used firebug to look at the divs and imgs and both imgs have 0 for margin padding and border yet the computed height somehow is 4.5px bigger in the first instancethe issue is that the phone screens height in landscape mode is likely much less than a tablet or pclet s consider i only want to allow 4 lines in the following example you can t go higher than a height of 84 pixels with the given font in a given uitextview with a width of 200you can also at this time query the status bar navigation bar and toolbar for their sizes and get the correct post-rotation values although the status bar width and height may be swapped--i just take the smaller value as the height works greati have an issue when the player is small the children combine width is greater than the parent widthas you can see the bottom two photos landscape so have been rotated are narrower than the portrait ones at the topif the magnitude of the distance between the center of the circle and the center of the polygons is less than the radius of the circle the polygons intersectsi ve found that if you load an image from the camera roll that is a png pngs have no orientation data flag and the height is greater than the width upon applying certain distortion filters to said image it will rotate and present it self as if it were a landscape imageyou are checking whether the width which starts out at 350px is greater than height 325 and whether height 325 is greater than width 350i have a centred fixed width content div and if there isnt enough content ie an small error page the height of it is smaller than the height of my web-browseri m making a responsive site and i m needing my images to be no more than 100 width of their containing elements but also no more than a certain percentage height in case they fall off the pagethe width is the same as the height so it shouldn t pose a problem since it won t ever be wider than the heighti can manage the height by giving specific size but the width is displayed less than screen sizebasically you need to create a random x position with the an upper bound no greater than the width of the applet and a random y position with an upper bound no greater than the height of the applet for example.because it is solid scroll bar calculated needed cell s height is not correct now cell s width is little smaller - scroll bar is part of a viewwe next tried to just look at the actual screen size assuming that when width was greater than height we were in landscape modethen we can calculate the width and height of the area for that 4 points and pick the smaller one well sometime width can be greater than height i guess.the problem is when the window s height is larger than it s width the grid inside the window gets clippeduntil all your provinces are larger than min size and smaller than max sizeif browser size is less than 400 width or 300 height scrollbars are usedthe whole problem is because of the div 2 height and width is larger than div 1i am trying to reference images with a greater height than width portrait format in kml script for google earthmy code might be a bit off and only for one side of the room but conceptually you are checking if your camera position modified by an offset based on camera width or height is greater or less than the room position modified by an offset based on room width or heightwhen i put back the width of tile and set to 100 the columns turn to 6 which i wanted but the height of tile is longer than the height of all its childrenthe fact that you have height length and width makes it harder than a simple knapsack problemif the image that s inside has a width that s smaller than its height add class portraiti m trying to size an image in a table-cell to be no larger than the height width of the table-cell but it s not workingcorrect me if i m wrong but if the magnitude of the projection of your point on the height vector is less then the magnitude of the height vector which is half of the height of the rectangle and the magnitude of the projection of your point on the width vector is then you have a point inside of your rectanglei m trying to figure out why the java print api can t handle paper sizes where the width is greater than the heightthis will slidedown the navbar when the scroll is greater than 150px and will slideup when is less or equal than 150px- that s the real problem the height is autmatically calculated from the width by the proportions of the image but when the calculated height is more than 710px it will be forced to be only 710px and the image proportion will be distorteddisk is bigger than ramabove images are portrait but if you calculate height and width you will find that width is more than heightbut this technique doesn t work when height is resized extended by word wrapping that is if a sentence is wider than the width of the text box and the textbox creates a new line automaticallydetails i wish to resize it to a specified width keep the proportions and if the height is bigger than a specified value to crop it to the specified heighttry your current setup in google-chrome google-chrome typically has a narrower minimum viewport width and try something like min-width 600px in firefox and your styles should be applied as expected layout.css will be applied when the viewport is at least 600px wideanother problem is if use multiple monitors together for viewing desktop the width will be very bigger than the height so the boxes will have smaller height and bigger widththe width padding and margin together make it so that the total width of the element is larger than the width of the screenwhich means if viewport width is more than 970 and viewport height is more than 0 serve nothingthe image is exaggerated in that it s width is normally bigger than its heightas some height width info is farther out in the headerthen you can write separate css for width less than 650px portrait more than 650 landscapefor the tall window case the blue will stretch to have a greater height than width making it easy to identifyyou basically need to make sure that either the content has a bottom margin greater than or equal to the height of the footer or if the content is in a container of some sort that it s container has a bottom padding equal to or greater than the height of the footerif the width of the image is greater than its height landscapebecause in landscape your height is smaller than in portrait you need to have a value smaller than 1.0as bigger the width and the height is as better is the image definitionlike on the ipad lest say its 137p x 60p and lets say the iphone s width is 150 smaller and the height is lets say is 125 smallerthe children iframe will always be bigger than parent div and parent div overflow will be hiddenand if image width or height is bigger than 2000 is am handling it in delegate method to downgrade it before caching mentioned belowwidth is less than height implies the portrait-secondaryit looks like a page in landscape because the dimensions of the page are created in such a way that the width is greater than the heightits because the height of the screen in portrait mode is more when compared to height of the screen in landscape modei am essentially trying to state if an has the class of cboxphoto then run the each function is for detecting the height width and add the class of relative if the image width is greater than it s height...then using the animate on click event you could give the height a value and animation time the width a delay equal o bigger than the height animation time and then it s value...that should do the trick but it s more stiff than actually using the uiauto shrink only seems to apply when the width is smaller than needed and not when the height is insufficientwhen i try to change the height and width using and the height changes perfectly while the width only changes if it is less than the width of the viewport so it wont go wider than 323 pixelshover toggles the height width when device width is wider than 768px while a click toggles the height width when device width is less than 768pxphotoshop opens it and shows it vertical mac preview does too but getimagesize keeps telling me width is bigger than heightbelow is my code for displaying a full-screen background image and also has some basic function for detecting whether the device s width is larger than the heighti needed to compare the width and the height of the uiimage when width is larger than height i will add borderinstead of figuring out the individual positions for each image button it is easier to simply right-align them by modifying the anchorpoint to 1.0f 0.5f and then position the images button at exactly the screen width and variable screen height position screen width 100if you make it transparent or less than full width height then it will appear on top of the content behind itin portrait the spacing is decent but in landscape mode i feel like the graphs should be bigger and take up more space than in portrait mode which is simply not possible with the tab bar and navigation barreturned thumbnail width or height which is bigger is 130px alwayscalculate the size of the blue view get the height width whatever is bigger calculate the missing dimensionclone the div incrementally strip words out until the clone s height width becomes less than the original sthat being said using viewport units for font-size in the above way is problematic because when the viewport width is much smaller - say 320px - then the rendered font size will become 0.03 x 320 9.6px which is very too smallmodify the height and width of the plots so that all four have uniform width one is substantially taller than the others which have uniform height among themif the element height is greater than the window height minus the nav bar height then additional margin is added to the bottom of my element so that what was hidden behind the bottom nav bar is now revealed on scrollif that still doesn t help alter the last to values viewbox attribute of the svg itself and make it one pixel wider and higher than the width and the height of the svghowever after rotating a rectangular image its new width and height is much bigger as these two screenshots should help clarify during rotation and after rotating then rotating again -- the little handles show where the images x y width height extends toi am working on a responsive sidebar that appears when the button to make it appear is clicked on it uses the transition effect and does not make the page take up more than 100 width or height of the pageif the width is greater than the height of an individual page add a dictionary entry to that page and explicitly set it s rotationby default the image width will fill 100 of the view port width 100vw but if the page has a height that is greater than the width or has a landscape orientation the background-size is overridden so that the image height fills 100 of the view port height 100vhi was able to remove the unwanted behavior described above by turning the droppable into the parent of the element and added a margin padding that is slightly larger than the draggable snaptolerancetry setting just either height or width whichever is more important to youoverall width height is much smallerif in java code the values would be in pixels so 50px on mdpi screens will look larger than on hdpi screensthe actual visible size is determined by the font-size and to a lesser extend by the fontfamilyis there a way to change the height so that its smaller than the width to make horizontal rectanglesthe scroll function hide the cart button if scrolltop is less than the height of the navigation barif the aspect ratio is 1 then the height is larger than the widthwith this gives you a figure of which the height is 300x smaller than the widthheight width are taken to show that if you 2 such children it will scroll horizontally since height of child is greater than height of parent scroll verticallythe width is equal to screen size but the height is much longer and that is what i want to scroll.but since i want a portrait preview i need to rotate the image and as a consequence i get images with an height much larger than the width the transpose of the original image i guessto resume the image has the same width of the parent div but its height is bigger so a part of the image is hiddenelements smaller than height or width is less than 2000px will become circles elements larger than height or width is more than 2000px will not become circles but rather stay their original shapes but have largely rounded cornerswhile setting it to the imageview check if the width of the image is greater than height or not and rotate it to 90 if neededif you wan to account for all the possible options real height width bigger smaller than virtual height width and to make sure that the best configuration is delivered the rescaling occurs such that the available space is maximised it is not so straightforwardwidth and height of the canvas element need to be as big or bigger than the width and height of the image which i wasn t setting when i created the image objectyes super and extends gives inclusive lower and upper bounds respectivelyso initially it is a bit smaller than the height and width of the spinner after selecting another item it becomes really bigger than the spinners sizeif i have a writeablebitmap version of my image and either the height or width whichever is larger is scaled to be either the screen height or width then how might i over lay that image on top of another image that is the page size to make the image become a full screen imageminus doesn t truly work for antialiasing less than 100 transparent pixelsif you have an image which has a ratio like 16 9 so the width is larger than the height use the method abovethere is two case if your actual image size is equal or grater than your imageview width and height then you can use adjustviewbounds property and if your actual image size is less than imageview width and height than use scaletype property to shown image in imageview based on your requirementas the image width is always bigger than the height this condition always is trueportait in a mobile device is that orientation where the width is smaller than the heighti used gif because its file size 2.1kb was considerably less than png or jpeg in this caseunfortunately most system trays limit the height of icons to a very small size and gtk.statusicon automatically scales down the pixbuf so that both the width and height are smaller than the height limiti have this doubt i have a menu in which i run a javascript code or another depending on whether its width is greater or less than its height works me well the first time the screen resolution is detected but if there is a change of resolution or a change of orientation does not detect it and despite for example of having changed to portrait orientation still executing the landscape orientation codeit will scale your bitmap but not greater than the width and height that is because it can cause blurriness to your bitmapthe slider code automatically fills in the width of the space 100 width and the height is more or less around 500px when the browser is maximizededit actually you resize the one that is the biggest if width is bigger you resize that and if height is bigger then you resize thatsafari 5.1.10 6534.59.10 middle handles a smaller viewport but in sort order with a smaller viewport computes new image sizes even smaller than google-chromethe precision of the gyroscope and accelerometer sensors is much greater than the precision of the compass and gpsthe vertical spacing in firefox between the real estate search h2 tag and the form input field for san francisco ca #city-field input tag is perfect but in google-chrome google-chrome is applying more extra vertical spacing than desiredthe logic is that the default orientation for a device who s width is greater than it s height is most likely a tablet and not a mobile phone deviceand program will check if width divided by height is less oneif your video s height width is more than height width of the device set width to be 100 else set height to be 100the problem is that when i move to an android device whose orientation is landscape by default the device s hardware is arranged in such a way that it is clear it is intended to be used mainly in landscape orientation the x and y coordinates are reversed and the fact that the window s height is greater than its width can t be used to determine whether the user is holding the device with it s top up and its bottom downfor some of them the width is much more bigger than the height for some of them the height is much more bigger than the width and for some of them height and width are almost the same1 giving more padding to the parent element s left and right side if your icon has more height than width and vice versaif you want to use it then add a bottom margin to the content_main which should be equal or greater than the height of the ad layoutwhile it works excellent i m trying to enter php code which resizes images to 120px by width or height whichever is largerbut width and height is fewer propertieswhen i resize my browser window and the div s width becomes smaller the elements inside the div jump below expanding the heightbut in that regard it is replaced by png which is generally smaller supports alpha transparency where gif pixels are either fully transparent or fully opaque and most importantly gif images are limited to 256 colorssince the height is much bigger than the width there are top and bottom parts that are captured in the image that are not showing up in the live feed naturallyfrom there on the width slowly increases again as the part of the string still on line 1 linearly gets wider as the font-size increasesthe problem is that when there is some fixed height opera generates more columns than specified in column-count instead of adding scrolli have ensured that the width value is not less than height alwaysbut in safari browser the table cell height is bigger than the width i did not set the whole table dimensionsi have a header image that i would like to be 100 of the screen in width when the width of the screen is shorter than the height and 100 of the screen in height when the height the screen is shorter than the widthsomethinghere s solution isn t bad but when the screen s width is greater than its height the image will leave 20 of white space on top and bottomits height and width is more than the mobile screen sizewhen scrolltop is less than 300 show the div otherwise hide italthough the uiimageview is square the uiimage s height is much larger than the widthmore specifically if the image height is greater than the width the generated height will be the same as the resulting .png s height but the generated width will be slightly smalleri am developing application which requires many more than 80 screens layouts each layout having different image views buttons textviews and so on and i have to be able to switching between them upon button clicksgiven that the child also has a fixed width and height that is less than the size of the parent this will push the browser into an impossible situationwhen the uitableviewcontroller view width is made bigger 500px+ the cell adopts the correct height however label 1 becomes too big for its content spanning 1 line of text over 2 lines and label 2 becomes squashed spanning 2 lines of text into 1 lineit seems that if width height is larger than 1.775 i should use widthx as resize value and if else than i should use xheightbasically you would start with a font height smaller than the height of your textview and then iterate or do a binary search through fonts of varying sizes until you find one that measures to smaller than the width of your textviewthe draggable div is greater in height and width than droppable divvmax - relative to viewport s width or height whichever is the largerif the height of the image is smaller than the width i set the height to be equal to the width and crop the width accordingly with aspect unchangedi am using liquid fun library for my android project when i have my glsurfaceview width equal to or bigger than the height everything works well but when i set height bigger than the width the particles rendering doesn t work wellnow usually with this approach when the element width and height is more than the default width and height of the drawing surface what the browser does is it scales up the drawing surface to find the canvas element sizeso if the width was greater than the height doingif its width or height is larger than your max values then it will be resized by keeping the aspect ratiomy imageview has bigger width than heightthen if the height is longer than the width you set the height to 500px and set the width to autoon pageshow or pagebeforeshow add that class if screen height is greater than width portraitmanaged to accomplish it by checking whether the pan tilt amount added to the zoom width height is greater than the overall image width height then stop it from panning tiltinghowever if the height is larger than the width aspect fit will increase the height of the uiimageviewso the problem is the javascript is not adding class from the image if image height greater than the widthi have an unordered list with 2 elements in it for this example and i want the height of the list element to match the width of the element when the screen width is larger than 480pxwhat i am after is to have the image the same width as the canvas and if the height is larger than the height of the canvas then it overflows and is hidden...i just want to fill the width and keep the aspect ratioand to resize the image proportionally when the screen width is smaller than 1000px i set the max-width as 100 and height as auto using cssif the width is larger than the height itâ s in landscape modeheight must be between 10 and 20 if your width is greater than 5it s a bold meaning that its width is greater than its height which makes its portrait view a landscapei have a scrollable panels that shows content larger than the screenpages are landscape if their width is bigger than their heightthe image itself may be bigger or smaller than that height and width and i want to adjust the image to fit the size rather than repeating or showing only part of the imageon page load detect if body s height is larger than window s height and if not move #header #content and #footer to the left via padding or via margin on the bodyin that case if the total images width height is greater then the screen s width height it will just cut off. brbut if a user uploads a picture with less width than heightuse min-width and or max-width to give the element a defined width which is more flexible than a single width value and then give the element a margin 1em auto style to centre it horizontally within the unused width available in its parent elementedit - now that i think about it i m not sure why your image would appear smaller unless your screens had a greater dpi than hdpifor example if your screen is 600 pixels wide and if the rss feed string takes more than 600 pixels to display you will not be able to see the end of your rss feedthe image is placed in a correct height but the width could be bigger or smaller than the height constraintswhen viewing my text area in firefox it shows up a correct width col 30 however in ie and google-chrome it s significantly smalleron an iphone compact in landscape mode the status bar is hidden and the navigation bar height is less than in portraitwith this code image will be stretched if image container width is bigger then image actual heightwhat i want it to do is to center a given image from a database into a div for example if the given images width is bigger than height it echos it with a left margina tablet offers more screens space than a phonenow i have another device which has the same pixel resolution of 480x800 but since the screens is smaller it has screens size normal and hdpi aka device 2i suppose that it is happening becouse when the keyboard is opened it resizes the browser window to other size that on some devices is recognized as landscape becouse window width is greater than window heightthat will also works if the height of the window is larger than the widthcheck if image width is greater than its height and if so rotate image clockwisein other words when the image s width is more than it s height then there will be an space in between the bottom border of the uiimageview and the image itselfwhen the height gets dramatically larger while width stays the same we throw a hide keyboard eventfirst one margin auto is better if you can know width of container list and you don t want centre content of this containerso problem is images are display more than width size and some lower than width then i won t set dynamically set height and widthfor height it just meant the height needed to fit the contents but for width auto is actually more complicatedi can t find a way to stop non-flex divs to become larger than their parent when their combined children s height gets too tallas the simplest solution swap width and height if width is lesser than height so you always get the resolution of landscape modetablelayout gives you a good mechanism for rows and columns managing width and height is easier but you d need more code to change the placement of all controls if you want to remove one from the form dynamicallyi have about 10 or more objects with same width but different heightso try changing the position of views to make use of the width when height is lessif the width of the label in interface builder the literal size in interface builder is greater than the width of the view at runtime then the height of the container is too small and lines of text get cut offnb the run time screen shot is me changing the height and width of the rectangle to an arbitrary size greater than the width and height of the textbox1 first of all the width of your two select boxes are bigger than the width of the column that contains it you need to take into account all padding and margin usedunfortunately the trackpad s scrolling deltas are orders of magnitude higher than a mouse s so the scroll speed is psychotically highrather than using fixed width height it is better to create a layout which allows the textblock to adjust its widththis should fit the image to the height of the gridview maintaining the aspect ratio and crop the remaining width unless the image s width is smaller than that of the gridview when the height is matchedvisible elements have a width or height that is greater than zero. -and you know your image at hdpi folder so its 1.5 larger than the mdpiissue has fixed size but works so long as larger than site width image heighti m trying to ensure that if the text happens to be longer than the height of the image the image expands to fill the whole space left column but doesn t break its width constrainti need to force the width when i am adding the image to the layout i mean that the image must be keep the aspect ratio but the image must be higher than the height of the screen and the image must be shown incomplete if the height of the image is higher than the height of the screenif the width will be greater than height so will the border thickness on sidesin order to do so you need to find out if the svg is portrait or landscape - meaning if the width is smaller than height former or not latteri am new in android i need to display the image in circular form but some images which have more than width and height from custom circular image view then displaying the image as streching form but i want to show the image with reduce the size of image and show in circleit happens because you are using layout_width 100dp for every image view and 20dp of margin so the final width of your layout bigger than screen width of devicebecause the width was bigger than the height of the pictures the img element was too small and the rotated picture overlaid some of the text above and belowthe trackpad is much more sensitive and can get the breakpoint increment correctly but the mouse wheel ends up scrolling through the section much quicker without correctly keeping up with the proper frame rate so i never end up reach the final frame by the end of the sectionthen i check if the width of the video is greater than the height and rotate the screenthen using img you always going to have a vertical scrollbar if the img height is higher than viewport height if img hasn t a parent with a widthif the height is greater than 66px i want to apply a negative top margin equal to half of its heightthen i would simply check the edges of all blue polygons whose lower bound of distance is lower than the upper bound of minimal distance against all the edges of the red polygonsassuming the imageview is always bigger than the textview it ll drive the parent heightif the image height and width is smaller than imageview original image should be displayedone where height is bigger than width and one where width is bigger than heightone specifying the height of the inner view is less than the height of outer view and one specifying the width of the inner view is less than the width of outer viewi have a bingmap its width and height is more than parent divand if the image s height is greater than maxheight or the width is greater than maxwidth i d like to proportionally resize the image so that it fits in maxwidth x maxheightif the width is greater than the height of the image you can safely assume that it was taken in landscape modechrome however stops displaying the canvas when the height becomes larger than 8130 pixels the width is constant - 834 pxsince the flex container box original width height is very lessyour scrollview height is less than the uiview which is the subviews in your case of scrollview and for scrolling it fully you will have to set your scrollview contentsize height more than the height of the view you are scrolling in it please give a check on this pointupdate as pointed out by der golem take the smaller between width and height so that all sides should be equali notice that when the arrow block is rendered when width is less than 296 px inside the carousal there is some space between the left border of the carousal and the arrow block even though i did not add padding or marginusing media screen and orientation portrait means that when is the width of the screen bigger then its height and when the soft keyboard popup the width of the screen become bigger than the height so that happenif either width or height has more than 0 then it doesn t return anythingif the first image is large like this one where the height is more and width is less it would look like thisinversely if the width is greater the generated height will be slightly smalleri need to resize an image so that if its height is smaller than its width i ll set its height and vice versawhichever value height or width has the greater aspect ratio gets its value computed from the other valuethen i have a photo with vertical orientation please notice that height is higher have 6000 pixels and width have 4000 pixels so it is definitely vertical photo768px which applies for everything bigger such as large tablet screens and desktops screensa hack around is a custom scrollpanelayout which adds the scrollbar width if the view s height is less than the actual viewport height a crude example beware not production quality to play within some scenarios i can prevent the image from getting too torn apart by rotating the image 90 degrees if the width of the image is greater than the height of the imagewhat i don t understand is the width is 600 on the universal storyboard so how do i then get the ratio of the height being 33 greater than the widthhowever i realize you probably want it to be more than the width and height so you don t see the edges of the shapes but i figure you can fix that upwidth is usually less than height you might want to think about inverting the coordinates iei then do a settimeout to check if the div s height and width is greater than 1question is there a way i can switching these two col-md 6 s around when the screens is less that x pixels acrossso when playback i first check the orientation of the video by measuring width and height and if width is longer than height rotate textureview by 90 degrees by below codeand if the height is actually heigher than the height set by the width you additionally needand i just recently found out that the above applies only to image whose width is larger than heightin general i use uiscreen.main.bounds.size s smaller value as the width of the table and my cell will compute its height for that width via uilabel.sizethatfits ...scaling the captured image to fit the uiimageview s height scale by 0.25 means the captured image will be of size 160x284 - its width is smaller the the uiimageview s widthi m not an expert on css but isn t using style a better idea than width height attributesfor this you can create a new transparent png or white 200 200 jpg and place the newly generated image apprioriately i.e if height is less place it vertically centered or if the width is less place it horizontally centered and save that filenoting that if you have an img bigger than the width that you want just add overflow hidden to #banner to hidden the overflow part of the img and maybe a desired fixed height if you wantbut what i want to do now is say if the scrollwidth or height is more than the canvas height or widthbut if they went fullscreen or wide width is greater than height they would see a sidebar on the left and maybe also the righti know emacs tries to be intellectual and opens its helper buffers depending on which dimension of the window is bigger so it may appear in vertical split window if current width is bigger than height and in horizontal split otherwisedevice width greater than device heightif the width is less than the height then it will scale the height by the ratio of height to width and leave the width at 4 units -2 to +2this is weird cause i would figure that the width should have a bigger value than the height right nowi have tried following code but it distorts the image if height is more than width but looks perfectly if it is vice versaif you set the width and height of the element and set the offset to any size the same size for both left and right or top and bottom it will be centered because the element cannot get any larger than its width and height attributesyou will get a vertical scroll bar when the height increases more than 500px and a horizontal scroll bar if the width increases more than 250pxyes there is add containerdiv img inside block add the width and height if the image this should give it a fixed size if the image is smaller width and height is smaller than the properties in the div the image will be stretched and if larger the image will be shrunkanother question is why the height is filled while the children elements width is larger than parent elementthe issue is that without the margin on the bottom the page height is shorter then the window bounds thus your footer div ends and the body of the page bleeds throughhow can fix this problem so any image that is lower than 500 width and height does not need to be resizewhen i want to draw a rectangle in c# using pen tools if the rectangle width and height is less then the pens width then program draw nothing in from if pens alignment property inset .but when i set alignment center then it print a rectanglefrom my experience background images tend to load faster altough images with height and width specifed can load faster but i don t think you have that optionwhen the screen in wider than its height set the image in css to width 100height is greater than 200 we need to calculate the new width andthe circle will stay perfect as long as the width is less than the heightwithin the head row there are lists of a height that is longer than the head rows height they are however only supposed to be visible on hover but when on hover they are supposed to be ontop of the headrow but still having the the original 100 width of the parent being the element of the columnalthough layout_width and layout_height are set to wrap_content the imagebutton is shown as a rectangle with the height greater than the widthit can be less than height and width if the scrollbox logical area is not bigger than phisical area scrollbars not visible in that casethere is more than one screens size in android and what fits on a qvga 2.8 screens and what fits on a 10 tablet will not be the samewhat i want is to keep the image s 16 9 ratio at all times with the image in the centre and just scale the image based on whether the window s width height is respectively longer shorter than the default imagei just re-sized the image if the image s width and height is greater than the frame size and displayed the re-sized image on it and if the image dimension is smaller than the frame i displayed as it isthe solution is to choose the minimum metric between width and height since in multi-window mode the height can be smaller than the widthi m sure if we did these same calculations with an image which had a greater height than width we d have the same problem with it having black space at the bottom of the image insteadi tried changing the screen resolution in a virtual machine orientation change is really just a screen resolution change that results in width being larger than height or vice versa and could not trigger any layout eventsthe images can be of any resolution size and the height sometimes is bigger than the width and vice versa for both imagesyou could use the tga format which is more common than ppm and allows true grayscale imagesthis means that font-size is more comparable to height than it is to widthif this app can rotate you might need two sets of constraints one for when the width is less than the height the other for when the height is less than the widthhow come photoshop sees its height bigger than its widthright now i scale by height which works to some degree however as the width gets smaller the image gallery will be cut off as the container has overflow hidden on some smaller widths as it is adjusting by the height of the container to stay in proportion but doesn t consider the width of the container too essentially the width is longer than the container widththe immediate children children .box that are display table-cell will take the height of the parent that is display tablehowever nowhere in the code have you checked that the width of the view added to the top of the view is not greater than the height of bitmaptosavethe orientation media feature is portrait when the value of the height is greater than or equal to the value of the width mdashand if the bitmap s height is greater than maxheight or the width is greater than maxwidth i d like to proportionally resize the image so that it fits in maxwidth x maxheightthe action icons are centered in portrait mode whereas the toolbar in landscape mode is higher and the icons are not centeredright now what this code is producing is the right image doesn t look like a square the width is larger than the heighti want to remove the height property when screen width is less than 700pxit s because you re using and orientation portrait so once the width of the window has a higher value than the height none of your css will be taken into account because it s considered landscape orientation at that pointthe draggable div is 3 times bigger than one droppableit will also automatically apply a 90 degree rotation transformation if the width is bigger than the height before applying any scalingalso if the image width or height is smaller than displaywidth scale you might want to cap it to be image width insteadin the case the height is greater than width simply not all the rows will be used but all of the columns must always be usedbutton height is higher than it s widthwhen i select images which height is bigger than widthif you rotate the device the width becomes the height and we can ignore the change but if the height gets dramatically smaller while the width remains the same it is safe to assume there is a keyboard being shown and we throw a show keyboard event2 take one div in modal-body with width and height fixed and greater than ifrmae width and height likethis can be done using pure css using the vw viewport width vh viewport height vmin relative to width or height whichever is smaller vmax relative to width or height whichever is larger length unitsi want to make the webpage scaling depend on screen height or width which is smallermy problem is that an image larger than the width or height of the screen gets squeezed out of proportion in order to fityou can use gridbaglayout instead of gridlayout to divide the components in rows and columns just like tablelayout that gives you more control on grid width height margins padding column rows etcit breaks in case of views with width comparatively larger than heightbut the problem i am facing is some images are portrait but the width of image is more than heightmy problem is that lower imagebuttons are not shown whenever height of image in imageview is more than its widthif the width is greater then height 3 4 screen.width thensplitactionbar works only on phones because the screens size is much smaller than tablet and it takes space at the bottom for extra space for your action itemsthe resulting png compression may produce a file size larger than your tiff compressionthe idea is that the width is 3 times larger than the height and i was thinking to achieve this with overflow-x auto and overflow-y hidden as shown in the example from the second row 6-th column on these websitethe content is longer than the screens of my tablet so i need to scroll vertically on a cardif your png files are coming out larger than equivalent gif files it is almost certainly because your source image has more than 256 colorsfor cases screen height is more than 0.5625 of width outer layout parts start to eat center2 view - top bottom leading trailing fixed height horizontally center in container if want vertical scrolling or fixed width vertically center if want horizontal scrolling - scrollview will scroll if height of view is greater then screen size or self.view in vertical scrolling case like wise if width is greater then scroll will done in horizontalbecause if you do that then if you tell opengl to draw a square it will appear as a rectangle on the screen instead if you don t have your x axis edges be larger than your y axis edges when your screen width is wider than your screen height as suggested by the imagemy aim is to use a bootstrap 3 dropdown to display links at mobile screens size and use a list to display the same links when the screens is bigger desktop and tablet sizeideally the hdpi version of your button should be 1.5 times bigger than the mdpi baseline versionmy array larger than max height width but not max height max widthto generalize this approach you could try and check whether the offsettop of an element is greater than the height of the container or the offsetleft is bigger than the widthi don t want to hide overflowing part by overflow hidden i want to force parent div.alert height to be not lower than its childrensimilarly max-height will be in effect when height is greater than widththe first example is an image whose width is greater than its heightyou can also see if the screen width is larger than the screen height since sometimes especially on first launch of the app it will be uideviceorientationunknownmy code so far which works like expected in the broswer with width of 560 and height of 500but the image data required for this height and width is greater than what is given by the filethe specified width and height cannot be less than the width andfor a very simple example there are three slides the slides are just fixed positioned at 100 width and height the last one has an overflow auto on it so one can scroll its content that doesn t need any animation and might not need more than 100 height egif im2 exists before this code is run and its width or height is larger than the image you are generating the new image will only overwrite the top left corner of your existing im2in short i want it such that when i change the width of the browser the red div s height gets smalleraccording to wikipedia the png format provides better compression than gifas long as landscape means wider than taller and portrait viceversa it means to read the image into memory and check width and heightby giving the middle indicators div a left and right margin slightly larger than the width of the left and right button divs you allow it to float up between the two and take up as much space as possibleso the majority of desktop and laptop screens nowadays have a width greater than the heighti m currently working on a view which would display different images downloaded from online the images could have a different ratio but would still have a higher width than heightso here when you enter multiwindow mode your app s window no longer fits screen - width is greater than height and it is considered as landscapehowever if i manually type in the link or refresh the page in mobile screen width less than 750px it goes to the same height location for the link as it would normally go to for a full width which is further down on the page for mobilewhen draw a td check if its width or height is larger than 1 if it is set its rowspan colspanspecifically the height must be at least 120px and if the width is less than 100px then the aspect ratio must be no greater than 3.0how can i go about resizing cropping an image so the height is constant but its width gets smaller as the page is resizedfor photos taken on other devices pass successfully when are rotated to portrait height bigger than widthsince the size could change be greater than 650 height or width it is considered ambiguousif you set the width to lower than the portrait width and set the min-width to 100 then you sill get width 100 but this time a version that actually works and now the iframe takes the actual container width and not the landscape widthwhen the image is resized while maintaining its aspect ratio chances are that either the image s height or width becomes smaller than imageview s dimensionswhen printing to pages that have a greater height than width if i am using a small width label tape and printing landscape there are no problemssuch that a landscape image would have an ideal height of 300 or slightly larger with a width 400 and a portrait image would have an ideal width of 400 or slightly larger with a height 300you may want to check if the width is greater than the heighthow can i make my webpage switching buttons from on hover to on toggle when the width of the screens is less than 769pxif the height is higher than the width then you can say it s portrait or else landscapein order to keep the date nicely fit across the width of the screen i decided to dynamically let the font-size change whenever the string changes in width may is wider than julnow i can see the image and just fit the screen nicely but the image is just at the top of uiscrollview . notes in this circumstance the width of my image after being zoomed to minimum zoomscale equals to the width of uiscrollview the height of my image after being zoom to minimum zoomscale less than the width of uiscrollviewarea 1 width is 15f and the height is more than 15f does not matter as long as it s at least 15fgreater than 5000 width x 5000 height pixels piczard raises anthe program s label changes dynamically so when the width is greater landscape mode it s label has a different text then when the height is greater portrait modethe height is set correctly but the width is smaller than 14.5emi have a div tag with height set to 800px i want that when the browser width is greater than 600px it shouldn t stretch the div but it should bring it to the middle of the pageswitching from the full nav-bar to the hamburger menu when the

toolbar change it s height to 48pfind out if the height is less or the width is lesssome function which can rotate images which have bigger width than heighti only want it to fit the width 100 and wish to become bigger than the height but not leave the certain containerits a bool value so if the maximum of width or height is greater than real width then you get trueonce the clone s width is less than or equal to the input element s width we delete the clone element and set the input s font-sizeimage s width is less than div s width i can use margin auto herea bitmap of a screenshot can get really big on a tablet since the screens resolution is likely higheradjusting the height and width essentially adds more space around your text within the selectyour image is stretching because you ve set both the width and height to 100 so the browser is making the image width fit the div width which is thinner than the aspect ratio of your imagein portrait width of the screen is less than heighti am using view flipper to show bunch on images like a slider where i implemented the functionality of swipe left and right to switching images now some of my images are larger than the screens size in terms of height are getting hiddenchecking if screen width is larger than height is useless in my case because the app always runs in landscapeso height auto seems more consistent with the grid based on width and a vertical scrollbari m trying to use universal image loader uil in my test project and i think i m having trouble loading images when their height is greater than their widthcss height 100 gives an element height that is actually greater than 100 by the size of the marginthe main advantage of the debian image is the smaller size â it clocks in at around 85.1 mb compared to around 200 mb for ubuntuand i don t why appears in this format width larger than heightthe invisible square link is about 200px higher than firefox google-chrome positioningyour mobile screen is less than 1000px so your margin set in percentage is relative to the screen width which is less than 1000px in this caseif the width is bigger then the height landscapeif the image is larger than the height it will only put the height to 350px and ignore the width that i ve set to 350 toothat will ensure that either the width or height is no greater than 640 but will not stretch the image making it look funnyicon size indexed png is often smaller than the same gifyou can change the width and height attributes on the referenced svg if they are bigger than the width and height on the iframe element you should get scrollbarsas-is it maximizes the width and assumes that the height is not greater than the height of the screeni add the detail that opening it only with some software paint picasa viewer ... i see the picture squeezed horizontally of about 50 this way width is smaller than height to my eye toowhen resizing the image if the width side is larger than the height resize the image so that the image height is the div s height and hide the width overflow after centeringthe other page isn t rotated but it has a height that is smaller than the widthby default even html and body are only as big as the content they hold but never more than the width height of the windowslet s boil your trouble down to this if the mouse is over #inner you can t use the usual methods spacebar arrow keys trackpad wheel to scroll #outer up and downso basically the small and medium sizes are a vertical layout as the height is bigger than the widtht he height must be at least 120px and if the width is less than 100px then the aspect ratio must be no greater than 3.0i have a page that hide the header if the window height is less than width thes is my codewidth divided by height is larger than 1.33 but i probably wrote it wrongsince your height is smaller than the width it should do the trickmy imade doesnt display when the image height is less than 981pz width is less than 477pzto explain the logic all it does is sets the width to 100 and checks if it s height is greater if it isn t then width 100 is finehowever when the window itself has a greater width than height i want a widget b to fill the remainder width not used by the drawing areaan image with more height than width will result in the above codehowever this does not take into account the space taken by the notification bar or window decorations so in reality you have less space than width times heightthen how to know when width is greater and when height is greaterthe problem is that even with that the scrollview doesn t allow me to scroll more than it s original width and the height is bigger than it should be even though the last line of code sets the content size of the scrollviewhowever in this case when i have 150px height image the 150 width seems start lowerthese are the cases if the image width is greater than 2048 then we need to scale down to 2048 same as if the image height is greater than 1229 then we need to scale down to 1229you can then use imagecopy to insert each gif image including the background and imagepng to generate png output which is better for line art than jpeg offers better compression than gif and can support more than 256 colorssolved it will resize only if width is larger than 800px or height is larger than 600pxawt is a thin layer of code on top of the os whereas swing is much largermy image is then displayed in an uiimageview where the width is greater than the height which makes the image looks wrongthe first one keeps checking if the image height is less than the div and applies .fillheight class while the next checks for width and applies .fillwidth classso at first this looks ok but is actually is not all pixels in the image are not square but elongated with their height being bigger than their widththe difference between a min and max dimension can be very large as the given area covered by a landscape cell is much wider and shorter than a portrait cellwhen i set it off height width but i d like it to stretch so it supports other device sizes ....i need the height to stretch as well though which does not happen no matter what i tried height keeps turning out smaller than widththe height of the html element is showing as a height greater than screen height which goes against the common belief that html height and width are equal to screen sizeif the height is larger than the width the ratio will be y x instad of x y and minimum will be multiplied by ratio for x instead of ywhat i did is in the completion block of downloading image method i check if the image width is larger then i change the imageview to the new imageview with new resized height but i can t make it work with autolayoutthe content itself has much more height than width and it would be perfect to have the screen split down the middle horizontally with the content on the left and the virtual keyboard on the righteverything works as expected except when the content of the iframe is smaller than width 300 or height 150how do i make perfect centered circle always 100 height of blue div until blue div width because smaller than height and image always covering full circlewhere the width is wider and the height is shorter than 44the resulting file from this png approach is smaller in size than a tiff file and i guess may rescale betterthe basic idea behind the approach is that you map the coordinates of the images to the interval by dividing by the width assuming the width is the larger dimension but it does not matter if it is smaller than the heightfor word to recognize it as landscaped the width must be greater than the heightthe point is inside the circle iff that value is smaller than the height or width of the boxthe element s explicit height or width is less than the height orthe heatmap plot contains way more information and should use 80 of the canvas heightthe the main content div needs to have left margin larger than the width of your sidebari have an application which has a rectangle on a google map at the certain point i have to rotate the rectangle along the vertices as well as it should be editable but the width of the rectangle should be always greater than its heightif your element is rectangle as is yours in the example it will overflow at some point for the width is higher than the heightin ios emulator works all right width of screen is greater than height views frames and bounds are as shownsince the height width is calculated on the visible viewport the soft keyboard apparently causes the orientation to flip now that the viewport width is less than the heightthe script reduces the dimensions of all jpg file in current folder if any width or height is greater than max default 1024 keeping aspect ratio and put them in a different folder createdbut a workaround could be to detect the size of the viewport if the width is greater than the height display normallythe height must be at least 120px and if the width is less than 100px then the aspect ratio must be no greater than 3.0if you resize the browser so that the height is greater than the width you will notice that the scrollbar goes away which is because the padding is relative to the widthin chrome when you use background-size cover if the xpos of background-image is no less than 50 you will meet that problemthis will check if the width of the browser window is greater than the height orientation landscape will do the oppositeevery other button whether using an ico or png that is larger than the target size ends up blurrythe bug occurs if the input has a width that makes it wider than the portrait width when in landscape modenote what i observed is the margins appears only when image width is larger than heightif width is smaller than height store width in one variable called value else store heightit works up to the point where the user s screen height is less than the widthnow i want to order this array by the pictures with the biggest width worth and where the width is bigger than the heightand i m just having trouble saying if the image original file s width is greater than the height then we need the height to expand to the height of the surrounding element and put the width at auto so it doesn t get squished but keeping in mind that the client can upload any image size they want with no restrictions of must be 350x350i have images that have height much greater than widthi m working on a menu bar which initially which have a width property and when the screen size is less than 767 media screen and max-width 767px i need to remove that property.so i m trying to implement that using a class.the height property is specified in this class and want to remove that class when width is less than 767px .is it possible to remove class of an element when change the screen sizesince the width of your image is larger than the height you need to basically reverse these three lines of codei want to make my floatingactionbutton much bigger with custom width and heightthis is to make grid consist of squares instead of having them look like rectangles with height few times greater than width closer to the north and south polesparent s height is higher than its widthi tried the make the div size bigger with height and width properties i tried moving the divs around and i also tried the line-height property and i got nothingmy development environment uses dual-17 monitors which are far bigger than the tablet screens size of 10.4 1024x768if the height of the image is greater than the width then i rotate the image by 270 degreesthe asymmetry might ve been caused by the dimensions of the spinner container .round where its width was 2px larger than its heightnow this thumbnail only gets resized if the picture is bigger than width 168 px and height 112pxyour wrapper has a height of 100 of the body which also has a height of 100 but it also has a top margin making the total outer height greater than the height of the windowso whenever width is less than height this shall be a portrai eventually will load your css file even if the original screen was initialized at landscapethe problem is that if i am setting as per the ratio my super view height and width then the iphone height is greater than widthi thought i d use another image source for my slider when the height of the window is greater than its widthif any of the width or height is less than l user is prompted to upload another onetherefore when i get my browser bigger width gets bigger as well as heightit also adds indents to the image in case the scaled down image has more width than height or vice versai assume you mean that you want the image to maintain itâ s natural width height but stay centered within itâ s container if the window width is less than the image widthhow can i use jquery to change the height of the element when the page width is less than 960pxone that maintains the aspect ratio one that makes sure the width is no larger than the maximum and one that makes sure the height is no larger than the maximumyou could put your box in another one smaller with height and width defined have the overflow hidden and with a relative position you hide the shadow you don t wanti figure it has something to do with an image which has a width smaller than its heightheight is usually larger than widthi ve tried setting this up in the report properties but as per my observation the moment the height becomes lower than the width ssrs will automatically convert it to landscapeuiviewcontentmodecenter keeps the proportions of the imageview so when you display it can show a padding because the image has more height than width or viceversai tried making them smaller with the width heightcreate a new class for the last image i called it landscape2 in my jsfiddle as the last image is the only one with width value higher than the height valuealso be aware that if the height of the printable area that is page height minus top and bottom margin is less than the height of your cell content then it s impossible for the browser to avoid breaking it unless it can somehow warp the fabric of space maybe firefox has a -moz- property for thatif the height is greater than the width just reverse the width and height variableshow would i write a media query for when the device height is larger than device width or vice-versaif the height is less than your width it means the user was holding the phone horizontally so you have to rotate itthe key to it all is that box-sizing border-box is less susceptible to browser differences in padding and border calculations on form inputsalternately you could make use of background-size contain it would preserve the aspect ratio but it will leave white space on the left and right if the width is larger or on the top and bottom if the height is largerheight is greater than widthso the scroll get the scroll width and height of the div 2 and as the div 2 height and width is greater than div 1 padding to right and bottom is not visiblethe width and height of viewgroup is by default 2286 height and 1600 width which is larger than device sizeif the orginal file s width is greater than 480 or lessthan 450 then i want to set the width of output image as 450px.and the height has to be proportional of the widthif the background image s width is bigger than it s height it s width must be 100i have a wpf button.the contentcontrol inside this button contains other ui elements like textblock images etc.when i increase the font size of the textblock or the image etc or i change the text inside textblock then some portion of the text and image can sometimes be seen overflowing outside the button s ie parent control height and width if the text fontsize or image size is more than the height and width of this button.i want to hide these overflowing portions of the text and image controls ie which only the portions of the textblock and image which lie outside the button contentcontrol s height and width boundary.how can i do thisif the circle s width height is larger than 1 2 of the textview height circle width height 200dp textview height 100dp then the circle gets correctly scaled but somehow there are some weird empty margins on the left right side of the circlethe window has fixed width 300 and variable height so the scroll appears when window height is less than content height of coursegetting the width and height takes more work than it s worth especially trying to do it across all devices and a responsive framework gives you so many more optionswhen working with a landscape photo the photo width is greater than the photo heightif it s a picture that s wider than its height everything works exactly like i d like it to but if it has a large height than its width it changes the size before rotating it which leaves the image much smaller than what i m looking formy document s width is greater than the browser s height so i can t center it vertically in relation to the documentwith this implementation your layout will be square assuming the lower size between width and heightnow you should have square cell - as you see those dimension are not pixels and height must be bigger than widthi suppose it is because you hide them faster than you show them so for a slight second the overal page height is shorter than it shouldobviously you need to make sure the height width is not shorter then the div_wrapper otherwise the background will showyet when i save the image the image his in landscape width is bigger than heightheight and width are both ints so if width is more than height so you are setting your view height to 0update 1 upon further testing this problem occurs only when the desktop resolution height is less than 942 pixels width is irrelevanti tried to make the circle smaller with width and height but it didn t workin internet explorer the tabspace has a width of approximately 10 spaces while in firefox and google-chrome it is more like 4 spacesit itself should have a limited width and height that is smaller than it s containerwhat should i modify to make the background image s width 100 when it s width is larger than the height and vice versaif your height and width is bigger say 800x600 that quad would be so small it wouldn t even appearwhy is the parent smaller than the children on narrow screensso i have an image placeholder and i want to load the first image from the html within a div element that is larger than 70px width or heightif the height of your page is less than 1024px and the width is greater than 768px the native zoom functionality does not work as expecteddisplayed but also has a height and width that is greater than 0there are 9 buttons at present and i want to add some more buttons with same height and width and margins which can be shown below these 9 buttons by scroll view.i will be thankful if you people can help me in fixing these problemhowever videos with height greater than the width the video container stretches vertically and goes off screen and the video looks choppy and zoomedfor example if you have a text size of 15px well firefox makes a larger 15px than google-chrome doesa chartobject that is not activated at the moment of its export seems to produce a file where width and height is 1 higher than it should beif the height is bigger than the width it is portraitif the height is greater than the width then scale the image to 200px widthyou re negative margin is more than half the viewport width of an iphone therefore it is dragging it out of viewpng compresses much better than gif and allows more colors at the same timevh for portrait orientation since in portrait the viewport height is higher than its widthfollowing that if the width is greater than 1000 simply scale both height and width which may already have been scaled due to the height by 1000 widthas long as the square height width are bigger than the text and the container height is bigger than the square height you should be goodin ie and google-chrome the table ends up under my image while in firefox it takes more that 100 an horizontal scroll bar is displayedthe only catch is that this logic of 1.33 times the header region height seems to work only if the header margin b footer margin is less than or equal to one-third the paper-heightthe width of the picture is greater than the heightmy issue is when the window width is less than 767 i.e mobile device i need the offset variable to be 54px as i have made my fixed header 54px heightand at worst impossible at all ram size is usually much less than disk sizeissue is that user may link to an image that is of extremely large height and width which is more than the height and width of the div it is in causing some overflow layout issuesspecifically if an image s width is greater than 250px resize it so the height is 250px and the width autowhen i specify text-align center for an element with a width that is less than the width of the text the text is aligned to the left edge of the content box and overflows the right edge of the content boxwhile using carrier wave with rails is it possible to take an image such as a bookcover which has a greater height than width and resize_to_fill it such that i will end up with a square image where the book cover is centered and the remaining space on the left and right is either whitespace or transparentit displays full table with full width but without scrolling and the height is bigger than i needaside of the left floated div i have another div article with a margin a little bigger than the width of the floating div just usual for a two column layouti also need the container to be as big as possible without it getting larger than max width in x direction and max height in y directionbut i d like the box to always fill the parent s width or height whichever is smallerif the height of the image is greater than the width of the image clicked then this means that you have taken the image in portrait modei want to use an image which is smaller than width of the screen but has height bigger than the screenjudging by these i would assume that in landscape orientation the window height will be less than window widthgive the sample text div a right margin greater than the width of the right-floated elementi don t think you can do what you want with pure css as you will need to make a calculation to see if the images height is less than the widthanother option is not to float the main content column but instead assuming it s the right column to give it a large left margin that is slightly wider than the width of the left columni assume margintop can t be solved since im setting margin top to -820 in order to get at a point of top 275 therefore screens smaller than 1200px height the div will go much higher...you can see the page s width is wider than the height but when the app runs on a desktop or a simulator device like 7 pad the extra space is pushed into the top and the bottomif the window width is above 1280 i would like the value for the height to be 515 and if it is below 1280 i would like the height to be 615 and if the width is less than 480 make the height 715but if i switching to my 24 monitor there is no longer this problem since the screens is wider and therefore the table rows are wider toothe value of margin top will be equal or greater than height of the fixed header heightif i display the app on an android phone and the screen in held vertically width is narrower than height then the rendering the page does not occupy full width stuck at 95 or sosuppose my collection view size is 320 width x 300 height then if content size height of collection view less than the height than the pull to refresh view is not workingof course you re getting a conflict when setting two height constraints of which one computes to 1 3 of the screen width â ˆ 107px excluding padding on the iphone 4 and the other enforces a minimum height that is bigger than this value 120pxi d like it so that the image fills the width or height whichever is smaller firstbut you only want it to be negative when x is greater than the width or y is greater than the heighthow can i achieve that my container will adjust the height accordingly of the children items when the height of the children elements is larger then configured minheight of their parent elementhere you are asking your browser to change the height of your element if the width is bigger than 1000 and 1300the javascript comes in only when width is more than the height and then what it does it sets the width of the child to be the height of the elementif top position relative to parent + height is higher than the parents height or left position + width is higher than the parents width assume the element is not visiblesometimes width greater than height and sometimes width lesser than heightso the height must be 1.24 times larger than the widthchange the size of the brush so the viewport has more height than width and change the geometry accordingly so the lines still appear 1px thickwhen the screens resizes the longer elements in my navbar switching to two lines to take up less spacei want to make an 100x100 pixels thumbnail of it and in this case because the height is less than the width the height should be 100 visible on the new image and the width should keep the aspect ratio of the imagechoose the correct type of image extension sometimes gif or png delivers better results then jpg sif image is bigger than screen width android adjustviewbounds true works correctly and adjust height to keep aspect ratio of imagebut what i d to do is to prevent user from making the frame size larger than specific width and heightthis assumes that height is greater than the width and vice versaif the width is greater than the heightmy fixed document xps has its page orientation set to landscape the page media size has a width that is longer that its height and it displays correctly in the viewer as landscapeinside the container i have a panel with the text set to left but when the screens gets smaller then a tablet to something like a phone i want the text in the panel to centerthis will see if the height or width is less than 50 points and if it is it ll set the size to 50x50 set it to a random color and set the center to the random pointi do know that changing the width and height used in the ortho calculation appears to move the objects nearer and further - smaller width and height moves them closer to the screenso that means the width is longer than the height or that it is still in landscapeimages in these different folders should have different physical pixel sizes mdpi has smaller images than hdpi but the images pixel densities aren t usedthis only happens when the window is on a computer in full screens mode but when the screens is made smaller to a phone tablet size the divs function how they shouldi have a header with 60px height when document width is greater than 760pxthis is well within disk space but far larger than ramif the width is still smaller than the height adjust it manually and you should be able to fix your issuei ve used resize_to_fit to reduce images to a specific pixel size depending on the longer side but i m wondering if it s possible to do it with this logic instead for any image whose width x height product is greater than a set value resize the image so that the new width and height values are as large as possible while still being under that valueso the problem i have now that the parent div height is larger than his children s heightif the image s height or width is bigger than its container then the image should not overflow its boundssame for width being greater than heightwhen the children s line-height is smaller than parent s it looks like the children s line-height is ignored because parent s line-height will hold up the line box when the children s line-height is smallerthis maintains the aspect ratio of the image but sets its size so it covers the div either fitting to the width or height whichever is proportionally lesssafari makes child block s height larger than google-chromenormally the html tag squeezes the image if the width or height attribute is smaller than the image itselfin fact the gap doesn t appear at all when width is greater than height only when height is greater than widthhow can i plot a dotchart like lattice s dotchart in ggplot2 that has thicker grid lines and only horizontal grid lines ie remove the vertical grid lines kind of like thisi have been working on this page that works fine in desktop devices and tablet but not on phones because the width of the page is more than the screens width i need to make this width responsive to have the page with height-only scrollwe want to wait for an element to be visible visibility means that the element is not only displayed but also has a height and width that is greater than 0the first two commented lines for setting width and height of dialog works but second two uncommented lines does not work displayed height is slightly smaller than it should be and content overflows vertically width is okobviously i want in portrait view the content area of this iframe to be smaller than in landscapebut the only thing i get is that the activity is still in landscape but the rectangle now is smaller with the portrait dimensions and the camera becomes weird because the image is rotated 90 degrees and moves down when i move the phone left and up when moving the phone rightjust check if the height is bigger then the width thus portaitit is quite interesting since you are in portrait view but when keyobard is shown width of the available screen is higher than height and that change orientation to landscapealso per the api docs size is more efficient than height and widthso in the case if i upload 2 images i want to check if the images are portrait height is greater the width or landscape and need to show the images accordinglynow program will check if width divided by height is larger than oneheight 100 can be temperamental because 100 of the height of the document can be less than the height of the window depending on the content css structure unlike width where 100 will translate to boththe current solution works for shapes with equal sides but my divs are not like that their width are bigger than their heighti have a select2 input box for multiselet option in which user can select as many options as he wants if the selected options are occupying more space than available width then i wanted to increase the height of the select box automatically don t want scroll option all options should be in viewable space and get the remaining options in next linei ve discovered that using the height width constraint instead of frame width height is more reliablehow do i scale it down when height width is getting lower or higherso if you want to draw a trapezoid the adjustment must be calculated like this subtract the top of the trapezoid to the base divide by 2 the result and divide the new result by the height of the trapezoid if the height is less than its width or by its width in the other casethe best i could come up with would be to scale the line to fit inside paper based on the width of the path assuming that the width is more than the heightif a glsurfaceview s width is or height is larger than the device screen it will behave like belowit is however still possible that either the width or height is greater than the maximum setbasically it should check weather container length or height is smaller compared to image width and height normalized and adapt it to thati bet start has negative x or y when error happens or the size.hight + y or size.width + x is bigger than height or width of the imagewhen you press print in calendar print preview the print dialog that pop-up has more options cross browsersfor once particular thumbnail i d like the width to be greater than the height because i want to go for this new layoutso this script will take a jpg gif of png image resize it to 110px width if width is greater of 110px height if height is greaterbut with the videos i m using the width is always greater than the height and players know whether to rotate the video or not based on the rotation exif valuei want this to show images whose height is greater than the widthby default browsers add a margin to the body causing the body to actually take up more than 100 height 100 plus whatever the margin isif your viewport s resolution was 1000x500 1000px width 500px height 20vmin would be equal to 20 of the height as the height is the smaller lengthgiven a scenario where you don t know the height and width of image elements in advance let s say that in cases where image height is greater than image width you d like to vertically center the image by cropping the same amount of pixels form its top and bottom such that the new image height matches the image widthif the video height was larger than its width the math is the samealso if the width is smaller it will start flashing a higher heightif width is larger than height you get undefined behaviour probably writing into random memory under which anything can happenthen give it a width that s less than the width of your li and add margin auto to center itand the size of the draggable div s should be smaller than the droppable div so that they fit in the droppable containerwhen the medium width becomes larger than its height then it would be the default landscape sizein your xml the tag specifies height bigger than width hence the ovalfirst of all if you anyhow provide a hdpi graphic adding an mdpi and ldpi graphic which both are less than the hdpi graphic in size there is approximately 3 4 6 scaling ratio will increase the size but far from triple it more close to doubleagain a uiscrollview will not scroll in height width unless the contentsize property s height width is larger than its frame property height widthi have a uiimage with its width much greater than its heightif the height or the width is larger than the contentsize it will scrollanother option might be to scale to maximum width and then check if the scaled height is greater then the maximum allowed height and if so scale by height or vice versathe problem is that the image has static width and height and then if i access the blog on a mobile device the image is cut because it s bigger than the width of the deviceswitch the values of the width and height so that the width is longer than the heightwe can assume that max 30 or more upto 100 can be the zooming effect if aspect image height or width is less than the desired height or widthif the player is moving towards one of the edges of the screen and bounds.x y + 30 is less than the height of the current map width it moves the origin so that the player is still centered and displayed on the mapor does it only load the portrait.css file on page load and if the viewport width is already less than its heightthe width should be larger than the heightif the images height side is larger than the width resize the image so that the width matches the divs width and hide the height overflow after vertically centeringlandscape and even though the width is given as longer than the heightthe pixel height is larger than the pixel widthwhen i set my html5 video width and height to 100 the video height is bigger than the browser visible area and a vertical scrollbar appearsthe layout s height is less than the height of everything else and the width of the layout is the same as everything else but when i use layout.getheight and layout.getwidth in my onresume they always return 0 so i can t really use thatyou can tell the difference by seeing if the screen height is greater than the screen widthfirst if a notification image is displayed from my firebase database and the height is larger than the width and also the height exceeds the maximum image height for the notification iâ m not sure specifically what this is the image is compressed vertically and the aspect ratio is incorrectalso if you keep a fixed aspect ratio you are going to have very funny spacing if the browser height is taller than the widthi can only find adaptivetriggers which take a static minwindowwidth or minwindowheight .but what i need is no matter how big or small the screen is if the height is bigger than the width go with the first design and if the width is bigger go with the second designmeaning if s width is longer src_x has to be 0 and if height is longer src_y has to be 0we now have a clock that can scale properly but only if the viewport width is greater than the height not the other way around480px seemed to be a good as no few devices had more than 480px width or less than 480px heightbecause a tablet s screens is much larger than that of ait is a much better way than fixed width and margin autoapparently the draggable li element is bigger than the droppable div because the li is block size and the div has a 150px widthmeaning that if #fluid-container has a large height than width the diameter of the circle will be the width of #fluid-container but if it is the other way around width greater than height than #max-circle will have a diameter equivalent to #fluid-container s heightthere is an image restriction that is not documented or at least i couldn t found anything the aspect ratio limit is 1 3 when the height is bigger than the width on the imagestill not managed yet to detect orientation correctly because now for some reason when portrait - width is still higher than height with is 960 at least that what javascript see but in reality it is not going over boundaries which are 768pxhowever when i run my application the buttons appear to be bigger than the size of the images i m displaying on them- the images are 30x30 but the buttons are rectangular rather than square with their height being greater than their widthwhenever i resize an image to a desired size there whe width is greater than the height the proportions get screwedi have a div with auto height and 100 width .now inside this div i have to display one more div with remaining width available in the parent div and 100 height div should be displayed in full page after the button of the parent div got ended .also i want to show the second div with border so that any one can know the expansion of the div by seeing ithowever the imageview has a smaller width than the textviewthe issue i m having is that when the height of the page is smaller than the pop-up it opens a dialog instead of a pop-upi try to resize a image and save it when the image is bigger than 420 width and height the image should shrinking but show up in blackimages lower than 160 height or width will not be allowed however i m stuck on my tracks to get the width and heighti subscribed to the main canvas sizechanged event and applied a scale transform so that the canvas and its children would shrink and grow in a zoom like fashion when the control is resized which is working but for some reason the parent canvas is shrinking at a much higher rate than the children making the children fall off of the canvas at a certain point because of the scale rateassuming width is bigger in size then height scale the image width to the holder widthit works as as desired for landscape image width greater than height however for portrait it automatically rotates image and interchange width and height without any flag to get if any rotation has been donei am using an image in a full screen div max height 500px but when applying the full width to the image the image height is much higher +1000px so is there a solution to let this image fit perfectly in the 100 width div with a max height of 500pxin this example the absolute difference in width is larger but the percentage difference in height is higherit must also have a width that is smaller than its containing block for the auto value to make sense - because #container is spanning the width of its parent the there is simply no margin to distributeyou may even make its height longer than its width to let the labels spread outthe images have a longer height than width - an aspect ratio similar to a phone on portraitworking with image sizes i need a regular expression which returns sizes of images which their height is greater than their widththe yellow box my basic goal was to make the heart a bit smaller than the width of the yellow box center it horizontally within and give the heart some top marginbut determining a concave hull is far more difficult than a convex hullthis is the same as before if height is greater than width and swaps the calculation logic for the two directions otherwisei don t know why but you can t use seticon function with icon bigger than 190px width and heightit seems like image in width is larger then the image in height where as it is not in realityin retrospect what you re trying to do will not get you to make the imageview circular because the default imageview is rectangular the height is always more than the width and so.edit also if the element dimensions is larger than the width and height specified in the svg file the image will get pixelatedthat is the height is more than half the width and depth -- little rule of thumbyou ll need to set the top margin for whatever item you want under it to be greater than the height of your navbar in order for it to show up correctlyif they are equal or the width is bigger i set those to 100 each and set height as auto whereas if the height is the greater value i set that to 100 and width to autowhen resizing the panel the bar will scale width accordingly and a vertical scroller will appear if needed if the height of all the bars is larger than the height of the container the paneli m then attempting to use jquery to run a check on whether or not the images height is bigger than it s width visa versa or they are equalwhen height is more than all the above mentioned height and widththe error says u are selecting an image that has width x height that is less than 50x50every time you mouseover the image the caption keeps going higher and every time you mouseout it goes lower and lowerthis is because that tablet often has a lower density of screens pixelswhen i resize a borderless form to a small width and height it won t get smaller than width 132 height 38i want boardpanel to always be a square with size equal to the minimum of gamepanel s width and height if gamepanel s width is greater than height there should be empty space on the left and right if it s smaller there should be empty space on top and bottomthe idea is to create a square thumbnail defined by whether the height or width is greaterwhen using an image.preserveaspectfit or an image.preserveaspectcrop paintedwidth or paintedheight can be smaller or larger than width and height of the image itemthe smaller squares are also adding 2px to the height and width which means anything more than a 1x1 grid won t fit in the containerand i want to show the video in the landscape mode if the height is greater then the width of the phone otherwise to show the video in the portrait modeif you re using a sprite and specifying the height and width unless the width is larger than the spritemy idea here is that you always resize to whatever dimension height width is bigger then to crop the excess amount in the smaller dimension you have you pull the positioning to the appropriate negative valuewhat i want to do is place two controls at the same position spot to be specific a button that contains a progressbar inside of it and a button that contains a icon once the progress bar is full i want to switch it to the button which has the icon like a checkbox toggle button it has more than one state when i change it it changes the controlsin case height is more than width then you have to resize with heightif the devices width is smaller than its height the card should also rotate 90degeverything seems good until i previewed the website on an ipad iphone portrait mode where the screen height is much taller than its widthi haven t worked with any more than jpg png and gif so there might be some more image types out there that can fit into this function bmpi would like to have horizontal and vertical scrollbars if my content bigger than cell width and heightadd a new column until width is greater than heightbut if the screen width is less than 200 then it will be from left view edge margin to right view edge margin.i would recommend to check which of width or height is bigger in order to know if you are in portrait or in landscape and adapt your math to this parameterregardless setting height greater than width is needed to get the layout right between browsersthe problem is that layer.bounds still returns 200x200 for the layer but because of the perspective transformation the actual visible width is less and the height more than 200when the browser window is smaller than the min-width the child elements are the correct width but the parent keeps getting smaller causing the children to overflowthis issue has been solved it happened because the glreadpixels reads the buffer which is connected with the surfaceview that the preview is displayed on and the size of this surfaceview is bigger than the width and height params i setted in glreadpixels so it just displayed part of the preview begins from the left bottom corner of the previewthe view s width reduces itself in my linearlayout and the view s height gets bigger145 and 154 and it has non sense because the max and last scale factor applyed is 4 so as i can see in the screen the width and the height is munch higher than 150 or similar valuesif the width is larger than the height then width and height are swapped and the angle is correctedsometimes the chart is instantly visible but when i rotate the screen between landscape portrait it keeps getting bigger every rotationwidth - set it a width make sure it has a priority more than others but less than heighti need to make the div#two s height increases to match that of div#one even as width of page changes if the width of page becomes small enough that div#one s height becomes smaller than div#two height then the height of div#two should be limited to the content itselfit seems like you re trying to make the width of the video wider than the heightin this case when height is bigger i want to resize my image by proper height ratio to match width 50first do one thing get the width of the document using java script and your sub div set min width of generating div on hover of sub menu if it is greater than minimum height than animate your sub menu sub div to wherever you want or you can also give style using java script css propertybut it sort s the pictures just for their width not if the picture have a bigger width than the heightfor a cross-browser experience its either scroll width height or offset width height whichever is greaterthe reason why your website is x-scrollable on all devices is that you forgot to add to and the row inside it has 100 +15px left margin +15px right margin which is bigger than window widththis will have a diameter that is equal to either the rectangle s height or the rectangle s width whichever is smalleronce again my question is why is my program crashing if the width is larger than the height when the computer playson resize check if screens aspect ratio is greater than 1.0 width height if so display your page if not hide you page and show a message asking the user to rotate their devicefor any frame with width values larger than the height a 1 ratio the leg will begin to stretch unproportionallyif the width is larger than the height itâ s in landscape mode.as i understand it you need footer to be on the left side of the sidebar when content height is smaller and full width bellow sidebar when content is higheri noticed that the horizontaladvance of the chars f w y a is smaller than their normal width and the verticaladvance of the char is smaller than its heightone way you can do it is to check if the position of the mouse is within the div boundaries if the x position is smaller than the div s width minus the width of the image as you don t want the image to cross the div s border and if the y position is smaller than the height of the div minus the height of the imageit is happening when width is greater than heightthe moment i resize the height to less than the width say 479px the rule in the media query ceases to hold and the layout reverts back to the originaleven though you ve given your header a fixed height of 10vh if one resizes the browser whereby the header s width gets smaller eventually a height 10vh might not be tall enough to contain all of header s content thus it overflowsyour main div has height 1200px and the content are larger than this width so border is not displaying on the content which are overflowing you can check by increase height it will showedon a tablet or phone which may have less than 750px screens width it will go off the viewportyou need to place .about_me outside .about_me_pic and maybe set a smaller width height if the total width is larger then the line the second element will go in the next linethis works fine when the img dimensions are smaller than the width and heightso it s even more odd that the width is greater than the height when it should be the other way aroundi have an image that has it s width greater than the height and it is still outputting using the second if statement in the jquerylet s say we have a container div of unknown width and height which is smaller than the full dimensions of the bodyi have two divs curtain_left and curtain_right that need to be 100 of the height of the browser no less than 20 width and no more than 40 widthbut if you want to show scroll bars only when the height width is more than specified then use overflow auto as -i don t understand why the height of span element more than its font-size margin and padding 0 jsfiddle examplethen if the preferred width height is less than the actual width height you could manually invoke pack on the frameon a 5 screen roughly the width is 400px more or less and the height is 600px or moreyou have to take into consideration that borders take up width and that the margin of 1 of either side of the large container means that it can only be less than 100 widththen the circle gets vertically centred because the height is greater than the widthfor example if the image width is much larger than the image height than on smartphone the image will use 100 of the width of the screen and in proportion to that will be the height of the imageeven if the image s width or height is larger the containre s the image must not go out of the ul s borderor continuously check the stage width height in onenterframe update and if height is bigger than width portrait else landscapeas the width of the draggable element is greater than the placeholder i can t get the placeholder to accept the draggable element to be droppablewhen x is equal to width and y is less than height you will be writing to the array 0 y+1 cellthe scrollbar should appear at the side when the width or height is less then the limit just like a scrollbox and can be scroll alsoif the height is more than the width then it is portraitso what i need to do is to check if the exif wants to rotate 90 or 270 degrees and if so only perform the rotation if the height is less than the width which would mean the portrait picture isn t already rotatedactually it s not even but rather since its width is greater than its heighthow can i show a webpage in center of webview match parent width and height if webpage s height is less than screen s heightthis seems to happen only when the page s height is less than its widthone thing to note is that gif supports a smaller palette than png - only up to 256 colorshow can i make the outer div height and width never be any smaller than the height and width of its contentsif the row height is more than that for a single row i would increase the column width until the row height matched that for a single row and then adjust the source columnâ s width to matchunfortunately using nsstring -stringwithfont forwidth linebreakmode doesn t work - which ever wrap mode you choose the text wraps with a width that is less than the current width and the height becomes 0 on any overflow linesif they do that could be adding more space beyond the width and height of #bob forcing scrollbars to appearbut then my cell s height is 100 and width is less than 100if the height of the video with width 100wh is bigger then the height 100vh i want the video to crop so it will be on fullscreen view on the max with and height youre browsertaking the second example the height will not be greater than the width until after you ve shrunk the window horizontally 25px 350 - 325 beyond the point where the image starts to shrinkthat is if particular height or width is smaller then it should be resizedit seems a good idea to set the width of the body a little less than page width - left + right marginbasically my layout has 1200px grid width but i figured that there will be a problem with 1024px screens resolution 20 of the population bla bla so i created media queries when the screens size is smaller than 1199px the grid to change its width to 960px and so on for tablet phones etc..its working fine for square images the problem is when width is greater than heighti have an rss feed that has a larger number of objects in it than the photo frame it s destined for can handlehow do i determine the picture size if it is a horizontal picture width is more than height width 300px and height 200 then insert into the databaseis there any way i could use regex or something to detect if the width is greater than 320 and if so have it replace the width and height by something that would fitso it would also be possible to have all three textblock columns starsized but that means width clipping does occur earlier and there is more marginwhich will paint all the text red when the window width is less than its height2 for each file check if the image width is greater than the image heightif the inner divs width or height is greater than the outer divs the overall layout structure will turn out wrong logically like in your caseif i want an inline list to be a certain height width is it better to use display inlinethe elements are sized relative to the entire viewport but the body width is less than this because of the default margin on bodyyou can infer the device orientation if the device width is greater than device height in viewwillappearon tablet the screens size is much bigger and there is enough space for most of the action items that s why your menu is placed on topthis would become more apparent if you had a shape with much longer width than its heightit suppose to load images from the hdpi folder because it s screens density is smaller than 320 dpiif height is larger than widthsee code below and fiddle - i ve added the case where the height is greater than the width too for completenesssometimes you ll find that jpeg at 100 quality ends up smaller than the gif or png version but most of the time line art is best stored in png formthe div 4 has the height of all other divs together and if the screen width is less than 600px i want to display them one below each other like thisyou can think of a window or stage as an independent viewport into the scene which can be sized larger or smaller than the min and max specifications of the scene rootif the largest width is greater than the largest height then aportrait mode can display more rows than in landscape modein this case if i want to have a fixed width while keeping ratio i just set height to a very large number so that the resizer will actually ignore it since the ratio of real height to desired height is far smaller than the ratio of real width and desired widthno distance can be greater than width 2 and height 2if your height is bigger and width is smaller than container width will be stretch to 100 and height will be trimmed from both sidethere may be a better way to do this but a quick and dirty method would be to inspect the display s width and height with display.getsize point point - if the width is greater than the height then normal mode is landscape otherwise portraityour exact code but in full screen you will see the 20px margin if your screen width is higher than 850pxthe 990 isn t hard-coded anywhere because the exact width that it slows down at is dependent on the height it s more of a total pixels thingmy image has the width bigger than the height so i want that the minumum zoom is the widthwhat i was looking to do was to assign a width property of 100 if the height of the images is greater than the width and the height if the width is greater than the heightfrom my experience every time the kindle fires up my landscape app with a width smaller than the height thus by definition not really giving me a landscape view i just ignore the surface and wait it quickly gives me a a real landscape flipping the height and width so that its a true landscape viewif either is larger than 1 it means the checkbox height or width is largerprovided that the #topnav s width is greater than the width of the or else you can t center it you need to set a width to the in order for an auto margin to workand if they aren t next to eachother that means your padding and margin is more than the 5 width of total width so reduce themi expect that in portrait orientation screen width is less then heightso you will need to set a height to your .container and set a max-height 100 to your image since your image has lager height than widtham i missing something here it suppose to load images from the hdpi folder because it s screens density is smaller than 320 dpii d like the height pixels back too while i m at it though the width is more importantmanaging the content via width is a better approach you don t really need to know the heightif your text won t be larger than the width of the box you could set the line-height equal to the height of the boxthe goal is to make the max-width wider as the original image width height gets smallerif the image is portrait height is greater than width the image will have a width of 100 within the div and be vertically centeredif you want a pure css option i believe an absolute positioned div inside the body with width and height of 100 overflow auto and right padding larger than the width of a scroll bar will replace the normal scrollbar without shifting the content to the left on long pagesit should look wheter the image width is higher than its height and the opposite and according to that set a height or width and the other value height width should be set proportionally so it won t get stretchedi set the settings on the template to scale any image that is larger than 500 width and height to be resize to around 500 width and heightsince the svg s width is much larger than its height every 1px change in the height of the svg is causing the width to change by about 10pxbasically i m comparing the images height to it s width and then if its height is greater than it s width i m adding a class to it s parent called horizontal that has the appropriate stylesbut if he move the mouse cursor away from the slider while he is still dragging the slider s thumb the drag speed is lowerthe question s if i am currently looking at a desktop lg and the print paper width is more like small sm can i get the height of the table as if it were smthis method checks the outermost sides of each rectangle and detects if the distance is less than the width or height of the combined twofor the looping make sure to go one less than the width and heightshapes width are a couple of pixels larger than their height and using that value in computations worksi found this how to detect the orientation of a pdf document in iphone sdk - but when i try to get the dimensions of the pdf the height is always bigger than the width no matter what orientation the pdf has.is there a way to allow the pop-up window to expand beyond the dialog but be bounded by the window and thus provide scrolling when the pop-up is larger than the window1vmin 1 of viewport height or width whichever is smallerjust draw the square maybe slightly smaller than the height and width of your character you re detecting the hit test on and you should be good to goif you can define the parent s width and height there s a simpler way to centralize the image without having to create a container for ittherefore if console window height or width is larger than buffer height or width argumentoutofrangeexception is thrown in .net there is no argumentoutofbounds exception typeis there a performance hit taking a large image and constrain it to a certain width height that s smaller than the original filemy problem is now after changing some stuff my game crashes when the computer plays its move if the width is too much greater than the heightthe solution posted by nathaniel actually fails if the image height is larger than the image widthbut then the java script adds some margin to top and bottom when the image height is smallerand everything goes well until the width and height is less than 1 original sizebut if the div s size width or height is bigger than 300px i can t see the entire element anymore has some parts transparent than others depending on the mouse location on the divdetermine if the width or height is longer and use the .scaledwidth or .scaledheight methods of the image class to resize it and preserve the aspect ratioscales the image proportionally when you make the browser window s width become smaller how do i get the same scaling effect to happen when the browser s height becomes smalleryou can use jquery .scroll but overflow css property set to scroll or auto when the element s explicit height or width is less than the height or width of its contentsthen in the javascript you just check to see if the height or width of title is greater than the height or width of mainwhen i check the following code in the chrome devtools device toolbar responsive and the window gets smaller than 1040px width the .wrapper suddenly get s an increasing right margin until 60pxif the height is greater than the width turn the display to nonesummed up right now i do all my calculations based on the image height first and then check if the screen width s is larger than 1.5 x my image widthsee picture above height 1280 width 720 when the actual splashscreen have a width bigger than the heightthis tablet has a bigger screens yet is still showing only 2 child views in the rowbut this technique has a disadvantage the default size of your image has to be bigger than the height width of the browser window or container it is inif browser width is more than 768px then set a 110px margincurrently i m using only the portrait orientation for all devices but the portrait orientation looks better on phones meanwhile landscape orientation looks better on tabletssince the app is used in tablet i want to use up 50 of the width for the popup and also customize the height since default height is lessall i have to do is check whether the width or height is proportionally larger then scale the text down by that same ratioif you want to force all the views to have the same ration on screens the only way is to give it a size dynamically after you calculated the ratio between the desired pixels and the screens density which is not really a solution what you need to understand is when working with various screens sizes each one suppose to behave differently a tablet screens is expected to be bigger and thus having more room for elements to show up on screens a phone screens is smaller and less elements should be showed on screens you need to adjust your view to support all of these screens and the proper way is to write a different layout for tablet and phones or even different layout by screens dpiparent s height is lower than its widthmy current algorithm simply reduces width and height of each letter s rectangle until the total width sum of all letters width is less than the width of the main rectanglein other words it should fill either the viewport width or height whichever is more constraining while maintaining the given aspect ratio2 if i upload a portrait picture height width and its height is more than 328px the picture gets cropped and centered50 width is more than enough for the images to fit even with the image marginand if their width or height is greater than their containers width or height then make them automatically shrink while keeping their proportionsi thought of using before and after pseudos to display top-to-bottom and bottom shadows on the containing element but these pseudos display within their parent element and positioning parent z-index higher than these children has no effect1 the timagelist s height or width property is less than 1 or the height property is greater than 32768 when the timagelist is initially created via the createsize constructor there are no such limitations imposed by the height and width property settersthis problem arise when image-height is greater than image-width so if your image s height is greater than width then you should resize the image by swapping image height and width with each other before applying cifilter..left position in fixed worked probably due to the fact that it s width is larger than it s heightthis will give the center square taking up the full width or height whichever is smallerthe button height is higher than it s width go to step 2if a user s screen had a resolution of 1000x800px 100vmin would be equal to 800px and 100vmax would be equal to 1000px as the height here is the smaller unit and the width is the larger unitby cropping i dont bother to missing some of the video 50px from the bottom or so fullscreen in width and height is more important to meone way of doing this is checking if left margin of the inner div is lesser than the width of sidebar and then only add class adjustwhen the width is greater than the height the orientation is landscapeassuming the width is greater than the heightfirst you determine if existing image has width or height which is greater dimensionsizes of elements in wpf are determined by more than just width and heightfor example when rotating from portrait to landscape the collection view bounds value still has its height greater than the widthkeep on lowering the font-size until the span s width is less than the fixed widthjpg or png should get you smaller than tiffthat is because some images have a larger width than the height ex 480 x 670if i have clearly understood your requirements then you wish to have gray margin left and right side of your main content when the width is more than 800pxthumbnail width height is smaller 400but what i obtained surprised me the width of the files in pixels changes depending on latitude but also the height is smaller than the original andfor images having width much smaller than height no margins observedto determine device is tablet or mobile i use criteria if device s screens diagonal is greater than 7 iches the device is tabletthat means fit width when the height is less than the ratio and fit height when the width is less than the ratioyou just should separate the x and y axis during distance comparison if the y distance is smaller than the width and the x distance is smaller than the height than there is a collisionhow can i call this method manually and pass the current size in which width is greater than the heighti want it to be in the original full size and if the height width is less then 1920 1080 it will center the videonote if you are sure that image is portrait if and only if your images height is higher than its width you could measure them to find its orientationwhere extends is an upper bound super is a lower boundalthough if you use values greater than the width and height you re going to have issuesfirst set height greater than widthmy ultimate question for this post is can i specify some form of expression in a media query in css that will simply compare the device-width and device-height and display one style when the width is greater than height and vice versanow this works on my desktop machine in firefox if i make the width smaller than the heightit seems like the draggable element including the margin is bigger than the droppable element and therefore the dropped status is set although the element does not seems to touch the upper droppable yetif i shrink the width then the image s width gets wider and if i shrink the height the image gets shorterthe second example is an image whose height is greater than its widthbut i don t need a perfect width even if the width is wider than the longest word it is ok as i will text-align center to enhance visibilitywhich means a big tablet screens gets the lower dimen values and images and everything looks extra smallwhen i made dimension of draggable div smaller than droppable div then drop event triggered successfullyi have acheived these things that image height should never get more than the div and its width should never be less than the width of divverify width is not more than 2x the height and height is not more than 2x the widthtried some option as width is less when we resize then list item move below and increase height of ul so using this method i am able to hide last visibleas you can see the font-size of the text is bit larger than the width of the noisy linesonce the page height is less than the margin i need to create another pageone page is a page of which the width is smaller than the height sounds like it s a page in portrait but as there s a rotate value of 90 added to the page dictionary it is shown in landscaperegarding the viewport resizing firefox goes 10 by 10 while google-chrome has a wider range 25 33 50 67 ... and other browsers may have other valuesi want set page orientation to portrait with width size is higher than height sizealso you cannot rely on fixed 300px margin i.e if window height is less than 500px you re already missing 100pxi wouldn t scale the image every single time in the paintcomponent method but do it once if the width and height have been changed since the last call and in that case recreate a bufferedimage containing the image which you blit every single time before calling the superclass paintcomponent scaled up to the right size use something like image scaling does not work when original image height width is smaller the scaling height widthwhen the window width is smaller than its height then the orientation would be considered portraitwhen the picture is portrait height is greater than width the output is automatically rotated how can i prevent this behaviorchoose an image which is smaller than the width and height of the divyou cant see 45 barcodes because their margin is bigger than page heightthe following works perfectly with my phone in portrait the width fits but when i flip to landscape the width still fits perfectly but the images are longer than the height
