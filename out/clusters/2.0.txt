quicksort or introsort or any comparison-based sorting algorithm is more common than radix-sortpublic class mealhistoryactivity extends activity implements connectioncallbacks onconnectionfailedlistener locationlistener ..qhash provides faster lookups than qmapdon t use nsdateformatter use nscalendar which is much more accuratei recomend to use dtmilano tool androidviewclient that is easier to use than monkeyrunnerone item to note be aware the default z-index for jqmodal is below default for blockui so using them together requires you set blockui basez option higher than jqmodal s default 3000.nwjs node-webkit is a better solution if you want your apptherefore vectorized substr by david arenburg is the best answer while sapply grepl by sixiang.hu and significantly better than grepl by david arenburgif browser width is less than 1670px and height of div.banner is less than 1253px then let div.title and div.social s parent be div.banner else let the parent of div.title and div.social be the body or browser windowi have tried connecting the qscrollbars but the maximum of the qplaintextedit is smaller than the qtextedit sconsider rdiscount which substitutes for bluecloth but is faster and better maintainedadd one more uinavigationcontroller between uitabbarcontroller and uiviewcontrollera bufferedoutputstream is more appropriate that a

selected and deselectedi find training in opennlp much easier than in stanford-nlpnowadays datejs is outdated and not maintained so use momentjs which is much better as pointed out by t.jlast question is nerdtree really much better than netrwbut bfg-repo-cleaner is a much faster solution than git-filter-branchusing drawimage canvas is much faster than using putimagedatais implements the rawcomparator that much faster than extends writablecomparatorin general parfor with matlabpool is an easier combination to use than dfevalthere s also jsdom but cheerio is simpler and comes with jquery-like goodnessqnetworkaccessmanager is higher level than qhttp and qtcpsocket so they have abstracted away the sockets connection statethe predict function for a glmnet is more than likely just predict.glmnetyou should try momentjs i think its much better than datejsdbcontext is a much more pleasant api than objectcontextusing completionhandler -based methods of nsurlsession is much easierâ sortedlist uses less memory than sorteddictionaryhere is one more idea with dplyr and tidyrsortedlist uses less memory than sorteddictionarya i tried gdi-compatible direct2d using id2d1dcrendertarget+binddc but it is much slower than pure gdiusing iequalitycomparer which is better because works without altering initial idictionary signaturea ng-app can have more than 1 ng-controllerthe hits arrays is longer than numtotalhits so your for-loop limit should be numtotalhits instead of hits.lengthcurrently tensorflow supports the older cudnn v.5.1 while there is a newer

querypathuserwarning your cudnn version is more recent than the one theanoi am writing an app based on uitabbarcontroller which has more than 10 viewcontrollers with corresponding uinavigationcontrolleras namedtuple lighter than dictionaryinstead of using uilabel using uitextview gets better resultsthe framespace for the uiviewcontroller becomes smaller because uinavigationcontroller manipulates the view by adding a uinavigationbar which is 44.0f in sizeloading is far faster than with the sqlcommandbuilder and sqldataadapterthe eclemma plugin is nicer and more mature then ecoberturaif image height is larger than width then scaletypes fitstart fitend and fitcenter don t worki need to perform several device.touch events as fast as possible however androidviewclient seems to achieve those significantly slower than monkeyrunneri have seen that the drawimage function is really faster than the putimagedataas of right now drawimage is much faster than putimagedataqlabel has no any other unnecessary things so it is better than qlineedit or qprogressbarso i think afnetworking would a better choice than sdwebimagedist fonts gruntjs gruntfile.js

is less commonly used than oncreatesecondviewcontroller which is a subclass of firstviewcontroller also has a uilabel but has one more uibuttonusing the clipping version of drawimage will be faster than putimagedatayou need to create a fileoutputstream and decorates it with printstream or better filewriter with printwriteruitabbaritem is a subclass of uibaritem everything is more painful because uibaritem doesn t subclass uiviewi like to use bufferedwriter more than printwriter and its working with the bufferedwriteri hear oursql is nicer the mysql-pythonknuth-morris-pratt which is classic or boyer-moore which is sometimes fasterthe priority level of ng-controller is lower than that of ng-includestringr is newer based on stringi internally and is often even fasterusing jdialog instead of joptionpane is better to put number of datathe floyd-warshall algorithm has a worst case performance of o |v| 3 where as dijkstra s has a worse case performance of o |e| + |v|log |v|you might be better off with a profiler like visualvm or chrononthat s easier with phpquery or querypathsublimetext has better performance than atom-editorin this example if target_aspect_ratio is bigger than original_aspect_ratio height is targe_height and width is calculated by target_height original_aspect_ratiodrawimage seems to be much faster than putimagedatatry painting via a qimage -- the qpainter textantialiasing is more likely to be honoured that wayfasttext is not better than word2vec as for as semantic similarity is concernedbasically you are implementing a view container much simpler than uinavigationcontroller and uitabbarcontrollerbasically it seems like cmmotionmanager is much larger and slower than uiaccelerometer ison average faster than rxjs 4 kefir bacon.js as fast as rxjs 5 and slower than most.jsqtoolbutton is much more complex under the hood than qpushbuttoni m not sure httpmodule is still better then httphandlerjtextpane is more high level as jeditorpane strange namingfor

mvvmlight reactiveui is much better than prismyour listview item s height is looking bigger because your are applying 17dp padding and 4dp margin at the top and 7dp padding and 4dp margin at the bottom of the textview ...so its taking total 32dp extra space excluding your textviewdon t use getimagedata putimagedata for clipping since drawimage is easier and faster.some user-controls s are larger than the tabcontrol and got clipped so i modified its template by wrapping the contentpresenter in a scrollviewer with horizontalscrollbarvisibility and verticalscrollbarvisibility set to autothen you have to check that beta1 - beta2 alpha1 - alpha2 is greater than min x1_line1 x2_line1 and less than max x1_line1 x2_line1when i evaluated monomac it was less mature than
