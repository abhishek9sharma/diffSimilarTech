in bourne-derived shells newer than ksh bash zsh you can combine the assignment and exportsortedlist appears to use less memory and is technically a binary tree where sorteddictionary is faster with unsorted datafor non-animated gif images a conversion to png8 should be painless and beneficial as png compresses much betterin free and turbo pascal file handling is much more easier than in delphi in pascal we have assign instead of assignfile and close instead of closefilecan i configure more than one hadoop cluster via ui of ambarimaven is more of a meta-program that can use ant scripts and run your junit testsfor heavy due xml processing vtd-xml is the most efficient option available it is far more efficent than jdom dom4j or dom.rsa has much simpler math and can directly encrypt decrypt data you should never compare rsa and ecdsaunfortunately g++ packed the structs significantly looser than gcc which caused significant problems sharing objects between c and c++ codeif you want to add a plugin and its versioning is higher than the core mvvmcross versioning use nuget to upgrade all mvvmcross packages before adding the plugincolorbox is implemented as a jquery plugin which is a bit different and better than thickbox s sort-of-self-contained widget modeli had the same problem when my pyzmq s and zmq s versioning is older versioning i upgrade the versioning to

jboss and weblogic business-bean-classes should all have their own ejb-local-interfaceunfortunately as martijn pieters noted there are no accepted solution for python 3.x and only one for python 2.x and according to the amount of memory spent for solving it numerix could have used psyco the library on which pypy is based much faster than cpythoni have used this link to generate nine-patch images however even if i add the files to the drawable ldpi mdpi ldpi xhdpi and xxhdpi folders the image is still shorter than the screens widthjspm is more commonly used to bring in client-side front-end libraries and npm for server-side onesi m more familiar with tcp udp sockets and so this looks very similar to af_inet type of socket s ip_add_membership socket option.ilist is a more specialized interface that extend icollectionwith requestfactory you pay an up-front startup cost to accommodate more complicated systems than gwt rpc easily supportsin ie and firefox fullscreen_block appears

librariesmozilla has stated that they plan to deprecate add-on that depend on xul xpcom and xbl. while not all bootstrapped add-on depend on these technologies there is a tendency for for bootstrapped add-on to operate at a lower level than add-on sdk and webextension add-onfrom what i know a compiled-language such as c++ is much faster than an interpreted-language such as javascriptcanvasjs is more of creating charts using canvas element of html5 and d3.js uses svgsince the namenode is a single-point-of-failure in hdfs it requires a more reliable hardware setupeclipse ocl provides a much stronger ui and an ocl2java code generator so that ocl embedded in ecore uml provides much more acceptable executable codepowermockito is an extension of other mocking frameworks like mockito or easymock that comes with more powerful capabilitiesgcc supports built-in __int128_t and __uint128_t types on 64bit platforms but it looks like formatting support for 128bit integers is less common in libci do not know any good signal processing libraries in .net but emgucv opencv is wrapper around opencv which can do advanced signal processingnote that there s much more than llvm and clang these compilers also rely on c++ standard libraries both have libc++ libc++abi mostly unchanged pnacl used to support libstdc++ c standard libraries both have musl pnacl also has newlib bionic some form of

attachments api for java which runs at a lower level than jax-wsphpunit does also have bdd features but behat is much more targetted toward that stylewhile java could be described as a compiled and interpreted-language it s probably easier to think of java itself as a compiled-language and java bytecode as an interpreted-languageto upgrade your plone site from 4.3 to 5.0 you can check this link section upgrading plone 4.x to 5.0 the migration should be more simple than older versioning like 3.x or 2.xi also recommend wtforms it s much easier to use than formencode and have builtin sqlalchemy extensionsnow all that said...you might get more visual appeal with pygtk pyqt or wxpython though tkinter coming standard is a nice featurealso developing enterprise application is such new languages java c# vb.net rubby is easier that vb6 because they rely on frameworks every body can write c# java code that function but it requires tricks good practices and some of imagination to write vb6 strong and rehusable codethis is easier with lodash underscore.js or even with es5 array and object methods but since you asked about pure jsthere s a known bug that when you install the googleads library using pip it will install a newer version of the oauth2client library which will break my google analytics api scripts because the google-api-python-client uses an older version of oauth2clientis there a specialized commandline tool to resize the images in a more efficient way than imagemagick or graphicsmagickyou need to use tolist to convert it from ienumerable because the ilist interface supports more functionality than the ienumerable interfacevbscript is much more convenient than creating an activex on vb6 or c# vb.netfor the uber-jar applications i use maven-shade-plugin for merging jars into one + proguard for shrinking but appassembler is much quicker and stable to usefor beginners freeglut or glfw is more simple and portable than pure win32mbunit has compatible syntax with nunit but has more features especially data driven testsencrypt the passwords with one-way encryption algorithm with a random salt like the common opinionï¼š sha-256 is stronger than md5because lodash is updated more frequently than underscore.js a lodash underscore.js build is provided to ensure compatibility with the latest stable version of underscore.jsit logically follows that 64bit integer is faster than 32-bit and when it comes to 64bit cpu s using a 16-bit data as fast as possible int_fast16_t would have int_fast16_min defined to int64_min instead of the int32_min specified in stdint.hgraphicsmagick converted much faster than imagemagick although i did not test conversion with cuda processingwhen later i upgrade to versioning c of my software i have to test the upgrade paths from a- c as well as b- c versioning n+1 requires n+1 more test cases than versioning n didif you are interested in more verbose javascript utilities for arrays objects and more check out lodash or underscore.jsfrom tensorflow official github how to construct a new dataset for retraining use official python script build_image_data.py directly and bazel is a better ideagraphicsmagick provides more extensive api documentation than imagemagickeven when latex editors support knitr their support makes working with .rnw files much clunkier than pure latex .tex filesin linux the git-core debian package is much smaller and the process is much quickierunless you particularly need to build against a more standard libc than bionic you can just use the ndk s toolchain either by copying the hello-jni example and changing build_shared_library to build_executable in the jni android.mk or using the script to generate a stand alone toolchainqset and other qt containers are less versatile than stl or boost containershere is the skimage scipy version appears sharperatom-editor has better github support out of the box but sublimetext has a several git

in debug mode the getline version is slower about 130 âµs vs 60 âµs for the fgetc versionfor more complex xml reading writing you better check xerces which is heavier than tinyxmlin your case whats happening is that your galaxy tablet has a lower pixel density and android down-scales the image from a xxhdpi to whatever density the tablet has hdpi or xhdpi ....so it your image is a 512px image android would down-scale it to 341px for xhdpi or 256px for an hdpi deviceyou can do this with beautifulsoup s html parser though the lxml.html package is somewhat more straightforwardcurrently macports has many more packages 18.6 k than there are homebrew formulae 3.1k owing to its maturitypyquery uses the css selector syntax familiar from jquery which i find more intuitive than

to specify rubythe easymock support is complete but the mockito plugin needs some more workrazorpdf uses an older version of itextsharp which i believe was the latest free itextsharp versionso for one time initialization code like setcontentview or initializing variables the oncreate event is a better place...web api relies on system.net.http library for getting request headers and this library gives a null for httprequestmessage s content.headers.contenttype in this case and web api sees that content-length is greater than 0 but no content-type header and hence returns a 415 unsupported media typesince that appears to generate index-color gif files which are smaller than the png files that doxygen generatesthe point of using okhttp instead of the defaulthttpclient by apache is that okhttp is threadsafe for android and better supported by retrofitit is semantically influenced more by java sml haskell and a very obscure oo language called gbetaeither is capable of doing it but

that swift uses a more static method dispatch than objective-c which unless a class dervices from foundation nsobject prevents the style of swizzling based on remapping method implementations at runtimepowermockito might integrate a little easier with testng but i have never used it with junitindeed it would be relatively easy to preprocess a bison grammar file but it is easier with jison

later ffmpeg versions iircwhile openmpi supports more connection protocols there is an infiniband-enabled version of mpich called mvapichyou can create custom controller to serve that files and use send_file mentod in it with disposition inline also you may be interested to x_sendfile_header setting to serwe that files with apache nginx which is fastertcp sockets- guaranteed delivery bigger payload than udp cumbersome to setup for web based solutionsfor example try hiding a dom of of 200+ children in google-chrome vs safari vs firefox you will notice google-chrome takes 20+ sec safari
