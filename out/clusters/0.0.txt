it sounds like the table is a lot larger than ram so this means something like 5555 disk reads -- likely to be the slowest part
the queue can contain any number of items but for google-chrome safari it is not more than 20
they show up centered on mozilla firefox but in google-chrome it aligns more to the right hand side
i m new to sever-side programming.some people told me that web.py is more suitable for beginners like me than django
http is not the internet any more than ftp telnet or world of warcraft are the internet
in bourne-derived shells newer than ksh bash zsh you can combine the assignment and export
please always try to use post method for submitting data as it is more secure than get method
open up the fiddle in both firefox google-chrome to see what i m talking about - in firefox the positioning of the background image is much lower than in google-chrome safari
if your goal is to eliminate certificate fingerprint warnings during push pull there s a better way to do this
lodash is another faster implementation of underscore.js that will provide a lot of utility methods for working wit arrays objects functions etc
some people argue gcc g++ is more popular on linux while icc is more popular on windows
i found it fairly easy to generate addition subtraction and multiplication questions at random however division is more tricky
jquery might have better methods than fadeout fadein for this job
ram is much faster then disk io
in my original project there is more than one textbox for currency description textarea chekcbox etc
the more general issue of overshadowing a model field with a property setter getter is more difficult and prone to caveats ref
if you insist on having many nbs you should merge them through multiplication or addition of logarithms which is the same from mathematical perspective but multiplication is less stable in the numerical sense
second in order to add or update the value of listview in general extends arrayadapter is much easier than implements baseadapter because of arrayadapter support add remove insert method by itself
tcp is slower assures data arrival udp is faster data corruption may be possible
google-chrome is extremely slow for your code path but grep seems to be 50 faster than array.filter here making it 900 slower than the firefox run
if you want to follow the spec then put says that the body is a representation of the url you put to while post is more general purpose
but note that while stateful isn t used much these days it usually makes more sense to opt-in for stateless sessionscope is much more universal and fits into nearly any session-based scenario
i understand that kerberos has better performance than ntlm
i recommend to take a look on tastypie which turned out to work even nicer than piston it helps you also with things like versioning your api and mamange multiple endpoints nicly
i have seen other people asking the same question why get method is faster than post
too bad that find calls often end up verbose Ã¢ it s even worse with stl than with boost ranges
also one benefit of declarative programming is that purpose is usually more easily understood from reading the code whereas imperative gives you finer control over execution
the subtraction case is going to require a little more work than addition in this code
it is the equivalent of a goto but is more restrictive in that labels may be used only in break or continue statements
sortedlist appears to use less memory and is technically a binary tree where sorteddictionary is faster with unsorted data
i found jqplot easier to use with more options and better documentation than flot or graphael
hence memcpy and strncpy work almost the same here and memcpy is more efficient and less prone to error
richfaces is more developed and tested generally since primefaces came out later than rf
i m working on a wildfly swarm project using wildfly swarm version 2017.8.1 maven 3.5.0 openjdk 1.8.0_141 where users will often upload files way bigger than undertow s default 10485760 bytes 10mb max-post-size setting
so no big surprise zsh being better than bash
more sophisticated distinctions between iaas paas and saas are also described in quite a few topics here on stackoverflow for instance in what is saas paas and iaas
i m always having to tune the code for gcc g++ differences - usually the given version of g++ is just more limited in what it allows
the parent process always can keep track of its direct children easily as fork returns their id grand children gets more tricky ... and send a signal to any of its children on exiting gracefully
basically mongodb supports no more than 100 levels of nesting for bson documents
for non-animated gif images a conversion to png8 should be painless and beneficial as png compresses much better
but there are many citations of real world tests which show that heapsort is significantly slower than quicksort on average
we ve recently switched from trac to redmine where i work and i think i like it a little more than trac and use the wiki functionality almost everyday
server-side validation is more secure than the client-side as the user cannot see the code even he does a view-source
in my limited experience using objective-c code from swift is a more common use-case and fairly trivial
you can also use strtol which is obviously better than atoi
for suitably large examples of each dictionary overcomes the constant factor by which it s slower than std map and will actually do operations like lookup insertion etc
however i suspect i m having a larger issue with using objective-c interfaces with extensions in a swift project or my understanding of how that works
documentation provides more information than private protected public does and a good system will have documentation anyway
i have also found that a while-loop is faster than a for-loop
if you need to do something a set number of times a for-loop is generally more concise than a while loops
the main difference between avro and thrift is that thrift is statically typed while avro uses a more dynamic approach
if almost all elements fail the filtering then it s considerably slower than just sorting everything since you ll end up selecting thousands of times
mysql s version is apparently marginally faster than postgresql but lacks some of the more advanced spatial features therefore it s pretty much limited to finding records that match a certain range of coordinates
you can use the accessor annotation to specify a method to be used when serializing a properties which is a cleaner way of doing it
i need to add more than one textview and imageview in listitem and also i need to add header s at some random positions
isn t testng supposed to a better than junit
the text-align center is for old ie6 whereas margin works for newer browsers
velocity is simpler than freemarker
however if this is indeed the case - and the data does not fit ram and you cannot use map-reduce i suspect sorting and iterating - though will be o nlogn will be more efficient using external sort - because the number of disk accesses will be minimized and disk access is much slower then ram access
you could also use nvl but that is a legacy function and coalesce is quicker since it stops at the first non-null
fread ... is extremely fast 10 - 100 times faster than read.table ... or read.csv ... for large datasets
besides strtol is a better option than atoi as strtol can handle failures better
when the data is in memory - you can do anything much faster on it since disk io is extremely slower then ram so sorting it and reading it multiple times is expected to be much slower then manipulating the data on memory
android-query is better than picasso because while in offline mode no internet connectivity picasso tries to fetch record form server whereas android-query maintains its cache form where it fetched the images
tcp is much better than udp in terms of reliability
i haven t used it myself though as per this answer it s quite a bit more confusing than lisp scheme macros
is it because request response handling on wildfly is kind of more lightweight than the jboss 4.2.3
there is icefaces which provides more semantic support than richfaces .also you can try nitobi suite which also provides similar kinda solution.if you are not satisfied with any of these i suggest try to write your own part extending the sun faces
my experience say that apc is nearly 7-8 times faster than memcached
while vimeo is more of a professional site youtube offers html5 h.264 video playback support for all videos so they ll play on iphone
however the tables are huge and the union all i read its faster than distinct takes forever to execute even with just two tables let alone 6
it seems some operators do better with post s than get s - this is a feeling i get from what some nigerian users mention
it s just a little slower than using apache bench directly against nginx
firefox gsap performance is still much worse than in google-chrome but google-chrome gsap does still lag every few repeats or so while in google-chrome the css animations do not
my impression common lisp is more for getting stuff done scheme is more for education and fun
i prefer the beautifulsoup syntax as i find it more natural but i find that lxml is better when i m trying to parse unknown quantities on the fly based on variables-- generating xpath strings that include variable values which i will then use to extract specific elements from varying pages
in free and turbo pascal file handling is much more easier than in delphi in pascal we have assign instead of assignfile and close instead of closefile
i had created the website www.suezre.com and when viewed in google-chrome or firefox figcaption on the pictures looks good but on safari it takes much more space
this should be possible maybe be aware snap.svg isn t so compatible with older browsers in which case you could look at raphael which is snaps older brother d3.js is very well established as well
silex seems to have a bigger community than slim maybe it s just my point of view
for xml documents it may be that the elementtree offered by lxml is more productive
but certainly wrong syntax in the for-loop is there better way to code it so that after loops i can get
on the other hand you may want stable sorting in other contexts as well and so if you have the stable_sort function defined this approach would still be more straightforward than filtering out the numbers with each sign and recombining them
there is another lib folder in home username directory which contains older version of pythons also
the one used by google-chrome and is slower than mobile safari s nitro javascript engine
union all will perform better than union when you re not concerned about eliminating duplicate records because you re avoiding an expensive distinct sort operation
overriding equals and gethashcode gives it better meaning
if google-chrome seems to finish earlier than firefox then that is the freezing glitch in action
since spsite takes a longer url you may also be able to open the right spweb as well using site.openweb
what we can see is that regardless of raw hardware power google-chrome seems to run up to three times faster than edge and also significantly faster than firefox all updated to the latest verion
this may be safer as iqueryable inherits from ienumerable
also in my experience at least settimeout offers a much more aesthetic experience than setinterval or requestanimationframe
can i configure more than one hadoop cluster via ui of ambari
there might be some edge cases where gif is slightly better because the png format may have a slightly larger overhead from metadata but it s really not worth the worry
innodb supports better locking semantics so if there will be occasional or frequent writes or if you want better data integrity i d suggest starting there and then benchmarking myisam later if you can t hit your performance targets
first maven is a much younger tool than ant or make so you have to expect that its going to take time to get to the maturity level of those applications
if you don t need to serialize raw pointers to things and instead either use c++11 style smart pointers or no pointers at all i d recommend using cereal as it supports pretty much everything in the standard library whereas boost has a more limited subset
i ve heard that rar decompression requires much more memory than zip decompression
i m taking a quite educated guess here that firefox is more forgiving with the irregular syntax than google-chrome
you might try running say apache or nginx which is even simpler to set up
the bson storage format used by mongodb supports more native types than javascript including 32-bit and 64-bit integers
i was also looking at sdl allegro sfml i didnt see much tutorials help on this but heard its better than sdl
almost any new cpu has more than one core or if it has just one it might support hyperthreading and thus pretending it has more than one
scalamock looks more natural when developing applications in scala however from what i read it seems to support fewer test scenarios compared to mockito and it s also less mature
the tooling provided with the jdk jstat jconsole jvisualvm is much more reliable
while postgresql is less popular than mysql most of the serious web hosting supports it
myisam is almost 4 time faster than innodb which is not acceptable in the environment we are working as i mentioned earlier that every second is worth many dollers for us
it s possible for icalendar software to make this a lot shorter with rrule but these calculations are hard and not everybody implements it
in my opinion this is a more elegant solution than jsf and i think tapestry s ioc container makes it more powerful than wicket
the gles recording examples uses mediacodec rather than mediarecorder but the idea is the same and it should be much simpler with mediarecorder
maven is more of a meta-program that can use ant scripts and run your junit tests
download xcode free and learn objective-c or swift swift is easier to learn than objective-c
post request are safer than get but that does not mean are invulnerable
to be specific the quicksort runs faster than mergesort in the first test case and loses badly in the following 9 tests
basically what is happening is that when i expand one of the expander items and that itemscontrol contains a larger amount of items 25 the rendering of the list appears to be truncated
while you could use either tcp or udp i think you ll find udp gives better performance
- i usually find debugging memory in hex x command is easier than binary so i will not use my solution
long-term evidence is showing that pypy runs certain python codes slower than cpython and this drawback seems to be rooted very deeply in pypy
safari is more secure than ie or google-chrome
any execute statement becomes prepare sooner or later it need to be parsed optimized compiled and then execute
my hands-on experience is that i usually am better of with getter setter and constructors
i created a php file which deals with file deleting and uploading but i this file is one directory lower than the folder for files
in my experience hide and show is a better approach because it doesn t mess with the dom
is it good idea to make serializer private static readonly to avoid spawning hundreds of temporary objects is it more faster than i did
i switched a thread from extends thread to implements runnable implements runnable is better practice right
however rather than extends actionlistener as in your second example you ll probably find that putting the listener implementation into a different class even an inner class which implements actionlistener provides better logical logical separation of your code
to avoid misunderstandings my question is not whether web2py or django is better
i know sympy has its own plotting module but the one in mpmath seems easier to use so far with the exception of this one issue of course
lingpipe probably also has something built in but nltk is much easier to use
to achieve this you can consider instead of storing the state in an array to make use of .data to store the state show or hide is much easier to maintain and understand
this is java detecting what you are doing and thinking it may be a mistake on your part - int s are less specific than double s
edit again one completely different approach would be to use pypy s sandboxing mechanism which should be much more secure than cpython plus a sandboxing module
both use the activerecord pattern so you ll actually get your database tables back in objects without fancy domain logic but datamapper is way easier to work with and is thread-safe
eval is more dangerous than get post because the submitted content can run functions like include which can access any file apache has read privileges for or shell_exec which can do anything in the shell the apache user can do etc
but as well as infobright if you re going commercial then checkout vectorwise it s quicker and similar priced
although i should warn you for anything more complicated than addition and subtraction and shifts you ll need to use non-trivial algorithms
the above links to libc++ which is the preferred c++ standard library for mac os x with clang and a lot more complete than libstdc++ even when considering the newest gcc
i suspect the continued prevalence of cvs svn is much more to do with inertia than anything else
i have been working on a simple textctrl project to get more acquainted with wxpython and i have hit a small road block
udp is significantly faster than tcp and is why it is or was used for video and various things back in the day
for heavy due xml processing vtd-xml is the most efficient option available it is far more efficent than jdom dom4j or dom.
a hood technique is to tag milestone releases of your projects giving then a version number and then manage dependencies with maven or a similar tool a bit more sophisticated than ant
however if you want to use the sha256 hash alogorithm which is better than the md5 then here s a code sample
tcp is very much analogous to a phone call whereas udp is more like mailboxes
but it doesn t seem possible to roundtrip the geometry as there are less setter than getter the geometry cannot be re-constructed from an empty object just by calling setter
beside markdown and restructuredtext there exists also asciidoc which is more powerful than markdown there are f.ex
its was said that awt is faster than swing as it uses the platform component but due the arrival of faster processor etc ..
labeled break like in java would be better than goto for this purpose
i had a situation where i needed to do more than just show or hide the one element
just a wild guess here but if you re using cvsnt on the server this observation might be based on the fact that cvsnt simply is much better at merging than svn because it has the notion of mergepoints
if scala 2.10 s reification turns out to be more limited than kotlin and ceylon
innodb is affected by the primary key much more than myisam and it could make a noticeable difference
when using embed in - uiview the new view will be a bit bigger than the subviews
quicksort is a partitioning sorting algorithm you might refer to mergesort which also is a partitioning sorting algorithm the biggest difference is probably the speed quicksort is faster even though both of them are o n log n
if nfa- numstates is greater than arraysize free previous memory and realloc arrays of size nfa- numstates
this means that memmove might be very slightly slower than memcpy as it cannot make the same assumptions
on modern processors floating point multiplication is generally slightly more expensive than addition which is one reason why compilers will typically replace by x+x
i ended up using gulp-ruby-sass that while is a bit slower than gulp-sass is rich with features such as loadpath
then when you extract the keys of each object you can compare using _.isequal function by provided by lodash instead of underscore.js usually lodash has better performance
if the list is populated all at once from sorted data sortedlist is faster than sorteddictionary
i recommend gson as this has small memory footpring just pull parsing is about 16k jackson is way bigger
in activity_main.xml below the feedbackview has a margin top of -36dp which is greater than its height when non-negated
the error is because the gridview is being applied to more than one listview
however the transition from the initial touchesbegan event to the first touchesmoved is less obvious sometimes the device waits a while
can anyone give some details about oracle hadoop connectors will it perform better than sqoop
what you have described in your question makes the use of this function better than mouseover and mouseout
that means you don t know how many iterations you re going to need so a while loops is more suited to this task than a for-loop
the reverse while loops is generally faster than a for-loop as well
one advantage of this approach over using a larger than 32-bit unsigned integer for the calculation is that it can be extended to work with bigger integersÃ¢ Ã¢ Ã¢ with 64-bit integers and uintmax_t integers Ã¢ Ã¢ by changing the constant from uint32_max to uint64_max or uintmax_max
in such a simple arrays you shouldn t be concerned about memory usage but the for-loop consumes less memory than foreach because foreach uses an internal copy of the arrays
the other question is that what i am hearing from our group leader is that postgresql is better than mysql when working with coordinates
if i try to do a google search for website loading slower in google-chrome than in safari i get a lot of results about how safari is slower than google-chrome
rsa has much simpler math and can directly encrypt decrypt data you should never compare rsa and ecdsa
ok there are some cases where myisam is faster than innodb but rarely enough that it s worth putting up with the lack of acid-compliance
although both approaches are o n the for-loop has a larger constant because of loops overhead
or is it merely a hint to whatever tool converts between swift and objective-c to better deal with swift optionals
i need to send bulk mail in my php application but its outgoing limit was 500 if i purchase vps server for sending email if it grows more than 1000+ gmail hotmail will mark me as a spam so what is the solution for this issue
firefox works a bit better than google-chrome but the settimeout just seems to delay the final result being shown rather than delaying each step
try reading this link also for more study over hdpi and mdpi concept
i have read that implements runnable is better than extends thread but i have no idea of how
instead i was hoping to just put the logic in a getter setter that seems more appropriate to me
although build.gradle has a higher priority so the value in androidmanifest.xml will be ignored by gradlew while building your application
pacoblaze was written in verilog which like adam said less common than vhdl
from my point of view the datamapper model is much easier to grasp but since activerecord is the defacto standard it feels weird to change the orm just for this little problem
for example when the setter or getter function is more complicated than just the trivial
i am using a sparse format but suggestions are welcome on other formats too i am able to use the data with weka in a dense format using the function names as variables and it works just muuch slower than with libsvm
if further stream will not be used to read values from it it s istream part won t be used ostringstream is more suitable
question is there a way to define conditional dependency in the build.gradle or another settings file so that a particular gradlew version is used for the build process that is ensured to be in compliance with the available java version either 1.6 or 1.8 either by manual definition or better by letting gradlew decide which version of itself to use
perhaps a highly optimized and tuned implementation with sse avx multithreading is better for me
install newer emacs by homebrew or macports
in our approach our test framework extends the standard test case class junit in our case but testng seems more capable that sets up and tears down the various database dependecies with each test using the following steps
if a post has a more recent reply i want to get the replies created_on value but also get the post post_id and subject
the problem is that the server-side selectedindexchanged event triggers earlier than the client-side change event so the data never reaches the server-side
so arraylist and sort is more effective than treeset
if you cannot tolerate that use getline it s harder to use so use fgets if in doubt
on linux these syscalls are often mmap 2 perhaps with sbrk 2 and since linux systems are mostly free software you could actually study and improve the implementation of malloc musl libc implementation of malloc the more common gnu libc malloc implementation is perhaps more complex to understand
what i would like to know is whether there is something in php that could check test in some simple way whether a folder directory contains file older than sometime or even how many of such files are there without any kind of manual go-through
you can also do this stuff the old fashioned way using sqlcmd from command line dbas love this for some reason but for us mortals ssms is much less of a struggle
letÃ¢ s encrypt provides great scripts for apache 2 and nginx but not lighttpd which is much more comfortable for small systems like raspberry pi or old boxes
i ve found that even if lxml is faster than beautifulsoup for documents that size it s usually best to try to reduce the size to a few kb via regex or direct stripping and load that into bs as you are doing now
the other option is to use a foreach loops which is slightly slower than a for-loop but works almost equivalently for all practical purposes
there is a problem here because i already have more than 40 get post request with different url names
you should be able to do this in flotr which has a better license than highcharts by just throwing what they showed in this blog post on its side
you can use a similar but perhaps slightly better path with pdfrw -- you can run pdfrw in conjunction with reportlab and import the pdf you exported from pydot and use it as a form xobject similar to an image on the reportlab canvas
a lot of people seem to say that writing compilers and other language tools in functional languages such as ocaml and haskell is much more efficient and easier then writing them in imperative languages
if all you want is to include a padding then you can achieve the same thing with the box-sizing attribute set to border-box that has far better browser support
with library purrr you can have a prettier more compact form see soto s answer for an even more compact one with dplyr
comparison between mockito vs jmockit - why is mockito voted better than jmockit
a subclassing is more flexible and is treated as an entire object which responds to all superclass methods plus it s own
awt is really out of date people have more experience with swing no days and even javafx
note that i am assuming a user can get invited to more than one post which seems logical
i read in some tutorials that android automatically scales up the images when the screens resolution is bigger than mdpi
2 using databasemigrations allows you to use an in-memory sqlite db for testing which is faster and more lightweight than mysql or postgresql
achartengine is easy to use mpandroidchart has more option but is less easy to use than achartengine
it possible to do this a bit better by using variadic macros to do the stringification
you can not have multiple physical branches under one repository with mercurial like svn or bazaar but the good thing about mercurial imho is the easy user interface that is really straightforward and the performance that is faster than bazaar although bazaar is getting faster and faster in their recent release
jpg and png work well for most applications but the files will be larger than gif for very simple graphics
why quicksort or introsort or any comparison-based sorting algorithm is more common than radix-sort
if you intend to do more than show hide
if you have a really large matrix the example in your question is far from being large no worry there will be a ram hit and unlikely to be faster than a for-loop commented under your question because no copy of the matrix is made during loops
if their original password was longer than the salt + hash you may have just reduced the security of their password assuming a good password and ignoring hash collisions
trying to build a page of charts asp control objects that are smallish and then when we click on the image a styled jquery modal dialog pop-up that displays a larger version of the chart
you d be better off using mktime for this as it s dumber than strtotime
evidently firefox debugger firebug is better than google-chrome debugger
if we put our filter in between these calls either in getter or setter setter is more efficient as it is called only when filters change we modify original filtered list with our filter and return it back through the getter
as an additional note my suspicion is that you d need to indulge yourself in some pretty sophisticated benchmarks before you could conclude that udp is actually going to have higher performance than tcp for web services
aggregate-functions is more general version of sum
its not necessary and will potentially introduce bigger issues as you migrate your code to staging and production regions
nginx is more performant than apache in most cases with high-levels of requests
unfortunately g++ packed the structs significantly looser than gcc which caused significant problems sharing objects between c and c++ code
why is implements runnable a better option than extends from thread class
i am trying to make my div wrap the tag however it doesn t wrap the height is always higher of my div and my tag has no padding or margin i tried many things but doesn t work i am adding my style and the html code i am also going to add some screenshots
public class mealhistoryactivity extends activity implements connectioncallbacks onconnectionfailedlistener locationlistener ..
if one of the numbers is a constant your compiler might optimize by doing some combination of bit shifts and subtractions mostly for powers of two since hardware div mod is slower than addition or subtraction but on modern processors the latency already only a few nanoseconds is hidden by tons of other performance tricks so you needn t worry about it
when the draggable is dragged over the droppable you change it s snapmode option from outer to inner and then when it s dragged out and the droppable is no longer active you change it back
works in google-chrome firefox a bit weirdish blur effect on hover opera ends look smaller safari ends look smaller
but for a really useful explanation you d have to tell us exactly which database and library you re using and which python versionÃ¢ cpython 3.3.2 s csv module seems to be a lot faster than cpython 2.7.5 s and pypy 2.1 2.7.2 seems to be faster than cpython 2.7.5 as well but then either one also might run your code faster tooÃ¢ and so on
the c function strtol is much better make it a habit to prefer that one to atoi
if you need better performances than what scapy can offer you should probably use tcpreplay
children is faster than find for example just like parent is faster than parent
the reason is that maybe like in my case the xcode bot was attempting to archive with the development profiling and development profiling is much easier to debugging than 4f96f173-7ebe-4892-b283-52489de2f409
qhash provides faster lookups than qmap
udp is not always faster than tcp
this way the upgrade rule detects older versioning and shows a custom dialog if it does
edit memmove is 2x faster than memcpy on the server
tcp has bigger overhead than udp because it needs to add more data to your payload but you are guaranteed that your data will be received in it s destination in the order you sent it and not corrupted
when you put images into hdpi folder their appearance is smaller than from mdpi and ldpi
but xquery will be more than schematron and i use xquery heavily to validate xml values and i should be able to produce html reports well
you will need more include paths in here if you are dependent on more than just qtcore and qtgui but i just put those too for simplicity
when you do get the parametres are written to url so you can access them easily on other hand it can be rewritten by user so post is more secure way
heapsort tends to be slower than mergesort for the same reason.
poor performance from mysql has more to do with it not being smart and automatically creating an optimized plan like sql server postgresql or oracle would
why blazemeter is better than jmeter
you can also upgrade to django development versioning it has more versatile list_filter implementation see which can be used for providing advanced admin filters including or-queries
or you could employ a request signing scheme in which certain request fields are hash together with the password of the user basically sending the password without sending the password similar to digest authentication but you can use something better than md5
no problem mnt i mentioned possible compatibility between the method tried in 4.25 my solution and 4.00 your versioning but keep in mind the gap in time between these versioning is probably more than two years of upgrade and also a jump between backend databases versioning oracle 10g to oracle 11g r1.
register spilling is pretty cheap on x86 cpus due to fast l1 caches and register shadowing and other tricks and the 64bit only registers are more costly to access in terms of larger instructions so it may just be that gcc s version is as fast or faster than the one you want
don t use nsdateformatter use nscalendar which is much more accurate
from reading this website it seems lxml is the most commonly used and fastest while beautifulsoup is slower but accounts for more errors and variation
according to this answer the isotope plugin might work better than masonry for media-queried resizes
i suppose i could do this cleaner with int and or double using instead of like
decode the passwords yourself and re-encode them with a salt i recommend something a little more fancy than md5
therefore the only types that should have access to a constructor are its derived types and hence protected makes much more sense than public
the two vector graphic libraries you can focus are raphael and d3.js but d3.js is much more powerful with data binding
swt is more simple to use than swing especially if this is your first ui
for example a lot of people that started at a higher level have no idea why shifts are so much faster than multiplication and division or the impact of branching etc
it displays things normally on the screen of course but when you go to print preview in ie7 the only thing that show is longer description. so in other words it hide that first column and it also hide the second column
so far it has proven to be faster than smarty and it provides a compatibility layer to allow developers that have been using smarty for years to switch their application over to dwoo progressively
i would make the conditions easier by ignoring capitalization by converting to uppercase before comparison and leading trailing whitespace by using the strip method
for example english text has a particular kind of redundancy with some characters repeated more than others words that are repeated and more common than others certain words that are more likely to follow certain other words grammar punctuation structure etc
also robocopy is better than xcopy
please consider also to use xtend for code generation that s much nicer than stringtemplate and integrates smoothly with xtext infrastructure
wel i have used both orika and dozer i can say orika is at least 10 times faster than dozer in my project after the replacement
while i haven t used nscollectionview myself my gut feeling is that there s probably going to be a greater overhead with numerous nsview s compared to ikimagebrowserview which uses the standard coupling of an nsview with an nscell -like reusable drawing mechanism to help improve performance
the only place where raphael defeats d3.js is fallback raphael supports older versions of ie where as d3.js is based on current web standards ie 9
the swift runtime is smaller than the objective-c runtime
i think it is possible to play better with the decimalformat and messageformat classes here is what i can come with it passes the test cases but i don t think it is that robust
the picture is in mdpi and hdpi and my testing device samsung galaxy s i think it s no more than hdpi
if i do heapsort i can create the stack while i m sorting but would this be faster than a quicksort and then build the stack afterwords
it d be really nice if scala-ide supported tighter integration with sbt
reading a line of numbers spaced with white-space except n and then finally terminated with n is possible with scanf and ungetc but not worthy of coding except as an exercise as using fgets and sscanf strtod is far better
when i request the shares field i can see more than one post with shares but when i request post_id sharedposts for some of them i just get an empty data array in response
if you want a java gui that actually looks nice well nicer than swing or awt then you want to check out swt from ibm
if you need to secure payloads that pass through multiple participants then you need something more than https ssl since https ssl only encrypts one link of the graph
you might be able to use mapzen s system as well but i haven t tried their system with large amounts of features whereas i know mapbox does work better than leaflet and openlayers for your scenario
the draggable is covering more than one droppable element and at this point there are multiple event.target.id s being covered
potentially you are trying to model something in inherited that is better suited for composition or your base class should be taking in an object instead of individual related properties if the properties aren t related then perhaps your base class is doing too much single responsibility principle
i wound up going with redmine and it s way better than trac
x86 is considerably slower a few clocks plus a clock or so per function argument while 64bit is much less because most function arguments are passed in registers instead of on the stack
listview much better than the gridview dataview in that they let you write out clean html
i recomend to use dtmilano tool androidviewclient that is easier to use than monkeyrunner
i need a query to get results from stackexchange dataset in such a way that it returns me 100 top reputation users with not more than 3 post body of post for each user
firefox takes almost 3 times longer than google-chrome
it seems activemq is better than rabbitmq in the sense that it is easy to set up and maintenance for cluster
and is as far as i know faster than the combination of malloc and memset on the other hand malloc alone is faster than calloc
i find fireworks has an easier time dealing with vectors because they re first class objects while in photoshop they re actually a combination of a vector mask and a colour fill
in the same breath i would also like to be able to run a specific number of child processes at any given time say for example n children running concurrently whenever one exits the parent process starts another child if needed but has no more than n children at any given moment
twitter desktop accomodates screensizes from around 1048px wide when you are on a screens that is smaller then that you are probably on a tablet or smartphone and if you open twitter from a browser on your phone you are instantly redirected to and prompted to download the twitter app
filtering before the grouping by is usually more efficient because it reduces the amount of data needed to process the aggregation
you might be better off looking at something more usable such as flask bottle etc
not to be confused ffmpeg is more recent and libav was used in some distributions of linux
memcached has more functionality but is intended for distributed environments while apc works on single servers only
as it happens my choice is textpad but just about anything which is more advanced than notepad ought to be able to do this
but heapsort is assumed to be on average somewhat slower than standard in-place quicksort
i was digging through the flask pluggable views documentation and while i find the methodview to be very helpful for making restful crud endpoints usually i end up wanting more than just get post put delete methods under a base route with common decorators and so forth
edit i just came across saucelabs which seems to be even better than browserstack for manual testing and they also cover many web browsers tablet mobile devices
kibana focuses more on logs and adhoc search while grafana focuses more on creating dashboards for visualizing time series data
if you are looking for a more flexible build than ant or maven but at the same time utilize maven or ivy repositories you should consider gradle
and before copying the directory it is better to zip the entire stata8 folder - that will significantly reduce copying time since there are plenty of small-sized files
and i want something simpler faster than creating pop-up dialog
probably you should start with something simpler than networking swing swt and android
one item to note be aware the default z-index for jqmodal is below default for blockui so using them together requires you set blockui basez option higher than jqmodal s default 3000.
plus being able to synthesise both getter and setter is a more complete solution
on the last iteration of the outer for-loop ndx is one less than array.length so when you call arrays ndx+1 that is equivalent to arrays array.length which out of bounds since arrays start indexing at 0
since the flow of logic is still basically a loop but the api boundaries of the presenter is a cleaner boundary than view in mvp which helps decouple v and m in mvp than is possible in mvc
i know that declarative way is cleaner but sometimes imperative programming makes your business safer
1 tcp is connection oriented and reliable where as udp is connection less and unreliable
oh i see you need a constructor that has more access than protected but less than public
js for tabs generally does no more than show hide maybe load content
i moved some .lib files from c program files x86 ibm websphere mq tools lib to c python27 libs and it compiled well
but a get seems more logical than a post anyway
wewtaco i noticed that your png file has wider dimension than the gif file and i am guess that could be a reason the black bars are showing up
if i m reading your situation right it sounds like you d be better served by avoiding inherited on thing and instead thing about category-specific attributes as properties of the relation between things and categories
especially as vb6 is becoming more and more of a distant memory and the vb.net language takes on a life of its own in conjunction with the core .net framework advancing
i am much more experienced with vbscript than jscript but i will give it a shot since not many takers on this question
personally i use sha-512 with a salt because a bigger number in the hash name means a better hash
but if you use public key encryption to encrypt messages you are a limited to small messages -- a 1024 bit rsa key encrypts less than 128 bytes and b going to pay in performance because public key encryption is much more costly than symmetric key encryption such as aes encryption
i ve also found unicorn to be faster than webrick especially in production applications and apps running on heroku
without wanting to self-promote i ve also put together a blog post that goes into more detail on the aforementioned answer that should be of some use
for a unity3d game i m working on i have a situation where i want a read writeable property with a trivial getter but a setter which does some more work
this is better than using get comments api for every post to see if there is new comment
it seems simpler to me because i m more experienced with server-side than client-side development
conceptually it seems like a type of central authentication system cas but is more similar to shibboleth also a federated identity management system
if you are decoding some formatted file rather than something like a programming language attoparsec or similar might be better than parsec or uu-parsinglib
on arm it is not or rather 32-bit os on 64bit uefi is technically possible only would still require the operating system loader to be 64bit but even fiddlier than on x86
pypy which in general is much faster than cpython is considerably slower for this use case
see the solution of how do i make apps smaller with qmake and macdeployqt on how to do this
accessing and dynamically reloading non-class resources inside jar war files is way easier
if your report is complicated and have many subreports and subdatasets its better to go this approach since ireport will make it quicker and easier for you to design and maintain later
example with nunit i have better experiences with nunit than with mstest
far easier than getting mysql or postgresql installed on a system.
it s similar to the solution proposed by ckersch except that it has more overhead you re changing the dom every mouseover mouseout but is easier to implement and doesn t change the structure of your svg at all
nwjs node-webkit is a better solution if you want your app
swift is neither easier to read nor understand than objective-c
it is a great tool if you want to use git as frontend for an existing svn server but for one-time conversions you should not use git-svn or tools based on it but svn2git which is much more suited for this use-case
is it more safe than get or post
of course if appropriate you can use just static access syntax public variables or static setter and getter which is even more simple and clear than first method
i believe the error might be how firefox and google-chrome handles these multiple times included jquerys and it might be that google-chrome uses the older and firefox newer version
what is even better is oleksiy s solution because surprisingly .foreach method uses less memory than classic for-loop so if you re optimisation freak use .foreach but after all it doesn t matter because your arrays size is small so you won t notice any speed difference
swt is claimed to be faster than swing although in modern versions swing is also fast enough
firefox seems to animate the element quicker than google-chrome does and so while a duration of 1s is enough for the animation in google-chrome firefox needs it to be 2s to be slower and show the effect
is the performance of coalesce field constant better than isnull
if you use post when get is more semantically correct it is less communicative of the intent of your request since post usually means you are sending a payload
i have not found a lot of times when implements an interface would be a better system than extends a superclass
part of the compiler toolchain includes an experimental jit generator now in its fifth incarnation and starting to work really well - the goal is for a jited pypy to run much faster than cpython
of those three ogg would usually be smaller than mp3
calloc itself is slower than malloc because you have to spend some time to clear the contents of allocated memory
please don t mention memcached i am already using it but it is not suitable as direct replacement of apc because i am doing many apc_fetch calls because apc is much faster than memcached for this purpose
there are some situations when myisam is infinitely more efficient than innodb when manipulating large data dumps offline because of table lock
another way to do the same thing is to use jvisualvm which is much more user friendly but also more memory consuming than jhat
dealing with a stateless cluster is often simpler then dealing with a stateful cluster
if you ve been using laravel then you already know it is better than codeigniter
access to disk is slower so when you ve written to a file it will be flushed to disk and no longer reside in ram which means that next time you need the file you might be going to get it from disk slow whereas in memory mapped files you know the file is in ram and you can have faster access to it then when it s on disk
the advantages here are that you can block off certain methods or certain parts of couchdb using nginx apache which is typically more flexible than the http options available in couchdb
i know many of pypy s data structures are actually smaller than cpython s but again that has nothing to do with the jit
i hear all this stuff about bazaar being slower than git
extends makes more sense to me here than implements maybe it s a typo in the book
can i safely assume that vb.net result is more precise than vb6 and discard the vb6 result completely
fwiw i have never gotten freebsd to work properly under virtualbox perhaps if you need that you would be better off with vmware which does
i inspected the range object in both google-chrome and firefox and then noticed that firefox s range object is far richer than google-chrome s
proto buffer and avro is better than than csv tsv file in terms of size but data is in non human readable format
restful services does not implement an exact way to transfer the info you can use path query string form string or even multipart data so you can do it as you want but in your case instead of using get method with all the data in the query a post or put is more appropiate and you will not hit the query string limit
if getting these in sync is an issue make the client-side timer shorter than the server-side one
therefore vectorized substr by david arenburg is the best answer while sapply grepl by sixiang.hu and significantly better than grepl by david arenburg
it turns out jquery datatables is better suited for customisation and we have adopted this instead of using jqgrid
in doing so the tradefoff is that tcp becomes slower compared to udp
but i d think bignum subtraction is a little slower than bignum addition
imho pagespeed is better than yslow
the c format is the same as is used by ctime but strftime is more flexible
the problem i have is that some children have more than one parent but because in order to use the recursive parent nicely i need to group the results by id i only see distinct entries
some fancy compilers understand the un interrelatedness of instructions to a limited extent and will automatically interleave instruction flows probably over a longer window than the cpu sees to better utilise the processors
most likely hashcode will be faster unless for whatever reason calling hashcode + equals once is much slower than calling compareto log n times
postgresql is more compliant but if you re comfortable with mysql and you re using an orm you should probably use that
one camp most notably the linux kernel people thinks that struct a is clearer than the typedef
png images are always compressed lossless but their compression algorithm works better than competition gif
using any other browser google-chrome firefox and opera it s much quicker
the keylistener is an older interface from the awt days its still ok to use it with swing but is more of a general listener
they are easily generated for udp simply by making the datagram bigger than the mtu
as i noted in comments however if you re willing to rely on posix s strdup then that s cleaner than strlen + malloc + and has the same semantics you take responsibility for freeing the memory allocated for the copy
the number of requests orientdb could serve is consistently 3 to 5 times lower than neo4j
generally speaking passes in higher-level shader material systems yes higher than glsl cg hlsl like this one are a way of setting up states necessary for multi-pass rendering
if you want to add a plugin and its versioning is higher than the core mvvmcross versioning use nuget to upgrade all mvvmcross packages before adding the plugin
now you can walk your collection with a for-loop without fearing that one arrays is shorter than another one or even use a foreach loops to go through elements without using an index
but this operation inherently involves division which is expensive whereas computing an address from an array index involves a multiplication and is faster
the thing is that gdi is still faster than direct2d if i draw to a bitmap and after it s done i bitblt the result back to the form it paints at 35ms and with the same graphics quality
the level of abstraction of datamapper is way higher than the activerecord s
firebird was forked + - 18 years ago from interbase 6 which was opensourced for a short time since then it has diverged and firebird can no longer read interbase databases nor can interbase - as far as i am aware - read firebird databases more recent than firebird 1 or maybe 1.5
edit for the read-performance this link shows that innodb often is actually not slower than myisam
while myisam can be faster for some queries innodb is usually quicker if properly tuned
also why does firefox perform way better than google-chrome on this benchmark
i have a small table and the internet explorer 11 adds padding to the cells so the hole table is bigger than in google-chrome or firefox
tensorflow is slower than caffe torch etc on gpu because of
the reason i asking this is because i read tcp is slower than udp because tcp ensures order of packets
or you might be happier with a fast-forward merge
i get the impression that most people think that hashing salt passwords is the more secure way of handling passwords but i can t figure out a way to comply with current company operations when using hash passwords
actually genson is faster and has more features than gson and has performances close to jackson but its a lot more lightweight see
but there are some cases especially in iot domain udp is more popular than tcp for its bigger transport overheads
uwsgi is better if you are using nginx i find nginx far better than apache personally
in the most simple way you can look at rsa one key of a keypair is nothing more than an exponent and a common modulo .
if you re after a plain parametrization using sin and cos it s way easier
using strncpy 3 is better than strcpy 3 but things like strlcpy 3 are better still
on windows the while loops above is 20 faster than the original for-loop in google-chrome in ie and firefox both loops perform the same
but when i press page down button from keyboard it works fine but when i scroll using mouse takes bit more time to load data and scrollbar of gridview displays abnormal
wouldn t swift be slower than objective-c in this case since it is layered on top of it
and i ve read that using liblinear is far faster more memory efficient for such tasks as such i ve ported my libsvm classifier to accord net like so
as the so link in your question suggests int comparison is faster than chars comparison and yield faster fetch
postgresql has a more comprehensive gis extension . mysql s is as dumb as a flapjack in flatland
myisam is often faster than innodb in terms of raw performance mostly because it is not acid
the workaround is usually using a for-loop and manipulating the loop-variable appropriately but in your case a while loops is simpler
if browser width is less than 1670px and height of div.banner is less than 1253px then let div.title and div.social s parent be div.banner else let the parent of div.title and div.social be the body or browser window
not sure why people think myisam is more performant than innodb - it s a conundrum wrapped in an enigma
i feel the need to mention that java s good garbage collection in general is better than malloc free of c
but there are other things you can do with little more than the addition and subtraction required to deal with indexing into lists etc
cpython is faster than pypy on the two tests slowspitfire and waf
also with xquery you can re-use your existing skills with xslt + xpath as the languages have a lot in common but xquery is more geared towards database access
basically ram is more expensive than the disk storage
however postgresql s sql features are far more advanced than mysql s and mysql has a tendency to silently ignore things you tell it to do - especially in a default installation and if you rely on a foreign key to be created that might be a very unpleasant surprise
i d rather use webclient because it requires less code than httpwebrequest httpwebresponse
actually adding a new resource folder does nothing more then adding it as a resource directory in build.gradle
colorbox is implemented as a jquery plugin which is a bit different and better than thickbox s sort-of-self-contained widget model
if you don t need a full dom available and just want to parse and scrape manipulate html elements there is cheerio which is more lightweight than jsdom and still gives you a jquery-like api
the solution from charliefl is approximately 100x faster than underscore.js depending on browser in this case and lodash being up to 2x faster than underscore.js
a post request would not provide any more safety than a get request any half-decent web debugging tool can forge post requests
at first to get post and get parameters is better to use
this does not work if any parent has more than one children
other useful pieces would be jdbi for database access much simpler than hibernate or other full orms async-httpclient for doing calls to other web services
you can t get a patent any more because with this post i will claim prior art -
apart from that you might want to give xuggle a try - it works on a much lower level than vlcj but this should give you much more control over what s happening and unlike jmf it s a good actively maintained project.
subtraction is similar using subtraction of the base type and borrow instead of carry multiplication can be done with repeated additions very slow or cross-products faster and division is trickier but can be done by shifting and subtraction of the numbers involved the long division you would have learned as a kid
also vert.x has little bit better benchmarks than netty
if you were attempting to beat the performance of tcp by shifting to udp keep in mind that part of the reason you get lower performance with tcp is because tcp tracks and redelivers the lost packets for you
id love to know how to solve this since using nginx sometimes is a better option than apache and having this issue with fuelphp framework and not being able to use this two great tools together is awful
also settimeout is a better approach than setinterval as you explicitly reset it on each round trip
an alternative would be firebird which is not so flexible but in my experience it is in some cases performing much better than mysql and postgresql
i have a sample wpf app here and wondering why bmp is loading faster than png
consider using swing which has much better performance over the old heavyweight awt
why new delete is slower than malloc free
as for your question a for-loop is usually better when you want a piece of code to run a certain number of times and a while loops is better when the condition for the code to keep running is more general such as having a boolean flag that is only set to true when a certain condition is met in the code block
maybe its your grasp of english which is the problem but its the lifetime of the connection time between connection opening and closing you need to worry about more than the timeout length of time with no activity after which the connection will be terminate
also pygtk is lighter than wxpython but i ended up bitting the bullet and using wxpython for the same purpose recently it is heavy but it didn t have any affect on the script performance
something where the app is about serving different pages you want low memory and good context switching things like preforking unicorn or running on the rubinius version of ruby with puma that makes concurrency easier to code because it will perform well with threading as opposed to something like mri with a global interpreter lock
one of the largest benefits of ironpython is that it has effectively no gil - meaning that if you are both writing python code and it is multi-threaded - you can often get performance that is better than cpython without having to spawn multiple process and pickle objects across the boundaries
it looks like vim is slower than geany
liquibase seems to have everything flyway has and more flexibility when it comes to rollbacks
c++ is not my first language and this is small part of code i can t figure out i ve chosen udp because it is always much simpler than tcp
i have tried connecting the qscrollbars but the maximum of the qplaintextedit is smaller than the qtextedit s
i ve noticed that the common lisp approach is more conservative than the approach scheme has
i ve also noticed that qtwebengine is significantly faster and more stable that the old qtwebkit based widgets
to any seasoned developer of a c-like language break will both read better as well as provide a cleaner solution than goto
that being said i find gitolite much more complete than gitosis like all those recent blog posts illustrate
if you are willing to limit yourself to vista or later then direct2d would be a little simpler than direct3d
in firefox it seems that this is 1px lower than in google-chrome and safari
i seem to remember reading that though infoset is great in many cases when you re dealing with larger datasets with sorting filtering it is more efficient to go direct to the table as using infoset requires each xml fragment to be parsed and elements extracted before you get to the data
the while loops seems tighter than a for-loop from previous answer but look up for vs while logic
consider rdiscount which substitutes for bluecloth but is faster and better maintained
i m learning swift and much less familiar with objective-c but for the life of me i can t figure out how they are trying to achieve the goal stated as build list of encodings sorted and including only those with human readable names.
much as i used to love jmock i have to agree with the comments that mockito is far friendlier to use
extfs4 or xfs are between 25 and 40 faster than ntfs or refs depending on the optimization
without draggable seems more like it but then i can t use the droppable
i think jtable would be better jcomponents as jlist because there you can implements tablecelleditor maybe example with similair output here
but i get compiler warning c4309 truncation of constant value in vc++ 2010 whenever the argument to put is greater than 0x7f
textedit is not the best tool to search and replace styled text for example the free textwrangler has more powerful skills to do that
i had the same problem when my pyzmq s and zmq s versioning is older versioning i upgrade the versioning to 15.2.0 then resolved the problem the ipc address prefix that i used is inproc
yes swing has newer and better api s than awt
imho the main reason that they didn t catch on is that they require tended to require too much skill and used awt swing which produces worse uis than what a designer with little programming skills could achieve with flash
i tried jboss too but i think glassfish is easier to use
fgetc is a function to read a single char simpler than using fgets
max_size must be big enough because a for-loop is slower than lapply you want to do as little loops through the for as possible but not too big or the list extension overhead will make the program slower
apache is more friendly configuration wise htaccess htpasswd rewrite rules etc nginx is fast in regard to static assets
i strongly suggest either of the first two options over the latter option as the latter option does not always play nicely with the way rpm and yum handle transactions when more than one rpm are involved
oh and it can use cpython for its innermost loop or psyco - but pypy is faster than either especially on 32 bit systems
note using apply functions instead of a for-loop is better but it depends on the actual purpose of your loops
it is only slow with google-chrome browser safari is much faster
i m more familiar with unicorn but based on the documentation i ve read you shouldn t have to start passenger in a separate process
innodb is often slower than myisam being a transactional db engine with acid properties
ignoring the cost of providing sorted input the oh of sortedlist is smaller than the oh of sorteddictionary
however a linkedhashmap is faster as seen here treemap has o log n performance for containskey get put and remove according to the javadocs while linkedhashmap is o 1 for each.
my guess is that server-side implementation may turn out to be more flexible and more powerful than client-side as i can add functionality to the server easily as long as the client understands it
i know how to sort a text file alphabetically but i m trying to do more than sorting grouping
i d totally go with flask unless one dependency bottle is better than three flask jinja2 and werkzeug
for similar functionality that speaks pandas but has more flexible features you could use the facetgrid object from seaborn
the while executes much much faster than the fadeout fadein calls so you only see the last result
add one more uinavigationcontroller between uitabbarcontroller and uiviewcontroller
solved the problem came from css specificity.bootstrap s css was judged more specific by google-chrome regarding my menu s selector but not by firefox and safari
i need a sip server hopefully simpler more efficient and more secure than asterisk or other full-featured pbx to just terminate sip calls and play audio based on the incoming number
performing addition on this slightly larger type will pretty much always be faster than doing division or modulo on the type itself
but depending on the answers to those questions i m guessing that coalesce might do the trick for you better than isnull
why get method is faster than post
in google-chrome the same flow renders in 13 seconds but firefox takes more than 51 seconds
communication via i2c is more complex that with uart or spi solution
the second way i thought is testing for icollection instead of ienumerable since ienumerable is more of a potential collection than an actual one
also i can not use custom dimension because my piwik versioning is older and i can not upgrade it now
yes if one sql statement is execute repeatedly using prepare statements is much better
there s a post on the subject on the birt world blog here specifically relating to xls emitters although the tribix emitters mentioned should also enable output to rtf a microsoft format readable by word that is much more concise than doc
a bufferedoutputstream is more appropriate that a dataoutputstream imho
swift also prevents us i believe from overriding a parent class s property but also still lets us observe changes to that property--this is much better than objective-c s approach
one place where the enhanced for-loop is faster than a naively implemented traditional loops is something like this
you can think of extends from a superclass if the derived class is of the same type.i mean that when a class extends an abstract-class they both should be of the same type the only difference being that the superclass has a more general behavior and the sub class has a more specific behavior
typically you would not allow a http client to determine the uri of a new resource so a post to blog would be safer than a put to blog article-uri although http does cater for appropriate responses should the server be unable to honour the intended uri
however you can t use a superclass value where a subclassing is expected because the subclassing is more specific
so my guess is the hosting provider upgrade something maybe mysql to a versioning that requires stronger passwords
your while loops always runs a fixed number of times so from a stylistic point of view you would be better off with a for-loop
in fact v1 uuid is more fit than v4 if you use the uuid just as a table id - because it uses mac-address and time stamp to prevent clashes
i am using yii 1.1.12 and recently upgraded my php from 5.3 to 5.5 and have found that apc is no longer to be used because opcache has been made part of php5.5
as a note the su command is much older than sudo and the normal procedure before sudo was to su to root and then to another user unless you knew the passwd of that other user
jedit is still pretty good but emacs is quite better
as far as i can tell qt-designer is more powerful than any wxpython counterpart like boa constructor and pyglade
it is said that phpquery is often faster than querypath because of fewer overall features
qvector will usually give better performance than qlist because qvector always stores its items sequentially in memory where qlist will allocate its items on the heap unless sizeof t sizeof void and t has been declared to be either a q_movable_type or a q_primitive_type using q_declare_typeinfo
ie 8 is much worse than firefox and google-chrome runs smoothly
i can write code that successfully returns the int of a single-character string however when it comes to ones that contain more than one chars i can t because of this type error
btw for extra credit if you are using ios 3.2 or 4.0 or later use the uipangesturerecognizer class to handle the drag and drop logic - the drag and drop motion is a lot smoother than overriding touchesbegan touchesmoved touchesended .
malloc is faster since calloc initializes the allocated memory to contain all zeros
opera probably is more complete to manage canvas than google-chrome but the problem is always to exclude the finger touch if i m using the pen
in my experience udp based code is generally less complex than tcp based code
as svick said it s no better way than profiling your program identifying hot spots and optimizing them using concrete benchmarking
rtsp is more of a handshake done with the server while rtp is the actual stream coming in once the handshake is done and you start streaming
if you want to allow the integers to be delimiter by more than one spaces for indentation purposes or so and depending on the way you want to handle tabs and other non-newline whitespace you can use a more complex delimiter
another popular language that offers more power than haskell is agda - i don t know agda beyond knowing it is dependently typed on hackage and well respected by people i respect but those are good enough reasons to me
i d say that pyglet is actually more evolved than pyopengl
possibly faster than ccombobox with drawitem would be an owner data clistctrl
webclient is sometimes easier to use than webrequest
i recommend you not to use grouplayout is really hard instead of you can try to use gridbaglayout it s simplier
coalesce case can add implicit data type conversions whereas isnull has simpler rules
you can send a lot more data with a post than a get
while those queries look very similar i suspect orderdate includes time information so the sorting and grouping is much more expensive and lead to many more rows in the subquery for the second query
because of this i m not sure if traditional crossover algorithms will work well for instance i tried ordered crossover and the children it created were generally worse than its parent
for or int which sounds a simpler case and chars could have been both implemented as member operators or as non-member free operators
and finally from my experience nginx is faster than apache
i haven t used parse.com but i think firebase is easier for a beginner
yii has a higher learning curve than say codeigniter and cakephp
malloc free is harder because thereÃ¢ s also calloc and realloc
this may be optimal indeed if the table access to retrieve the values missing in the index is more expensive than filtering and sorting
obviously as a result i need two folder in the directory folder one called bad which contains all the folder containing one folder and one called good which contains all the folder containing more than one folder
i believe the storage formats were either jks the standard java keystore jceks a java keystore that provides much stronger protection of private keys or pkcs12
i can t seem to figure out why removeclass doesn t work when my scrolltop is less than or not equal to my nav s offset .top value
since an id is unique and the methods getelementsbytagename or getelementsbytagname returns a live htmlcollection it s better if you use these elements as unique variables so you won t ask your browser to fetch them many times
alternatively use the java.time classes if you re using java 8 or joda time otherwise - both are much better options than java.util.date and java.util.calendar
i would find this very useful if not more useful than box-sizing border-box
according to moore s law computers are becoming exponentially faster hence computing hash functions becomes much cheaper in terms of time especially quick hash functions like md5 or sha1
so if the gtk scrolledwindow is smaller than the gtk drawingarea inside it the scrolled window should change to scrollable - but the problem is that it does not work
right now i would have to say the put method is better since it works and i could not get the webservice to work
this code does more than just show or hide fabs on scroll it actually handles a pretty perfect action bar disappears on scrolling effect
when i m in a hurry i use gedit purely because it is quicker than komodo edit
foreach can simplify the code in a for-loop but it is a heavy object and is slower than a loops written using for.
it is similar in spirit to keras which is built as a high-level api on top of theano tensorflow cntk although the main difference is that lasagne implements only one backend allowing it to integrate more deeply with theano features
in fact on windows jruby passes more rubyspec tests than ruby meaning mri or yarv itself
the next solution is faster than using in and except clauses
for those commenting that cstdio is obsolete personally i like it more than iostream
this task can be easy done with getter setter method or with signal and slot but setter is more suitable here
this is not to say this is more official than jerkson just that there are many useful jackson extension modules that many developers are not familiar with
however vim comes by default with another plugin which does a lot more than nerdtree called netrw help netrw
i want to use a jpanel and then put jlabel if using jtable is easier then i will use that please tell me which will display the data
i really miss this feature on virtualbox because i find vmware to be bloated and it slows the host system down much more than virtualbox does
for next projects i m going to try redmine seems more clean and hipe than trac
the misunderstanding is that incrementing the exponent is not faster than doing a multiplication
i find that objective-c is much nicer for working with core audio than swift
if you re in a nested loop and need to break out of all loops a goto can make this much cleaner and simpler than break statements and if-checks
also note that i use objective-c more than swift
racket is closer to scheme than to common lisp but you could dip your toes into the lisp family without the speed bump of the emacs style of development
tcmalloc is faster than the glibc 2.3 malloc available as a separate library called ptmalloc2 and other malloc s that i have tested
alternatively use a gridview though i find that repeater gives you more control over the emitted markup
ram is a lot faster than disk so reads and writes are temporarily stored until the data is requested by the code or the disk is able to receive it
the best testdriven.net disables all instrumentation that mstest does so it makes mstest blazing fast - much faster than nunit for example
for jradiobutton and jcheckbox is better to use itemlistener only because fired exactlty events selected and deselected
aside you should probably look into using a jslider which seems more natural than using a jscrollbar for value adjustment
obviously i could script each input into a get request address and replace the img src with that but post is more desirable and it seems there should be a more elegant way to make use of the form s submit mechanism
lxml parser is generally faster html5lib is the most lenient one - this kind of difference would be relevant if you have a broken or non-well-formed html to parse
you might look at postgresql as i find it a bit easier to manage and maintain as i feel some aspects are more logical than mysql
i ve found that firefox is greatly faster with imacros than google-chrome
well glassfish is more right than jboss and weblogic business-bean-classes should all have their own ejb-local-interface
declarative code is easier to make bug-free than imperative code
unfortunately as martijn pieters noted there are no accepted solution for python 3.x and only one for python 2.x and according to the amount of memory spent for solving it numerix could have used psyco the library on which pypy is based much faster than cpython
also since this is a bit old bcrypt is indeed better than pbkdf2 but scrypt is even better
if you have both post and get params with same name and if you using then it will take post variable only.because post has the higher priority than get
memory optimizations - phusion passenger uses less memory than thin and unicorn
pypy s jit can make python code execute much faster than cpython
it is in fact considered to be much more dangerous than strcpy since the null termination mechanism of strncpy is not intuitive and therefore often misunderstood
is the assumption that codeigniter modules work in kohana or at least can be massaged to without too much effort or is it just that kohana s got fewer modules
i have used this link to generate nine-patch images however even if i add the files to the drawable ldpi mdpi ldpi xhdpi and xxhdpi folders the image is still shorter than the screens width
when not sorting before grouping it is much faster but then i get values from random parts of hour
if pypy succeeds to be better than cpython in general which is questionable the main weakness affecting its wider adoption will be its compatibility with cpython
it s not any more secure than get but the general rule is that you want get for getting information and post for changing information
also for my money i d create a swing gui not an awt gui as swing is much more robust and flexible
i want to check if my pubdate i receive from a rss feed is older that now
as you run queries it has to fetch data from disk which is much slower than ram
i reimplemented the mouse move press and release events for the inner widget in order to be able to move it inside its bigger parent with drag drop
what you really need is an efficient way to insert into a priority queue when you know that the element being inserted is smaller bigger than the min max depending on whether this is a min-heap or a max-heap
this tiny overhead on add is vastly outweighed by the savings on lookups since all programmers should know and understand that case-insensitive compares are vastly slower than case-sensitive especially with unicode - the cpu can t just do a block compare of data but must check each pair of characters specially even using a table look-up this is vastly slower
maybe i would mostly always choose post over get it s more tidy and refreshing and going back issues with post method are a thing from the past in any major browser they just ask you if you want to resend the data don t they
thinking you can format magento blocks any better in a cms such as expressionengine and use magento just for the backend will put you on a hiding to nothing to end up with a fairly useless setup that isn t going to go anywhere
if anything i find working with svn easier and more intuitive than perforce
or in short stateless is better than stateful
the function is available in browsers newer than google-chrome 39 and firefox 31
when you say something like heapsort should be faster than quicksort what makes you say that
do any of the other common architectures like arm mips sparc etc have an easier than x86 instruction set
i am using the bash ftp command to ftp files however i have a problem where i try to create a directory that is more than 2 folder deep
i m more familiar with easymock than mockito so i had to do a little digging
although several ci tools such as teamcity have better support for nunit probably would change as mstest becomes more popular
copied from comment below i m looking for a statement like in mysql and postgresql count is faster for short queries exists is faster for long queries and use queryset 0 when it s likely that you re going to need the first element and you want to check that it exists
i don t know if it s activated by default on centos but it might be considering it is on ubuntu which is less entreprise oriented
myisam has proved to be faster than innodb for me
this is actually the syntax of ocamlyacc which you should not use if you start a new project in that case you should use menhir which has a more readable syntax and is better for numerous other reasons
but i ve had difficulty implementing this it seems as though nsprogress is meant more for long operations that execute all their code on one background thread but have separate sections that make it easy to determine when progress has been made if this is the case then the use of the term suboperation is a bit misleading as it brings to mind the use of nested nsoperation
lxml is the faster parser and can handle broken html quite well html5lib comes closest to how your browser would parse broken html but is a lot slower
firefox doesnt support the date format you have entered while google-chrome is more flexible and does support it
postgresql seem to better than mysql in terms of speed
i find training in opennlp much easier than in stanford-nlp
so for scheduling purposes i suggest you to use the setinterval approach while the settimeout approach is better for delayed execution and asynchronous work
change your paths to relative paths which mean they just have the bit of the path from the current directory in this case the projecta source1 bit if you ve set your current directory to your dropbox folder or just source1 if you ve set your current directory to the projecta folder which is a better idea
i read in a blog article that buildr a ruby based build tool was two times faster than maven for a simple build
if you judge that the code is more readable with getter setter after fields rather than after constructor you re free to do it
nserror is generally used to pass information between different code interfaces that are expecting a possible error where as nsexception is more so for errors that are unexpected or caused by the developer and thus should be handled during development
nowadays datejs is outdated and not maintained so use momentjs which is much better as pointed out by t.j
yes generally post is a better way of submitting data than get
if it s too slow i would ditch the autocompletion part of python-mode because it uses rope which is slower than jedi
last question is nerdtree really much better than netrw
the new project has two job numbers so instead of using the job number text box at the top i need to add option button or checkbox whichever is easier to choose between the two different job numbers for the four groups of information
coalesce is more correct of course you could just embed isnull over and over and over... but put that under a performance microscope and coalesce may just win
using a profiling is often more appropriate than benchmarking but it seems to be even more tricky
post request is a little safer than get because the parameters are not stored in browser history or in web server logs
but bfg-repo-cleaner is a much faster solution than git-filter-branch
as for reliability i think that postgresql is more reliable especially when compared to mysql using myisam - innodb is a lot better here
does anyone know if the upcoming v8 versioning is easier to upgrade or if its easier to upgrade from a certain previous versioning compared to earlier versioning
note that using the beautifulsoup parser is a lot slower than lxml s default parser
the thing is like ratingbar is smaller than the textview i don t get a correct aligment
if the loop is very tight time-budget-wise there will simply not be any room for the browser to do other tasks such as gc - for google-chrome this task seem to be secondary versus firefox which gives this higher priority likely to get more performance out of its engine
however if thats the case does this mean firefox is faster in execution than google-chrome
you could use beautifulsoup - but feedparser is much better geared towards rss handing
jspm is more commonly used to bring in client-side front-end libraries and npm for server-side ones
i d also recommend postgresql over mysql if you are going to have nested comments as postgresql does hierarchical querying better than mysql
note that there are plenty of python implementations other than cpython out there - for loopy code pypy tends to be much faster than cpython
if you want to use a counter in a loops a for-loop is typically more appropriate
i have to convert the qstring of the file s contents to qbytearray in order to compare them or vice versa and comparing bytes seems like the cleanest method however when converted from qstring to qbytearray the size of the new qbytearray is smaller than what it should be
this way of doing movement is much faster than using sin and cos
if you are looking for a web framework simpler than django look at flask flask uses jinja2 as the default template engine
the alternate screens switching is much older and as you indicated there was not much to be done i did not investigate further
you could similarly make children the transient field if explicitly recording the parent relationship is more helpful
proper handling of the last case is more complicated under cloudant and probably couchdb 2.0 due to its totally broken quorum handling but that s a different topic.
i always used uwsgi but realized that gunicorn is easier for simple projects like mine
using two one-to-many associations is always better than relying on many-to-many relations
keep in mind that union will return a distinct list - duplicates will be removed but it will perform slower than using union all which will not remove duplicates
however in general one could expect that a division is a more expensive operation than a multiplication
does udp always perform better than tcp
i m more familiar with tcp udp sockets and so this looks very similar to af_inet type of socket s ip_add_membership socket option.
but if today post is less than 10 post i will get back the yesterday post to query
i am using groupby on tickets then filtering my dataframe to those records where the count in that ticket grouping is greater than 1 using filtering
finally we concluded after we put print statement inside for-loop that it will take much more time than loops in the first case without print statement
i heard that in php there are some alternatives for the functions substr and strlen which handles safer bits
you d gain compatibility and durability because rss is more defined things will change less but if the feed doesn t include what you need it won t help you
the chance of receiving video streams over http is higher than rtsp rtp rtmp and so on
for example given gif may be deprecated in a system because png has proven better for the system s users - perhaps because it supports better colour depth preserving the colours more accurately or svg might be deprecated because some clients have been found to be using web browsers that won t display them jpeg might be deprecated because it s known the images in the system aren t natural photographic images and the format gives visually poor results despite larger compressed files slower processing speed and higher memory usage - lots of possible motivations for making things deprecated
and the second problem is that i want to use hover or hoverintent method better than mouseenter and mouseleave but im not sure how to use fadeto to get the same effect
another gotcha is that you must make sure that an instance cannot be a child of more than one parent or else destroying a parent could also destroy children belonging to another parent
swing is far better then awt and should be educated to people who is writing gui-based java for the first time
once you re out of ram and the system starts swapping - disk access is thousands times slower than ram so any potential benefits of 64-bit code are flying out of window
but if you still wish to figure out the phpbb password encryption hash it is no longer md5 in version 3.0 or higher and is a custom hash
algorithms like rsa are much less user-friendly than aes
depending on your actual needs which you did not explain a multi-column tlistview in vsreport mode may be a better choice than a tlistbox
in some ways the jquery-week-calendar has more features at the moment but fullcalendar has a bigger following and is closing the gap on features
ironpython is faster than c# in certain areas but not faster than cpython however you can link ironpython to any language thus over coming problems but then again you can do the same with cpython
since every browser has a limitation on the number of cookies they will store for most recent ie versions it is 50 for google-chrome and firefox it is a larger number but still finite the cookies build up until the limit is reached at which time the browser starts discarding the oldest cookies which means the session cookie for asp.net ends up being discarded causing the asp.net session expiration error
mbprogresshud has more features than uialertview so it might be better suited and more easily adapted for your purposes
the app uses a uinavigationcontroller that never has more than 1 uiviewcontroller on it s stack
it also allows you to redirect the stderr into the stdout which makes it easier to read
and division may be slower than multiplication or may still be fast
doing a single printf and strdup is faster and simpler than doing 2-3 printf calls
from my experience vmware 5 is faster than virtualbox 4.2 rc3 and has better smp performance
but i am still curios why is the policy set stricter with google-chrome than for example firefox
i know that orika and jmapper are great libraries from google and they use reflection in a different way than for example dozer which is much slower they se reflection to generete code somehow
will hide the exception-handling and since dealing with exception-handling is heavier compared to a simple if t why isn t the normal new t not considered less good practice considering we will have to use try-catch to check if a simple allocation succeeded and if we don t just watch the program die
if you have so many records in the table then the first thing is to change the table engine to innodb if its not innodb because for large number of records innodb is much faster as it caches the table data while on the contrary myisam engine only caches the indexes so each time it has to do a full table scan from disk if the data required cannot be fetched from index
using orientdb that is supposed ti be faster than neo4j for depth i m seeing a slow performance
for example nginx is considered faster than apache and a nodejs application is considered faster than a php application
when the textview text is longer than cardview length it shows against the imageview and i don t want that
immutable tree maps have o log n puts and gets which is asymptotically slower
we know tcp is better suited for this but the hardware development decided it s got to be udp
we propose to use udp over tcp since udp is faster than tcp
you don t want to use apache because nginx is better suited since nginx is built for async i o
disable antialiasing and the performance of direct2d will be on par or faster than gdi
also you should consider using nginx as server that s more flexible than apache
in fact this presentation which still refers to an older incomplete version of mysql s opengis support suggests that with proper indexing some mysql geospatial actions may actually perform better than postgresql postgis though i m sure that s up for debate
ilist is a more specialized interface that extend icollection
however properties become very useful when the setter getter actually does something more than just assign return an attribute s value
if i run ls folder | head in a directory with a lot of files the execution time is about 50 times faster than ls folder | tail
when you call input.nextline as part of your exception-handling catching is it better to place it into every catch block or just inside a finally block at the end of the try-catch
i am aware that a post is better for this kind of thing but my question is is this expected from a get request
i would say personally i find foreach a bit more readable over for loops but you should use the best for the job at hand and not have to write extra long code to include a foreach loops if a for-loop is more appropriate
innodb is more reliable than myisam
memory is a bottleneck to performance ram runs slower than the cpu and if you re paging to disk than it s really slow
in general mysql is optimized for pkey lookups and postgresql is more generally optimized for complex use cases
innodb consumes more disk space than myisam -- typically 2x-3x
but sometimes memcpy performs faster than strcpy because it moves blocks of memory at a time which allows it to perform some optimization i will not go into details here
also what makes nginx better than apache in this case
note i m not saying mysql s license won t work for you but postgresql is definitely simpler
if you have a full version of visual studio 2008 rather than the express edition it integrates the inbuilt mstest much better than nunit does and cruise control also supports mstest
the subversion versioning on the server is older than the versioning on my notebook so i guess my newer versioning somehow upgrade the working directories so they are incompatible with the old versioning on the development server
in ie opera and firefox it looks much better because aa is used which is still clearly visible but not that bad
if the network between the two point have a very high quality udp is absolutely faster than tcp but in some other case such as the gprs network tcp may been faster and more reliability than udp
i have noticed that content extraction is faster in itext but searching words using regex in the content extracted by itext takes longer time than pdfbox
it s useful to know that extends bound is much more common than super
fyi postgresql scales better than mysql on multi-processor overlapping requests from a review i was reading a few months back sorry no link
a profiler gives you more detailed information which can help to diagnose and fix perf problems
i ve generally gone with openssl though gnutls is newer perhaps better
however it also breaks pickle maybe not dill and is less dynamic then this approach
i think that as a commenter suggested reflection is the way to go - you can get more than the public ie protected variables but still apparently can t get private ones
i usually use the fall-through switch idiom so that if a user is more than one versioning behind you publish a versioning 3 and a user is still on versioning 1 they will go through all the necessary upgrade sequentially
also if all your classes extends class super it s better to write instead of raw class
the question is a bit wider than serializable deserialization and applies to any situation where some object could be uniquely rebuild from jpa persistent data and vice versa
multiplication is faster division is more accurate
my another question is if i put the data size smaller than mtu into sendto then i can guarantee call sendto once socket only sends one tcp udp packet
you have to make sure your local sql instance is exactly at the same build versioning versioning like the hosting provider otherwise your local sql may upgrade the database structure and you ll be unable to restore it back on the hosting provider or you ll be unable to restore in on your local server if your versioning is earlier than the host s
innodb is transactional so inserts will generally be slower than myisam
i know that sqlite in tests should be fast because it is run in-memory and all that stuff but it is just still much slower than normal postgresql mysql database
note however that doing so means that each encrypted chunk has its own padding and that rsa is much more computationally expensive than aes
in fact nginx can use select instead of epoll if you compile it with the --with-select_module option and i bet it will still be more efficient than apache
note that lxml is probably a better option than beautifulsoup for this kind of task nowadays for the reasons given by beautifulsoup s author
so why while loops is faster than for-loop and why need bunch of lists
then i thought about innodb but then i read that myisam is better with many write operations
also i think typedef is a better choice when you want to define a struct
note that at least in my opinion sscanf and scanf are actually more powerful than cin and cout in a lot of ways-for this kind of parsing specifically and without bringing in external libraries they re almost always my first choice
phpstorm takes a few minutes to synchronize the project and aptana takes even longer to rebulild the project
if you are using a linux mac unix machine most of time i have had to either start from the root folder such as users .....to the source folder or when using a directory that is closer just use in front of it
modulo can also cause a divide-by-zero and it has a higher precedence than addition
managing changes that need to be made across these branches is a lot easier with svn than it was with cvs but it s by no means pain-free
if the hash function is more complex and cryptographically strong md5 or sha1 then it is theoretically not possible
how is aes less secure than rsa in this scenario
you can also use webclient which is much simpler than httpwebrequest but in order to set a cookiecontainer you ll need to derive from webclient and override the protected getwebrequest method
now when clicking a time less than 1 millisecond will be displayed however it obviously takes nearly a second on my computer until the changed color actually is displayed where btw. google-chrome seems to be faster than firefox
for instance strtol is better than atoi and you should be checking each time whether strtok returns null
django is also a wonderful framework but web2py is just better in my limited experience opinion
also if i change all to png is not bigger and alos i am using prawn pdf outputting these images so cant use gif
with requestfactory you pay an up-front startup cost to accommodate more complicated systems than gwt rpc easily supports
or depending on the use case and generally less clear especially if you have more than one exception-handling expected - you don t want to have try-catch imbrications...
ssl the s in https has more states but since it follows a fairly linear progression does not really have any kind of complex diagram
i did a search online comparing myisam and innodb but all of the articles i read judged myisam being faster than innodb on select queries
this type of flexibility is what draws me to bazaar despite the fact that git is wildly more popular and faster
to hide action bar invoke hide method using getsupportactionbar getactionbar in case of minsdkversion is 11 or higher as show below
in ie and firefox fullscreen_block appears closer to the bottom than in safari and google-chrome
using drawimage canvas is much faster than using putimagedata
formally it means division cannot have a complexity worse than multiplication
i could add the dropzone in a ng-include above the area and have it hidden when the template is looking elsewhere but have heard that ng-include uses more processor than ng-view so would prefer to keep it all together
as a note jchart2d is way better than other libraries as jfreechart for real time applications
the atom feed option seems to load faster than the rss one fwiw
i d say the intersect method see answer by dasblinkenlight + any must work better than contains + any
also i have tried the accelerometer sensor and it worked but i m asking to check whether the gyroscope is more accurate to this function or the accelerometer
even though gethashcode itself should be fast it s not mostly faster than equivalent equals
may be because vvcospif it is wrapper under objective-c runtime and converting data structures copying of memory from intel simd - objective-c - swift runtime is slower then tiny cos
the public properties accessor gives you more flexibility in the future
this example is in mstest but mbunit is more or less equivalent
to show it open the command window search for user keymap and select it and then paste this if empty or edit accordingly this is the file format for versioning 0.7.2 upgrade to it before if your versioning is older
using union all is quicker than using union since a distinct check does not need to be done
interestingly quicksort performs more comparisons on average than mergesort - 1.44 n lg n expected for quicksort versus n lg n for mergesort
orientdb looks more fancy and advanced but not as popular as neo4j and is not supported on heroku
redmine is an open source ruby on rails application that supports multiple projects much better than trac and seems to be much easier to administer
now assuming that your inner loops is more complex and the simple for-loop is slower let s look at how much memory we save by avoiding broadcasted data in a parfor with 4 workers and a dataset with 50 million rows for about 760 mb in ram
btw for cron at jobs is better to use absolute directory pathes not relative
for example for small amounts of data an memcpy optimised for large amounts of data may be significantly slower than a strcpy that wasn t optimised for large amounts of data
i ve been using bower info package and npm view package to see which package manager has more versions of numerous packages and have found that bower goes much farther back to older versions of the packages
i m not an expert in the inner workings of mysql but it intuitively feels that retrieving and sorting int fields is faster than chars fields i just get a feeling that a z is more work that 0 1 and seems to feel much more familiar from a computing perspective in which 0s and 1s are the standard on off flags
swing is relatively similar to awt apart from the fact that swing has more capabilities awt is probably the simplest form to start out with and has most if not all of the tools to complete your project hope this helps
i have a larger view with a textview and an imageview inside of it
i noted that while in languages like c variable identifiers can only be alphanumberics and underscores common lisp allows many more characters to be used like and at least scheme does
expression-blend has much more advanced wpf silverlight visual designer than visual studio including wysiwyg animation editor etc
loosely speaking ram is 1000 or more times faster than disk and cpu is faster still
in vb6 at least so i assume it s true in vba replace is faster than concatenation
is implements the rawcomparator that much faster than extends writablecomparator
the bind method really isn t for the repeater it s more for the formview or gridview where you are editing just one item in the list not every item in the list
edit true the file on disk is not larger than ram but the in-memory representation can easily become much larger than available ram
on the server side you re using tcplistener which is nothing more than a socket or tcpclient factory
specifically i m trying to store some information acquired in the for-loop in a different arrays i think there s a more efficient way to do this but we haven t covered more than single-dimensional arrays in class yet so no matter at a parallel index as the current interation
with gtk it s more common to use cairo already mentioned by jeff foster
i need to change my dropdown menu which works well with a mouse but i would like to make it more accessible with keyboard
you can do this by looking into the source code or better with firebug firefox or developer tools ie google-chrome in the network tab
i was exploring around with c regarding strncpy since most people says that it is safer than strcpy additional parameter length to avoid buffer overflows
sorry that this post is more of the and for further information... type than a direct answer which i think has now been given-- i just thought it was helpful not to get things lost inside comments
assuming you are working with 32bit x86 64bit x64 is harder to deal with you would have to either
try this lib that s a good one with the jackson we use only in the server side because jackson is more slow in the android than gson at least in our test
on the project i m using bower to manage dependencies because i found that it has way more available versions than npm does
on second thoughts in your case uicollectionview is surely a better candidate than uitableview
however when i switch from multiplication to addition it looks much better
much nicer than strtotime mktime etc
because disk access is orders of magnitude slower than ram access
i think that eloquera www.eloquera.com is better than db4o and additionally has better licensing
however instead of using two nested for-loop you can use count arrays which is more efficient
there are more than 1000 folder inside this directory which are mainly celebrity name like angelina joulie etc and inside that folder several images are there for that celebrity
java s array .sort is from about java 6 actually timsort the fastest general purpose #sort out there much better than quicksort in many situations
as stated by mark adams iboutlet and ibaction is nothing more than a void typedef and will only be used by compiler
i am a beginner with python and from the hardest way to learn python i know that while loops should be avoided but rewriting to a for-loop is even slower
animation effect works fine for the lower image with firefox and ie-9 browsers whereas google-chrome does not show animation
udp uses datagrams chunks of data which are received whole on the other side unless the size is bigger than the mtu but that s a different story
i think reductio will make this easier but with raw crossfilter this would look something like
this is to demonstrate that you can achieve this without for loops however a simple for-loop is much more readable
google-chrome extensions are considerably more limited than firefox extensions Ã¢ Ã¢ they can only hook the behavior of the browser in certain predefined ways
in safari the background of my menu navigation drop-down menu s is much wider than in google-chrome firefox
so it should have always been gkagent under objective-c in order to be strictly correct however objective-c is less type-safe than swift so you could get away with it with the possibility that you d get an unrecognized selector exception if a gkagent object was ever passed to the delegate method and you assumed it was a gkagent2d
migrate to enterprise linux or freebsd postgres works much better on unix type systems mdash
i want a task or cron job that will scan these folder let s say every 1 00am and delete all folder that is more than 15days old or 15days prior to the date when the folder is created in the directory
svg performance in firefox is slower than in webkit google-chrome and ie10
i have worked pretty heavily with both flavors of the gwt extjs libraries though i ve spent more time with gxt recently
the last fallback is to go the snail way - to mouse over to click on the red close window button but any mouse movements are slower than a keyboard shortcut
this redeclaration allows a cleaner way to access and mutate the property internally without resorting to fragile ivar synthesis which is becoming an antiquity now that the compiler does it for you
the alteration to swap the functionality of the page navigation of divi is done in a file titled frontend-builder-scripts.js found in the divi folder directory includes builder scripts frontend-builder-scripts.js
the difference you notice is very small but i think the multi-thread processors is spending more time because the concurrency for the cpu resources between the threads
in general parfor with matlabpool is an easier combination to use than dfeval
edit for those of you coming later i also learned that like sml in f# the order is specified and deterministic--unlike ocaml which is even more crazy considering how close the two are in syntax
using settimeout for such purposes is better idea than setinterval as you don t have to clear them and they won t get crowded - if your fight takes longer than period then this won t run into next fight
for academic documents you may use restructuredtext or asciidoc which offers more features than markdown
while i am more familiar with mysql than with postgresql i believe it is true for both databases that sub-queries have a negative impact on performance relative to joins
even if you use a lowly for-loop it s much easier to loops over the elements of a list than it is to construct variable names with paste and access the objects with get
but drupal i believe is more powerful than wordpress and joomla
then the buffers won t need to be treated as arrays of pointers and passing arrays of say floats between objective-c ++ and swift is easier
calloc returns tha address of a block of memory initialized to all bits zero which has the same effect as calling memset but is potentially more efficient
because post method storing capacity of response is better than get response
a virtual memory is a concept to work for files bigger than ram by using the pages and swapping with disk and ram
i m creating a coldfusion railo api wrapper for mailchimp s restful services v3.0
i understand that mp3 is much smaller but it has worst audio quality when is compared to wav files
i have created a php form with multiple checkbox and there is a script that controls if the sum sum of all checkbox values is greater than a specific number.if yes a sweetalert box appears.the problem is that when i click the ok button on the sweetalert i want to remove the last checked attribute and to remove that value from the sum to execute the script again and display the right results.i cannot figure this out..any ideas will be helpful
2 second loops is and easier for-loop to read
vb6 vba though a little better than vbscript in general still has many similar issues where for their domain they require much more boiler plate to do simple tasks than what i would like and have seen in other scripting languages
there s also jsdom but cheerio is simpler and comes with jquery-like goodness
but obviously this would render script less usable after google-chrome and opera start supporting unicode 5.2
so i feel that on x86 memcpy is faster than strcpy
in chrome the object.create - getter setter is faster
it seems to be younger than zen-cart and oscommerce
since a 53-bit mantissa is too large to fit in less than four 16-bit registers or two 32-bit registers performing an addition with a 64bit mantissa isn t any slower than using a 53-bit mantissa so using extended-precision math offers faster computation with no downside in a language which supports a proper type to hold temporary results
a heartbeat is by nature a connectionless contrivance so it goes that udp connectionless is more relevant here than tcp connection-oriented
i have installed both cakephp and codeigniter and it seems that codeigniter is much smaller a little less overwhelming and documentation is clearer
as for debian being more stable than ubuntu for using as server it can be true in very rare occasions where the package is very obscure
i d recommend redmine like the other posters as it is more complete than trac
it is possible that the config of your innodb engine is more efficient for your searches than the way you have myisam set up
the net effect is that the backtracking implementations i like that name better than traditional nfa are slightly more expressive than dfa implementations because they can match regexes like which matches three or more word characters repeated twice something that can t be matched by a dfa
swift comparing to objective-c has it s own benefits like swift handles strings more easily swift tuples offer compound variables and also coders don t need to spend time annotating variables with type information and risk making mistakes
rsa is also a better choice than dsa because it has much better breadth of support for signatures still considered secure by nist
you can often get better results by searching vb6 which is almost the exact same thing as vba
however it isn t clear how much the value can be for the standard tumblr api you can t get more than 50 post at a time
the multiplication should perform somewhat better than division
in my experience xlib via mit-shm extension was significantly faster than sdl surfaces not sure i used sdl in the most optimal way though
however if g is guaranteed to have only non-negative weights g is non-positive weights then dijkstra s algorithm could be better choice over bellman-ford
http 2 is even better than spdy and check this article for a use case regarding spdy
from that point the servlet file actually the web server tomcat glassfish jboss etc is behaving more or less like the iis and aspx file
the amfphp library is not only faster than regular post get requests it also allows you to pass php objects into flex objects and flex to php
i ve found pdcurses which is more like the ncurses but it lacks a lot of ncurses libraries
vcpu reg are virtual cpu registers that exist on many processors that have things like multiple cores hyperthreading or other features that enable higher layers to believe that there is more than one cpu present when there isn t -- such as today s x86s
as for me jboss implementation is smaller than the whole glassfish so i m using
or would a tool like typemock be better suited than moq in this case
in firefox it s less noticeable but in google-chrome it s very noticeable
according to my own experience postgresql run much faster than mysql especially handling big tables 1.4 gb lineitem table in my case
if it is true then timsort will always take less comparison than quicksort because on real life data there is some pattern except data is truly random
unfortunately looks like it requires uninstaller and reinstall as the locations seems to have changed drastically from some subsubsub folder off of appdata to something higher up under user directory
but for the example you give it doesn t matter - if it s going to fail it will be in the initial strlen so strncpy doesn t buy you anything in terms of safety and presumbly strncpy is slower as it has to both check bounds and for nul and any difference between memcpy and strcpy isn t worth changing code for speculatively
if they are internal then it s debatable whether it violates ocp or not but the violation of srp is even worse anyway
only one disk read - since the disk is much slower then ram -
another downside of this angle is that querying the updated time of the parent will still give me too many children and is less efficient
udp has a much lower overhead than tcp
also i think you d be better off with setinterval in this situation instead of using an infinite settimeout loop
i have look at similar topics but i just get more confused with how strncpy or printf are not good or you have to have a 0 added at the end or some other detail that makes picking what to do more difficult
uitableview is much more customizable than uipickerview
but as you can see the first versioning is way better not to mention that all php versioning below 5.6 are already outdated - so i d strongly encourage you to upgrade instead
also addition is faster than multiplication and multiplication is faster than division
but as i understand it ntlm disallows the more secure kerberos domain credentials if they re available
mozilla has stated that they plan to deprecate add-on that depend on xul xpcom and xbl. while not all bootstrapped add-on depend on these technologies there is a tendency for for bootstrapped add-on to operate at a lower level than add-on sdk and webextension add-on
as a new newbie programmer i find that making daemons over systemd is much easier than over init.d
the short version is that having concrete base classes makes it easier to accidentally slice off your child object use arrays incorrectly
for the case xcode versioning is lower than ios device s image you can either copy the disk image from other already updated xcode or maybe the internet or upgrade your xcode
yes post is better than get because post data is not usualy logged by a proxy or server but it is not secure
because heapsort is actually slower than quicksort for each n
there are two reasons that i can think of as to why a ram disk is slower
as it stands d3.js is not just better than raphael and processing in many cases but is also a viable replacement for jquery underscore.js and other frameworks
time spent learning a profiling is probably better spent than time writing and debugging micro-benchmarks
you can customize kate and i think you will like it better than gedit
doing things like 1000 successive fgetc is much slower than doing one single fread of 1000 bytes
from what i know a compiled-language such as c++ is much faster than an interpreted-language such as javascript
post is not better than get
for this reason since calloc uses two arguments of type size_t it can allocate bigger blocks than malloc will ever be able to since malloc takes only one argument of type size_t
i tried replacing the gridview with a listview and the scrolling of the listview is much faster
you need to preserve the grades as you go or keep a running min and max which uses less memory but requires more custom code you can get wrong
notice that memcpy is faster than strcpy unless the source string is much smaller than the buffer s size which is rarely the case with ip addesses.
unfortunately qtwebengine has much worse and poorer integration with the rest of qt facilities than qtwebkit
and then all your users are relying on your left right controls no matter whether they re using a mouse or the keyboard which gives you more control over how it looks at each stage
or switch from org.json to something that performs better such as gson or jackson
being queryable the data tables produce faster results with sorting and filtering with their defaultview dataview
when summing an arrays over a specific axis the dedicated arrays method array.sum ax may actually be slower than a for-loop
heapsort has a better big-o than say quicksort yet quicksort performs much better in practice
use genymotion or bluestacks for emulator.these third party android-emulator is better performance as compare to builtin android studio android-emulator
at best it is a computationally expensive hash function like whirlpool that for example is five times slower than md5 and thus allows only a fifth of the number of hash operations in opposite to md5
and if your csv files are stored in more than one directory you will want to pass the folder name as a parameter too
i think that in that case the put verb is more appropriate because post really means i want to create something new
it would be great if someone can point me to a document for some javascript guide for better performance use hide show is faster than insert delete a dom
can be fast or it can be awfully slow even if division is done entirely in hardware if it is done using a div instruction this instruction is about 3 to 4 times slower than a multiplication on modern cpus
in any case if addition is faster than multiplication a better solution might be to use a table and index by it
take a look at the jackson json parser it s faster than the one in android and faster than gson and supports streaming
but lastly unless i m missing something this would be easier with a map or an object used as a dictionary of ids
the whole thing just no longer working after i switching my iphone to airplane mode
qnetworkaccessmanager is higher level than qhttp and qtcpsocket so they have abstracted away the sockets connection state
scapy is a better performer than dpkt
loops recur is faster - it s one of the most efficient constructs in clojure done correctly it should match the speed of an equivalent for-loop in java code
when things get complex an autoresetevent or manualresetevent is usually more sensible as they are less time critical you get through the gate regardless of ordering
a repeater might be a better decision than a gridview as they are friendlier for using custom layouts
either way gitolite is easier to maintain and more up-to-date than gitosis see how do programs like gitolite work
of course two parent can generate more than two children
if i add font-weight bold they get a little bit thicker but still thinner than within safari google-chrome
you could try using c-types with ff which is a regular dll being called by javascript in your add-on this is way better approach that using xpcom because if the interfaces you use in there can change in each ff version indeed you will have to do multiple dlls each for your add-on supported ff versions
i assume the same control in vb.net would be datagridview and i m fairly sure that you can probably make it look better than in vb6 but if you want really good looking ones you might want to look at thirdparty grid controls
but during upgrade setup launches the older versioning setup bootstrapper ui
i have code that does the same thing but the avx version is considerably slower than the sse version
many other antivirus software that works just as well if not better than norton like avg avast and others do allow you to uninstall from the add remove
in its implementation foreach executes a closure over every element in the arrays this is typically more straightforward and transparent alternative to old-fashioned for-loop
there are libraries that allow on-disk data structures comes to mind and another one whose name i can t recall at the moment but disk accesses are orders of magnitude slower than ram
vimeo will always have fewer users than youtube because the user experience is poor for low bitrate users
innodb has better performance than myisam though innodb needs more attention to tuning the configuration innodb supports atomic changes transactions foreign keys and innodb is much more resistant to corrupting data in a crash
mergesort - in general mergesort is consistently faster than quicksort however quicksort is done in place and doesn t require allocating memory unlike mergesort
following the first answer it appears that postgresql is more compliant to sql standard than mysql so it needs a group by clause for each selected column you want to display with your aggregated function
i like the idea of sqlite but i m more comfortable with postgresql mysql even ms access or oracle
i looked at gson metrics and it seems slower than jackson
...but i am not sure which method is better such as gdi or directx nor how i would implement said methods
versioning of php older than 5.6.0 are eol and are no longer receiving any security updates so from one professional to another i would strongly encourage you to upgrade if your versioning is older than 5.6.0
from my experience webrick is slower than mongrel is slower than thin
notepad++ which is often recommended are even more broken than sublimetext 2 which i find to be pretty good actually
also i tried installing pathogen and that worked for some bundles but would not work for perlomni.vim because it was an ftplugin and pathogen was not appending the bundles correctly and after research i saw most people saying vundle was better than pathogen
i know mergesort is better since it is stable and doesn t have n 2 as worst case but i required to implement quicksort
i think it is a few cycles slower than addition but yes division is very slow compared to the others
testng is much friendlier to this paradigm than junit though
on most machines int is faster than short chars so there s not much to think about there
if you are doing physical simulations things like division or square roots are going to be way more expensive than addition
i can convert full string to upper or lower by using toupper or tolower .but how can i do this.hope your help with this.thank you
somehow webkit seems to do better than gecko on the html5 single-page spec scripts and i can t figure out why at this point
finally you might want to look into uicollectionview which provides a lot more visual flexibility than uitableview and can be seen as a sort of generalization of the latter
for some requirements tcp is better for some udp
most attacks involve generating hash for common passwords so for reasonably complicated passwords it becomes harder especially with salt some people use usernames as salt others use randomly generated numbers
also have a look at strncmp which is safer version of strcmp
although since you re already using c++ in your function with cin and cout it s probably better to use std string instead of a char buffer
unfortunately in postgresql select count is often slower than mysql to which it often get s compared to
it should be mentioned that sinon provides many more features for smart stubs spies than jasmine so both can be used together
but when myisam is really better than innodb
according to the answer of the foreach vs for-loop question assuming it s correct for loops on list are a bit more than 2 times cheaper than foreach loops on list and looping on arrays is around 2 times cheaper than looping on list
for example javafx the reason why it is much faster than awt swing ever were is because it contains uses a huge amount of native code
i know you re thinking why did i use awt instead of swing but at the moment i am more comfortable with awt
an xlarge screens is defined as a screens that is significantly larger than a large screens such as a tablet or something larger and may require special care on the application s part to make good use of it though it may rely on resizing by the system to fill the screens
if i have a bunch of fields in a parent class that all need to be inherited by subclassing is it better to have the subclassing nested in the superclass make the fields protected rather than private or use protected accessor
in general the tcp protocol manages the available network bandwidth better than the udp protocol
but for the arrays it is better to use for-loop as shown by alnitak than for-in
the get method is useful for passing a reasonable amount of non sensitive data between pages while the post method has less limitations and is best for more sensitive data
also see i ve replaced mouseout with mouseleave which should work better than mouseout text will not jump up and down
this is little strange to me why if-statement is in this aspect treated worse than for-loop
there s not much to recommend one over the other except that the direct ivar access is slightly faster the properties version creates a temporary array and sends an accessor message to make the new condition create its copy of that array
perhaps the class should be decomposed in other classes or subclassing if in your case inherited is more valuable than composition so every class has a well defined responsibility in the system
speed-wise the above seem to be at least an order of magnitude slower than glibc malloc free on my machine
i had previously used aptana 3 for a couple days and may have come to the conclusion that it is better than dreamweaver at actual html css coding
wxpython is probably easier than pyqt or tkinter i don t want to start a framework war
i recommend using either my own twelvemonkeys imageio plugins supports tiff ico and adds better jpeg support but i guess you could also use apache commons imaging or other library
in my opinion myisam use to be faster than innodb now they are pretty much the same in speed
i ve found that rendering client-side is nice for small controlled internal uses but for anything where you want tight control over the output server-side is more reliable
instead of the conventional read.table i feel fread is a faster function
if this is an issue you could try sd stream diff which doesn t require sorting like comm does nor process substitution like the above examples is orders or magnitude faster than grep -f and supports infinite streams
ntfs filesystems actually supports longer names 32k
on most processors division is slower than multiplication for the same data types
another option is to spend a bit of cash on a 15000 rpm disk or a ssd solid state disk although that ll be slower than a ram disk
are there any studies on whether functional declarative or imperative programming is easier to learn as a first language
jsdom jquery offer complete set of tools but cheerio is much faster
also as an aside objective-c has a foreach loops that is more convenient than manually setting up a for-loop with a counter
i guess i m just surprised that the documentation recommends the approach of querying presumably continually in my case versus keeping a tailable cursor open i would have thought that push would be cheaper than pull
gethashcode should be a lot quicker than equals but doesn t need to be unique
alternatively it can be used over udp which is less hungry than tcp
both systems have large suites of available software packages available freebsd is likely larger and there s a better chance something may have been ported to freebsd over solaris depending on the niche of the package of course
which loops is a better fit do while or a for-loop
the predict function for a glmnet is more than likely just predict.glmnet
engineyard also seems like a great company but i think they hold your hand a little less than heroku
you should try momentjs i think its much better than datejs
a udp stack is considerably simpler than a tcp stack
other hash functions such as sha-1 also have hash collisions although it is much less likely than md5
put another way let s say i start with a new innodb table and insert 20 gb of data assuming that 20 gb incorporates all the excess innodb stuff i realize data stored in innodb is larger than myisam then i delete all data then i insert 10 gb of data
i haven t tried comparing the two but this pypy bug seems to suggest that multiprocessing in pypy is slower than in cpython
i ve found stripes to be really effective and surprisingly lightweight....it aims to be more lightweight than struts
note i recommend using opera - it is much faster than google-chrome as it doesn t have memory leaks and comes with a built-in ad blocker
postgresql will always be a little bit more mature than mysql
i am using installshield 2011 and what i want to do is on an upgrade to install all the files that are equal or greater than then versioning that is already installed
for example do you use keyboard more than mouse
or maybe flip them on my machine sin seems faster than cos
so if you want a entire file of 93mb to be reassembled by transferring fragmented packets over the network such that no packets are dropped then tcp sctp is a better choice
dbcontext is a much more pleasant api than objectcontext
i have searched it in google but most of the articles talk about how to use database cleaner gem with activerecord but none of them clearly specify how to use databasecleaner gem with datamapper
your loops would be cleaner as a for-loop
i added the check for uitapgesturerecognizer in case your class handles more than 1 uigesturerecognizer s and you only want to remove that
however if you must use the same route you could separate them by get and post since post is more common with registration type scenarios anyway
my guess is that in interpreted-language the efficiency benefit in using switch statements is indeed smaller than in compiled-language
this is kind-of the functionality you for instance see but you instantly already see that there it s called at an instance and the fact it requires to extends rather then implements pdostatement has more to do with the c-level implementation functionality of that class
after reading a question related with the performance of sin cos why is std sin and std cos slower than sin and cos
relevant discussion here as well is fb_graph or koala ruby gem better than facebooker2 using the facebook graph
java seeks to find a compromise between a purely compiled-language with no portability and a purely interpreted-language that is significantly slower
it seems npm 3 handles duplicate dependencies much better than old versioning of npm so delete your node_modules folder upgrade to npm 3 and the run npm i again this should solve the problem
i don t need more than 2 localization now english and portuguese but i might need more later so it should be easy to add a translation if my app gets used by an russian site it should be able to send welcome emails in russian and with the name of the site brand that uses my app so i supposse what i want to do is something like a whitelabel product
the jruby runtime alone is already pretty heavy much heavier than mri
instances are created on the stack which is a lot more performant than malloc free calls
canvasjs is more of creating charts using canvas element of html5 and d3.js uses svg
a public field is not worse than a getter setter pair that does nothing except returning the field and assigning to it
nginx is better suited than apache as it is light and single threaded vs apache thread per request in most normal setups
the mismatch between blackbox and module io emission is a legacy api for better integration with verilog ip where the chisel designer has little to no control over the verilog
i ve done a small experiment as will be shown below and it looks like that a while loops is faster than a for-loop in perl
since the namenode is a single-point-of-failure in hdfs it requires a more reliable hardware setup
actually if you would like to retrieve specific task with all its details get request would be more suitable than post
an alternative to using your own mock class they start to build after a while would be to use a mocking framework such as nsubstitute or moq it s more of a learning curve but quicker in the long run
can a nsis section create more than 1 uninstaller
that s because the multiplication oprator has higher precedence than addition
this is actually simpler than using dill pickle as the autowrap module produces and compiles c code by default that can be imported as a c-extension module 1 2
i would like to change it so you can send files however udp does not support this and tcp is slower than tcp
creating an instance of the namedtuple is easier than creating a dictionary
you then could even make a smooth fading from panel1- panel2 using js see here or easier with jquery fadein and fadeout
also it seems like a for-loop is of greater cost to the compiler than a while-loop
assume this plugin config is in a parent pom.xml only maven super pom.xml is higher up in the hierarchy
regarding the padding itÃ¢ s more tricky as cryptojs does not list pkcs#5 as supported and java does not list pkcs7 in fact it lists very little so it might be implementation depended which padding algorithms the aes provider supports but at least nopadding is supported by both java and cryptojs
using printf isn t faster than cout but scanf is a little faster than cin 0.04s + - 0.05
ogg vorbis is better quality per meg than mp3 plus no licensing legal issues
your getter or setter is more than just a trivial assignment
your desired output does not reflect what you have as input if you want to grouping common sublists you can use itertools.groupby considering you want sorted output using a dict and then sorting makes less sense than just creating the grouping from the sorted list using groupby
maybe google-chrome is more lenient when it comes to illegal characters in the url than firefox or something like that
as to why multiplication is faster than division and when the divisor is fixed this is a faster route
i tested orika and it was a lot faster but was slower than dozer with small collections
declarative programming is not always simpler than imperative programming
linkedhashmap is faster for insertion because it wonÃ¢ t have to unnecessarily compare values while inserting like treemap as stated by ejp
it works fine in firefox but in google-chrome it sends more than one requests to servlet and finally there is exception in servlet and it doesn t work
well obviously you created an implementation qabstracttablemodel which has a little bit more specialized interface than qabstractitemmodel
this would explain why in your case mousedown or click are slower than mouseenter which in a touch device happens as soon as you touch the element being monitored
tried comboboxes with qsqlquerymodel without threading to improve performance but experienced it works much slower than qstandarditemmodel in our project qsqlquerymodel works very fast with such amount of data with qtreeview for example
you would like reading this post too as whenever you start comparing you might understand better difference between hashmap linkedhashmap and treemap
any decent libc will have an efficient strlen that s much faster than looping a byte at a time so separate vectorized strlen and toupper loops are faster
post requests are no safer than restful requests which are no safer than get requests
django turbo gears web2py which is better for what
repeater is more light than datalist as datalist creates the view by creating a table whereas repeater doesn t
a boolean would most likely not yield better performance than int since the excel formula engine is dynamically typed
then i tried the metaphone function and it worked far better than soundex
any idea why in google-chrome it is looking fine but in firefox the margin-top is slightly higher and in ie it is even higher than firefox and google-chrome
if you need to run all 3 in 1 click then you are better off with maven ant or something similar that has a good integration with eclipse
if making a tcp connection is analogous to making telephone call then sending a udp packet is more like mailing a letter
postgresql requires more tuning than mysql to achieve optimal performance
the vm mentioned in here is not like in vmware or virtualbox it is more like java virtual machine jvm as well as python and ruby
to my mind a for-loop is simpler to understand than traversing the list backwards with a while loops
i ve got arr in front of a client s ssrs setup right now no difficulties reported and it s 100 modern iis rather than legacy nlb which is less flexible when it comes to web-centric activities
as compilation is mostly reading small files i wonder if buying a fast usb key to work on can speed up compilation time compared to a standard sata drive and with a lower price than an ssd drive 16gb keys are 30
at home w ubuntu linux virtualbox is easier to maintain performs as well as i require and is free
general consensus including the php docs is that metaphone is much more accurate than soundex when dealing with the english language
interpreted-language are inherently less performant than compiled-language - c will generally outperform python - some operations more than others
in my experience avassetexportsession is slightly more performant than using avassetreader and avassetwriter for a straight forward format a - format b type conversion however that said it s probably not by enough to be too concerned about
troubleshooting the build maven is less reliable than ant especially the non-core plugins
using completionhandler -based methods of nsurlsession is much easier
but it s a lot less powerful than vim emacs
this is tied to the framework although i don t know any language where a property has more than one getter or setter
edit i can only reproduce this error when i have a tabcontrol with more than one tabitem
graph beeing cut in google-chrome is a known issue google-chrome does not respect some print css and works much better with firefox not all versions still
while tcl syntax looks more related to shell syntax like bash or tcsh tcl is actually more closely related to perl or php or ruby
i m sure there s a work around to use get for emails but the alternative post is much more easier and doesn t require any hacks to get around
within your for-loop the statement command.parameters.addwithvalue is potentially adding to the command additional parameter but no two parameters can have the same value so if your loops is executed more than once you ll get the error you received
so when i see that the salt is stored in the hash password and that you use that hash password as salt i think crypt + salt is not more secure against a brute force on output hackers who managed to steal hash passwords
libstdc++ does this a lot more than libc++ and the former is the default library for llvm-g++ gcc llvm the latter for clang apple llvm which means a lot of errors will seem to go away when you switch to gcc llvm or just stick with apple llvm and switch your library but your code is still wrong
what i found is that if i build the app using xcode 4.2 base sdk 5.0 deployment target ios 4.0 the size of the text in my uilabel and uitextview renders smaller by maybe 3 points or so
another reason is that mergesort needs more memory because it s hard to implement it as an in-place sort
if your client connections are more or less permanent and not too many clients are connected at the same time tcp is only slightly worse than udp
post method are generally consume more secure than get because when we use get method than it can display the data in url bar.if the data is more sensitive data like password then it can be inggeris
if you want to compare you re better off putting your result through getstring and compare the much less secure hash even less secure than md5 already is
still while it might be better than multiplying by say 17 16+1 or 12 8+4 as they only add in a couple bit-shifted copies of the original value instead of five it s a very weak hash compared to hash functions that do more than a single running multiplication and i ll illustrate that using some statistical analysis.
i d recommend agda as the better vehicle for getting to grips with the ideas behind dependently typed programming but idris is the more practical option
which one is faster is indeed a cpu-specific issue or at least how much faster is cpu specific yes division is typically seen as slower than multiplication
so if you working with only in-memory data collection ienumerable is a good choice but if you want to query data collection which is connected with database iqueryable is a better choice as it reduces network traffic and uses the power of sql language
it was introduced since the nat traversal for tcp is much more complicated than udp
keep in mind though that jackson is a larger library than gson so depending on your case you might prefer gson to avoid 65k methods limitation
i read somewhere that safari has more stringent requirements on cross domain scripting - it and google-chrome share the same code base
and for rest if you need more than the webclient webrequest
i think from my tests perhaps firefox has more strict standards than google-chrome about cookie manipulation
but i haven t yet figured out whether it s me writing sloppy code with firefox perhaps being more forgiving than safari or if it s safari or if it s jquery
if you actually need dao s this is something that comes out-of-the-box in appfuse and put partly in spring roo but there is also a great addon for spring roo hades addon that does a great job at this maybe even better than appfuse
you may want to use the rabin hash which is faster and more collision resilient than cryptographic hash such as md5 sha1 et al
but with the udp protocol in particular this is easier than for tcp
innodb would be a better choice than myisam for a high-write table
i too had a similar requirement initially i used uilabel and then i realized that uitextview is better
it would be slightly more sensible to bind the click to an element closer to the form and if you use getelementbyid rather than getelementsbytagname it s more simple since you don t have to worry about the index of the number you re binding to
datatables has better customizations as far as clientside bells and whistles where as jqgrid is a little harder to make look as pretty but can do some pretty good serverside interaction from what i understand
note that doing this will get the values via post var instead get wich makes more sense since you are sending via post your form
the for-loop is faster than the foreach-loop if the arrays must only be
since loosing some packets doesn t matter but speed latency is crucial udp is much better than tcp
in addition the need for polyfills for mathml complicates matters further as they may handle the interaction differently as can be seen in the sample below when using the button to load mathjax
and between we are just looking to send and receive data over tunnel there is nothing more or need to control computer on the network all we need is to route data through corporate firewall and should support multiple vpn servers such as cisco microsoft etc
Ã¢ sortedlist uses less memory than sorteddictionary
i have used it and the api is cumbersome and the performance is overall lower than eigen and armadillo
innodb is much much stricter than myisam
in case if updatepanel takes more time to process set asyncpostbacktimeout property of your scriptmanager
you can use array.prototype.find method to check if the element exists in arrays which is much better than perform a traditional for-loop
even if jboss is the better product in my next project i will shift to glassfish because of the better documentation
you had a better chance with kohana 2.3.4 as it was derived from codeigniter and was similar
usually in ajax get method is faster as it doesn t involve proccessing post fields and as you are only getting information i would stick it
if you decide to use a language that s larger and messier than scheme try common lisp
if the most-recent versioning is lower than the running app versioning run your upgrade and bump the versioning
i wanted to know that what makes spi faster than i2c
yes i understand that ienumerable is much more lighter rather than ilist but anyway there is a lot situations where we need to have ilist instead of ienumerable and in this approach we need to cast ienumerable to ilist isn t it
that means private is better than protected protected is better than public etc ..
that is if you have then you are guaranteed that a happens before b and that b happens before c regardless of the fact that a is involved in an addition which is lower precedence than a multiplication
-- in which scenario configuration would i get udp to perform better than tcp
pygobject is nothing more than a thin layer of glue making gobject gio .
i have to use a while loops for this project i know a for-loop is probably easier but just the way this has to be done
the underlying websocket technology is bidirectional more info here but pusher s pub sub model is unidirectional
that way quicksort can reach recursive base case more quicker than mergesort
note that there are exceptions to the above - for example tcp generally traverses firewalls better than udp which may be blocked due to security to traffic policy reasons so voip speech may sometimes be sent over tcp for part of its journey at least
i aways heart that nginx performs better than apache server
division is much more expensive than multiplication
namedtuple have a lower overhead than dictionary since the duplicate keys don t have to be stored per item but have the convenience of named access
loops in c++ are most basic than python the for-loop is more simpler it is based on the three expression initializer expression loops test expression and the counting expression
the problem is that i ve now accumulated a bunch of backup folder in each project directory which makes it harder to find the specific change i was looking for
but the text turns out to be much bigger under firefox compared to that under google-chrome
generally i know it sounds banal xslt is better at transformation generating a new document from each source document while xquery is better at query extracting a small amount of information from each source document
this is analogous to the way you can compute exponent using successive squaring much faster than by repeated multiplication
innodb uses row level locking while myisam can only use table level locking that is why innodb has crash revovery is better than myisam
but in my include directory there is also a opencv2 folder which has more subfolders and in general more files
in gaming especially fpss udp tends to be the chosen protocol because it s much less chatty than tcp
gson is more about json-based persistence in the vein of xstream which can do json too and sounds a bit too heavyweight for just an applet
as luiggi mendoza commented splitting by s+ instead of would resolve any issue with the number being delimiter by more than one spaces
umd is even better supported since it is compatible with commonjs and amd so that would be a safer bet
this isn t entirely scientific but if i set .browser.safari false in safari or google-chrome then .scrollto no longer works on any element with any parameters
or if the arrays is a straight numerically indexed one you can use a for-loop which is more efficient
from reading other so questions such as this or this gives the impression that memcpy should work faster than memmove and intuitively this should be so
might be better off with i2c or spi like people have suggested here
the first question is qtablewidget or qtableview which is more suitable for this job
carnigorm and puremvc are good choices but my personal opinion is that robotlegs is far easier to work with
a tooltip has more in common with a popover but they are generally regarded as a popup historically
udp has less overhead than tcp and is therefore faster
i believe the reasoning behind it is that it allows the parameters to be named nicer by preventing shadowing of member variables
fortunately ecto 2.1 has a better alternative since it s supports the built-in calendrical types from elixir 1.3
another side note single-quotes inside xpath string looks a bit tidier than escaped double-quotes imo
also innodb is slower than myisam unless myisam is blocking for a huge select
we inline the call instead inlining is way better than tail calling and opens the door to many more optimizations
marcus yes memmove is faster than strcpy and faster than python but why
i have more than 20+ textview and imageview in my activity like this
i d like to add that couchbase is a faster and more scalable option than couchdb the 2.0 version introduces views at a high level it s a distributed memcached membase server merged with couchdb but of course more sophisticated than just mashing them together
json-rpc is more pythonic than xml-rpc or shudder soap
if memory serves this is the same technique slide rules used although they also took advantage of with the idea being that addition is easier than multiplication but my exposure to slide rules is limited to an eccentric high school physics teacher and a cryptographic teacher using it to explain certain tricks with big number math
it seems like you re a little confused about what a subclassing and by extension inherited symbolizes instead of thinking that a subclassing belongs to its parent class pretend that a subclassing is a more specific version of its parent class
rather than editing batch files which you may have to do for other rubygems bundler it s probably better to do this once and do it properly
if you have access to lodash or underscore.js it is even easier with pluck
here is one more idea with dplyr and tidyr
using the hash value with a salt is much safer if someone breaks into your db no password is there
scala does not provide an alternative and any alternative that was provided would likely be less reliable as typesafe does not have the resources that sun oracle ibm etc
you might have better luck with a uicollectionview instead of a uitableview
mysql mariadb is slightly worse than postgresql
ftp protocol is more complex than http or telnet form example
note if you are constantly adding removing items from existingholdings then you could use sorteddictionary which should be faster sortedlist is faster for accessing elements but takes longer adding removing
your use cases are actually much easier than the skip-lists algorithmically because you avoid most needs for varlength paths by keeping the tail to queue cards to the end directly
but as that reference points out murmurhash is way faster than md5 and sha functions although it doesn t do a direct comparison to the object.gethashcode method i mentioned above
chqrlie has pointed out in the comments that this method could also lead to erroneous comparisons for extremely close dates fractions of a second since if difftime mktime date_1 mktime date_2 is less than 1 in magnitude the value will be converted to 0 upon return thus comparing as equal
i am not concerned about the fact that firefox runs faster as browser js implementations will vary so much as the wide spread of results encountered in google-chrome that makes getting an accurate result impossible
then we can simply use foreach for javascript arrays .its a simplest than for loop..but as per the research for-loop is faster than foreach ..this is one of the good explanation for that
though i was thinking the addition is more simple than multiplication
use hash and choose hashing algorithm that suits you well if possible something stronger than md5 but don t go all the way to sha512 either
as a note and for a shorter code using the css display none and jquery show milliseconds and hide milliseconds is quicker you can even animate it by using time like this
i think you should use gitkraken it will be better than smartgit on ubuntu
get is more appropriate than post for queries because of its safe semantics
a variation that uses settimeout rather than setinterval and uses the more cross-browser secure document.location.reload true
one reason to use rar it is sooooo much better than zip
this in turn means that a generic for-loop is worse than a range-based for-loop for auto i v for the compiler because in the latter case the compiler simply knows that you are going to iterate over the whole range and not go outside of it or break out of loops or something while in the generic for-loop case specially if your code is more complex the compiler cannot be sure of this and has to insert extra checks and tests to make sure the code executes as the c++ standard says it should
with a salt md5 is much more secure than without but you re better off using one of the sha hash such as sha256managed
eclipse ocl provides a much stronger ui and an ocl2java code generator so that ocl embedded in ecore uml provides much more acceptable executable code
if we assume that you live in a poor coverage area and your phone and your tower are constantly dropping the signal then re-establishing a spdy connection is no worse off than re-establishing a tcp connection modulo ssl handshake
i am checking it in firefox and google-chrome and see that in google-chrome spacing between letter is larger than in firefox
generaly get is shorter than post
for floats and double it s more difficult as with plain int as these may or not may be in the host machines byte-order
multithreading is faster takes up less resources there is no separate namespace for it and you can run them 4 times more than the fork but multithreading requires build php with non-zts some extensions do not work with non-zts and requires something you would understand pthreads model
at the bottom there s a partial code of a form i m trying to build it has only the upper gridview and details view for now but you can see my problem in the screenshot i took the erased row has personal data the gridview and the detailsview drops lower then the second centered subtitle
when writing code in jscript as i am wont to do as i have never been a fan of asp.net and jscript is infinitely more elegant than vbscript you can call upon the arguments collection
a better bet might be to install spim and to learn mips assembly which is more straightforward than x86 anyways
it s true that the yosemite compatibility exists but i ve found that earlier mac machines does not have the propper hardware and you experience some lacks in memory and graphics when upgrading more than one osx
ostream is more general subclasses support writing to different places ostringstream is a specific one writing to a string
powermockito is an extension of other mocking frameworks like mockito or easymock that comes with more powerful capabilities
after a lot of googling i ve found that most sources say that the dijkstra algorithm is more efficient than the bellman-ford algorithm
rythm is a high performance 2 to 3 times faster than velocity pure java template which use razor like syntax
the good news is that dexterity content types are more lightweight than archetypes content types and doing raw listing by iterating over folder.contentitems in your template should not be that expensive
for a low traffic site the huge tokens that kerberos send across the network actually makes it slower than ntlm
fgets or fgetc is a better approach
sortedlist uses less memory than sorteddictionary
parallelizing mergesort is simpler than quicksort in-place
bottle is rather faster than flask
if you want to support better than just addition and subtraction you could do it as an eval if you are careful about how data gets into #number
you may want to look at turbogears which is built on top of pylons and has more out of the box things for you to use
the code could probably be improved a bit by preventing expected being incremented with negative int values coming from random.nextint 1024 by using random.nextint 1024 instead of random.nextint 1024 but i assume no one ever ran into issues because no one uses a shutdown command longer than 1024 chars
gcc supports built-in __int128_t and __uint128_t types on 64bit platforms but it looks like formatting support for 128bit integers is less common in libc
because you can determine what code in a compiled-language is likely to do better than a dynamic-languages it has been determined more error free to use a compiled perspective for more things so as you can see with the availability of offset-management and lookup compiled behavior given to you in core perl there is no reason to mess with the symbol table if you don t have to
the nltk library includes a confusion matrix that is simple to use and produces a nicer output than scikit-learn
i would say pure actionscript is better for programming whether you use flash ide or flex ide is not that relevant and mxml is better for non-programmers to combine the components programmed in as
i was just going to say radix sort however that could be a bit above what you were looking to implement introsort is generally the accepted sorting solution for data it s a variation of quicksort that switches to heapsort when it reaches smaller sets as it s faster on smaller sets than quicksort
in usual programming practice one wouldn t bother and simply multiplying by the floating-point representation of 180 Ã¯ because multiplication is so much faster than division
for my project packery is better then masonry because packery is filling up all gaps masonry is just looking for the first possible gap and doesn t fill empty gaps
yes some functionality possible only on device but you can try also bluestacks app player which has more possibilities than android-emulator
i think the listview is better than gridview in this situation
note i am looking for a more elegant way than strsplit or substr
that s obviously quite a bit more than the 16-bit that s mandated for an int but equally obviously less than the 64bit mandated for a long long
similar to pmg s solution but still faster because multiplication is faster than division -
if what you are making is a map from one word to another you might be better off with a dictionary
note that if the arrays are not chars int the optimization does occur and data_p is fetched only once because chars can alias anything but int is more limited
skip-lists isn t any more difficult to implement than a self-balancing binary tree and gives much better performance in some situations
the reason udp is faster than tcp is because there is no form of flow control or error correction
even though i liked many design aspects of swt and it is simpler than swing imo swing is the one to learn because imo it has far far better documentation examples etc
i do not know any good signal processing libraries in .net but emgucv opencv is wrapper around opencv which can do advanced signal processing
if you use map_shared | map_noreserve you can use a memory map much larger than available ram + swap -- but if you run out of disk space or quota your process will receive and die from a sigbus signal.
for example quicksort average cost t n.log n and heapsort average cost t n.log n are both sorting algorithms with the same average cost - yet quicksort is typically much faster than heapsort
all of the object files are dumped into the output directory and the executable is placed in a different folder that is kept cleaner
using this hint we can try to guess that a fixmap must correspond to a dictionary data type in c# since a map is more or less like a dictionary of key-value pairs
so i ve started learning swift because it looks way better than objective-c
make the excludes annotation more legibile by sorting the different parameters into different grouping
i understand that ram is typically thousands of times faster than disk but i o speed is not the only code running
post data isn t inherently more secure than get data
in general encapsulation of fields by getter and setter leaves more flexibility for changes
although you could tell dancer2 plugin passphrase to use a 4-byte salt it s much easier to just use crypt saltedhash everywhere
following my comment on your original post here s some more information that will help you get through this
even in your original post the subclassing is actually more restrictive than the superclass so doing something like
they are for example too big in a phone and too small in a tableth because the screens of tablet has more centimeter than the pone screens
i have noticed that ef is slower than linq2sql massive petapoco ado.net and possibly nhibernate
switching to 2.2 framework which has better compatability with screens resolutions and densities
for your first problem make sure that both the classes are in the same package and the members are declared either public not recommended or protected better or don t specify any access specifier which is a bit more restrictive than protected
i have a simple parent has_many children relationship and i m trying to get all parent that have less than n children
i can t say whether toupper or tolower is faster though
in other words calloc is no more type-wise than memset
i admit that gin index on hstore is much more expensive than its equivalent for jsonb but even then it is faster to just do seq scan on hstore than use index on jsonb
you can also look into strtol which is better than using atoi in terms of error checking
or it can be disambiguated by type inference unification is a more appropriate term or an explicit type signature like thilo said in their comment
granted iisexpress is much better than cassini but if there is no reason to not use full iis then i conitnue to advocate it s use
the question is is mysql somehow more resistant than postgresql to sql injection attack under the perl dbi and why might this be the case
rsa is not ment for bulk encryption as it s quit slow compared to symmetric algorithms like aes it s more than a factor of 1000 slower
d3.js is much harder to learn than raphael but in both cases you will also have to learn svg to be able to create better animations
the other way round returning a subclassing that is a more specific class does not break the contract because the subclassing has at least the same functionality as the superclass
note that there s much more than llvm and clang these compilers also rely on c++ standard libraries both have libc++ libc++abi mostly unchanged pnacl used to support libstdc++ c standard libraries both have musl pnacl also has newlib bionic some form of glibc compiler runtime compiler-rt linker and general user libraries such as sdl part of emscripten and for pnacl in webports
nvidia is more permissive for example nvidia lets you cast wrongly ie float4 to float only making it a warning ati won t error
as disk i o is orders of magnitude slower than ram i o this can cause a very significant difference in query execution times
you would allow post get post is more secure to the php file and would then run an http post get request from c#
i was going through internet and so and understood that web sockets are encapsulations to tcp which by itself is slower than udp ofcourse at the cost of reliability but i couldnt find much info if websockets or udp would be ideal to implement such a server
while mysql is more famous for serious enterprise-quality database where preserving your data is critical i recommend postgresql
using a hash or similar to detect if the transmission was decrypted having a salt hash makes it harder not impossible to change or forge message contents
a filesystems such as xfs is more suitable for this
so both can use quic instead of tcp and it s usually faster than tcp hence the name which sounds like quick and is an acronym of quick udp internet connections
a directory or folder is nothing more than a location on a disk used for storing information about files
as you can see the program is much quicker under pypy than cpython which is why i moved to it in the first place but at the cost of a 10-fold increase in memory
if you don t already know vb6 there s little point in learning it now - your time could be put to much better use by learning vb.net c#
if you use linq using max min method is a better way than sorting
this makes for example javassist or proxetta significantly slower than cglib which simply reads the methods via the reflection api and overrides them
the specification of atom feed offers more value than the rss one with internationalization content types and other things and every modern feed reader supports it
secondly the haskell ffi is more powerful that is it does more with less code than ocaml s and more libraries are avaliable via hackage so i don t think foreign interfaces will be a deciding factor
if you are happy with this sequence of permutation there is little more to do
i m new to nginx and want to try it out since it apparently is much faster and less resource-hungry than apache but i can t see why this would be such a hard thing to achieve
wav files are about 3 times larger than mp3 files so it would need 1.8gb additional space to do the conversion
wondering mainly if svn uses less disk space or more than the same in cvs
i ve seen mention that it is two orders of magnitude slower than host malloc and free
so now i just want to forget this virtual directory system and make the solution explorer to be nothing more than a folder tree as it is in real just like a windows explorer
early this month i started learning swift as i found it fun and easier than objective-c
if you want only very coarse parallelism at best and you intend to stick with mostly functional structures then pick based on something else like syntax i think haskell is much nicer here but that s subjective or available libraries haskell wins on quantity availability but ocaml might edge it out in the graphics department nonetheless
a get post is easier in that regard
the only thing i can suggest is that you use ppm format which is even easier than bmp for you to read from
first off get is no less secure than post
the superclass has a more stringent constraint on a property content blank false than the subclassing content nullable true and i am using tableperhierarchy false
it should be in my opinion more strongly noted that password hashing with salt is no longer secure and should not be used as others noted use pbkdf2 or bcrypt
sqoop 1 is older fully functional and mature project supporting hadoop 0.20 1.x 0.23 and 2.0.x you can download the bits from here
i am working on udp socket programming and i have to stop the transmission in application if requested data is more than mtu value
i think it can be better to do form submission through javascript so on submit function can be controlled more wisely to kill popup on more than one submit click....am i right if yes plz guide this way
i ve considered that udp is more suitable for sending a series of discrete data sets but i need the reliability of tcp
xcb is lower level than xlib and allows you to minimise the number of round-trips to the x server leading to lower latency
this garentees that while a can be issued to the pipeline every cycle it will have a higher latency than an add subtract circuit
does anyone know of a jquery plugin that would stack elements like masonry or isotope and displays bigger smaller elements based on importance
i find cobertura and emma to be largely interchangeable in terms of coverage checking just that cobertura has a better maven plugin and emma has a better eclipse plugin in my opinion
see the referred post for an example that reads a single file in parallel with fileinputstream which should be significantly faster than using bufferedreader according to these benchmarks
the various alternatives calloc realloc work roughly the same way calloc is easier to use when dealing with arrays and zero-fills the data while realloc is useful when you need to resize a block of memory
nevertheless i would recommend sticking to the queryover versioning it s much more intuitive and you avoid magic strings especially that you don t have to upgrade the nh versioning
spi is not less limited than i2c in this case
i ve seen plenty of questions asking whether quicksort or mergesort is better and when to use each of them but what i d like to see is some input on when to use them with regard to the size of the data being sorted
i ll add that if this is the first time you use bsearch and qsort it s better you look at the samples you can find around
in terms of performance py4j has a bigger overhead than both of the previous solutions jython and jpype because it relies on sockets but if performance is critical to your application accessing java objects from python programs might not be the best idea
the most interesting thing i noted is that certain test combos in firefox are much quicker than even google-chrome
if you need more than integer accuracy but want to avoid floating-point consider using fixed-point arithmetic instead
also it looks like when i transcode webm to mp4 2.7 is 30 faster than webm
i need to prove that git is better than cvs and svn to my team.the only thing git lack is a standard server
the flex compiler shell fcsh compiles code faster than mxmlc and compc by keeping all the partial build objects in memory
since mantis is a bit more complete than bugzilla when it comes to features you could define separate issues with custom field for your tasks
postgresql specifically has gotten easier to manage while mysql has lost some of the simplicity that gave it an advantage without picking up enough features that really matter
any suggestions on how to manage the android actionbar in phonegap - i ve seen some other similar questions but generally asking how to show it seems like getting it to hide is less popular
no more caching by google-chrome or opera
i ve found that using a simple for-loop iterating over all elements in the string and comparing using charat performs faster than indexof or regex
something like textolution s proprietary add-on for firebird looks like it could accommodate constructing single complex nested query that would apply both regular and fulltext criteria but dbisam does it more elegantly
on linux google-chrome displays text about one pixel higher than firefox and opera
a uicollectionview works very similar to a uitableview but gives you more control over how the cells should be displayed and aligned
also the for-loop is more readable than the while loops because it puts all loops variable manipulation in one place
for some reason when the duration of touchesbegan is greater than the duration of touchesmoved my player will complete the touchesmoved actions first even though touchesbegan had to come first and then jump to a different x-position and then move with duration 4 to complete the touchesbegan
a i tried gdi-compatible direct2d using id2d1dcrendertarget+binddc but it is much slower than pure gdi
using iequalitycomparer which is better because works without altering initial idictionary signature
for this reason i deployed a 2 cores 4gb ram and more than enough disk to run through the getting started example of the enterprise integrator
ultimately the check point is do not use more than one for-loop and never use the while loops
edit it seems junit has more printed books as references compared to testng on amazon
if directory folder atob has more than 1 item aaa.xyz let prune other folder file in same way
mysql is more than capable of serving your needs as well as alex s suggestion of postgresql
so what this says is that provided your subclassing doesn t have any more values than the superclass used to determine ordering implementing is reasonable
also when you open a matlabpool the workers are launched and ready so the overhead of parfor is much less but still not zero as the body of the loop needs to be sent to the workers
i suggest using a template engine such as freemarker for this or velocity but freemarker is better imo
maven is definitely better than ant and well used for big projects
it usually performs better than lzf or lzo
but the research i ve done so far all points to multiplication being faster than division
you cannot directly use an expandablelistview for the spinner popup any more than you can directly use a listview for the spinner popup
i think d3.js looks so much better than leaflet but for quick zooming panning functionality my first question is is this better off in leaflet or can d3.js handle slick zoom pan even though it s not tile-based
cfstring has some slightly better functionality than nsstring but is a bit harder to use
edit the proposal by jens from the comments using the min max is probably more what you re looking for if you re not interested in complete ordering of your values
enthought-dev is chaco faster than matplotlib
that is actually not the case with rsa which is --- more so than aes --- just a math equation
it is even slower since i could only upload wav which is way bigger in size compared with ogg and opus
in the compareto method you can then write the code which will call the getters for the year month and so on until it figures out whether the current object is less than equals to or greater than the object o being passed into the compareto method
it looks like google-chrome is smaller in your screenshot there so firefox could just not be at the defined break-point yet
in your viewdidload on the second view or viewwillappear is probably better set the background image to the image you put in the property
however it is better to do this on the php side and work more securely with post instead of get
so after googling this i found that using gyroscope sensor is more accurate than the accelerometer
multiplication takes less time then division so you can try this
is the foreach loops slower than the for-loop
obviously google-chrome is more persnickety whereas firefox defaults to moving and sizing the printout as necessary
for security http vs https is more important than post vs get
also consider using uilabel instead of uitextview if you don t need to edit information inside since uitextview take longer to allocate and init and are generally slower than uilabel
with firefox it was very easy i just grabbed the apk from their ftp server run the adb install command one would think it should be even easier with google-chrome but it s really not
hardware-specific optimizations makes the code even more complex such as sse avx optimizations for x86 x64
i d like to know what is the difference between heroku and openshift for now i m going to use the free package for my blog i ve noticed the openshift has more supported techs
well we typically don t do too well reading binary and hex is a better substitute for that
so in my practice using war app easier than jar to manage and re-configure
this one is more promising than revmob because banner positioning and event callbacks appear to be possible but due to marmalade and cocos2d-x s gl conflicts this might turn out to be just as bad a solution as iwgameads
i m more familiar with mate than cairngorm but what i do in this situation is to back up my pop up with a model and dispatch the events off of the model
much better than opera firefox and google-chrome
modulo is a bit weird for floating point - it returns negative for negative so you still have to have a branch and it involves a division which is slower on some machines as in i ve not found a machine where is significantly less expensive than going round a loop with a couple of subtractions two or three times
does this make ant more complex than maven
generally i noted that jstl sql taglib is much slower than java code because it put all the result set into an hashmap
i want to have another textview underneath these two but i am having a problem when the textview length is less than the imageview
i wrote a plug-in a short while ago that will handle text input much better than keypress keyup and keydown events
rm -rf directory also works faster for billion of files in one folder
it takes longer than google-chrome or safari to load but it does load successfully
you can parse it like what you are using or you can do the same with more less code and more performance by using gson as described in this answer or you can use jackson as described here
scaleing the underlying application server tomcat glassfish jboss ... seems nicer but currently i only found redhats openshift for doing this
libxml2 libxslt also come with their own much lower-level python bindings but lxml is much more straightforward and pythonic and it seems to have great performance as well
but if you will look at the accuracy level stanford-nlp have more accurate detection than opennlp
https is more flexible than ssl an application can configure the level of security it needs
these formats allow various data compression codecs note that snappy is now much more popular than lzo and can also provide other benefits such as fast serializable deserialization column pruning and bundled metadata
sctp mapped over udp ipv4 allows more private hosts per public address but udp mappings in ipv4 nat gateways are notoriously tricky to establish and keep maintained due to the fact that udp is a connectionless transport without any explicit state for a nat to track
the genisoimage man page suggests using -r or -r which has better defaults for ownership in addition since the rock ridge standard supports 255 byte file names and folder depths greater than 8 directory and is a real standard unlike joliet
although this is much faster than explode without the limit it is not as fast as the substr solution suggested by the user set sail media
if you need to load from a well-defined filesystems fat or ntfs this is more tricky you have only 450 bytes of space because 60 of the 512 bytes are used by the filesystems internally for code that interprets the data of the filesystems finds the file containing the code and loads it into memory
note there are many more differences between zsh and bash
as you can see from the above tests realloc is consistently faster compared to memalloc memcpy and free
avoids n calls to malloc free it s faster and simpler to allocate deallocate
the above assumes you are in the same folder as your docker-compose.yml and the directory is all lower case characters
a ng-app can have more than 1 ng-controller
raphael is very much similar to d3.js but is more on thd lines of a graphics library and the added advantage of compatibility with internet explorer 6 through 8 using vml instead of svg.
here ajax form breaks after adding html5 attributes in google-chrome safari is a better description and workaround
as a general rule udp is faster than tcp due to less protocol overhead
mit scheme is known for strong interactivitiy support while plt racket feels much more static
in your example i would suggest to use rbac rather than acl because rbac is more flexible for enhancements and maintenance which will be always in system like university management system
either way applying gain and or attenuation to time-domain sample data as in a wav file is much easier than trying to apply these effects to frequency-domain data as in an mp3 file
just one tip if only job for the http server will be just proxying the play apps consider using some lighter option than apache for an example nginx or lighttpd you ll find sample configurations for all of them in play s documentation
instead of dropbox i could use key value store as rest web service which i want to do later but have no time for this for now in my opinion my solution is more reliable than icloud and which is very important i have full control on how itÃ¢ s working mainly because itÃ¢ s my own code
now if you free some values on the heap and allocate more with malloc you may be given back some of that dirtied memory that you scribbed on earlier
however post data are not much safer than get data anyway
alter how i am joining the tables together so that the sorting of the results for the grouping by is more efficient and then hopefully remove the tmp table as well
if it is useful to you you are more than welcome to it note i m more familiar with vb6 vba than vb.net so this udf is more in the vba style but still works in vb.net
there are simple examples 1 2 for intercepting get requests in the documentation for http-on-modify-request however intercepting post requests is more complicated
since clicking the mouse is significantly more difficult for me than typing i was wanting to make a simple program that would just run in the background and click the mouse for me any time i press a specific key on the keyboard
otherwise there is still the possibility to change a public access to a protected or package private access which will be much more restrictive than public
notice also the the cpu cache is much more important than processors registers today
bitwise operations are usually significantly faster than multiplication and division operations
there is no way that you can detect if the user entered more than a chars by scanning a character.you ll have to use an int .since all your case s consist of numbers you re in luck
i know maven is more powerful than ant
the advantage here is this membership provider uses pbkdf2 to derive the hash which is more resistant to brute force attacks given the number of rounds
moreover this even used to apply to all integral types larger than chars until one of the tcs for c99 standard finally required all-bits-zero pattern to be a valid object representation for int zeros of all types on all c platforms.
with current hardware at about twice the number of active threads as execution units cores ht logical processors however the architecture handles multithreaded execution your cpu starts spending more time scheduling thread execution and managing thread states than it is actually executing the threaded instructions
the haskell zipwith is friendlier than the ocaml list.map2 which requires the lists to be the same length
dialog makes it easier for you to create a pop-up window with customized contents
for-each loops is an iterable form of ordinary for-loop which is a better built data structure
secondly i did not use ienumerable because it is more generic than icollection and does not even have simple properties like count
so it seems like the opposite - mri 2.3 gets 2-5x slower than jruby 9.1
furthermore protected is actually closer to public than to private
but whether or not your use an anonymous class is orthogonal to the question of whether implements runnable or extends thread is the better mechanism to define your thread task
readability is a big reason for functions using recursion rather than loops makes them easier to follow and for using the iteration methods where possible map to transform an arrays values-by-value rather than a for-loop
google-chrome s parsing may be more strict than firefox is at having things like trailing commas as specified by the standard at as stated in danilo celic s answer
some elements require more than simple mouse keyboard interactions due to the complex rendering carried out by extjs
as a general rule png is never worse and often better than gif because of superior compression
in this case a traversal-oriented approach is best maybe gremlin is better since cypher doesn t allow you to specify traversal order
this would be easier with server-side php plug-in s unless the file is loaded client-side
the map set multimap and multiset are normally implemented as binary trees with red-black balancing rules for example and deque is possibly more impression than knowledge a circular queue in an array exploiting an array-doubling or similar growth pattern
the hits arrays is longer than numtotalhits so your for-loop limit should be numtotalhits instead of hits.length
writing in a compiled-language java or c++ in your examples would almost certainly give better performance than an interpreted-language like php
i ve been teaching myself a bit about declarative vs imperative programming and i ve come to the possibly false understanding that declarative programming is more or less just abstraction
mouseleave div becomes thicker which will cause an almost automatic mouseenter
so the easiest way is to use one either webkit or gecko webkit has probably better support for svg these days plus i can t find package of gecko right now
edit 3des is better than des in the sense that it s significantly more secure but still less secure than aes but its performance is of necessity significantly worse than aes des or twofish because you re essentially applying des three times

your macro with memset and memcpy was not any safer than strcpy
most likely a trie is more efficient and you didn t sort your dictionary and it doesn t use a binary tree or ternary tree
history.js does everything pjax does and better so no need to mix the two
the alternative is to write slightly more complex c code which can split on either spaces or tabs note that you can pass strtok more than one delimiter
i ve read that mantis contains less project management tools than redmine
gecko seems to like anti-aliasing more than webkit
simply i just kept only the latest .android folder in this directory c users user name removed the duplicated one and then emulator started working for me
this is better than strtotime and strftime because it does not try to guess what is the format of the date but rather use the date format you provide
which of these gecko or webkit uses less memory in general case
oracle has kept improving innodb by so much that they declare that it is better than myisam in virtually all situations
sublimetext 3 needs much more time several seconds more then scite before the opened file shows up and i suppose it is because sublimetext does some pre-evaluation of the file content like detecting areas suitable for folding there are fold triangles available depending on indentation of non-white characters in the file
i would recommend postgresql for a beginner as it has far fewer surprises than mysql
of course ordering could be forced obj.gettype .tostring and using lexical order but since a strict order is not necessary only grouping i was wondering if there s a more efficient way than sorting
i am using jquery ui dialog to show more than one pop-up on one page each pop-up will have its own id and it will be triggered by an anchor with a attribute
if you get curious and discover the putimagedata function in the canvas 2d api please note that drawimage is much faster which might be unintuitive
so for example a galaxy note 1 calling a gs3 experiences more delay than a galaxy note 1 calling nexus 7 tablet asus and galaxy note 1 calling a xiaomi mi-2 phone
if you re open to using lodash which is a better version of underscore.js imo this can be expressed fairly simply using flattendeep on each element of your multi-dimensional array
you will notice that swift bundles are always about 4-5 mb larger than their objective-c counterparts and this is precisely why
in google-chrome the button should be a tad smaller than in firefox
another important difference is that valgrind can report a lot more information than gprof does but that s not specifically related to using it
any pointers would be appreciated i d love to get this working as you can imagine doing the post synchronously is considerably slower than asynchronously
mousemove is more intrusive than mouseenter but it tracks your mouse position all the time so that the tooltip moves accordingly
one step up from that would be using the ccurl couchdb cloudant curl tool that wraps your curl statements to cloudant and makes them less verbose
if a subclassing needs more information than the standard parameters which came up for us you have the option of a second parameters class type that you use as a second parameter but then you have two types of constructors in the tree or using inherited in the parameters class hierarchy
can anyone help me to hide it onload and show when is more than delta and hide on scroll up when is before delta
while it is simpler with mouse keyboard is kind of tricky
for example filtering and sorting takes longer in java
edit more recent scipy does a better job of not always padding to powers of 2 length so is closer in output to the pyfftw case
objective-c is much more free and easy with types and compilation checks where swift isn t
subclassing must allow more than the superclass not less and going from an argument being optional to not optional is allowing less
my view is that option 1 is clumsy code and involves unnecessary creation of an arrays even though the for-each loops is more efficient than the traditional for-loop in option 2
a side effect of many division routines is the modulo - so in few cases should division actually be faster than modulo
would an arrays be faster than a for-loop in this case
in a language like c a for-loop is more or less syntactic sugar for a while loops
tried both google-chrome and firefox google-chrome is much worse normally a 2nd or 3nd link clicking will trigger
the justification of realloc is that it s faster than 2nd malloc manual copy free
even with md5 salt it is weaker besides them
if you use the share button on the xcode documentation window to open the page in a web browser i had much better luck with safari than google-chrome 31 you can click on the mac ios developer library link in the top left corner of the webpage
i searched a lot about a tutorial or even a documentation describing how to add custom settings fields to general settings page in vbulletin admin panel but no way unlike the wordpress which is much easier to get tutorials to
the ardalahmet solution is not the right one if you need different backgrounds for each uinavigationbar when you have more than one uinavigationcontroller such as in a uitabbar because it using uinavigationbar categories
it seems like the linux method just using linefeed makes a lot more sense saves spaces and is easier to parse
localization it s easier to translation text than images
no trivial support for cache accessing ram is faster than accessing disk
since the fixed position in general is not all that stable on touch some more than others google-chrome works great it is still acting up in safari ios 8 in situations that used to work in ios 7 therefore i generally just use js to detect touch devices including windows mobile
glassfish v3 vs jboss 7.0 in using in production environment i know more people use jboss the application server but glassfish has more features and stability over jboss
but when looping through an arrays it s better to use a regular for-loop
svn in much better than cvs and have lot of mature tools for every platform
the cons of gulp-sass is that you get more than just node-sass - you also get gulp-utils and other things - which is a problem if you are not using gulp in the first place
and found out that framerate of createjs easeljs is much worse in firefox than in google-chrome ie
- if you move towards more static content or go the fastcgi way lighttpd is faster than apache

with correct locking for safety reasons and heavy concurrent use postgresql performed better than mysql
we have a few clients who have very high traffic sites running apache slower than nginx with varnish in front of it and they get way more traffic than you are saying with little to no performance problems
usually i subclassing the stock cocoa classes customize to my needs and if i need custom methods in more than one subclassing i will declare a category on the superclass rather than relying on inherited to provide my custom behavior
look at the quick start guide on the miglayout site it s a lot less difficult than gridbaglayout and much more powerful
you could do something like configure a reverse proxy for certain paths in lighttpd to go to a different port which nginx owns but this will still push all the data through lighttpd and just use more resources than having lighttpd serve it directly
overriding choice for me is macports as it has many more packages than homebrew and it puts its stuff in opt local to stay out of the way of other programs
but i don t want to use d3.js because some other feature in c3.js is better
accessing the main memory ram is much faster than reading values from the hard disk
verilog and vhdl allows for more optimization
i know tcp is a safer choice but let s assume i can only use udp and i need to ensure i can send packets over at a high rate with no missing packets what should i do
webm is usually more robust than mp4 which can be all over the place
currently tensorflow supports the older cudnn v.5.1 while there is a newer cudnn 6.0 available on nvidia site
looping with a for-loop is nothing more than a basic iteration of an arrays using a for-loop
in practice this means that tcp is better suited for continuous transmission of data whereas the more lightweight udp can be used when reliability isn t important
but on all of the mobile browsers i ve tried firefox google-chrome opera it s much smaller around 25 of the size specified
the first solution i thought about was using the keydown and mousedown that seems more work
i understand the difference between these functions but my question is when checking for a single null value would isnull be any quicker than using coalesce
note that json representation of mongodb document could exceed this limit since bson is more compact
one could use saaj soap with attachments api for java which runs at a lower level than jax-ws
to navigate to f you must go to c users folder a b c d e f within each directory there are a number of .html files and potentially more than one folder also

conan uses a more direct and easier approach to library dependencies management than biicode supporting both binary packages as building from source
copying the description in both getter and setter is even worse
so i decide instead of writing out chucks of code for each of the 10 possible health point not to mention there are other player stats that will be done in the same format i decided upon scraping together a for-loop with two if-else statements to attempt a loops to fill each grid element as long as the health value is greater than the for-loop s i
udp sockets have much lower overhead than tcp because packets are not acknowledged by the recipient
i solved this myself the problem was just qt errors no problem with the code at all for some reason it didnt like that my project files were in a folder structure of more than one folder before my project files used the exact same code in a new dir and it worked
what is better with sockets bufferedwriter or printwriter
ocaml is closer to c++ because of it s imperative and oo features but i recommend you learn haskell as it is more functional more mindbending and has more resources
always favor disk persistence disk storage is cheaper than ram
it has functionality the same as a canvas but swing is more advanced and has better features than awt
postgresql supports some more security features than mysql for example integration with gssapi or kerberos for logins last i checked mysql didn t have these

is division more expensive than multiplication in c++
also calloc is slower than malloc from operating system memory allocation perspective
and also don t forget - http.sys much more customizable than httplistener
if your exchange data between 2 widget i suggest to use qtreewidget more than qtreeview because data in qtreewidget can edit dynamic data row and value
why nginx might be better than apache when one is long polling and why long polling is better than periodically polling a server
however take some time to consider how you re currently using uialertview and whether you are able to give ios 8 users a better experience by supporting uialertcontroller
the performance in google-chrome is best less so in firefox and ie
i won t go into the discussion whether wicket or jsf is better this is mostly a religious battle anyway but due to the popularity of jsf there are simply more people experienced with it and there is a large community offering many things for jsf like component libraries and extensions
but native hibernate support regarding inherited mapping is more powerful than standard jpa and single table per class hierarchy or table per subclassing mapping strategies are more suitable for polymorphic queries and associations than table per concrete class strategy
i only mention this because a lot of people are more familiar with mysql than postgresql so linking lastval to something familiar might clarify things
the same speed as addition though still faster than multiplication
you can t findviewbyid earlier than oncreate
it seems to me that swift would be way simpler to learn then objective-c for beginners i know because i learned it in like 2 months and swift is less complicated and better laid out then objective-c
unless you are using the static typing feature xquery is no more strongly typed than xslt
so the solution for you would be to have static contents contents of apk like its manifest file jar file dex file res folder etc ready in a folder create a copy as a temp folder modify resources contents and not names as per user needs then finally create zip of this temp folder and sign it to have the desired .apk file no need for java complier then
the guava library is much more popular than lambdaj and does allow you to avoid for while loops by using preficates and filter methods
using the post method isn t necessarily more secure than get
an alternative approach with getc fgets or fread seems better suited to you needs
if you are more comfortable with updatepanel these should still work if you have everything inside a form tag and a scriptmanager within the form tag too
graphicsmagick also seems to be faster than imagemagick using better multitasking
now why chat to int works because every chars is represented as unicode in java so you can think of it as at backend chars is a smaller version of int
obviously dynamic allocation with malloc or calloc is more flexible
it depends on the browser its definitely true for ie and firefox but seems slower on google-chrome
the other ram disk questions like ramdisk slower than disk
vmware has more features but costs 80 virtualbox on the other hand is more basic but is free for most users see virtualbox licensing faq for details
even if you can handle them with npm it s better to use bower since it s optimized for this purpose no deep dependencies among other things
i think that s why i can t use to launch my project this way works but jar way is better because everything including the main_class is described in manifest.mf
i m in debian wheezy which is much more recent than ubuntu 10.04
ps i ve noticed that in google-chrome situation is better than in firefox but new line still starts beneath tag
my personal experience with both richfaces mixed better with other jsf libs icefaces has more advanced ajax capabilities like server sided push kinda like comet the basic ajax functionality is easier to set up and use but plays difficult sometimes when you mix it with other jsf libs
strtol is better than atoi with better error handling
if strcpy is anything like strcpy it will write one byte more than strlen returns to zero terminate the string
here s what it looks like if the parent is bigger than the children
i am trying to bind it with a gridview or a datalist whatever is more appropriate without success
then the right events to do it is keyup more than keydown since the value isn t yet in the field at this moment or on change
but right now the sorting step is taking way longer than the filtering step so i would like to combine them in some way
in contrast to turbogears django is more out-of-the-box
the swift one is dramatically slower then objective-c implementation
note that this algorithm avoids any math more complicated than addition and multiplication so will likely have much better performance than something that requires trig functions
and because hex is much more readable and useful than binary - it s often used and shown
for input and output to complete gandalf the grey s answer if you like to use cin and cout it s better to use std ios sync_with_stdio false
a while loops or do...while loops is more appropriate here than a for-loop because you do not know how many times the user wants to execute loops
i though that udp was faster than tcp but do you think that tcp will be faster due to the congestion
but that seems a lot uglier than implements a facade pattern and just extends the map code but that is a lot of intermediate code to create a facade for
however if that upgrade includes myself say i have a package named server and part of the upgrade includes a newer versioning of server then the upgrade fails
udp is less reliable on a wide area network but in a closed environment of a vm talking to its host you can safely skip all the tcp reliability stuff
is it a microoptimization or are there real significant examples when memcpy is faster so that we really need to use memcpy and not stick to memmove everywhere
i guess you can just manually check the condition within your for-loop continue if it s not met but a while loops makes more sense imo
however in most computer architectures there are at least 2 registers to return values that are twice or more as wide as the word size edx eax in x86 rdx rax in x86_64 v0 and v1 in mips why mips assembler has more that one register for return value
make sure that you re running a versioning later than 1.0 you may want to upgrade if your versioning is older than that
in general strncpy is a safer alternative to strcpy
analytics -- when you can scan via the clustered pk you get better performance with innodb than with myisam which has to bounce back and forth between the separate index and the data
i know that it would be easier with the parent knowing it s children using a list but that s not what i m after
i prefer to use beautifulsoup better than lxml
further more gson really seems to be faster than jackson json
innodb scales better than myisam
additionally you may have to write nested try-catch blocks more frequently if you are using traditional try-catch . closing a resource also throws an exception-handling
the application has far fewer threads than the cpu has processors cores
quicksort is usually faster than mergesort just because it s easier to code a tight implementation and the operations it does can go faster

pypy is now faster than cpython in most cases
knowing that a division is much more costly than a multiplication

if you use another library like glut or sdl it becomes much easier let the library worry about setting up a window and then you can focus on learning opengl
the quicksort algorithm is faster than mergesort which is what sorted will get you when called on a sequence of objects via java.util.arrays.sort
my suggestion would be to try to use a testing framework testng or junit which gives many more features than just parametrization
in php you should use metaphone it is more accurate than soundex
as the simple for-loop is faster than a foreach loops
postgresql is better than mysql in many ways
also your comparison would be safer as a for-loop that ensures value is less than 100 rather than a while loops
for example mdpi is basically 72dpi as your computer monitor hdpi resources should be around 1.5 times larger than mdpi resources and so forth
is opencl just there to make multi processors cores just more portable meaning porting the code to either gpu or cpu or is opencl faster and more efficient
scheme is older than common lisp
high-availability will be easier with couchbase or aerospike than with redis
on windows xp however it works fine on local file systems but when watching folder on a mapped network drive it throws an ioexception when trying to watch more than 50 directory
i m in the hate it part so anything i said is biased plus in our test prototypes developing in wicket was faster than jsf
disk files are of course an order of magnitude slower than ram and thrashing your virtual memory system could actually be worse than that depending on your access patterns
multiplication is higher precedence than addition and addition is left-associative so this is equivalent to but knowing that only tells you that the first addition will happen before the second addition and that the multiplication will happen before the second addition
from this question i found out that iis server is better than cassini for my purpose but i don t know how to check the default server of my website
rythm is a strong typed java template engine using razor like syntax with high performance 2 to 3 times faster than velocity and fm
seam is more powerful with jsf but not necessarily richfaces or icefaces for they mostly just extend the component set which is anyway fall down to standard html components when rendered by jsf
we can send fewer data with get method compared to post method
obviously reading a block from cache is much more efficient than reading it off the disk since ram is much faster than disk
building restful services with openrasta is much simpler than with wcf in my experience
the post get may fix the problem - get is much more lax with security than post
unfortunately including .class only goes two directory deep and does not copy any files that are deeper than two directory inside of the bin folder
the first time i run this on a device i realized that i was on a wrong track for some of the local phablets tablet mobile that have large screens has less screens density
myisam table is much faster than innodb but no rollback is possible
this isn t to say that xhtml2pdf is bad just that it s going to take time for it to be as good as rendering in a browser and if pdf output for its own sake is what you really are interested in i think using reportlab directly is a better choice
yes pow is slower than multiplication multiplication is slower than addition
research showed me that mantis is simpler to use over bugzilla so i decided to use mantis but have no idea how to install it.can anyone please tell me what are the steps you need to take in order to install mantis bug tracking system in a small company to track website mobile portal bugs
normally you can just call parent class methods directly by doing parent.foo self ... but in case of multiple inheritance super is much more useful
to be more precise between viewwillappear and viewdidappear functions of the first viewcontroller
i am more familiar with vtk than itk so propably what comes into my mind is a bit biased
i have some buttons i want to order in a table layout and everything is working fine but of course a tablet screens is much bigger than a normal smartphone screens
edit you probably only want to validate when the value changes and field loses focus that s why imo the onchange event would be more appropriate than onblur not onblure
i changed out total for sum which is more consistent with other databases sqlite aggregate-functions
about the inexactness problem you should be aware that double can be more inexact than int
implements runnable is better because you can extends other classes
if you do mind using linux you can use ubuntu which is more user-friendly but not really recommended as a server at least for the default version
i haven t tried it on ie 9 but i can only imagine it being harder than google-chrome firefox
the cpu affinity is more like a suggestion to the kernel regarding which cpu to use
these methods which give us access to private members are known as getter setter or better knows as accessor mutators
excel cannot process data more than 64bit big it will store it in powers of 10 but in our application i want 128bit data for that i have formatted particular cell to be text format in excel sheet so that i can enter very big number
you might want to try running your trainer under pypy if you aren t already -- it s significantly faster than cpython for some workloads
param should be params and therefore your data is not being serialized which would explain why the server is rejecting your post since post requires more privileges than get presumably
well if it is a single calculation you wil hardly notice any difference but if you talk about millions of transaction then definitely division is costlier than multiplication
as written malloc would be better than calloc but the question used calloc and it would not be hard to make it sensible for use with this code too for example a conditional assignment in set_matrix such as
so if your document bson is larger than 16 mb mongodb throws exception
looking for a swfupload url their site is down so maybe plupload is a better bet
i feel postgresql is much more mature and robust than mysql
given that you re seeing extra tasks causing a slowdown you likely either have resource contention via locking or your tasks are cpu bound and having more tasks than processors cores will cause slowdowns
this is why rsa is much slower than dsa
i m building an application in both bottle and flask to see which i am more comfortable with as django is too much batteries included
myisam supports longer rows than innodb does
anyevent http resolved several issues i had with my program locking up and also offered better control over ssl cert validation and use of proxies including socks proxies
division typically uses more resources.Ã¢ to avoid division we multiplying rather than divide
if the data is critical you should go for tcp which is slower as compared to udp which in fact doesn t guarantee the packets will arrive in order or even if they d arrive or not
3 if i have a large object to cache i find serializable and deserialization takes a longer time in ignite and retrieving from distributed cache is slow
nginx s static file performance is better than apache
you seem to be compiling more than one hdl probably vhdl and verilog
i m also looking for more examples and explanations of complex combinators more complex than fold in common programming languages
in addition seeing arp being slower than icmp doesn t necessarily mean icmp isn t deprioritized---it might mean bandwidth is insufficient to hit the limiting threshold
will using shellsort instead of insertionsort inside mergesort yields a faster performance
the point of such an architecture is because i have news with some text between which i want to be able to switching with paging effect but the news text can be bigger than the screens
finally b+ tree is admittedly more difficult to implement than a trie it s more on a red-black tree level of complexity
myisam is more space friendly than innodb you can start with that one
why is enumerate slower than xrange + lst i
a boilerplate setter getter is no better than a public member
splitting the min and max operations seems more simd friendly thus i suggest
colt does this already but i have found it is more complicated and more powerful than jama which may explain why simple functions are slower with colt
bit shifts have lower precedence than addition subtraction see in docs
plus copy as rtf for atom-editor has more recent updates than sublimehightlight for sublimetext
it is well-known that the processor instruction for multiplication takes several times more time than addition division is even worse upd which is not true any more see below
i just wanted to point out my answer since i know for-loop is faster then loops
note without the mouseout it works better but tooltip stays until next mouseover
textmate isn t known to perform well on large files but sublimetext supposedly performs better than vim on large files and yet supports legacy textmate syntax parsers
continuing the int_least8_t example hlp will be promoted to type int which is larger than chars
you are right because myisam is really faster than innodb
instead of firefox or ie i use google-chrome and i superficially feel google-chrome is responding better
if mp3 ogg is better try different compression ratios and sample rates to see which goes faster
as i said postgresql is far superior and i hate mucking with mysql s bizarre bugs and i think that overall postgresql performance is probably better than mysql for any even slightly complicated query
in my case i found jackson little faster than gson i used default serialization because so far i don t have a need to customize serialization
qregularexpression and i m much more familiar with qregexp
whether you use a plugin or write your own code css only is a no go for google-chrome safari and as you said firefox is better at dealing with it
strcpy incoming connected will overwrite dataa and maybe datab if your first token pointed to by header is shorter than strlen connected
a similar tool is now present in firefox you had to use firebug before but google-chrome is more used partly because of its more powerful js engine v8
apparently opera ie and firefox works better with
actually calling memset after malloc is closer to calling calloc than the option you suggest
small in firefox is smaller then small in safari so never ever use them
conclusion diff1 is faster in firefox opera and safari diff2 is faster in ie and google-chrome
i have never used glut but i know that many people will say sdl is better
or use a single for-loop and there is no need for nested loops that makes it more complex
note that this will work when the variable is public but it is best to limit the scope as much as you can so protected is more sutable here
livescript is coco but much more compatible with coffeescript more functional and more feature rich
for use with types other than boolean and int this is more complex but still possible - but it would be easier to use an initializer
hardware design with vhdl or verilog is more like programming nowadays
frankly i care less and less each day as i become more and more impressed with clang llvm
i feel swift is better than objective-c in many aspects but my major question is - will swift dynamic libraries support older version of swift
but if firebug donÃ¢ t enabled after launch firefox Ã¢ time equal 2ms that faster than opera and google-chrome and difference between empty filled array disappears
ienumerable is less specific than ilist
just like it would be possible to come up with arithmetic expressions that could be written with less parentheses if addition had a higher precedence than multiplication
as such traversing a nat through udp is much easier than tcp
if lob-storage isn t in ram at the time of a query execution then we need to read it from a disk which is of course much slower than from ram
uipangesturerecognizer gives you precise movement data whereas uiswipegesturerecognizer is more basic and just detects whether or not a swipe happened and in which direction
heapsort has higher overhead than quicksort but its worst case is o n log n vs
measure how much faster than realtime avassetreader can decode at replace avplayer with your own metal + avassetreader path if you think that some performance has gotten lost in transit
phpunit does also have bdd features but behat is much more targetted toward that style
to get the html instead of hardcoding it as above use the webclient class since it has a simplier api than webrequest
as mentioned in comments use the post method instead of get because post allows much more data characters across in one message
firefox doesn t support mp3 on html5 they support ogg which is better anyway
more mathematically you can think of a class a set of all objects with some similar characteristic and then the subclassing surrounds the superclass and has even more characteristics
as suggested in the comments since you are saving data post is more appropriate than get
from what i ve read the gridview control plays a lot nicer with the objectdatasource
entity-relationship diagram are simpler than uml diagram
the non-random random behaviour is more a reflection on the quality of the rand prng Ã¢ it is often not very good
now imagine writing lots of small packets across a network udp may cause congestion whereas tcp is better controlled
tcp windowing is more expensive than raw udp but if you use udp to go faster and add a custom loss-recovery or seqno ack resend manager then that may slow you down again
and there are no handshakings required udp are pretty much faster but less reliable than tcp
my ipad 1 safari js benchmarked 38 times slower than google-chrome on my pc
your colleague may be right in the general sense using try-catch to test your exception-handling handling is less desirable than using the provided expectedexception utilities
as mysql_real_escape_string escapes characters according to default charset so it is better than addslashes function and it properly sanitizes sql injections arising out of abuse of multibyte character sets but in another article here a workaround-scenario is shown that explains that injection can still be done
when i try the demo in google-chrome or safari it is indeed much faster but when i ve tested it in firefox it s consistently slower
disk even ssd are orders of magnitude slower than ram
dill has a better serializer that can pickle socket objects on any os and thus sending the socket object with multiprocess works in either case
if i have a class hierarchy in which subclassing require use of more specific types than those specified in the superclass ivars is it better to declare the superclass ivar as id or to type it and then cast where necessary in the subclassing
i ve thought in using a pairing function but that makes children exponentially bigger than parent so after a few splits there is an integer overflow
now i want from all user that have more than 1 post to get all post except the most recent post
in general multiplication is more costlier than subtraction right
in many cases emacs or vim is more productive than a huge ide that makes coffee
also i want to know if google gson is better than jackson for json parsing
while java could be described as a compiled and interpreted-language it s probably easier to think of java itself as a compiled-language and java bytecode as an interpreted-language
a third possibility would be to send out some form of discovery packets either by broadcast or better by multicast udp
compare the very active django tag on stack overflow with that of pylons or turbogears though and i d argue getting started is simply easier with django irrespective of anything to do with code
from what i can gather arc4random generates much better random numbers than rand does however i haven t seen a way to seed it and i would like to just like using srand
also which database syntax postgresql or mysql is closer sql mssql syntax and structure
with this set each time you boot and the sata negotiated link speed of the ssd is less than 3 it s going to reboot until it s 3 however many times it takes
i would advise you to try wicket it is very easy to learn much easier than jsf and it let s you re-use many existing components as well
simple function in zsh to parallelize jobs in not more than 4 subshell using lock files in tmp
even if addition is faster than multiplication i think that you will lose more because of the branching
aes can be even much faster than des or 3des when the cpu supports aes-ni
from a software engineering point of view as soon as you make a function protected you expose it to other users of course much more limited than public exposure but still much more exposed than private and you create expectation about some stability of the api
i would also recommend you to check hikaricp as its way much better than c3p0
hex encoding is far more readable than binary that s why sublime uses it
qlist code is generally less optimized than qvector one
now i went into this script there are for loops which are adding some values to the classpath for there are more than one for-loop
otherwise if oncreate is being called more than ondestroy receiver is registered multiple time and the app mis-behaves
post has a lot more advantages than get
what i want to do is if a user checks the more than 1 checkbox all radio button must turn into checkbox and users must be able to check more options
why is the bitvector 32 structure more efficient than bitarray
also note that some mysql engines are faster than others for example myisam may run faster than innodb at expense of the lack of real foreign keys
hons generally runs slower than cons because in creating a hons an attempt is made to see whether a hons already exists with the same car and cdr
while the post method can be submitted with forms or ajax calls and it is pretty safe at least more than the get
final result will be of type ienumerable and in terms of performance this would be better than iqueryable since here join is taking place between in memory collections
| application expects grails versioning 1.3.7 but grails_home is versioning 2.1.0 - use the correct grails versioning or run grails upgrade if this grails versioning is newer than the versioning your application expects
also a while loops seems more appropriate and self-explanatory in this situation than a for-loop
then you run that string through a good hash algorithm--something like sha1 is fine even md5 is more than adequate despite reports to the contrary
is sending packets via an established tcp connection after all hand shaking has been done a method to be faster than udp
irrlicht has a cleaner api lower system requirements and works better across platforms than ogre in my opinion
the httr package is a bit nicer than rcurl for making http requests in my opinion and it sets a user-agent string by default
it is clear without any performance tests that native javascript for-loop is faster but there is no big difference for small arrays like 10-20 small items
the speed for tcp in comparison with udp is slower
an additional bonus i find that conda works better as a package manager than virtualenv
i have heard that myisam performs better than innodb on read-oriented tables
since i am using two for loops it is consuming more time and is affecting the execution time of my entire program which already had a for-loop
there may be some exotic corner cases where myisam performs marginally better for certain workloads table-scans or high-volume insert-only work but the default choice should be innodb unless you can prove you have a case that myisam does better
i keep hearing from some people that graphicsmagick a fork from quite a few years back that branched off from imagemagick is significantly faster than imagemagick
so i think a custom checkbox is the better choice here but if you really want to use a button i would use a hidden checkbox field and apply onclick functions to the button to change the value of a hidden checkbox field
2 since superclass is smaller than subclassing one should use memory object carefully
nunit is faster as compared to mstest
firefox handles this better than google-chrome does but neither exactly the way i want
ember.js would make things even simpler than backbone.js
if that doesn t work i ve had better luck with gulp-sass and gulp-sourcemaps
neo4j and cypher is still faster and obviously this has no effect on the gremlin queries on neo4j but that might be just a issue with the gremlin implementation for neo4j
having said all of that i do think that maven is a very interesting and useful system i m not calling it a tool like ant is maven is broader than that for software development configuration and build management
far better to use a surrogate key and yes a join on an int is often faster and you can join in delete staments in many databases not use the slower subquery especially since names tend to be longer than a few chars
the setter complexity can be higher than the getter and thus validate a unit-test
adding lightweight generics to your objective-c api makes it easier to interface with swift because your api gets translated more precisely
secondly you will find a for-loop is easier than a do loops for implementing the logic as you don t need to keep track of loops counter manually
better than get use post method to send and retrieve user data
given that this is 4 years old and lodash has more or less taken the place of underscore.js i thought i would share this solution using lodash
both old and some modern systems implement a special vfork call which has somewhat strict limitations although less strict than the posix requireemnts for vfork but avoid this copy for performance reasons
nss is more strict than either openssl or gnutls
btw i concur that udp is far more appropriate than tcp in this case
it might be helpful to see why quicksort is usually faster than mergesort since if you understand the reasons you can pretty quickly find some cases where mergesort is a clear winner
sortedlist is faster when you want to enumerate the elements and you can access the elements by index and sorteddictionary is faster if there are a lot of elements and you want to insert a new element in the middle of the collection
given postgresql s reputation for doing things better than mysql or at least as good as i daresay that postgresql would demonstrate similar performance if properly used
i finally ran it through pypy and was delighted to discover that when the lists got really deep pypy was running significantly faster than cpython
if you have not programmed assembly before i suggest you choose mips since it is easier than x86 and then b looking at how to transfer data with the serial port to begin with since this illustrates memory-mapped i o that is used
question iÃ¢ m seeing some compromise in mp3 quality my converted mp3 is lower file size when compared to wav but my audio quality is little poor than wav wonder if i can increase the quality of the mp3 file
post is a little more complex than get though
that continued usage of 1024-bit prime field elgamal or dsa keys is much riskier than it is for 1024-bit rsa all are still commonly used because once a successful attack has been conducted against a single well-chosen prime field all users of that prime field may be affected at little additional effort.
this is relatively slow since reading from the hard disk is slower than reading from ram
entity sql which is not available in code first and dbcontext api - you must access it through objectcontext api is more powerful because it is not dependent on limited functionality offered by linq
what makes quicksort faster than heapsort in practice is its constant that was ignored by big o analysis
nuxeo is definitely more advanced in this because with its web interface you can customise almost everything but alfresco has other advantages
i also find sorting and filtering is also easier on windows forms
ansible is in an earlier stage than chef puppet and other tools out there when it comes to community support
a better solution is not to use myisam for tables where the data is constantly changing - innodb is much more bulletproof and as paul correctly points out you can use transactions on innodb tables but not on myisam
to upgrade your plone site from 4.3 to 5.0 you can check this link section upgrading plone 4.x to 5.0 the migration should be more simple than older versioning like 3.x or 2.x
however using get rather than post is typically more appropriate for things like this where you are only selecting different options rather than changing data on your server
after googling i found that we can t add images on more tab in uitabbarcontroller because more tab is automatically displayed by uitabbarcontroller when uitabbaritem is more then 5
i think adhering to the dip principles makes it easier to comply with the ocp principles
i am not sure if vmware server will be much better than virtualbox
4 i d like to understand why nginx might be better than apache when one is long polling and why long polling is better than periodically polling a server
probably the project has deployment target setting higher than sdk versioning you have installed - try to change it to the lower versioning that is supported on your mac or upgrade your xcode to newer versioning
i had an outlet of a viewgraph which was a subclass of uiview in which i drew some graphics.in landscape mode the size of the viewgraph is larger than in portrait mode
firefox renders the video correctly and it matches the background and in safari it s always brighter whether you add the filter or not
i mean i think realloc is way smarter so why do we even need malloc
i also recommend wtforms it s much easier to use than formencode and have builtin sqlalchemy extensions
now all that said...you might get more visual appeal with pygtk pyqt or wxpython though tkinter coming standard is a nice feature
in the cleanup even in normal case scenario i would regard the use of goto as being clearer than the do while 0 constructs among other things because the target labels themselves practically cry out look at me far moreso than the break and do while 0 constructs
only firefox and opera seem to have this issue opera even worse than firefox but i don t care that much about opera
if you could upgrade to that versioning there is less that has to be done
drupal makes it easier for the developer to accomplish much more complex tasks than joomla or wordpress
usual way with tagging is to get objects by tag but if tags are used by few applications it may give more than post
an interesting answer about this can be found at why is quicksort better than mergesort
the easiest solution is to just replace underscore.js with lodash which has even more features than the latest underscore.js
printwriter is a richer api compared to bufferedwriter
the above delta timer is better than setinterval method 1 makes use of settimeout method 2 but also corrects itself starts the timer using a function method 3 and doesn t pollute the scope with a special clockstart function method 4
this will work for hotfixes and it is simpler than cherry-pick your development changeset from your default branch
note if we replace math.h by cmath the program does not compile with a warning of ambiguous call to pow seems a better condition
we don t need the getter or setter it s more for convenience
benchmarking the and versions against a for-loop with set is informative here and demonstrates that loops version is faster than either of the approaches
ocaml is faster than racket for most of the benchmarks on languages benchmark game
these relations naturally arise when you impose restrictions on what you can handle--then if a subclassing means that the method can handle less acts as a superclass of since can handle everything that the subclassing can handle and more
a side note since you want all rows using union all is faster since it does not need to perform a distinct to eliminate duplicates
from what i heard quicksort should have better average case performance but from my tests it performs 4 times worse than heapsort for array of random integers
there seems to be a consensus that nginx serves static content faster than apache
i suggest if possible that you not code in awt but rather code with swing which is much more robust and flexible
says that enhanced for loops is 3x faster than the regular for-loop well that great and its easier to write anyways but what if i need the index
you just need to connect using the entity framework driver and if you develop in any of technologies that uses dbcontext includes code first model first and data base first but is lighter than objectcontext you can use the list below
and normal for-loop is faster than for-in loops
we could still do this with settimeout but setinterval is better suited for this job
tostring itself uses an iterator just like equals but is a more inefficient approach
notice my use of illegalargumentexception instead of nullpointerexception - the illegalargumentexception is more in line with what you re hoping to achieve
redmine is definitely much more popular but trac is getting more popular in particular as 1.0 version is around the corner
use a dawg which is more efficient than a trie in terms of space waste
now this test tests more things than one post put delete which breaks the idea of a single unit of work..
you could do it with a while loops as well but a for-loop is nicer
also swt is actually newer and more actively maintained than swing
also developing enterprise application is such new languages java c# vb.net rubby is easier that vb6 because they rely on frameworks every body can write c# java code that function but it requires tricks good practices and some of imagination to write vb6 strong and rehusable code
ellipsis still wraps in google-chrome but is more user friendly in firefox by adding the .
they have their differences better stick to one i prefer for this example to use keydown just plays better with me you can use keyup
it s more effective with firefox more than google-chrome or any other browsers
with the exception there is more data with the post than the get
if you overload it you must also define it as protected or define it as public which is weaker
this is important because if the int needs more precsion than 52-bits the precision is too low for a double
class cplayer has a lot more fields than i put here but they are not relevant to this post
the only reason i was considering postgresql was that some research suggested postgresql has much better support for changing schemas along the way than mysql
i also kind of get the impression that scriptaculous drag and drop is better than jquery ui drag and drop based on the online demos
this can be done in a repeater but a datalist control is more straightforward and is just as easy to use
if you re just going to use vim the same way you use gedit don t bother - gedit is better than vim at being gedit
if you want to use a continuous gesture that tracks the user s finger you can use uipangesturerecognizer rather than uiswipegesturerecognizer and i think animatewithduration is better than catransition in that case
this is easier with lodash underscore.js or even with es5 array and object methods but since you asked about pure js
why do you think that push is far more scalable then pull for starters
decimal types libraries are fantastic for financial applications because we re used to dealing with the style of rounding required in financial stuff but there is the cost that they tend to be slower than ieee floating point
step #3 if you see that the last versioning is older than your current versioning do whatever upgrade logic you want
at this point i m putting off worrying about client-side validation since server-side is more important
i presume it s why is pypy faster than cpython some of the time
because the unification performed as part of type inference transcends quantifier scope you can sometimes end up in a situation where ghc would have to unify a type variable in an outer scope with a quantified type from a nested scope which is how you get compiler errors about escaping types and skolems and whatnot the latter i assume being related to skolem normal form
after looking it s seems that hmac is much faster and better in term of security even if the underlying hash function sha1 is broken which is not the case when using rsa-sha1
when you call pandas.read_csv you can use a regular expression that matches zero or more spaces followed by a comma followed by zero or more spaces as the delimiter
if you want to stick to lower level basic file operations ant is better bet than maven
according to the performance results at for serialization with databind with strings gson.tojson myobject gson is over 10x slower than jackson
in my opinion swing is easier to start because there are tools like the eclipse windowbuilder which enables you to create your application in a graphical interface but javafx is more likely to be used in the future because it has some great improvements over swing like css skins etc.
easy make the pro bundle have a higher versioning than the lite bundle - upgrade only kick in when the versioning is higher
as in c# development in my past i never create a new instance of some tcp socket in loops if i want to make it asynchronously - i create a single instance with delegates to async functions and if there is a similar situation in c# project like in javascript code here in the question s content because it s doesn t produce new objects in for-loop it takes less memory and as for architecture it s represented as more clean and good solution
when i run my http web server on google google-chrome it gives more 324 error than in firefox
instead of implementing all these over udp it is much better just to switch to tcp
but the post method okhttp is more slower than httpclient s post always more slower than okhttp s get method
upgrade actually installs newer versioning of the packages you have
i have successfully deploy pm2 on amazon-web-services elastic beanstalk it has more than one way to achieve
on the other hand you may very well have legitimate reasons to have a bunch of properties that are no more than getter and setter
actual mounting of filesystems is trickier business and really depends on what you are mounting - ntfs fat ext3 xfs nfs cifs webdav etc etc
i think lwjgl has a implementation too but the jogl one is better
the swing library is much more portable than the awt library
similarly as the subclassing gains more methods it inherited the list of superclass in the order in which they were named that precede it
the compare dialog of tortoisegit is more about file and with git you have to compare two master branches not just two commits of the same branches both pointing to the same svn central repo
also on implementations like jython or ironpython could be a lot slower than with cpython
on unix like environments emacs is more native and you can use slime which is usually available as a os package or as a separate download for aquamacs
the fgetc loop variant was consistently 45x slower than the fread loop
so whatever pandas read_hdf loaded into the ram is less than 100 mb i have 4g ram and my 32-bit-windows system can only use 2.7g and i used the rest for ram disk
i am running into an issue where for some of the folder there are too many subfolders and it spits out the directory name k really long path blah is too long not the actual dir- the actual dir is longer than 260 chars
the results end up very close but the emgucv image comes out a little bit blurrier than the opencv image
so i am using the music graph api to access and display artists similar to the current one in this case the who. however when i use a for-loop to go through the results .text artistnames only prints the last name in the arrays in this case it only prints pink floyd even though the arrays contains more artists. however console.log prints every name in the arrays
also note that the fact that the avx are a newer than sse doesn t make the avx faster whatever you are planning to use the number of cycles taken by an function is probably more important than the avx vs sse argument for example see this answer
they have a good edit in-line model and it seems to have better ux than the ng-hide ng-show options
use dsa it tends to be more compact than rsa
the uibezierpath class seems easier to use so how could i get that drawing in a uiimage
i have a directory that contains more than 5000 subfolders....i need to get the name of the folder in the final level..
i m trying to get better with dplyr and tidyr but i m not used to thinking in r
if using a decently recent version of bash or zsh it s much simpler
can anyone more experienced with ionic angular give me a hint what is wrong here
a properties is nothing more than syntactic shorthand for a get set accessor
in general try-catch is more robust does not require you to define an exact position of where to test could be a block and provides info about the exception-handling
xmltype is being stricter about the validity than clob
i am scraping a list of rss feed by using curl - look at the xml from the rss feed that s giving the problem there s more than one feed so it s possible for some feed to be right and for the feed that are wrong to be wrong in different ways
you can for example store a hash stored with something stronger than md5
you ll have to use jta if you need transactional access to more than one jms session
according to this test - hide is slightly faster then fadeout since it doesn t use animations
there s a known bug that when you install the googleads library using pip it will install a newer version of the oauth2client library which will break my google analytics api scripts because the google-api-python-client uses an older version of oauth2client
you should know that strdup allocates more memory and returns its pointer which you then overwrite the original pointer returned by malloc so it will be impossible to free that memory since you no longer have the pointers
innodb not only has the advantages you list but it is also faster than myisam in many benchmarks
just making boilerplate getter and setter is better but is almost as bad as public properties
the upgrade works correctly but if uninstall new build for example build 9 and install an old one example 3 i got an error although nothing currently installed on my machine this versioning is older than installed one
nsurlsession also provides nicer interfaces for requesting data using blocks in that it allows you to combine them with delegate methods for doing custom authentication handling redirect handling etc. whereas with nsurlconnection if you suddenly realized you needed to do those things you had to refactor your code to not use block-based callbacks
but using the prototype instances can inherited properties which means less memory and you gain a lot of flexibility
most of the patterns i ve seen will either break when inheritance level is more than 2 levels child parent grandparent or use more resources by implements super through closures
in this particular case you concluded that a bitwise-and operation of c++ language must be implemented by a bitwise-and machine operation while a modulo must somehow involve machine division which is allegedly slower
the reason being that sorting less elements which the grouping generally produces is going to be faster than sorting all input documents
myisam is better for high read volumes innodb for high update volumes due to table vs row locking
it gives me arraylist but arraylist has a linkedhashmap which contains some more linked hashmaps containing final values
ten years ago intel vtune recommended not more than 1000 irq s www.cs.utah.edu mhall cs4961f09 vtune-1.pdf try to get about a 1000 samples per second per logical cpu
especially look at the last two results for longer strings for which the preorder inorder approach is much faster than brute force
additionally you should reset i each time you go through loops and a for-loop makes more sense than a while loops especially if you re using c99 as i can be declared within loops
qtablewidget or qtableview which is more proper to make a downloading task list
sql server is probably smart enough to translate isnull into the equivalent sarg expression but if you are bent on using a function then coalesce is a better choice because it is part of the sql standard allows for multiple values instead of just two with isnull and avoids using quite possibly the most confusing function name microsoft ever devised in isnull
using a ram disk is even better though often more of a challenge to get it to implement for you
here it is with reshape in base though joran is right melt is likely easier
the int version seems to execute much faster than the boolean one
is fb_graph or koala gem better than facebooker2
oracle s other application server weblogic still doesn t even fully support java ee 7 - both they and ibm seem to have similar strategies of maintaining stability in their full-fat releases while being more bleeding edge with glassfish for oracle and the liberty profile for ibm s websphere
i think it is because the disk is slower than ram
simpletest is slightly easier to grasp but phpunit is the best in my opinion at least so if you want to start learning and using a framework start with the one you re going to use when you ll be a master in tdd
error build buildd opencv-2.3.1 modules calib3d src stereobm.cpp 802 error -211 sadwindowsize must be odd be within 5..255 and be not larger than image width or height in function findstereocorrespondencebm
i m working with both ubuntu mac but i like staying with the linux system feels faster and more stable for me
if you have more than 1 changelistener and at the same time no mapchangelistener setchangelistener registered on your property the listeners wont be executed
but also it shows incredible differences between speeds of the browsers ie 50-100 times slower than firefox or google-chrome
i ve been trying to sum up values over a swipe and see how different browsers report values and they vary a lot with safari reporting order of magnitude bigger numbers on almost all platforms google-chrome reporting quite more like 3 times more than firefox firefox being balanced on the long run but quite different among platforms on small movements on ubuntu gnome nearly only +3 or -3 seems like it sums up smaller events and then send a big +3
i did a simple performance test and i noticed postgresql is slower than mysql
if you re building a simple demo of a rendering mechanism glut is way better than sdl it takes care of a lot of the details that sdl would otherwise require
is there a specialized commandline tool to resize the images in a more efficient way than imagemagick or graphicsmagick
also with the for-loop it s considered better to limit the scope of the iterating variable i and to use println you need system.out not just system and you need a string java arrays do not override tostring so something to output the numbers the user entered after loops like
if you are not using transactions while storing or updating tables switch table type to myisam its quite faster than innodb with much less overhead
p the second thing is porter stemming algorithm but then i realized lemmatization is much better for my cause.
safari 5.1 still renders smoother than google-chrome but it is now clear that google has done much improvement
after thinking about playing with it some more and reading some other posts using objective-c typedef in swift here is a better solution i think
new to carrierwave already loving it so much better than paperclip
it can be with post or get get is simpler
i m significantly more comfortable with apache but learning to use nginx has been pretty exciting or as exciting as learning to configure a new webserver can be
i usually do this with nested linearlayouts containing a textview and imageview for the icon but obviously using these compound textview is cleaner
it sounds to me like you are asking for the union of the filtered session values from the two tables and as you want the distinct set you do want union rather than union all union all is actually a much more common requirement than union
application expects grails versioning 1.1.1 but grails_home is versioning 1.2.0 - use the correct grails versioning or run grails upgrade if this grails versioning is newer than the versioning your application expects
it also caused a bigger problem with serializable and deserialization
because webclient is higher class of httpwebrequest and its slower
but firefox keeps being less responsive than google-chrome or ie
qnx is most famous for being the real time operating system of which there are two versions qnx rtos v4 is an older product but is still used in many existing systems and still supported by the company
nexus looks better choice than artifactory because of using filesystem instead of database to keep repository
1 yes there is a obvious benefit reading from ram is faster than reading from disk
historically floating-point could be much slower than integer
sendmessage type functions will be slightly slower since they have more coding inside them allowing them to work with more than just mouse and keyboard functionality
to protect your user s passwords you need to do better than md5 hash the passwords
when i ran the test individually with a timer google-chrome actually performed better than firefox hope this helps
but apparently tracing garbage collection is so good that it is better than using malloc free
is putimagedata ... more performant than drawimage ...
it s much better compressing than zip rar
however people often argue that postgresql is cleaner and easier to use that mysql
maven is more like a replacement for ant
fact is that interpreted-language like php are always slower than a compiled-language
actually we could say that tcp is a higher level protocol compared to udp because tcp includes some advanced features which might be useful .
can you provide any useful example that shows ienumerable could be more useful than iqueryable
a c-style for-loop has more flexibility but ultimately you can write an equivalent loops with python s while or c s while for that matter which touches not only on the Ã¢ Åone obvious wayÃ¢ principle but also Ã¢ Åsimple is better than complexÃ¢ amongst others
and simd math libraries for sse and avx however they seem to be more sse than avx2
also in this case keyboard input is essential and more important than mouse interaction
you could use memcpy memset for strings too but strcpy is simpler
if you don t mind the libc allocation functions realloc is even more efficient it wont copy the data on a shrink just mark the extra memory as free and if you grow the memory and there is memory free after it will mark the needed memory as used and not copy either
electron should be a drop in replacement for nwjs node-webkit and offers more flexibility over when to show and hide windows
i have a validation on the droppable for not adding more than one draggable per droppable
if you re unsure which version you have or you are targeting a version earlier than air sdk 3.2 you can download the latest air sdk pre-merged with flex sdk from adobe s gaming site download the adobeÃ¢ airÃ¢ sdk save it to disk and link its location to flashdevelop
postgresql is picky pickier than mysql -- all fields in the select list when using distinct must be present in the order_by and group_by clauses
technically this could also be done by customizing a qtableview widget but qgraphicsscene is more robust for custom graphics and performance
i ve created an application with this library instead of jgraph because i thought that jung is easier to learn than jgraph for newbies even if it provide less features
hence your subclassing is accepting less classes than the superclass contract promises
more than this methodology i would suggest to you to do the training directly in keras as it claimed that keras optimizers are 5-10 times faster than tensorflow s optimizers
upgrade solr to a newer versioning seems have sort this problem likely newer versioning has a better heap memory management
the uinavigationcontroller class seems to handle better rotations than uiviewcontroller
this platform is probably not representative of your microcontroller but the test shows that on this platform the subtraction is considerably slower than the division
however if you have special needs regarding properties such as specific get accessor implementation needs then better define a function which gets the value as you need it
the for-loop here is more efficient for 2 reasons a you don t have to construct a temporary arrays of tuples like with zip and b it returns false as soon as a non-match is found
me too don t get any advantages for joomla it s big system and it just as good as wordpress for regular projects just wordpress is much simplier
i want to add a uiview of smaller frame as subviews to parental view but i am not getting the needed
unless you re doing very heavy processing working with a single frame is probably faster than transferring it to the server as far as i know emgucv in c# isn t considerably slower than opencv in c c++
i second macports it is more up to date than fink and closer to the freebsd ports system where i come from
we even setup replicas outside aws using stunnel and put ssd drives as the primary block device and we get ridiculous read speeds for our reporting systems - literally 100 times faster than we get from rds
but you will have loops the outer arrays in order to get it to work which would be better done with a for-loop so you reference both at once
perhaps 128bit distributed-system internet-wide pointers but no more than 64bit in a system call or perhaps even a legacy 32-bit limit
in my personal openion mysql is slower than postgresql and mongo db
obviously for something like show hide functionality a checkbox makes more sense than a button
this is where i learned that localization is a lot more than translation
most noticeably if you look or google-chrome firefox and then internet explorer 9 you ll notice that the terms and conditions are slightly higher than in google-chrome or firefox and thus slightly touching the main content area
is there a better function than show hide which looks as nice as the accordion does
its really strange that the same doesn t work with a while loops as is said that a while loops is more fundamental that a for-loop
2 that code appears to be less secure than the bsd solaris versions since it doesn t take into account the saved setid bits
i m well aware that inline is more of compiler decision than of user going so far as even to inlining non-specified inline-functions so the user control is almost negligible
last to address other answers while you should use post data when modifying something it is in no way more secure than get
delphi users might want to look at free pascal s paralel implementation of libchm since a pascal solution makes it easier embeddable
it looks like the onload function is a more modern convenience method and the old way of checking the result is using onreadystatechange instead
there is a project pyquery that is much faster as it uses lxml.html library speed comparasion can be found here
i fixed this by adding after the for-loop and before the return statement which fixes the problem but if the for-loop is written to continue while i is less than the arrays length and when the arrays only contains a the length is one and i is 0 shouldn t it also pop a
the f indicates an rtp profile where the timing of rtcp feedback is more relaxed
with explicit superclass calling your subclassing can accept more or fewer arguments than its superclass and can decide itself what to pass when calling the superclass
the fresco docs explain how to use drawees and you can see right from their xml definition that they are much more customizable than imageview
i tried to do it in server s pom.xml file and i set the impl module to provided scope so the jar file is not longer contained in war but now the tests are failing as after unpacking the war file used for running the tests does not contain the impl jar file which is required for that
as others have mentioned you want to be careful with your hash since it s easy to do something that s not really secure h salt password is far weaker than h password salt but at the same time you want to balance the effort put into this with the value of the site content
but i don t know anything about sinatra and padrino is the footprint and speed really that better than ruby-on-rails
the damerau-levenshtein algorithm includes many comparisons and int compare much faster than chars
some browsers implement the mouseenter mouseleave events that i ve noticed are more accurate than mouseout
solution c using slideup and slidedown it works smoother and nicer
its just a name they choosed it because odoo provides more than openerp for example web site modules
add smaller webview as a subviews to the uiview
dbcontext api is easier to work with than objectcontext but both approaches use the former
remember disk is 1000s of times slower than ram
there exist battery-backed packages of ram modules which can act as an ultra-fast hdd substitute but if they attach via sata scsi or other typical disk interface the still are slower than system ram
i ve been told that coalesce is less costly than isnull but research doesn t indicate that
i was also going to recommend nginx + fastcgi as i prefer nginx to lighttpd it s better mantained or at least that s been my perception the last few years
opengl is better for playing around and experimenting because you can easily draw triangle without messing with hardware buffers available on larger selection of platforms plus glsl is better than hlsl because it doesn t compile into assembly
is there a simpler way than a for-loop to create this arrays or no
for other databases like mysql and postgresql there is simpler solution
but if you want a full-fledged java ee 6 server then glassfish 3 or jboss 6 is a better alternative
we can use tidyverse extract from tidyr to split group into group and decision then replace the group value to 1 if the percentage extracted the number with parse_number from readr is greater than or equal to 90
or go a little higher level than reportlab xhtml2pdf - now weasyprint built on top of reportlab
if the apps versioning number is bigger it s an upgrade and you now need to save that as the last installer versioning
google-chrome always reports 250 for both widths as expected but firefox always reports a larger number though the exact number may depend on the os and or version of firefox and or phase of the moon
stringtokenizer is faster than stringbuilder
normally a server wouldn t need to know the client s address beforehand but udp s knottier than tcp the more usual stream-oriented approach to socket communication in many ways
for removal and transliteration there is a better tool called tr translation or delete characters
however if i d built a new site with a cms on java i d probably go with magnolia cms because the documentation and community is more mature despite that it s newer than opencms
union all is generally faster than using distinct or grouping
on the other hand functions like printf or puts have more overhead per call than putc printf has to process the format string and puts has to call strlen or equivalent but that overhead only happens once no matter how many bytes you re writing
at least for .executemany oursql seems to be more proficient than mysql-python as the sql statement is only prepared once for all submitted values
magma routine magma_gemm has higher performance than cublas in some cases
you need to use tolist to convert it from ienumerable because the ilist interface supports more functionality than the ienumerable interface
in firefox it s much better than google-chrome but still not as black as ie
innodb is more strict in data integrity while myisam is not as
so how is it possible for pypy to be faster than cpython also becomes fairly obvious
although because pbkdf2 applies your hash function a large number of times a long salt is less important than in traditional straight hashing applications. for my application i use a 32 byte random salt unique for each users account where i m hashing their password with pbkdf2
fread performs faster and more efficiently than read.table but read.table produces less no errors on the same data set
the bitwise operators are generally faster than modulo and division operators
it s much more than post get etc
since most data-storage mechanisms in-ram in a database etc. get a lot slower as you put more data in them you should ensure you re only timing your http access and not looking at overall crawler throughput including storage
internet telephony is a lot more than sip - rtp rtcp sdp on-device audio handling etc.
when people say that unix filesystems are better they might mean to be saying oh ext3 stores bits in such as way that corruption happens way less than ntfs but they might also be talking about design choices made at the common layer above
replaced strcpy with strncpy which is much safer apparently and that removed the segmentation fault
some possible options that might be nicer than multiple dialog pop-up
but in my opinion for most sites expressionengine is a better choice than wordpress
it looks like at least on safari and firefox prototype runs significantly faster edit not 20x as stated earlier
jpgraph has far more capabilities than phpgraphlib
i also know there is nginx and haproxy although i have never used either of them and have a lot more experience with apache
however linux pretend i said ubuntu is even better environment for ruby on rails development and it installs great in vm
from my pov the object pascal paradigm used with fpc object pascal dialect which can coexist with the default object pascal code is more advanced lightweight and integrated than the interface-based plumbing of delphi xe2 compiler with on-the-fly marshalling using rtti
however arrayfun is just a for-loop in disguise and is often slower than writing loops explicitly
if my guess is incorrect please edit your question and add the missing information column separators number of columns... note that the tsv and csv format is trickier than it seems
instead of using the endian conversion functions you could use the qdatastream functionality with any qiodevice which is much easier and more intuitive in my opinion
lxml is supposed to be much faster and efficient and can do much more than beautifulsoup
myisam is faster for certain queries and supports fulltext and spatial indexes while innodb is transactional and more concurrent
it is great if you want to use git as frontend for an existing svn server but for a one-time conversion you should not use git-svn but svn2git which is much more suited for this use-case
technically accessing the ivar directly is faster than using accessor but there are very few situations in which it will make a significant performance difference and would probably be a case of premature optimization
richfaces has better ajax support than icefaces
getimagedata has a for-loop i realised that each index in loops is called more than once
when people talk about pypy using less memory than cpython this is a major part of what they re talking about
but when i used iperf on two linux machines to send data using both udp and tcp i found that tcp performs better than udp for 10mb of data
our team use django as our frame before but now we use flask as our frame because it is more light than django but we still use django template.
if you pick up something like mips and get the hang of it x86 is less of a monster to learn
i have an imageview that is bigger than a textview and i want to center the textview on top of the imageview both vertically and horizontally
if i have to use the value of counter in my program then i think while loops is better than for-loop
mockito has been around a lot longer than scalamock and is much more actively maintained because of it s much larger contributor base
64bit amd and later intel machines run faster than 32-bit x86 machines because when amd designed the new instruction set they added more cpu registers and made sse math the default
but if it works with large datasets the users will notice that using the malloc -only program slows down other programs much more than the realloc -using program with the same data
if you take that segment of html code and run it in a browser i tested it with latest google-chrome and firefox it adds one more th element in the table the final page has 4 columns instead of 3 and i have absolutely no clue why this happens
specialname is more than properties accessor event add remove methods count here as well that s why you have to check the names as well
in short it s worse design to move things to the base class than it is to downcast to the specific class
mongodb supports no more than 100 levels of nesting for bson
i simply want to get the genre id3-tag of an mp3 file but the id3v2 utility returns more information than i require and i don t understand what this data represents
in google-chrome it seems .prototype is faster firefox shows no difference between the two although generally performs slower than google-chrome
if it can be practically determinized this give you a dfa that can be exponentially larger than the nfa then by all means do that
in addition to the previous answers the strncpy char pointer which seems unsafe for my opinion and the malloc which is safer but you need to remember to free it outside of the function and its inconsistent with the hierarchy of the program you can do the following
cannot sleep run atomically in soft irq context and are guaranteed to never run on more than one cpu of a given processors for a given tasklet
atof is indeed better in reading floating point values than istream
i am more familiar with express than koa but could also see it going in the entry server.js file
you are mixing libraries and levels of libraries jogl and lwjgl are both pretty thin wrappers around opengl iirc lwjgl has more wrappers for openal audio
the reason to do this is because even though there is an integer division instruction div idiv in the instruction set it s typically very slow several times slower than multiplication
i ve used both uploadify and plupload both are nice plupload has more bells and whistles though and has things like html 5 drag drop from desktop supported
in my opinion it will probably be easier to integrate with codeigniter although someone more experienced with cakephp might prove me wrong
i find setinterval is a little cleaner than chaining settimeout calls
cpython runs on more architectures than pypy and has been successfully adapted to run in embedded architectures in ways that may be impractical for pypy
postgresql is stricter to the sql standard than mysql is
but avro offers far more than just doing away with the need for your own writables although that is in my view a considerable plus it offers fairly efficient serialization the choice between serializing against generated entity classes like thrift requires or using a so-called genericrecord structure instead and not having to have tagged data
the reason to use post for sending sensitive data is that it prevents data leakage via the query string although another way would be to use get with custom headers set although post makes much more sense
corecompile input file c buildagent temp buildtmp.netframework version v4.0 profiling client.assemblyattributes.cs is newer than output file bin debugging dllname.xml
the rule of thumb is that if a cpu is given more than double the count of actively running threads as it has execution units these are the physical cores on a cpu chip and logical processors like hyperthreading technology that splits one core into two then the os will spend more time scheduling threads and switching between them cache-thrashing than it will spend actually running the threads
to be perfectly honest i junit is way more popular than testng at least here where i work and live
just because you have data that is larger than your ram amount doesn t mean the node should go down it just means that not all documents will be available in ram and the node will sometimes have to fetch from disk slower
vbscript is much more convenient than creating an activex on vb6 or c# vb.net
for large and complicated systems yes there are enough bugs quirks that can rear their ugly heads - i am convinced that the reason that people tend to always go with mysql over postgresql is that the name mysql is much more attractive
this particular jboss runs in a vm with 4gb of ram and 2 cpu s and more than enough disk space it has never has less than 5gb free at any time
turns out this was a hardware failure the aes commands need more power than the des crypto1 ones 50 more which the antenna failed to deliver at the reading range i was testing with
on top of that fink gives you access to more packages than macports
you might want to give the data.table package a try check out the fread function which is much faster than read.table
first of all i recommend you to use ogg instead of mp3 has better performance
yes sha1 is a better hash than md5
fifth many-to-one is much easier to use correctly in nhibernate and i assume hibernate than one-to-many collection mapping
it s a little less magic than metaclass but it also means you re going to have to remember to decorate each subclassing
doing it with mouse is much more slower than it can be done with keyboard
be aware that guaranteeing immutability by having no public or protected constructors is easier to break than making the class final
ram is always faster than disk
gtk and qt are two of the most common ones these days but there are others such as motif which is older and doesn t look as nice
either the tcp or udp protocols could be used to achieve this although tcp is probably easier
although it depends on your project size and requriments i recommend devxpress and telerik web windows .i ve used componentart telerik devxpress and i think telerik is better if u are developing web applications.and devxpress are better in winforms.by the way while developing in some cases i came across especially performance problems in telerik products.nevertheless telerik is good choice for web development
when you put more than one qwidget on a qt form you should always use some kind of qlayout the quickest way to fix your problem is to select all items in your form and click on the grid layout button the one with 3 x 3 small squares on top of the designer box
i think having each permutation in their own container that you hide show is the better solution
relatively speaking the string concatenation in your code is probably going to be slower than the int and boolean comparison operations you have here
at the qualities i m recording 720p or 1080p the file size of an hevc-encoded video should be 40-60 of an identical h.264-encoded video and i am seeing this when i use the default camera app on ios but when i use avassetwriter as above or in the project linked above i m seeing file sizes be about three times larger with hevc than with h.264
those attributes let you create objective-c code which is more understandable by swift and complier warn you when you break the rule for example
although the calculation method that uses a prime a multiplication and an addition is slower than a single xor it gives you an overall better hash code in situations when you have multiple fields
if you just expect puppet to restart httpd simple because you asked it to then you either need to use a program like ansible which is more of an actual task manager or use some kind of inotify thing to see that a certain file has been changed so httpd must be restarted
it api seems for me easier than swt you haven t got to manage disposing components by hand to prevent memory leaks you adding component to panel instead of constructing components with parent panel information former is closer to my previous experience...etc. native look and feel you can get in swing too overall performance is enough good swt should be faster because it s using native components of backed os - but is the performance gain really big pro
please keep in mind that qmake and qbs are two very different build systems with fundamentally different designs and capabilities and qbs verbosity is in part due to its fundamental architectural differences which make it far more powerful than qmake will ever be capable of
yes i know ftp is better than telnet but right now i m stuck with telnet
further than that i wouldn t use apache at all if i needed to optimize things nginx is much better as a server it s even faster than node.js for serving static files for example
i want my permalinks to be accessable via more than one slug
this example is a bit looser than the inherited model provided by languages such as java -- an animal instance can have any behaviour at all rather than one of a specific set of behaviours depending on its subclassing
tcmalloc is faster than the glibc 2.3 malloc.
i don t want to use boost because that s a library i haven t used extensively yet and i m doing this partly as an exercise to gain greater mastery over the stl
as for not reinventing the wheel like many have said already make sure to first explore the possibilities in the standard template library stl which is much richer than you might think and then look at boost www.boost.org which has libraries for a lot of diverse purposes and they are extremely high quality and some are just works of art like spirit proto lambda and mpl
udp is actually expected to work better than tcp in lossy networks or congested networks
i am trying to use an svg form an image on a website as it s far more crisper than an png gif or jpg that i can use
disk access is much slower than ram
try-catch rsources is fine for some cases but this is the old way and works better when you have more than 1 exception-handling in a block
not only does postgresql have a far more flexible indexing than mysql but the table approaches are very different also meaning the appropriate indexing strategies are as different as the tactics are
i wrote this brute-force converter but your values don t seem to exactly match up with .net type precision - double 64bit is too low precision and decimal 128bit is more
you can use string.isnullorempty and toupper method is in general more accurate than tolower
i read somewhere that nemerle s macro service is more powerful than boo s
ats is a dependently-typed language that is designed for low-level programming though it s somewhat less elegant than agda
you likely aren t using appropriate plugin and would do better with droppable and draggable
as you can see the swift example is more complex and error prone than your objective-c code
having seen a question here on so about joining strings i have done some testing and came to knowledge that joining a string in a foreach is slower than with a for-loop and using the indexes in the arrays
note it is preferrable to use a series of if statements instead of a switch as long as the old versioning is smaller than the versioning for the n-th step upgrade that step
and it would look better with the firefox s google-chrome hidden
with these options jruby on rails gives about the same or better performance than mri
as far as tcp goes i think tcp is more generally used protocol for more data-centric requests like chat or things that require packet integrity udp tolerates packet loss to lower latency
how can i make the two droppable div s to not accept more than one draggable elements
nginx works great by itself and will likely be much faster than apache
some common examples are the crc checksums of which crc32 is very common but you can also relatively easily compute 64 or 128 bit or even larger crcs much much faster than an md5 hash
std map though is actually implemented in a way that many operations are slower than dictionary as its size gets large
a malloc free pair can be better than a realloc if you don t need to keep around the original memory
for the uber-jar applications i use maven-shade-plugin for merging jars into one + proguard for shrinking but appassembler is much quicker and stable to use
but when is fork and clone better than pthreads
i had one further issue that related to the oncollectionchanged - the notifycollectionchangedeventargs required an index as opposed to the item of the sorteddictionary which is doesn t come out of the box it s easier with a sortedlist but anyhow
obviously this may cause problems such as missing functionality that was released in later versioning of devtools but if you can t upgrade it s better than not having it
i have made some testing and it came out that rsa is lot slower than dsa
dr don t just repeat the old quicksort beats heapsort it s more complicated
2 layout-hdpi uses layout-mdpi because it s the best candidate it is the folder that theoretically should fit better with the hdpi screens because layout it s totally generic
fuzzyset is much faster than fuzzywuzzy difflib for both indexing and searching
because of tcp requires connection and provides security it is slower than udp and therefore it should not be preffered during a video streaming
although putting data with post method little harder than simple get
but even in that approach i always prefer to use the safer strncmp than strcmp
if it s only one colour you want selecting you can use a radio button instead which would be a better idea than a checkbox
it seems that zsh is more configurable than bash but also more complicated
i was testing on google-chrome win7 but with firefox it seems worse
at times the get rate is slower than the put rate and we see messages backing up
one framework that tries to do more in the template while remaining less bloated than jsf which isn t that hard anyway is apache tapestry
2 install the firefox extension there s also one for google-chrome but the firefox one is more reliable -- so if you re a google-chrome addict like i am then use both
this approach seems more complicated and possibly less clear than inheriting protected and then using into public the base class members your child class actually needs to expose
traditionally there was a huge difference in speed imperative has fewer overheads because it s more directly like the computer works but some more modern compilers of declarative code seem to be in the top few of the speed tables a lot of the time - compiled verses interpreted makes a much bigger difference than imperative vs declarative which is why python etc are often slower even though they re imperative
note that i much much much prefer the ansi standard coalesce but sql server has done us the favor of documenting why isnull is better effort that imho could have been spent fixing the problem
then again it s better than settimeout setinterval which fires only once per second if the tab is not active in google chrome a common use case for audio file listening
although allocating with and freeing with is probably more c++ than malloc and free
i have made an app similar to yours for android we use boofcv whose surf is much faster than opencv
myisam is not faster than innodb anymore for most types of queries
for example nunit offers more assert methods than mstest
apparently google-chrome is pickier than firefox
if you want to use something in front of it though i suggest you use something like nginx better than apache since nginx is also asynchronous like node and it s performs really well at serving static files
same functionality different machine code output bit shifting operations are almost always faster than multiplication division on most architectures
another analogy could be using map dictionary to model anything objects data event handlers etc but using a more specialized form of map dictionary makes things more explicit
i would also suggest to replace terms like a l1 0.3e1 with as multiplication is faster then division
what i want to do is to check how many seconds the time is after loops and then if the time taken to finish the for-loop is less than 60 sec than run the mysql update
it is often useful to have different accesses for the two most often a more restrictive setter than getter and so the likes of
the upcoming canopy 1.2 release in a couple of weeks will include more complete integration with ptvs and visual studio that will automate this and remove the need for canopy to be the default python environment
ok guys i cant find better solution with show hide or something so i added snippet to be more easy if someone find solution why when back to top opacity still 0 i need when back to top opacity to be 1
i also checked prolog and it seems a pretty cool language easy to do relations between data and easier than lisp but i d like to hear what you think
i would say that the quicksort is simpler for parallelizing than the mergesort
also symfony on windows with xampp will run much slower than on linux ubuntu system
https can be quite slow over a 3g connection as the overhead in terms of number of packets to setup an ssl connection is higher than a plain tcp connection.
i tried to use jquery and the scroll event it s working on google-chrome but not on safari and is definitely less smooth than on the example
it appears to be centered in ie but in firefox and google-chrome it appears more to the left
while mysql has a larger user base postgresql is gaining more an more popularity ever since implementing several crucial features that were missing in earlier versions
udp is way lighter and faster but somewhat less reliable than tcp
from my tests bitblt is x75 faster than stretchblt
most importantly for your image processing app the compiler will optimize swift code to run faster than objective-c
for beginners freeglut or glfw is more simple and portable than pure win32
all have more or less cumbersome and non-obvious error checking involving errno strtol is way much better than atoi in any case so avoid using atoi
innodb has better crash recovery while myisam is poor at recovering
nsstring is more general as it leaves you the oppertunity to create another subclass of it that could add the altering functionality without using the nsmutablestring s implementation why ever you would want that to do
almost all sip voip providers allow you to forward calls from an attached did telephone number to more than one sip device so your request could be satisfied by a basic account on your friendly neighbourhood voip provider
python is an interpreted-language so by definition is slower than other compiled-language but the drawback in the execution speed is not even noticeable in most of applications
ivy but gradle does it better
you can hide show the status bar on android 4.1 api level 16 and higher by using hide show functionality
x-tag 2 is now using the polymer polyfills so it may not be much better than polymer but worth considering
filtering indexing sorting all is simpler that way
using a virtual machine such as vmware or virtualbox makes this easier
firefox has a more advanced plugin than the google-chrome extension but both work
when writing your server bear in mind that the sequence of events for a tcp socket is much harder than for a udp socket since as well as the normal socket and bind calls you also have to listen and accept
google-chrome is letting me get into bad habits and is happy to parse that format but firefox is stricter
you can use the javascriptconverter class when you need more control over the serializable and deserialization process
g_vertex_buffer_data and g_color_buffer_data are the arrays of data to use you will likely need to set up some shader code and the render code still has to be added but this is how to have more than one vbo texture coords colours normals etc
the memcpy version is not more complex or more dangerous than the strncpy version
can anyone please let me know what is difference between for-loop or foreach loops which is faster from both of them
both commands works in the same way only difference is yum list installed output maybe bigger than rpm -qa because yum will show package dependencies also in its output
you should also keep in mind that sortedlist performs worse than sorteddictionary during construction if the items are not inserted in already-sorted order although in this particular case it is highly likely that dates are inserted in chronological sorted order which would be perfect
basically the way google-chrome renders text looks ugly and i want it to look like or almost like firefox or safari which looks thinner and better
old thread but in my experience writing server-side code with ucma is somewhat easier than trying to use ucwa - and all that ucwa really is is a ucma application sitting on your lync s4b server with a rest wrapper
without adding any extra complexity to the rockauto site it appears to structure it s tree view as make-year-model-variant but year doesn t really have any attributes or children or parent it s more like an attribute of model
to me it looks like safari gets it more right than firefox text is generally more around a middle line
and naturally a pragmatic design where you wrap the various records in a class the userprofile class with getter setter methods makes transitions simpler as you can easily hack in versioning at one place
directx is way faster than gdi
though it has a couple of rules that check for specific security issues it s far less advanced than veracode coverity or fortify in this respect
swift is lot smarter than objective-c about singleton class
mbunit has compatible syntax with nunit but has more features especially data driven tests
in cs insertion-sort is less commonly used because we have much better algorithms quicksort and merge-sort come to mind
so whether or not method 5 or 6 is faster depends on the cpu i can only surmise this is because the branch prediction in the command processors of the cpu is smarter on the new processors but i m not really sure
after you upgrade the application such that the versioning number in the app is higher than the versioning number in the database on disk the sqlitehelper code notices and calls the +onupgrade + method with the old and new versioning numbers
however i can t tell you right now if this cost is higher than the serializable and deserialization cost
better than modifying superclass output would be to modify the superclass so that the subclassing can provide the appropriate shape name
now since the pseudo-element is below all of the floated children the parent div happens or better yet seems to contain the floated children as well - which is really what you want
there are certain types of browser event that selenium struggles with that sahi handles much better
centos is more consistent and reliable because it is enterprise while ubuntu is geared towards desktops and personal computers
when the data is on disk titan is faster than neo4j cause it has a better disk representation
if your default audio subsystem is pulseaudio common for fedora ubuntu debian it is better to properly recompile pyaudio and underlying c library portaudio with pulseaudio support only without jack and other subsystems
you should check this thread why get method is faster than post
a fairer comparison would be comparing stringstream to the printf sscanf line of functions which would be slower than strtod but still faster than stringstream
have a look at this post it is probably easier to get the selected radio button by changing your itemscontrol to use a listbox with the existing datatemplate
if you use svn then it still okay because svn handles binary files much better than cvs
there are lots of cpu gpu combinations where a 32b integer multiply is faster than a 32b floating-point multiply on cpu and vice-versa on gpu
an initial get request to a page usually costs less than subsequent post anyway so there s not much reason to avoid it
post or get is not really make difference in security if your code is vulnerable to injections post or get method would not make any difference or even you can say get is more secure because get url will be logged entirely in log files and if there was an injection in your code you can find entire injection code part in log files but post data will not be logged
it s simpler deals with salt for you in a completelly transparent way makes way for updates both in encryption algo and in hash time cost and comes bundled in a nice api
on a button click javascript validation should be if a user select one checkbox it should allow to process further to any script but when user selects more than one checkbox it should prompt that you can select only one check box
to sum up the webchromeclient is easier to use but the webviewclient allows you more configuration
mgcv and gam does not depend on each other but since mgcv is more popular than gam many packages has dependency on mgcv for example car
if old is greater than new free the extra old pointers on the end before doing the first realloc so you don t leak memory
i want to have the milliseconds or better captured by fluentd and then passed on to elasticsearch so that the entries are shown in the correct order
in your case postgresql may be a better option than mysql because your query is going to likely be against secondary indexes
i have been trying out redmine to see if i like it better than mantis
we updated freetype in osx 10.6.5 and fontconfig which links against freetype wants this newer version
in your check there is only one loops needed and a for-loop is much more conveniant
i would like the column extrema of my dataframe beeing max2015 if max215 is bigger than max or smaller than min2015 if min2015 is smaller than min
because sha256 hash are much longer than md5 hash you can detect the hash algorithm by looking at the length of the hash
after doing more research i now feel that using a dependency manager like the documentation recommended cocoapods or carthage is a better option than manually adding the framework to the project
my issue affects all browsers ie being slightly quicker than google-chrome or firefox according to that issue ondisconnected was delayed only when navigating to another page in the project - in my case ondisconnected is not called immediately even when i close the tab or navigate to an external page
also keep in mind that once ram is exhausted your program will start running in virtual memory on disk which will probably cause far more disk i o activity than the program itself so if you re concerned about disk i o your best bet is probably to make sure that the batch of data you re working on in memory doesn t get much greater than available ram
this approach using purely images screenshots and generating mouse and keyboard events is more similar to manual testing activities performed by real people which have just monitor mouse and keyboard
as kibana is the webui for elasticsearch it is better make it high availability
i normally use something like this tag.object.annotate num_post count post .filter num_post__gt 2 to get tags with more than 2 post
jpql or hql is much more expressive and it s much easier to predict the associated generated sql query
you didn t provide a full code sample that includes the surrounding loop presumably there is a surrounding loop so it is hard to answer definitively but the main problem i see is that the latency of the dependency chains of your fma code is considerably longer than your multiplying + addition code
there are other multidimensional trees that are usually better than kd-trees quadtree r trees like r-tree but much faster for updates or ph-tree
first the sub-directories of your src directory should mirror the sub-directories of your include directory this is just to keep things intuitive also try to keep your sub-directory structure reasonably flat shallow because deep nesting of folder is often more of a hassle than anything else
for certain kinds of transactions a stateless session may perform slightly faster than a stateful session
snappy also consistently decompresses 20 + faster than lzo which is a pretty big win if you want it for files you re reading a lot over hadoop
the boilerplate code would multiplying rapidly when the express get more complex than addition of two terms
as far as easy goes they are both equivalent in terms of difficulty both provide assembly and c except that the gnu toolchain for avr is more complex than microchip because it requires use of unix command line etc
create new string which will collect edited versions of each word you can use stringbuilder or better stringjoiner with delimiter set as one spaces
go with gwt-rpc or better newer with requestfactory
lxml is much faster than beautifulsoup and probably the fastest parser available for python
innodb table is a bit slower than myisam tables but i don t think it is a major problem as you told you are using drupal system is that a kind of mult-sites like a word-press system
and looks like your php versioning is less then 5.5 so upgrade your php versioning 5.5 and it will work
i have to say that this combination is much better than aptana radrails 2 or aptana 3 for developing ruby on rails apps
if you always keep track of the lengths of your strings you can compare lengths and use memcmp which is faster than strcmp
therefore serving and caching images from nginx or apache still seems the better choice
i think that functional declarative programming haskell scheme lisp etc is more powerful and more abstract than imperative programming and therefore is intrinsically harder to learn
what i am hearing from our group leader is that postgresql is better than mysql when working with coordinates
note also that gson comes with less features out of the box than genson or jackson
out of experience i m involved to a project that uses huge amount of data using mysql and we mostly prefer myisam for data that can be generated it allows to achieve much higher performance losing transactions but generally speaking myisam is faster but innodb is more reliable
for example i ve noticed nvidia s glsl compiler is a little more picky than ati s and rejects some shader code that otherwise works fine
the use of a presenter is closer to mvp and gets away from the dependency injection model advocated by apple mvc
i have a qgraphicsview nested within a few widgets qframe and then in a qtab and i want to be able to drag-and-drop a qtablewidget which is within the qgraphicsscene onto a totally different widget - another qtablewidget which is much higher up in the window but not a parent
first sort the dataframe by time this should be more efficient than sorting each grouping by time
i ve already done the rsa but dsa is bigger deal to me
you should use strncmp to compare your strings it s safer than strcmp
apache activemq which is way more popular than qpid or rabbitmq - or indeed any jms provider would work just fine
you ve struck lucky with the requirements - because you re going from udp - tcp it s actually a lot simpler than doing udp - udp
anemic domain is when a product or other class doesn t really implement anything more than data setter and getter - no domain behavior
- coalesce should be more portable than isnull
mind that qscopedpointer or std unique_ptr will always work deterministic but qobject destroyed signal doing deferred release via qobject deletelater is more prone to surprises starting from when exactly the object gets released
this blog post provides more info to get started
the first one can be solved by using svn +ssh which is the more comparable format as cvs uses its own protocol as well
i wrote one query but it will fails if a particular parent has more than 10 children
this is because multiplication and division is faster in sse the 80-bit vs 64-bit issue again and that the sse registers are faster to manipulate in the fpu you can only access the top of the stack and rotating the fpu stack is often the slowest operation on a modern processor in fact some have an extra pipeline stage solely for this purpose
yes iostream is slower than cstdio
yesterday i needed to reboot production server on debian 6 with more than 3-y uptime and 3rd party configured billing system on it
it is not easier than the np-complete problem since it can be reduced to it in polynomial time which makes the problem np-hard
usually when people want more flexibility than joptionpane offers it s basically a bunch of static factories for a few dialogs they write their own dialogs using jdialog
the advantage with sphinx is easier integration with mysql and postgresql however lucene is more feature-rich
google-chrome decided to treat them as function declarations and hoists them firefox treats them more like function expressions
swing will save your more time than awt as all the code of components of swing are purely written in java whereas of awt code of components are written in native language that is other than java thus compilation time of awt is more than swing
it is much better than ant because for most common tasks you don t have to write a complicated build.xml maven has very good defaults and it s all convention over configuration
the query optimizer in postgresql is more advanced than in mysql and copes with complicated statements much better especially when it comes to sub-selects
this gives you more flexibility than subclassing because with subclassing you are automatically inheriting all the methods in the superclass which is far more restricting than simply using some of the methods of another class
there can be times when mouseout is a better choice than mouseleave
aviran made a great suggestion with qunit but i think jasmine is better suited for new developers because of its readability and bdd -ness
often gcc g++ code is faster than anything i can produce in asm probably because i am new to assembler and so i don t know very many instructions
mips is much more orthogonal than x86 could ever dream of being
i do understand that traditionally they are saying that lxml are stricter than beautifulsoup however what i do not get is the following
it shows that koa is faster then other framework but as this question is about express and restify express is faster than restify
previously discussed on so why is quicksort better than mergesort
i am looking for a good new component that offers more help with wav and mp3 files too but not found what i am looking for yet
this way it is not ok if the parent has more children let say they are input s
if the sortedlist is populated all at once from sorted data it s faster than sorteddictionary
often myisam is fine in certain other cases innodb is better
or will this result in an md5 hash that is more likely to collide than if i would concatenate the content of all dependent files together
alternatively you could seek out a user-agent parsing library which turns the string into something more useful such as google-chrome windows or safari iphone in which case you could reasonably use a shorter varchar value
thanks to opencv i managed to rewrite everything with wxpython which i know better than pygtk
hmac is better than a plain hash because it is not vulnerable to hash length extension attacks
64bit code is not actually faster it is usually a bit slower than x86 code
qcubed community is much stronger at the moment so you might want to check in qcodo forum for your answers on basic problems but post on the qcubed forum
however naive multiplication will get slower and slower as the exponent increases
the eclipse builder uses simpler logic than maven so sometimes the things m2e does are just not enough
webrequest just offers you more functonality than webclient
using strncpy is considered safier than strcpy because the second one can easily cause buffer overrun
according to some - browser - statistics ie6 market share is still bigger than google-chrome safari and opera together nearly as much as ie7
the answer is simple here - pickle on pypy is slower because it s implemeneted in pure python as opposed to c in cpython
it s like complaining that a sha256 hash is bigger than an md5 hash - yep it is but only one of them might slow the attacker down for a while
so if you are just starting out beautifulsoup may be easier to use instantly but in the end i believe lxml is more pleasant to work with
as a side-effect of implementing proper parent traversal lxml is a bit slower than celementtree for parsing
you may try to listen to uideviceorientationdidchangenotification within your subclass cell to rotate the webview and within your view controller with the table view and run a -reloaddata on your table view in order to properly resize the cells assuming the landscape webview is way higher than the portrait webview
google-chrome is just more forgiving for some mistakes then firefox
i also dilemma to choose in between whileloop and for-loop but think that while loops is more suitable because unknow how many time need to insert the words
md5 is no longer secure and it can be broken with a good gpu no typo you can use your graphics card to break a hash
postgresql is older than mysql so it might have influenced them
using a solution such as a prepare statement where it is not possible for a user to directly influence the actual sql query being execute is a safer alternative
in addition to the suppositions in question 4 supposing that my message is no bigger than the mtu - udp header - ip header size is the udp datagram that results guaranteed to fit into 1 ip packet on my local network at least
you can always develop an application without using getter and setter methods.as you have explained.but using getter and setter is better practice because access modifiers private public gives you encapsulation which is oops feature
personally i felt that scintilla performs better than avalonedit
hash password + salt is better but still not good enough.
it s easier with phpquery or querypath
this command uses key as is if its length smaller than md5 hash block length 64 bytes otherwise its uses md5 key as key and not key derived using cryptderivekey rc4 md5 key like in your implementation
encrypt the passwords with one-way encryption algorithm with a random salt like the common opinionÃ¯Â¼Å¡ sha-256 is stronger than md5
if your application is self-sufficient i would recommend going for tomcat as jboss is much more resource intensive as well as weblogic moreover weblogic costs some money
because lodash is updated more frequently than underscore.js a lodash underscore.js build is provided to ensure compatibility with the latest stable version of underscore.js
datamapper is potentially more complex then activerecord but it s a lot easier to develop your domain model and database asynchronous then with activerecord
activerecord is much simpler then a datamapper but also much more limited
any hash function like md5 sha1 sha256 etc obviously cannot be 100 unique - because they have a fixed length and due to the there must necessarily be non-unique results for input content that is larger than the hash
subjective phpunit provides much nicer code coverage reports than simpletest
in the case of overflow a free malloc pair costs less than realloc because of its internal hidden memcpy
if your author field is selective and sorting is cheaper than filtering
userwarning your cudnn version is more recent than the one theano
this is a radical concept i know but the mouse is slower than keyboard shortcuts
i have found jmeter to be more reliable than soapui or loadui
if your compiler can do this then writing functions in a way that the compiler is able to inline is better than manually inlining the calls yourself
if you have the money ericgorr is right perforce is much nicer to work with then svn
this is my first experience setting up lighttpd as i thought it would be more suitable than apache in this case
so in what platform and how memcpy can be significantly faster than memmove if there is none why providing two similiar functions instead of just memmove and lead to a lots of bug
xfce runs much smaller than gnome and is full featured
none of the .net libraries are there and there are some syntax differences as vb.net is more strict than vb6 is
but i don t know why the size of mp4 video with h.264 codec is bigger than the size of the image set in the only implementation i found so i made my own archive format that is basically the imageset merged together in 1 file and compressed with snappy plus the info for split them again
data should be in post or get.if you dont put your data in your form then you will have to use get which is less secure than post
a get request will be slightly smaller than a post although using websockets would give a more accurate figure
parsley is more robust and adds a lot more features than robotlegs which is why its been used in the world s largest flex applications
i hate to answer a request for a solution in language a by suggesting a solution in language b but what you are doing here falls into the class of problems which xslt handles much better than xquery
since package protected is less accessible than public the code is reducing the accessibility of the foo method
generally the division is more costly than addition i think but not much difference in this case
then again smarty 2 is years old v3 has been with us for years and twig is far more practical in the html5 age
i have tried firefox and it better than google-chrome crash issue is not always happen but not solved this issue
edit just checked the performance of intersect it is slower than using .all with contains
the class of problems you can solve with while loops is strictly more powerful than those you could have solved with the strict for-loop found in pascal
multiplication is more expensive than addition subtraction and division is more expensive still
testing and support of ant code is quite expensive and integration with maven adds even more complexity
to convert to integer a string passed as argument to your program use atoi or strtol which does better error checking
generally the performance of hard filesystems like ntfs is better than that of traditional unix filesystems
you will probably use both in large projects - put the definitions of the functions that should be inline and templates in the header and put the ones that inlining makes less sense for in the cpp
however as things stand right now ironpython is much more mature and has much better performance than ironruby so you may prefer to use that
according to this analysis aes rijndael-128 is more than twice as fast as des 3des with a bigger key size more secure
it s even possible that you could implement pong using only integer arithmetic which is likely to be faster than floating-point -- but the difference is unlikely to be critical
also take a look at silex as this has lower overhead than symfony and works with symfony forms
just keep in mind most of the time c is faster than python but then again most of the time pypy is faster than cpython
it s not even a webkit issue unless google-chrome s got a newer version than safari
i found programming google-chrome extensions easier than firefox but i couldn t come across something similar to xpcom in google-chrome
if you re just going to loops through point use a for-loop as while-loop is more prone to dropping into an endless loops if you forgot to increment counter or doing wrongly or do it in multiple places
lxml uses libxml2 and provides a nicer interface the elementtree so you get most of the benefit of libxml2 s speed and all of the benefit of it s xpath evaluation
using comparator instead of putting all the logic directly in the comparable gives you more flexibility in the order that things are compared in
but the the foreach loops takes more time than a the for-loop
nginx also happens to be better than apache at writing logfiles interestingly
in this case post may be better than get anyways
innodb tables are about 4x bigger than their myisam counterparts
i have experienced situations where union s made a query much slower than union all with a distinct afterwards
it has to do with the fact that multiplication is itself done by means of binary shifts and additions - far fewer than with division
i prefer using for-loop instead of foreach loops for-loop is preferably faster than foreach loops when you do not have to do something to each element and can solve your problem by just using the index as follows
firefox is just better for web development and i prefer safari overall
i d question whether get is the right verb here considering you need to pass a complex type it sounds like it would be better served as a post
suggestion is to put operation in viewdidappear but it also seems to work in viewwillappear and is slightly less ugly
tcp is subject to higher latencies than udp as it requires the client to send back packet confirmations
however a post request is less efficient as a get request - bear that in mind and only use post if you really need to
i have a file that i need to transmit through udp reliably i know tcp is the better option
if you are looking for location based queries in relational databases postgresql is more matured compared to mysql
i like the idea of the of editing inside the terminal and like the key bindings of vim but the text highlighting in my vim is much worse than in textmate
raphael supports older versions of ie whereas d3.js is based on current web standards
lz4 is probably better though snappy was developed by google with protobufs in mind so you might want to test both on your data set.
that s better than setinterval or settimeout
but adding a class to swt package seems harder first because there is different jars depending on the operating system used org.eclipse.swt.cocoa org.eclipse.swt.gtk .... and also because copy pasting the code of styledtext is not that easy since there is call to external methods waiting for a strict styledtext
current task looks like flask is ok for it since it is smaller and simplier than django
ghostscript and imagemagick convert should also be able to do this for you although libtiff is supposedly quicker
if you want to upgrade dependencies major versioning it s more trickier
this solution has the disadvantage that if the other factor is not constant the compiler and you can t reasonably avoid the division int_max n to be done at runtime and division is normally more expensive than multiplication
in all other cases division appears to be several times slower than multiplication
use clutter which is much more suited to animation and integrates with gtk
it s probably overkill for what you need but sproutcore is an mvc framework and it doesn t look any more heavyweight than javascriptmvc or trimpath s junction
i should also say that i have the token at ctx.request.get authorization koa based i think it s something like req.header authorization with express in all routes
i use rspec and capybara together but the language syntax of capybara makes more sense is semantic as rspec when testing for request expectations
most lisp dialects have this concepts in scheme it is rarer since hygienic macros are supposed to reduce its usefulness
public is higher than protected so there s no problem
however if the keys are not comparable how are we supposed to tell whether the children are greater or less than the parent
slower than the cstdio ones and extensibility iostream allows
ogre3d seems to be more mature than irrlicht judging by the amount of applications and games that is
can i use jgraph or is jung better
a for-loop is more adequate than a do while for simply iterating an arrays string
i m having an issue where my glsl 130 code wont run properly on my somewhat modern ati 5850 hardware while the identical code runs perfectly fine on an older laptop with a nvidia card i have
this works because a parent thread will always have an id which is less than its children
in codeigniter and zend-framework which is the better option
can any one tell me which one is better between session facade class and singleton object design patterns in asp.net
it logically follows that 64bit integer is faster than 32-bit and when it comes to 64bit cpu s using a 16-bit data as fast as possible int_fast16_t would have int_fast16_min defined to int64_min instead of the int32_min specified in stdint.h
there is certainly no need to call grep or ls because the same can be done easier with qregexp and qdir
if you want to bind data to gridview datalist datalist controls then better option you should use datatable dataset or you can use list ex list
more or less the same thing as the accepted answer can be implements more succinctly by extends the gridviewpager like this
actually it is much better than soapui because with jmeter you can easily read the data from csv and parameterize it
usually multiplication has a higher precedence than addition but the grammar you have posted has the reverse that might be part of your problem
my target is wildfly but glassfish documentation is better so i figured i would start there
if the value of touchesended is more than 3 seconds beyond the current time and the time of touchesbegan is still before touchesended then it s time to show your hint
while you can munge together a solution with ant maven is a better solution for managing dependencies than ant
afaik malloc is not slower than memcpy
it would be better to use strtod for this purpose as it allows for error-checking but atof is simpler to use and so is used here
also this loops is better created as a for-loop
the google-chrome renders the letters using pointy ends but the firefox uses more solid and bold effect
i ve been a senior full stack developer for +3 years and mainly i use yii for php development but i was told that laravel is better so i decided to build an ecommerce script with laravel to get to know laravel more and to see the difference between yii and laravel
edit for clarification miglayout is probably easier to use than gridbaglayout but if you get familiar with gridbaglayout it s not that hard to use and it doesn t require a download since it s part of the core java library
graphicsmagick converted much faster than imagemagick although i did not test conversion with cuda processing
consequently ironpython is potentially faster than cpython is especially for multithreading scenarios
maybe not productive in the same way - i d say vim is quicker for editing files emacs is better at doing everything else again i would personally say things like flymake-mode vcs bindings are such are quicker to use than the vim equivalent
i am writing an app based on uitabbarcontroller which has more than 10 viewcontrollers with corresponding uinavigationcontroller
i believe gridview allows much finer grained control of display than does listview
if you want the fastest encryption algorithm then there s no substitute for testing it yourself - somewhat strangely php s sha1 implementation is significantly faster than its md5 i know these are hash - this is to illustrate that performance depends on implementation as much as algorithm
malloc + memset is slower than calloc under certain conditions
i recommend you to use nginx as an reverse proxy since the configuration is easier and the performance is much better than apache
i know mysql has to choose for either mandatory or optional but mandatory seems the illogical choice for me as this is 1 much more difficult to implement in sql and 2 less common than a parent with optional children
changing it will require a reboot. that will slow things down a bit as the swap file on disk is much slower than ram
junit is older and have more extensions dbunit cactus etc
it is slower than nginx because apache with the event mpm is very roughly equivalent to an event-driven http proxy nginx varnish haproxy in front of apache with the worker mpm
myth 3 strncpy is a safer version of strcpy
i create new branch add those new features and than i once again made pull request but now the features i implemented in the master branch are also in my new branch so my second pull request has more features than i want to push to the original project
not that i think this is a good idea but in c at least you can check if your unsigned integer is greater than int_max for two s complement anyway not so sure about the sign magnitude and one s complement variants but they re probably rare enough that you could safely ignore them until a problem pops up
it won t do anything to change the fact that disk io is orders of magnitude slower than ram
i would like to find better solution than serializable and deserialization
the nice thing about letting the plugin install it for you is that if you re more familiar with ruby-on-rails than padrino as is my case this will not only set things up for you but also show you were the directives need to go
i d strongly recommend to go with allegro 5.1.x it s a little bit more difficult than sfml but very functional and easier than sdl it s got nice support and it s compatible with plenty of os
inspecting the assembly shows that in the sequential access case eigen is faster because the sum becomes vectorized while it does not when using raw boost multi_array
thus ilist is more than ienumerable and you won t be able to get away with it
but using post instead of get presumably adds one more level of protection for xsrf types of attack it does not you need some form of explicit xsrf protection token with post or with get
i can verify that by unchecking the checkbox it does flip the value because i enable disable the next button depending on the myproperty value - i have more than one checkbox btw
i wish program with armadillo and openblas is faster than with only armadillo
i would also be moderately surprised if the multiplication actually was faster than the addition
the tcmalloc library for example can be easily inserted into an application to evaluate performance gains in heavily threaded applications where tcmalloc tends to perform a lot better than libc s malloc implementation
basically a given branch of the tree may be found under more than one parent branch but wherever it is found it has the same children
generally speaking the inline keyword is used more now to allow you to violate the one definition rule when you define a function in a header than to give the compiler a hint about inlining
i haven t chosen a db yet so if mysql or postgresql is better in some way over the other please provide your preference and perhaps why if you have time
so congratulations - you can pat yourself on the back your avx routine is indeed about a third faster than the sse routine tested on haswell i7 here
i suggest that you to move jmock which has a better api or even to mockito whose protocol is even simpler
edit added some getter and setter that makes it clearer how you access object info
it certainly looks nicer and has better usability than mantis or bugzilla but it s not open and it makes some tradeoffs for a simpler interface
while in google-chrome usually another page refresh fix it firefox is more stubborn
hex is somewhat more readable than binary if i happen to be loading a data dump in a text editor etc
when later i upgrade to versioning c of my software i have to test the upgrade paths from a- c as well as b- c versioning n+1 requires n+1 more test cases than versioning n did
of course you might still ask whether to use strncpy or strcpy in implementing that abstraction strncpy is safer there provided you fully grok what it does
when you install a msi with abovementioned settings msi will check if any other product installed with same upgrade code if it finds a product then it will check if the new installation has a higher versioning
i success in plotting distance with points but i need more visual plot with heatmap
phpunit is more popular and up to date as simpletest hasn t had a new release for some time though for testing webforms it s still very useful as phpunit does not have good support for that
if you are interested in more verbose javascript utilities for arrays objects and more check out lodash or underscore.js
crypt with hash is simply more expensive than md5
gitosis which is obsolete for a few years now gitolite is much richer works with bare repos repos without a working tree
if you don t need it to be public it s often safer not to due to getter setter allowing better control over what values can be assigned then you should declare if protected or private
if i set a pixmap to a qgraphicsscene that is larger that the window it will add scrollbars so is it possible to get what is displayed in the qgraphicsview
edited to add myisam is faster than innodb because it is simpler
i do know imagemagick better than graphicsmagick
while memmove will be only slightly slower than memcpy due to the assumptions it needs to make about the source and destination in memcpy they cannot overlap it should still be far superior to any standard loop
myisam is the perfect choice since the database is almost only used for reading and myisam is significantly faster that innodb
use socket for tcp and datagram for udp its a lot faster than tcp but less connection oriented
this may help in case you have a real nth root precision problem but my experiance is that the builtin math.pow double int is more precise
for this particular application sending simple data chunk to the client from an index given by the client tcp will not perform any better than udp
hence as compared to tcp udp is more attractive for delay-sensitive applications like audio video
basically if the user is on a view under the more tab the actual current uinavigationcontroller you want to use to push a uiviewcontroller onto is the uitabbarcontroller s morenavigationcontroller property
when i try to access reporting services via the broswer such as google-chrome or firefox it prompts me for username password in which i do enter but then it gives me an error
most optimizing c compilers optimize it out to a multiplication operation which is much faster than division it can be done only if the divisor is constant though
if it needs to be more specific with processors and stuff let s just say this is for raspberry pi 2a 900mhz quad-core arm cortex-a7 cpu on the latest raspian os
mayavi makes it easier to visualize the data but matplotlib looks more professional
since your disk even if it s an ssd is several orders of magnitude slower than ram the systems gets unresponsive
explain in postgresql is way more useful than in mysql
to the operating system a single thread which i assume is what you mean by java process essentially cannot use cpu on more than one processors which may or may not mean a physical core-- see below simultaneously
post is not any more secure than get
from tensorflow official github how to construct a new dataset for retraining use official python script build_image_data.py directly and bazel is a better idea
in general ogg achieves better compression than mp3 which is a plus for things like download size bandwidth resource usage etc
if your tree is not binary that is a node can have more than 2 children it might be worthwhile to introduce a virtual parent node that has all the real roots as its child nodes
although lxml has better documentation better xpath support and better code for technical reasons i cannot use lxml so i am forced to use elementtree
i am not sure could this be because now the older links after upgrade is been pointed to newer versioning and just linking is not sufficient and need to modify something more on linux
for simple time aggregation influxdb has shown much better results than postgresql and mysql in the order of ten times faster to respond
put is preferred for database updates and post to create new entities so post is better on this case
also i would recommend doing a dual boot to ubuntu it s much easier to work with opencl in a linux cli fashion
firstly i switched from innodb to myisam which is better designed for mysql spatial extensions
i d rather not use use extjs directly - i m looking to expedite delivery and ext.net seems much easier
graphicsmagick provides more extensive api documentation than imagemagick
the server-side way is more reliable and browser-independent while the client-side approach will decrease the amount of incoming traffic to server
also using private and protected instead of public is more about good programming design than security and i recommend you read about it as well as polymorphism and inheritance
also you can make your code simpler by using isnull or coalesce to handle columns which contain nulls
the lone exception is myisam which is an older mysql storage engine which does not support transactions is more prone to corruption and generally tends to perform worse than innodb
together resharper was finding more than justcode
innodb has better crash recovery while myisam is poor at recovering data integrity at system crashes
to draw you can use either plain gdk which is more basic or use cairo which is more flexible drawing library nb
this does not seem to occur in safari or ie and a similar permission error occurs sometimes in firefox but is reproducible more often than not in google-chrome
btw google-chrome is less close to w3c specs than firefox de 42+ i d opt to start using firefox for your initial testing and then test it in ch to detect quirks
dexterity arguably has more better documentation than archetypes see plone.org products dexterity as well as my book professional plone 4 development
instead of using onclicklistener though it uses a class called onitemclicklistener which is more advantageous for using with listview
i cant get the orientation through exif because of my server don t have root access to fix that so i was just going to see if the width is less then the height then rotate them but the code isn t working properly
however it s important to recall that most of .net cryptography is based on cryptoapi even if cng is being more and more exposed in recent fx releases
most often qvector is not the best container to use usually qlist is much better
because hard disk have a much slower memory than ram virtual private server performance may slow down considerably
do you find rails with postgresql is slower than mysql knowing that it produce more query on the background
i know tlistbox renders like this but i require the use of tlistview for the data property also the tlistview handles icons better via a timagelist
i resorted to split the two in swagger list-without-search as get and list+search as post just to put the page in the swagger documentation also if the latter actually works also as get
regarding your question about safety -- the answer is post is absolutely no safer than get
when i want to write the full contents of a file into an outputstream i usually allocate a buffer as a then make a for-loop to read data from the file s inputstream into the buffer and write the buffer contents into the outputstream until the inputstream has no more bytes available
perhaps write a config file for them bower.json for bower and package.json for npm that makes things cleaner and you can ensure installation by running npm install
many people don t know about 8-bit png which is usually better than gif in size.
the reason this is happening is because firefox renders the select box as a taller element than google-chrome and the container of the blue text is getting caught on the select s container element because it s now sticking out lower than the others
it ends up in a state of confusion...you basically cannot release the drag of the table it keeps getting bigger and smaller as you move your mouse - but you can never let go and release it to get the size you want
in some benchmarks i see that myisam is faster than innodb but seems i have a little improvement
webclient is a shorter and more concise syntax but behind the scenes it uses a webrequest so in terms of performance it won t be faster it will be equivalent
i have used a lot more than 10 linux distributions and i now stick to opensuse
if you use shellsort no extra memory is needed at all though shellsort will be much slower than quicksort
i also know that it can deal with flac better than wav and ogg
firefox is more tolerant when it comes to image headers then ie and google-chrome
any suggestions as to how i properly set up the setter getter is more than appreciated
udp suits well for passing short messages but for transferring large amounts of data tcp is more preferable
apache is more flexable then nginx but it comes with a high price in performance
but when anyone human looks at it they look at it in hex using a hex editor which is much easier than reading binary
a post has broader application and is generally used to send persistent data to a server in fact prescriptively get should not be used for this purpose
you can safely store the salt in the db because working out a string from its hash is just as hard when you know some of the string as it is when you know none of it provided the password itself is longer than the salt and long enough and strong enough to take a long time to crack by brute force at least 6 chars with at least one case change and a number or non-alphanumeric i d say
another post outlines some more details on this how to get master-master replication with subversion
i planned on using svgs for the entire site but with only 20-30 svg images of medium to high complexity used in the page and google-chrome already seems to be showing som jank and high paint times for scroll and firefox is even worse though safari seems to do a lot better
i don t want to use apc because opcache is around 10 faster than apc
i saw this swift vs objective-c and it does lead me to believe that swift is more accurate in terms of timing that objective c but i wanted to make sure that was accurate
when there are more than one exception-handling in try-catch block rec_catch_exception triggers
if we remove the font-size it appears properly in google-chrome but shows up smaller in firefox
1- use a sorting algotithm like mergesort or quicksort has better performance with small inputs
integer math is often much faster than floating-point so such a function could be a major performance win
i thought about aborting the request if the interval between mouseenter and mouseleave is lower than a threshold but it does not help
as namedtuple lighter than dictionary
binary tree sort in particular is likely to be slower than mergesort or quicksort because of the tree-balancing overhead as well as cache access patterns.
ironpython and jython are also jit-compiled although using the more generic jvm and .net jits so they tend to be faster than cpython for this kind of work as well
the opengl sin cos implementation has probably higher precision but not by much
in future these lists may be read from disk and larger than available ram
that answer is pretty clear a chars is smaller than an int and when objective-c was designed back in the 80s shaving off a few bytes was always good
google-chrome is just faster than firefox which just faster than ie at bit-wise operations
especially in opera there is much more green in the painting than in google-chrome
you do want to upgrade no further than versioning 2.1.6 at the moment as it s the latest one that supports rails 2.3.x
i have been told innodb is faster on executing writes but slower than myisam doing reads i cannot back this up and could not find any article that analyses this i do however have the guy that told me this in high regard feel free to ignore this point or do your own research
you can simply create a new thread runnable or futuretask to run on an executor and call invokeandwait only when necessary to update components but if you can get away with it invokelater is better
this will make your work easier as searching sorting filtering than handling 3 parallel arrays
although you can directly access a vue instanceÃ¢ s children and parent it is more convenient to use the built-in event system for cross-component communication
so assess the situation the development cost of a udp transport is higher to significantly higher than tcp and to some degree you are re-inventing tcp
if you want to move directives attributes from parent to children this is way more complicated
i have no concrete figures on that but from my own experience i d estimate that instrumented tests are around 100-400 slower typemock seeming to be faster than ms moles
d3.js is not wrong the data is incorrect and leaflet is more lenient
no sw is running on responder side - allows much lower latency 10 times less than typical tcp udp latency
one might want to define kerberos access to more than one ldap server
udp just has a smaller overhead than tcp but that comes at the cost of reliability
it doesn t sound as if you need anything more elaborate than a countif function and a sumifs function
google-chrome is lightning fast when you use the dom api but vastly slower using the .innerhtml operator by a magnitude 1000-fold slower however firefox is worse than google-chrome in some areas for instance the append test is much slower than google-chrome but the innerhtml test runs much faster than google-chrome
if you re simply looking to hide the value from your cross table you shouldn t need anything more than the show hide items menu
if i set the cpu affinity to cpu0 the cpu usage is 5 but after setting affinity to other cpu the cpu usage increased to 9 12 especially set to cpu20 the cpu usage is more than 25
therefore accessing myisam consumes less resources than innodb
instead of using uilabel using uitextview gets better results
innodb is usually much better than myisam at tables being available while insert update and delete are happening because innodb uses row level locking for updates whereas myisam uses table level locking
first option with var as local vaariable and two getter and setter defines better as property because it give option to control input validation and do custom code when setting value like raiseing event
this goes in your root .htaccess but if you have access to httpd.conf that is better
since ubuntu 10.10 is newer than debian squeeze if you can do it on squeeze you can certainly do it on ubuntu
imagick is more resource hungry than gmagick but when i tried to use gmagick it is not working properly
furthermore since at least in java you can only have the access modifier for an overwritten method to allow more but not less access than the superclass method you are still gonna drag either protected member variables or protected getter and setter all the way up in your subclassing
with swift the code is much more readable than with objective-c
i ve read that aes encryption is more secure than the triple des encryption ms is using in their example above
addition happens to be exact in fixed-point as long as it does not overflow but fixed-point multiplication is no more exact than floating-point multiplication
that prohibits you from doing something like having a protected and public overload where the protected overload is the better match
the framespace for the uiviewcontroller becomes smaller because uinavigationcontroller manipulates the view by adding a uinavigationbar which is 44.0f in size
vim includes netrw which is already a filebrowser and i like it a lot more than nerdtree
c++ std map behaves more like a python defaultdict than dictionary
timsort is used by python and java for their sort methods and is rather supernaturally fast but it s a more complex algorithm than mergesort which matters if you re working in something like c - so if you just need something that works pretty well and is simple go with mergesort
i would however argue that ubuntu or centos is a better option when it comes to server installations
also it seems that my view gets called more than once according to the log outputs and that is normal except it should be a post then redirect to a get but it seems to have more than one post request
it uses less resources than unicorn but has more requirements to your code it better be thread-safe because puma is a threaded server
if it is unavoidable node.js has good options - try to use the module cheerio which is faster than heavy weight jsdom
innodb is slower for read only databases because it has features acid compliant row level locking that myisam leaves out
note that i ve incorporated dshin s comment that multiplying is faster than division however the performance improvement is about 90 removing the binary search 10 multiplication vs
it works fine and fits all my needs but recently i found that git works better than bazaar so i decided to use it but i face a problem with git usability because most git s gui not user friendly as bazaar explorer so i want your advice based on a practical experience which best git s gui user friendly or which one is most similar to bazaar explorer
so use ng-if more than ng-show and ng-hide or else the user can just change the visibility option using developer tools
this is happening because of speed of for-loop which is faster than your time .as loops iterates in time of less than miliseconds and generates values.you can only call it when you want to insert single value to database and don t iterate for values
i am trying to explore kde a bit but many of the tools i rely on have fonts that appear so much bigger under kde than gnome even though the chosen font size is the same and the resolution is the same 1920x1200
of late firefox has had much better performance than google-chrome
now don t get me wrong regenerating the session id on login or more accurately as oswap put it on privilege level change is indeed a very good defense against session fixation
udp gives smaller latency with many many issues to discuss here of course tcp gives bigger latency
i saw he used checkbox which to seems much more useful than button since you can take multiple objects out at a time
you can make your life easier by extends each of the components you use to a custom component that either implements its own event but then always the same event like contentchanged or takes a java 8 consumer function that is called whenever the content changes
also you can send a text only to given client determined by the url it can be post but put looks nicer
livescript derived from coco which itself was derived from coffeescript it has the more appealing syntax to me it even has my beloved pipeline | operator from f#
when hdf5 storage can be accessed fast than .csv and when dask creates dataframes faster than pandas why is dask from hdf5 slower than dask from csv
as a side note using toupper is more efficient than using tolower so toupper would be the way to go
to prefer isnull over coalesce when given the choice is that isnull tends to produce query plans that are more efficient than coalesce
in google-chrome there is more files download 47 than in firefox ie 42
i think that the boost manual could have explained how the allocator is used more explicitly
execution of aes is more faster than rsa for same key sizes
if so then you can just pop lines off the array using settimeout which is better than setinterval for most animations
using post is more secure than get in the sense that data shown into the url in get request but not in post
i tried using schedule static num_threads 4 and noticed that my programme always completes in 11.5s to 11.7s always below 12s at about 320 cpu runs more consistently and uses less resources even if the best run is half a second slower than the rare outlier with hyperthreading
i also personally believe that postgresql has better handling of complex queries that include sub-selects and the like which most mysql users used to avoid
for looping over lines in files you can use a for-loop which is more readable than while loops
multiplication is more complex and you can reference the solution in the question efficient 128-bit addition using carry flag
noexcept was added rather than just removing all throw specifiers other than throw because noexcept is more powerful
another suggestion change you to because you can keep an extension method for more collections because the ienumerable is more abstract than ilist
the only thing i can think of that is easier with the mouse than with the keyboard is resizing windows
you can possibly achieve slightly really marginally higher throughput with udp but then you have the hassle of recreating all the goodies tcp gives you for free
the animations are slower than google-chrome and opera
i ve tried firefox and google-chrome and seems that firefox is faster and comsumes less resources is there anything else that is like text based
the difference between reentrantlock and reentrantreadwritelock is a more fine granular control on the throughput
what is the best way to get the better visualization with bokeh or seaborn
it seems to be slower in google-chrome and firefox but is significantly faster in opera
it has some downsides- namely working with both ant and maven so the actual pom.xml is more difficult to comprehend but it does allow for more flexibility than is otherwise possible with maven
otherwise you will run into issues of trying to fadein and fadeout at the same time if your delay is shorter than your fadein
you will find that coalesce works better than isnull here
webkit is stricter than gecko
well i have written this class wich do this but when use cin cout works no more
most of the time reading the table from rom is still faster than multiplication division
better than twitter feed is engator - rss to twitter and facebook
i already create the xml for some beans inside the larger bean with xstream and append them as elements to the jdom
postgresql is way better than mysql in nearly every respect
also i believe the ironruby team is smaller than the ironpython team
although such reports are better manageable as crosstab pivot-table
4 fewer merge options than in git though the fossil workflow makes merging less likely to occur in the first place.
not that these are bad granted they tend to be an order of magnitude slower than addition subtraction negation etc. but they aren t needed and if they re present it probably means the implementation isn t really that efficient
i found that orientdb is too slow at least much slower than neo4j even on relatively small 150k datasets when searching records by text pattern despite the presence of indices
what s bad about this is that when microsoft were designing asp.net mvc they opted for declarative validation logic using data annotations instead of imperative which is much better suited to validation scenarios and can handle just anything
that beeing said putimagedata is much slower than drawimage at least when i tested them earlier this year
its slower than in google-chrome and firefox but now finally
this method also allows you to put the url within the action parameter of the form and uses post which is more secured for transferring password information
if the code is to be distributed consider compiling that java class with a target jvm versioning that is somewhat earlier than the latest Ã¢ otherwise some users will be forced to upgrade their jvm to run your software and some of those won t have admin rights to do that.
but i guess multiplication is more computationally expensive than addition
it s likely that you will get better results by using int math.round ... math.round returns a long if you pass a double
if you have a newer processor with sse or avx extensions then ensure that the compiler is compiling to use these features usually this is done automatically when you set optimizations
i ve learned partly by trawling this site that the google-chrome security is fussier and the app loads correctly without errors in firefox and ie but i can t find any resources that are loaded from a non https source
so at this point in time pypy is just over 9 times faster than cpython in this micro benchmark
tensorflow is better at marketing itself than long-time players of the open-source market like torch and theano
inlining inlining produces fatter code which is faster the inline functions will not appear in the call stack
so even ignoring practical considerations like disk is slower than ram it will be slower
all in all t4 to me is more of a inside vs code-generation tool to quickly create c# or other files while xslt is more of a data-processing data-transformation tool to turn data from xml into another format typically html or pdf using xsl-fo
is calayer better than uiview in terms of performance
window media player uses directshow which gives you better performance and greater flexibility than playsound under mci
phpmyadmin also shows the larger number however i have switched to heidisql since i find it s gui is superior for my local development
if you have more than one show hide box you ll need to create more tables
from my experience collapse filtering is much faster than grouping
i successfully compiled graphicsmagick with q8 but after all it seems about 30 slower than imagemagick 0.3 secs
addressing issue #2 if your mdpi phone has a smaller screens than 600dp it will use the layout in res layout folder
if you want to search a volume a quadtree or octree works better
basically imagemagick was only slightly slower than libjpeg
better if you have a code swift is better but is not problem objective-c
pyomo runs in less than one minute and scipy takes 4 hours
if you re going to stick with maven and want a plugin for maven that will do the code-coverage job i think cobertura is a better choice as emma stable last build is from 2005
having nginx in front of apache is a better set up in my opinion
google-chrome dev tools are by far better than firefox ie whatever imho
it does not have master worker as unicorn or passenger thus uses less memory
objective-c print is more readable compared to swift
spoiler its namesake may betray why addition subtraction is more costly
maven is higher level than make makefile the classic c c++ build tool or ant build.xml
loading is far faster than with the sqlcommandbuilder and sqldataadapter
while leaflet aims to be more lightweight than openlayers openlayers is by far the more mature proj
does that mean perhaps rails team favor postgresql slightly more than mysql
as for the suggestions in the comments keeping the fork result in a variable a then waiting with waitpid is safer when you have more processes as wait waits for the first ending process not a particular one
unfortunately the sample apps are not based on uimanageddocument or nspersistentdocument but if you look at the way they handle backup files you could probably use that approach to create a document based app with less hassle than using uimanageddocument
this i suspect serializable takes more time to process serializable and deserialization
i ve ran into out of memory errors on firefox with canvas heights greater than 8000 google-chrome seems to handle much higher at least to 32000
usually if you re going to consume all the elements of the iterator in a single loops it is better to use the for-loop approach and it will be better using the enhanced for-loop that already uses iterator behind the scenes
it s called web audio api and is currently a draft but is well supported by webkit you ll need to use prefixes and a little less by gecko
i prefer sublimetext because it s a little more customizable than notepad++ but they re both great options and lighter than dreamweaver
right now putimagedata is much slower than drawimage as you can see here
firefox and opera unfortunately fires many more keypress events than others ie and webkit which have the most sensible implementation the one the w3c is about to standardize in dom 3 events afaict but in that case getcharcode is 0 so you can safely ignore them
tftp is used because it uses udp which is simpler and had a smaller footprint than a full tcp-based ftp server
note the show hide effect is much softer because of the commented fadein fadeout declarations that were triggering console errors probably because jsfiddle uses jquery slim now
16 cores apache would scale better than nginx while nginx would process more client requests
chunk features includes branching looping and macros and has a simpler syntax than velocity and freemarker
if aes is negotiated it s faster than des and 3des used by default by older applications
swt has a more platform-specific look about it but java ships with swing built-in there s no messing about with external libraries as with swt although the use of eclipse may make that much easier i still develop quite a bit of my stuff from the command line unfortunately
recently we noticed that cypher queries run faster than gremlin so we decided to convert our queries
the iodbc included with os x has some things that are listed as deprecated and i ve had better luck with unixodbc in the past
innodb performance has been improved to the point where it is hard to come up with a benchmark that says myisam is faster
in google-chrome a basic for-loop is faster than i-- and --i while in firefox it s slower
i have worked on codeigniter but yii is far more ahead of that
i think it mostly depends on the interprter engine in browser which responsible for interpreting th scripts which server sends to your browser and another thing about firefox as you have mentioned the extension in firefox is also responsible for it and another thing which i think matters a lot the developement of the browser as you can see google-chrome has same ui on all windows linux mac since it is mostly written in java so it requires jvm to run hence it is slow as compared to firefox which is written separately for each os using the respective oss apis hence it is fast since it directly interacts with os than interacting with jvm which in turn interacts with os like in case of chrome.still google-chrome is faster in incognito mode because of its intelligence to keep frequently data cached if you ll see the temporary files created by google-chrome they are huge in size as compared to that of firefox
like remove the jar s from your war in case the version of your jar is same or lower than that of jboss s or replace the jar s of jboss and remove that jar s from your war in case the version of your jar is higher than that of jboss s
this may help those confused by dask and hdf5 but more familiar with pandas like myself
the google-chrome console gives more information than the firefox console
kmz loads much quicker than gpx and can be integrated with the google maps api as a kml layer
even then google-chrome s fonts look thinner than in firefox or ie
try catch inside for-loop is probably closer as long as you don t mind the unassigned values left in the arrays
for my circular viewgroup i just want to put each basic view uibutton uiimageview ... around center of my circular viewgroup i read the apple doc about uiview and uicollectionview and both can contains zero or more subviews and i don t know what i should use uiview seems less difficult than uicollectionview but uicollectionview seems more appropriate for what i want to do maybe i am wrong but how implement customcollectionlayout and how set this layout in customuicollectionview because i planed to add in future custom drawing and animation
if so what is the nature of the output of lz77 that makes it more suitable for huffman compression than lzw or some other method entirely
as well i used innodb engine but myisam is better if most of the queries are select and you are not going to do many writes
i guess post would be also fine but get is always better for our use
these steps were taken from this blog post which contains more details about how to investigate and what output you ll get
i know that swift is buggy as heck i run into bugs everyday but ill bet objective-c was even worse when it started out benefits of hindsight so in a couple of years swift will be equal or greater than objective-c keeping its basic simplicity as well
there is another principles which i like even more than srp - dry
jeff kaufman has a good demonstration of how box-sizing works and why border-box makes more sense
uicollectionview is more generic than uitableview and you can custom almost thing on it
it simply comes down to the space available a tablet gives more room to developers thus allowing developers to put more on one screens
if you want to go the visual studio .net route i would recommend you look at add-in express or xldna rather than vsto both of these have less limitations than vsto
this one s an overflow but i think it illustrates the unreliability of isnumeric in general especially for int - for double it s much more reliable
it s like asking whether sin is faster than sqrt
if you know buffers cannot overlap memcpy is fine and may in any given library use optimizations that allow it to be faster than memmove
scenarios when quicksort is worse than mergesort
it seems to be common wisdom that if you are deploying django on an apache server then you should still put an nginx server in front of the application to serve static files at which nginx is more performant
you can also user a stemming which is a simpler version of lemmatization
this article seems to suggest that this is possible by swizzling a fake location into apple s cllocationmanager class to be used by other apps but i am unfamiliar with the objective-c code more familiar with swift
eclipse compiler for java jdt ecj is much smarter tool than actual javac
my rails app is coded in jquery but for file uploading i ve yet to find anything better than fancyupload better imho than uploadify or swfupload
carrierwave seems to be gaining more popularity than paperclip but most people seem to be on paperclip
i saw that the discrepancy was because in safari the text element is taller than in firefox and includes a slight amount of whitespace on top that doesn t show up in firefox in firefox the top of the text element is exactly when the text starts
edit explained as i m guessing you are somehow forced to use glut but i agree with other posters glfw is a better option if you can choose
noexcept allows for more efficient code generation in that it does not have to perform rtti on throw exceptions instead if an exception is throw from a call-frame underneath a noexcept-declared function std terminate is called short-circuiting the crazy std unexpected machinery specified by the 98 standard
it works in firefox because firefox is more lax about this security restriction and google-chrome happens to be more strict on mixed-content errors
i myself did not use brew before but this page says it is less intrusive than fink and macports so you may give it a try
client-side will also be more responsive than server-side because there s no request-response but that s really only a perceived performance issue for high-latency connections
i want smooth fadeout fadein animations instead setting visibility where fadeout is slower than fadein animation so i ve used enteractions and exitaction of datatrigger
always use tls which is ssl which is https more or less
notably this doesn t happen in all browsers google-chrome renders more smoothly than ie and firefox for instance but is there any way i can make those white lines stop appearing when the user zooms in
or if there is too much intermediate output to be shuffled your job will become slow as you will need disk based shuffle in such a case which will be slower than ram based shuffle
ssd disk are good but they are still much slower than ram
while testing my implementation i discovered that although it generally performed better than regular quicksort heapsort consistently outperformed both
udp communication requires much less overhead than tcp due to the number of messages exchanged
in the above code #header seems to overflow out of #header_wrapper because of and which adds up to more than the height of #header_wrapper and even though box-sizing border-box has been applied its still overflowing
the active selector handles the mouse click much better than mouseup down you just need a way of reading that state in the onmousemove event
if you work with data that doesn t need construction destruction and requires reallocations a large array of ints then i believe malloc free is a good choice as it gives you realloc which is way faster than new-memcpy-delete it is on my linux box but i guess this may be platform dependent
setinterval is better than settimeout for this task
nb weka contains its own implementation - smo but it also provides wrapper for libsvm and libsvm runs faster than smo note that it requires installed libsvm see docs
even when latex editors support knitr their support makes working with .rnw files much clunkier than pure latex .tex files
unwound before program execution is terminated. he said code using noexcept is more optimized than code using throw
i suggest you try increasing your maximum to just under half your main memory and attach a profiler visualvm is better than nothing and see if where objects are being retained
however innodb tends to be slower as myisam
i have no idea what i m doing so i dove nose-first into nginx -- which i had never used before -- because someone told me it s better than apache at dealing with lots of small tasks and requests -- not that i would know how to turn apache into a proxy mind you
quicksort is not better it is well suited for a different kind of application than mergesort
it s much easier with a shapefile than a geojson as shapefile are much more common in gis software
the hash idea should work minor note that sha-256 wouldn t present collisions md5 is no longer secure but it depends on the trade-off if the service involves something really really critical a client-side ssl certificate would be the best way to proceed
basically collections are things that implement some kind of iterable interface and they internally use the same iteration method though lodash source is a bit more convoluted than underscore.js
from what i ve read i was expecting quicksort to be faster than mergesort but on my code it is not so i assume there must be a problem with my quicksort algorithm
twip for parameterized testing the junit stuff isn t the greatest in fact testng does this better as well -
you might have better luck with a repeater a datalist or a datagrid
jsf is a web ui framework whereas seam is a more general web application framework that integrates not just jsf but conversational contexts workflow jbpm and object persistance preferably ejb3
as i am benchmarking my cluster i discover that for large file my get command is actually slower than put command
i prefer using these short forms because to me year getdate is shorter to type and better to read than datepart yyyy getdate
in linux the git-core debian package is much smaller and the process is much quickier
the eclemma plugin is nicer and more mature then ecobertura
so i have a form that submit to a database and i want to prevent more than one submission if the user clicks the submit button more than once...with a little research this seems easily enough done however none of the solutions i found worked for me as i am using the jquery validationengine plugin to validate the form client side
if you need a surrogate primary key using an auto_increment field is better than an md5 hash because it is fewer bytes of data and database backends optimize for integer primary keys
as objective-c is the older programming language for ios or macos applications swift allows you to use those classes structs in your code
if i am parsing an rss feed with php and xml how can i parse more than one feed using one fopen statement
unless you particularly need to build against a more standard libc than bionic you can just use the ndk s toolchain either by copying the hello-jni example and changing build_shared_library to build_executable in the jni android.mk or using the script to generate a stand alone toolchain
truetype opentype font that provides better compression than woff 1.0
though if you are going to eventually fill a substantial portion of the map the dictionary method is much less efficient
write the application differently - create a matching interface and write the service provider implementation against it testing that and also write a minimal subclass of the abstract-class that does nothing more than forward calls to the interface
the resulting page identifiers will also be shorter than md5 hash and will only contain digits so they will be easy to include in url query strings etc
actually i want to move it to the top while dragging and move it back afterwards but this problem can be illustrated in a simpler way with just mouseup and mousedown
gson 1.6 now includes a low-level streaming api and a new parser which is actually faster than jackson
a heartbeat mechanism pull model is definitely easier to implement but a push model is far more efficient
note that in any case for increased security and fast static file css js delivery you might want to add a reverse proxy layer nginx usually provides better performance but apache works as well before the nodejs python server
using get is much easier than using post for most of developers
so if your code has tough data dependency problems addition is about 12 times faster than division
in this way your uistackview would be dynamic in the sense that when the text in your uilabel gets bigger the separators on both sides would shrink
virtualbox no vmware because virtualbox is more user friendly
i found a solution to this problem using beautifulsoup at beautifulsoup-where-are-you-putting-my-html because i think it is easier than lxml
first you have many different library you can use instead of retrofit the basic one and i think the simplest is okhttp but you have to understand that okhttp is no more supported but still work when you downgrade your sdkversion and you can use volley to perform the same service as retrofit
as you are no doubt aware from your searches innodb is primarily better than myisam for high volume inserts not counting non-comparable features like foreign keys or full text searches which are exclusive to innodb and myisam respectively while myisam is primarily useful for tables which are read more often than they are written to
in future if they add more than one directory at the root level i will handle it but for now you can assume they will only put in one top level folder
the answer is simple so that you don t upgrade to a versioning newer than the versioning in wheezy by accident
also throwing illegalargumentexception makes more sense instead of nullpointerexception when string has blank empty or null values
also post is generally considered better than get for ajax calls as it doesn t have the same string length limit slightly more secure too
however i could not find it the documentation so it may inherited more than properties
php is an interpreted-language so will run a little slower than a compiled-language
quicksort usually is better than mergesort for two reasons
so union is much better than the union all with distinct in performance-wise
you can do the same thing with much cleaner code with chr ord and array_map
as you see i too mistrust whether the tab chars are real tabs and also use two or more spaces as delimiter
in firefox the input button has more padding than in google-chrome
and web2py is more lightweight than django rails whatever on pretty much all counts
pd note that firefox s developer tools are better and more complete than google-chrome developer tools but in essence are for the same purpose
ps again i am aware that relying on client-side script is way less secure compared with handling all execution from within the server-side
so yes at least in this respect csc is smarter than vbc
also note that in my code above manually calculating the euclidean distance is much faster then calling pdist
if you have recently upgrade to a versioning of apache greater than versioning 2.2 the authz_core error error might be coming from your httpd.conf or httpd-vhosts.conf file in the tags
i ve already built a view that can take a drawable can use focused pinch-zoom and drag can auto-scale images can switching images dynamically and takes images larger than the screens
so a 128bit adder will be slower than a 64bit add
bazaar is easier to extend in an api way git is easier to extend in a unix way pipes
i don t think it get s simpler smaller than http get post and json unless someone can correct me
unless you need javascript flash css or something like that you can replace qwebview with qtextbrowser which is both faster and free of static leaks
in the past the redis developers experimented with virtual memory and other systems in order to allow larger than ram datasets but after all we are very happy if we can do one thing well data served from memory disk used for storage
but better ogg than wav
another alternative for javascript ajax is writing a google-chrome add-on easier than firefox or embeding a web browser within your application
i prefer user getter and setter because is less code and more legible
well for that you ll need jsf that is better integrated with seam and jsf does not handle file uploads that actually everyone use so you have to put also icefaces that actually are better managed by maven that you currenty are not using... neverending story
but my directory structure is more organized its more like app lib mypackage folder
if image height is larger than width then scaletypes fitstart fitend and fitcenter don t work
to answer klochner both seems quite popular but ruby is not a language that i am familiar with and django seems more heavy and complex to me than web2py
a system with a lot of ram will have advantages when switching between different instances of visual studio because their state won t need to be written away to slower than ram disk be it ssd or not
qset and other qt containers are less versatile than stl or boost containers
if you write your own reusable components then writing them in actionscript may sometimes give you a little more control but for non-reusable views mxml is much better
i changed the genrandom function to genrandomword length and instead of using a while loops i used a for-loop which is easier to see how long it will run for
what i meant to ask is it can be argued that npm has a wider user base than bower some even argue that we should stop using bower altogether like here and here
i believe that ubuntu is better than centos when it comes to mono as it is much easier to setup and seems to be better supported
this alleviated some of our performance issues but even on subsequent refreshes we noticed ie6 taking substantially longer than ie7+ firefox google-chrome etc
i ve tested this on a few devices a nexus 10 tablet which gets the bigger version of the file from the xhdpi folder a generic tablet using mdpi a galaxy ace phone mdpi again and everything works ok
anyone who thinks myisam is faster is either not tuning innodb correctly or has such small data that who cares
lxml.html deals with badly formed html better than beautifulsoup is actively maintained beautifulsoup isn t and is a lot faster since it uses libxml2 internally
however i ve seen that object s hasownproperty is much faster than indexof
i am not sure but by reading the documentation i think you need to download the pyodbc it seems to be better supported than adodbapi
i am however no cpython guru and can get so much more out of ironpython than cpython as i can easily leverage the .net platform on which i am far more at home
i need to perform several device.touch events as fast as possible however androidviewclient seems to achieve those significantly slower than monkeyrunner
here is the skimage scipy version appears sharper
atom-editor has better github support out of the box but sublimetext has a several git packages
in the first example sqldf is 3x slower than data.table and in the second its 200x faster than plyr and 100 times faster than data.table
microsoft s free application for stress-testing wcat is underpowered and buggy but the full blown test edition goes up against products like loadrunner but is easier to use better-integrated with vs asp.net and for much less money per virtual user
translating this to gremlin is a tad bit tedious pattern matching in cypher is more natural but lmk if this is in the right direction and i ll do it
here the working header request with firefox bigger than google-chrome request
2 readability library content is passable slower on average than goose but faster than boilerpipe
i have seen that the drawimage function is really faster than the putimagedata
you could use nant to send email but teamcity is more appropriate as it can provide a centralized place for notifications including emails
so you can do a django redirect_to urlconf entry but you d be better off with an apache or nginx or insert-your-webserver-here redirect so the initial request never has to hit django at all
font-face bold in firefox is bolder than in google-chrome
that hopefully explains why a typical 320dp phone screens is always smaller than a 720dp tablet screens although the smaller screens can have more pixel than the larger
i am not sure if this is no longer true myisam is faster than innodb for reads
i assumed the version using chars variables would run slower than that using int s due to the conversions but on my 64bit dual core ii system the int version is slower
i ve been looking at services and the two most comparable for grid testing look to be saucelabs as mentioned above and also browserstack which offers a cheaper unlimited package i believe
product-sum is always faster than min max even in alternation and allowing for caching
using post over https is better than using get and http
since the upgrade or mac clients can no longer connect through safari and firefox is no longer accepting the about config setting of network.automatic-ntlm-auth.trusted-uris
dus anyone knows if there is something wrong with my json or if google-chrome is harder to get than safari
i interestingly think using min or max is the more pythonic approach
udp is also more work than tcp if you need reliability which is built in to tcp
a for-loop is faster than a foreach loops
myisam has historically been viewed as faster than innodb but for recent versions of innodb that is true for a much much smaller set of use cases
you can t cast a superclass in a subclassing because the subclassing may have a bigger interface than the superclass means the subclassing can have functions like getunixtimestamp that the superclass doesn t have
i have coded a routine to compute the cartesian product of different tables as in a database with the only exception that the tables are stored as files in my case and for computing the cartesian product i am using file i o for reading files i am using filereader coupled with bufferedreader and for writing files i am using filewriter coupled with bufferedwriter now as i am performing every computation externally in files i.e i compute the product as follows i take a row from file-1 which is table-1 in my case and concatenate it with every other row in file-2 which is table-2 in my case and write it to an external file which holds the result
i came across a situation where i need to implement a for-loop with more than one loops control variable
as of right now drawimage is much faster than putimagedata
use of malloc free is even more rare and should be used very sparingly
beautifulsoup is more forgiving in terms of well-formed xml structure see i had to edit the xml a bit to make things work for elementtree and it s actually much easier to work with
avoid public attributes in class use getter and setter it s just shorter there
some recent tests we did showed that postgresql does perform faster than mysql and we believe the table partitioning feature in postgresql will be very important with a table in our database we foresee to grow into 100 million rows and more in production
with get and put it is more likely that the media-types are symmetric however that is not a hard rule
the reason why you get the exception mentioned is because when you call byte.parse but the string that you put in is greater than 255
i did not make any changes more than change protected to public but i add another class in a new package to print the rules by these following codes
ie handles updates better than google-chrome and firefox
performance i did some test with simple game similar to swing copters and found that game created with libgdx consumes 15-20 more ram on ios device that the same game created with cocos2d-x but then i used apportable to run cocos2d-x game on my android device and found it almost not playable
you could for example generate a random aes key encrypt it using rsa and store it in the output file and then encrypt the file itself with aes which is much faster and doesn t have any problem with large inputs
for python there is a pypy project which it includes jit making possible the code to run faster than in cpython in many cases
also setinterval is often better replaced by settimeout
the uiview is taller than the screen so in ib i pulled it out of the scroll view so i could see it all but i never moved it back to being a subviews of the scroll view
realised that templates are incredibly powerful and don t need to be slow and use of the stl and boost is much more widespread than 10 years ago
datamapper is much smarter then activerecord
ie is much slower than google-chrome firefox for all js work not only complex ones
in the end you have a scheme whose encoder is more complex but whose decoder couldn t be simpler
lodash is definitely not slower than underscore.js
he says he uses debian and is less familiar with centos and so i am posting here
counter1 can be used with instanceof and inherited but is more verbose and doesn t have real private properties eg count properties is exposed
following the linux kernel coding gudelines i don t fancy typedef because they tend to make the data definitions opaque if something is declared elsewhere as the typedefined type understanding that is a struct is somewhat more complicated
i ve replaced settimeout with setinterval which is more appropriate for repeated tasks
the logs only seem to work with a google-chrome browser which is a laugh as usually firefox is better at running google apps than google-chrome
most importantly you can easily supplement udp with some reliable delivery hand-shaking that s less overhead than tcp
rsa is much faster then ecdsa at verification
note better than just runtimeexception would be to use a more specific unchecked-exception if one is available
hbase is schema less and from hbase you can create impala or hive external tables
and if you find yourself with more issues after this post i check my github daily so logging an issue against my repository will get more help in a better place for a back and forth
so yes it can be used with flash or rather pure actionscript but it is a little less convenient than with mxml where everything is set up by the framework because it takes more under the hood configuration to be able to run all the necessary parts for remoting
if png isn t smaller than gif then your software may be saving it poorly - look for png optimisation progams like pngout and pngnq
i ve also found scheme ides much more user-friendly than lisp s plt scheme is a good one
gitolite is far more advanced than gitosis and is quite easy to install directly from your workstation based on ssh communication with your git repository server
keep in mind that implementing udp traversal is easier than tcp
i assume this is because comparison between int is much easier than between chars strings but i was looking for some literature to back this assessment ideally some database structure book
anyway the most important issue is that web2py is easier than django pylons php and rails
as mentioned in other posts senderid and sequencenumber are both of type int which is likely to be larger than chars so these values will be truncated
i suppose the first option is good for small arrays but a for-loop is probably better practice as the amount of code would remain the same regardless of arrays size
the coalesce function is used here because it is more portable than nvl or ifnull
from how i understand it postgresql is a more correct database implementation while mysql is less correct less compliant but faster
as you can see ie 8 is about 5 times slower than firefox 3.6 and almost 20 times slower than google-chrome 9 at least when using sunspider tests
xhtml has a stronger syntax than html and is easier to convert to apache-fop this way
mysql is more permissive and allows the non-standard use of distinct but postgresql throws an error
take note of this there is no way to subclassing more than one superclass at a time
in fact one could theorize your approach of having it show up after the finger is released is better than what google-chrome and safari is doing
wikipedia defines web services as a software system designed to support interoperable machine-to-machine interaction over a network. as implementation they are more complex than rss feed and are usually used to integrate business applications like connecting an erp with a crm system
if necessary i can switch to tga though png is more convenient
you got at least put and delete although they are used much less frequent than get and post as in hardly ever
i used apache-poi for excel sheet and i know that it has a good api support for word doc too but i heard that docx4j is better in handling word documents
not sure what colors you want but if you have installed the newer rcharts with devtools install_github ramnathv rcharts here is how you might color based on the source value with a demo here
the mtu is closer to 1500 and this applies to tcp not udp
safari and opera work with the google-chrome setting but firefox and ie display the iframed page larger than google-chrome causing part of the text to be cut off
qlabel has no any other unnecessary things so it is better than qlineedit or qprogressbar
if you will have only yours commits on your branch issue is much simpler you can do squash those git squash
c++ allows you to define struct without the struct keyword so the typedef is used less often
grouping has looser constraints than sorting so in theory it could be marginally faster than sorting but unless you re dealing with a lot of data you re unlikely to see a speed difference
it was never intended to be some safe version of strcpy - that s complete nonsense since strncpy is far more unsafe because of the null termination issue
for class-dump-z the -p option will generate property instead of getter setter which is more clear so you d probably type in
in few words strncmp is safer then strcmp but it is slower too
llvm compiles code faster than gcc may create code that runs faster and the clang frontend provides more accurate error messages than gcc Ã¢ so there are definitely reasons for switching
i ve used python on windows and on ubuntu and linux is much cleaner
so i think afnetworking would a better choice than sdwebimage
it is also usable from emacs and vim but this time the emacs interface seems more polished
a for-loop fits better to your requirements than a while loops
triggers in postgresql have a syntax a bit more complex than mysql because they execute procedures as the action
remember the tuples are saved into the disk which is vastly slower to access than things in ram
the code makes some reasonable assumptions but it may fail to detect an escaped field if its doublequote is followed or preceded by more than 3 spaces before after field delimiter
for example matlab multiplies two 1000x1000 matrices in 0.15 seconds on my computer r needs 1 second while c++ armadillo lapack blas needs more than 10 seconds for that
dist fonts gruntjs gruntfile.js js less license package.json readme.md
how can i make the droppable to not accept more than one draggable div
this seems to me like a bandwidth error or something like that originally i ve got the error when i played with the html 5 audio api and if i loaded the audio file 10-15 times sequentially then i ve got the error but now i ve discovered that i get the error without the audio api too just by reloading the site a lots of times also safari gives me the error much faster than google-chrome wtf
myisam is faster than innodb for reads myth
setting it on a many-to-one or many-to-many relationship is more awkward
also try post ing using ajax as get is much more likely being cached
it seems like if the uiimage is slightly larger the ciimage is double the size whereas if the uiimage is slightly smaller this isn t the case
it is suggested in this so post that c# is more efficient with toupper because microsoft optimized it that way. but i ve also read this argument that converting tolower vs
dr your heapsort is not faster because it isn t actually a heapsort it s a backwards insert sort followed by an in-place ordering reversal
this is also one of the few places i think you d be better off with setinterval rather than settimeout
swt became slower than swing because it uses proxy to os widgets
why atom-editor uses more memory and takes more time to start as compare to sublimetext editor
in innodb the count s when where group by or join is not used execute slower than in myisam because the row count is not stored internally
2 integration would be easier with jboss eap support from eap 5 or wildfly however if you don t need any java ee technologies i would go with more lightweight server like tomcat or jetty
but changing the chmod maybe even working with umask is better than dealing with root-access and using chown
this is why pypy may be slower than cpython sometimes it needs a warm-up phase in which it can actually optimize repeated operations
also for printing arrays i recomend to use the enhanced for-loop it is easier
using options such as -os for the compiler to tell it to make the code small in other words don t inline-functions unless the code is shorter by inlining than by calling the function and don t unroll loops etc etc - but do inline-functions called only once as that does make the code shorter
the point of this cache is to store data that the cpu is using quite regularly to speed up transfer time since the cpu cache is physically closer to the processors then ram is
for example quicksort is faster than heapsort in general although their time complexity are the same
btw this is not essential for this solution for windows 7 and 10 xcopy is superseded by robocopy which is much more performant and powerful
even if you re on linux it s much easier to get a precompiled version sudo apt install r-cran-rgl on ubuntu if you have the appropriate cran repositories set up
note that the for-loop based on the string assignment a_string runs one time more than loops based on the inline assignment a_inline -- notice the last number -3.46945e-18
personally i would recommend testng although if you re just starting junit is slightly less of a learning curve
also i can t see your table engine but myisam is better for full text searching rather than innodb
nuxeo is based on open source but you have to pay the license and is pretty expensive at this point documentum is better anyway
thus i suspect when people say that nunit is much faster than mstest it is because of the loading and updating delays but the actual test execution time appears to be very similar
mercurial is significantly faster than bazaar it s slower than git though by a much smaller difference
sometimes it is good practice to use onmousedown event instead of onclick because onmousedown is fired sooner so ga script has more time to execute event tracking it s only a few milliseconds difference but can help
i m trying to create a template in velocity since i have more knoledge than freemarker
i think karatsuba algorithm is best to perform arithmetic operations on large numbers.for sufficiently large n another generalization the schÃ£ nhageÃ¢ strassen algorithm is even faster
mvp offers greater seperation as your presenter have no knowledge of web centric concepts
for me apache is easier to use but i prefer nginx as it is much faster
if you include the explicit rbind version it is slightly faster than the do.call rbind rep list a n version but not by much and slower than either the apply or matrix versions
i can t use anything more than basic addition and subtraction and string parsing functions
that is for symfony so not sure if silex has some better sugar
anyway i just prefer not to use it because gecko is slower then webkit
use httpwebrequest instead of webclient it s just more robust
i prefer the command line because i have a shell window open in the source anyway to run builds and tests and along with file name completion using the keyboard is faster than using the mouse for me
it is understandable that memset is faster than memcpy
spring security is fine too but if you plan to use jsf 2 you probably also use cdi provided by seam weld which is integrated into the java ee 6 profile from glassfish and jboss it is easier to use shiro as spring heavily relies on its own dependency injection methods although spring security does not need that much injected classes but you should stick to one way of doing things
puppet chef always have a place in my heart stack but ansible is just easier
on the other hand a usb connection is far more reliable better supported and of course has the inherent advantage of speed and since it is well supported does not suffer from all the pitfalls bluetooth connectivity does
it is much more efficient than gridview listview for complex layouts
do need implementation of qabstractitemmodel that can be more useful than qstandarditemmodel
i have just noticed a site i am working on looks different in google-chrome than other browsers saf firefox everything is more saturated in google-chrome even a background-color rgb
also datamapper is much more ruby syntax friendy and features like lazy loading when doing chainable conditions like activerecord in rails 3 are there from the beginning
yes but if you think of your diagram as a topographic map the subclassing have higher altitudes than the superclass
having used both i can tell you that it s a much more polished platform the servers are about 4Ã£ faster you can run as many apps as you want and the heroku toolbelt is much more powerful than the openshift s client tools
tcp streaming for audio can be less helpful than udp rtp as you d have to turn off nagling
scylla a cassandra clone which is generally more efficient than cassandra also has similar issues with huge partitions as in cassandra moderately large partitions are fine but these issues are actively being worked on including re-designing the file format so eventually scylla should support arbitrary-sized partitions
if the above is true doesn t this mean that the foreach loops is much slower then the common for-loop since it involves making copies of each element of the arrays
we started with ehcache terracotta server array cause it s well-known backed by terracotta and has bigger community support than hazelcast
no intel or amd x86 manuals ever guarantee atomicity of anything wider than 64bit except for lock cmpxchg16b so this talk of sse vector loads stores being atomic on some cpus isn t something that you can reliably take advantage of or detect when it s supported
this package and my answer here may not solve your problem because reading the numbers directly as chars is an easier way to achieve your goal but i thought i might post this anyway as an information for users who may need to use large int with more than 22 digits
i know for a fact hotmail is using a rules based spam filter which is quite strict and gmail uses more like a self-learning system which could explain why gmail accepts your message and hotmail doesn t
depending on your use case a dictionary might fit better than a namedtuple
and it seems working fine antialiasing is much better however this beats the idea of a transparent background in the process
i really do not get the appeal it s marginally better than textwrangler bbedit s free little brother but if you re spending money you may as well buy the better tool for a few dollars more
objective-c s relatively lax type checking makes this easy to deal with but swift is stricter
you do not need to set up these remotes but having them for all the repos that you frequently work with push or pull changes makes things easier for you
on centos dnf install zint ubuntu takes more work
personally i ve used mayavi in the past and found the performance much better than matplotlib for 3d scatter plotting though the python bindings are somewhat in question moving forward i think
the new name is meant to clarify that the company is more than just elasticsearch such as the open source logstash and kibana
you should not be using the post method for requests that contain no actual data get method is better for that
this changes the variable curve so that it now points to the middle of the arrays that was previously initialized so that the follow-on for-loop indexing is likely easier for the programmer to think about and a bit cleaner to write debug etc
also if you have very limited memory processing resources it is worth bearing in mind that udp is a less costly protocol as it avoids a lot of the overheads tcp incurs due to its inbuilt connection management
my another question is if i put the data size smaller than mtu into sendto then i can gurantee call sendto once socket only sends one tcp udp packet
use swing-x components there is a jxtable which is more powerful than jtable
so how i create my layout bigger than tablet screens using xml and just do something that will hide show the listview 1 or listview 2 to work using any tablet
it feels like arangodb is focused on graph operations and neo4j fits more the needs of using graphs if you have more relations than rows the reason to use graphs instead of relations with joins
the big caveat here is that apc generally has less memory available for storage though. default being 32mb memcached s big adavantage is that while still fast it s distributed so if you have multiple servers running they could share this data
using webclient is potentially slightly on the order of a few milliseconds slower than using httpwebrequest directly
personally i find shark more useful than instrumentation for profiling my code and finding out what s taking up time when it matters
you may be interested in looking at the constexpr keyword which i think is better than the inline keyword when you can make use of it
division though is an iterative process in logic the implementations you see on educational sites verilog vhdl are simply doing the same thing we did with log division in grade school but like multiplication it is much simpler than grade school you pull down bits from the numerator in the long division until the number being checked against the denominator is equal to or larger basically the number can either go in only zero times or one times into the next number under test unlike decimal where it can be between 0 to 9 times
memcmp is simpler than strcmp and can be implemented even more efficiently in places where the strings are known to be properly aligned
running a quick benchmark it seems that the for-loop is 4x faster even in the worst case where you have to replace every single time and you construct a new arrays to hold the replacements
since you re presenting multiple columns a gridview control is a better alternative to checkboxlist
nonatomic properties don t use locks but direct ivar is faster because it skips the accessor call
flex uses an older less capable version of the osmf platform for its videoplayer
this breaks the inherited and the subclassing is no longer an instance of the superclass
perhaps in the same vein and i had a problem of this sort with some of my other data trying to convert character names in matrix and data frames into factors results in more confusing behaviour
alone push is better in the accepted answer can t quite work as a push-operation in some class can require a new pull at the pushed object
google-chrome is smart enough to guess where things should be closed and still work correctly but firefox has more strict of standards
but is there any specific situation when while loops is better than for-loop
testing with scalatest+scalacheck is much much better than junit testng
phalcon is more powerful verstile but to get started with it i feel you have to be a better php developer than you do to get started with something like cakephp
i have a working script to stream over tcp but i understand that udp is the better option for video streaming however i m not really sure how to do it
for a counterexample i think scheme programs ran faster and used less memory than the lisp programs that preceded them mdash
that would theoretically cut the time in half but it seems that robocopy is much faster than xcopy at least for this use so it took way less time
as part of the processing joptionpane invokes getwindowforcomponent on the argument before passing it through to the underlying jdialog which is slightly more general
if you are still having problems jdk 8 has the ability to play mp3 files which are significantly smaller than wav you may want to try this
as for me settimeout is simpler than setinterval in this case as you won t need to clearinterval in the end of the array
everything is set as default for sure the server is up and listening to port 9990 trying to compare both wildfly and jboss eap standalone.xml but they aren t exactly the same wildfly is more evoluated compared to jboss eap which is more stable
in this approach you won t get much from django you are better of with bottle flask
for example on the blog page of my current project i have two widgets in the sidebar one for latest tweets and one for latest music news however as you can see on this page the content of the blog post all test posts... are much longer than the height of the two widgets and would of course get larger as more post are added
eugene s suggestion of using ecc is a good one - ecc keys are much shorter than rsa or dsa for a given security level
in my opinion it gives a nicer solution than the mouseenter and mouseleave event
the subviews version is definitely faster since having the controls loose on the uiview took more like 2 seconds to update
also the hash algorithm itself is much slower than sha1 md5 sha1 md5 are made for speed - not a useful property when storing passwords
r-tree are substantially faster than quadtree for window queries like inside contains covers etc
any sort of reverse proxing of tcp udp connections is more scalable at a lower osi level ie layer 3 or layer 2 instead of layer 6 7 as nginx is operating at
since ntile might put the same number in more than one percentile i use a query to calculate the percentile using rank
i think silex produces a bit uglier code than slim but i m afraid to choose slim because it s changing constantly and i will be stuck with the current version if it breaks backward compatibility
for quadprog ipopt would be a much more powerful solver than nlopt
i can only guess at the reasons and i don t worry much about the occasional downvote but perhaps some readers think i m advocating cvs as a better system than svn or git
the subset-sum problem is hard more precisely it s np-complete which means that your variant is hard too it s not np-complete because it s not a decision problem but it is np-hard
crfsuite is faster than crf++ and it can deal with a huge training data
using fgets and fputs is faster than multiple calls to getc and putc all you need is a buffer a little buffer in this case to store the current line
theses two links are great specially about to know more about the main reason of this header that is portability but for me what i like most about it that i think uint8_t is cleaner than unsigned chars for storing an rbg channel value for example int32_t looks more meaningfull than simply int etc
since myisam is better on selecting while innodb is better on writing
probably you can take a look at rythm template engine which is much faster than freemarker and velocity also much easier to use
it might not be the most efficient way to do it but i ve used ordereddictionary though sorteddictionary is probably more appropriate for handling the out of order issue in the past
an add action like that would be better done as a post request partly for semantic reasons it s sending data rather than get ting it and partly to avoid annoyances like this
once you ve done that you can use strcmp to see if the string is equal to stop and if not then call atoi or better yet strtol which has better error checking to get the numerical value
typically mergesort is slower than heapsort and quicksort but that s usually under the assumption that comparisons are fast
on most processors a boolean operation has no reason to significantly be slower or faster than an addition both are basic instructions even though comparison may take two of them subtract then comparing to zero
newly created groups click more than 2 checkbox then a group button will appear now click the group button then an alert pop will appear asking you to enter group name.enter some name and click ok.then that name will now appear on the right side group table.now clcik the group name then those members will be selected.i want to the same from existing groups also.please tell me how
i would go with kohana over symfony because kohana is much easier to understand out of the box and doesn t require any special setup to work with
unfortunately i m pretty sure you ll not find any packages or projects that migrates a joomla web site to laravel or maybe codeigniter which is much older than laravel
generally innodb is much better for preserving your data integrity so stick with it and do not go back to myisam there is also a matter of what each engine is best fore but unless you give us more details there is no point in dwelling on that
i don t understand why the division multiplication in c++ is so much slower than addition subtraction where the managed c# version is more reasonable to my expectations
for instance if the high word is less than the modulo then it is safe to perform the division like this
but one below query which was editable in ms access versioning before back-end upgrade is no more allowing edits
often running the equivalent commands in the terminal be they ant maven etc. is clearer when failures occur because you ll see the full error output
ienumerable is more generic than iqueryable though all instances of iqueryable implement ienumerable and only defines
that s why realloc can temporarily require more memory than a malloc free pair
but becuase reading from ram is usually faster than from other kind of memory storage divice os copy the program from disk on ram and start executing program from there
http is an application layer protocol which could be encapsulated with a protocol that uses udp providing arguably faster reliable communication than tcp
calloc does take longer than malloc because it has to zero out all the memory you asked for before giving it to you
lastly if you are frequently finding yourself running long running process i advice you to try jruby which is works much better with long running processes due to jvm lot faster than mri
tcp as you know udp is faster than tcp even if udp may miss some
then i thought of putting each integer from s into a binary search tree and searching for first occurence where one of children is smaller than query and parent is bigger than query but i don t know if this will work
yes it is an old wives tale that myisam is faster than innodb
mvc is the most extensible and if you are familiar with how things work under the covers you ll probably be better off than implements a hard to extends ms thing like odata and wcf
you can do the whole job in a single for-loop reading from stdin look if it is larger than the max smaller than the min and so you do not need the arrays
haskell has higher level bindings to llvm than ocaml the haskell ones provide some interesting type safety guarantees and haskell has by far more libraries to use 1700 packages on making it easier to glue together components
to summarise the differences controllers in the mvc have more control over the ui and handle events while a presenter in the mvp is more passive and just presents information through the ui
above is a simplified version of my actual code where the c arrays is much larger so i have to use a for-loop to get every index
1 i guess dask will be slower than pandas for smaller datasets
one more note consider extending classes that are more specific than runtimeexception illegalargumentexception illegalstateexecption etc
by default when you scale a qgraphicsscene larger than the qgraphicsview in which it is displayed it will show the necessary scroll bars
in my case i needed speed right out of the box and silex provided me with the speed and although i am using most of the symfony components it is a lot faster than symfony out of the box
use a for-each loops to go through a range it s not as fast as using a variant arrays but keeps things simple and offers better speed than a for-loop
i generally use mongodb because it returns queries in json format integrates well with angular.js and its bson format is much faster than json
i am wondering if there is a cross-platform allocator that is one step lower than malloc free
i think the single responsibility principles srp is much more useful in practice -- as long as a class only does one thing it is okay to modify it if the requirements for that one thing change
during writing test for angular app using protractor i faced a lot of problem related to handling spinners some of then i solved but i don t know how to test spinners which hidden by wrapper for example if parent tag have ng-if or ng-hide statements and spinner has a height and width that is greater than 0
you will probably find that bitvector performs a good deal better than bitarray
from what i read on the net multiplication is usually easier to compute than division
side note it looks like you re using the post form of file upload which as the docs say is considerably more complex than put
longer answer 64bit x86 has more general purpose registers which gives the compiler more of an opportunity to optimize local variables into registers for faster access
telerik has a control called radwindow which is more or less a modal window
running with debug option -x seems to imply that command substitution is similar to subshell since bash outputs a deeper nesting for it
note also that onclick would be much more appropriate than onmouseup for this
this is the reason why working with the higher-dimensional arrays ends up being so much faster than the for-loop -based code
division is inherently a much slower operation than multiplication
if you want to cover the largest audience possible set up a streaming server like icecast and broadcast over mp3 and or ogg both is better
sometimes your mxml does not get you the itch of what you are looking and actionscript gives you more power
odd that elasticsearch is more tolerant than kibana
google-chrome renders passwords smaller than firefox
on the other hand for-loop is more like counter based where you want to specify for how many times should loops happened
use firefox network in development tools and check your requests sometimes it just sends options request in cross origin i insist on firefox because it s network tool is much more detailed than google-chrome and safari
but do also remember that in your case get request looks more appropriate and as balusc says its not good practice to use post for bookmarkable page-to-page navigation
if you need to do more with the parent like paging or fetching the children you could split this problem into a sub query note that the line is not required it s just an example what you can further do with the query
disk space is probably always going to be cheaper than ram
google-chrome shows it better than firefox firebug
however bash has useful interactive features dash does not zsh is still better imho
nevertheless in my opinion break is not much better than goto its both not a good programming style
using strncpy instead of strcpy is normally safer but here you alloc eachtime the right amount of memory needed to store inpoint into mpoint so i cant see what s the point
based on why lodash is faster than native foreach post maybe it s justifiable to use lodash in favour of both underscore.js and native foreach to loop
i have one parent resource which can have more than one children of one attrbiute and one than more children of other attribute
i m not sure exactly how you re drawing the conclusion that ironpython is faster than cpython
joe duffy s blog implies using substr is more efficient than strsplit
i would like to know how to only get the post that the user either hasn t read at all no record in views or the post latest_reply.id is bigger than the one saved in views
and i think post is better than get
bower packages are simpler than npm equivalents and don t have subfolders with module dependencies
also nice to know is the fact that the latest version of google-chrome and also opera don t know since when but longer than google-chrome supports userscripts out of the box no need to install any add-ons
but that seems like a ton of redundant code i m using squants to track units so there s more than just int and double to worry about that i d like to avoid if possible
why postgresql is more capable than others mysql etc. on django
adding a dynamic salt to each user would mean that you will have to hit a datastore to retrieve the dynamic salt and the hash version of the user s password then you will have to perform the cpu intensive hash function in your code twice -- you are hashing a hash which is less secure and more likely to have collisions
if you overwrite the env versioning the rake db migrate will go downgrade rather than upgrade if versioning is smaller than last known versioning in db schema so please check and avoid similar environment variable
i find this method simpler than using clearinterval to pause and setinterval again to restart
i suggest you to give a look to tcpdf which is far better than fpdf also because it is actively developed
if there is a junit extension or similar framework that provides a better solution than testng then please let me know
pull - do a asynctask in your android app such that whenever the app is opened it checks asynchronously if there are any upgrade by having a versioning code in a url and show a dialog to the user if the versioning code is greater than what it is in the device
gridfs is not a server-side feature but rather a convention on how files larger than the bson document size limit of 16 mb can be stored in mongodb
the only solution i have found is to restart emacs aquamacs which is obviously less than ideal
as for streaming it s better to use udp first because it lowers the load on servers but mostly because you can send packets with multicast it s simpler than sending it to each connected client
i read that nginx is faster than apache and i want to try it with some of the projects and leave the others with apache
the listener to the jlayeredpane component makes fast successive calls the listener to the jlist calls significantly slower
fireofx google-chrome safari and opera has better css selectors support compare to ie
my requirement is i need to upgrade the existing versioning currently installed versioning on the computer of the application if and only if the new application s versioning is higher than the existing versioning
reference from here link for ntp commands as i am more familiar with ubuntu debian based commands
both a renderscript and opengl are used for getting high performance graphics and animation s.but still opengl is the best option to get high performance graphics because it is well documented and you will have more control over the glsurfaceview .but in renderscript some of the classes are depreciated in the current versions .its almost not possible to make a rssurfaceview to transparent
get requests are no less insecure than post requests
it s easy to use a gem for this such as devise which does a lot or sorcery which does less so may be easier to understand and alter as you like
while celementtree is fast the world standard lxml library which also implements the elementtree is faster still
one thing is that if your inserts are not in the order of increasing primary keys innodb can take a bit longer than myisam
whenever a top parent reply tile goes out of the viewport it is disposed as expected but when trying to bring it back into view it scrolls right to the top and looks very jumpy even worse whenever a bigger thread with multiple children tries to come back into view it doesn t scroll at all
quicksort also has a better cache access behavior than heapsort
if a task is cpu bound calcuating something making it multi threaded will only improve performance if you have more than one processors to run the calculations
if you subclassing has less arguments than a superclass and you could make them optional in the superclass just add placeholders in the subclassing
well unless you re targeting older than google-chrome 1.0 firefox 8.0 ie 4.0 opera 7.0 or safari 4.0 it s safe to use insertadjacenthtml
edit double metaphone was specifically designed to be better than soundex and work in languages other than english
this is the proper solution don t ever rely on passing a string as a function when using settimeout or setinterval it s slower because it has to be evaluated and it just isn t right
on windows machine i would probably go with textpad personally i now use programmers notepad 2 however it does not support a spell checker and i don t really thinks it s better than textpad by any measure
testng is more flexible than junit and have multiple advantages like support for parallel testing for example
iirc floating-point multiplication is much less expensive than division so this might be faster than both
one of the primary distinction betweeen vi vim and emacs is emacs is designed and supposed to be run at times without quitting where as given the quick load time of vim it is easier to quit and start for editing tasks
i feel like using scripts ant maven is more natural for this task whereas java needs to work hard to read all the files folders to heap and write them to another folder
oo class diagram is more abstract and has more features than entity-relationship diagram
of course you might be able to make the first step from long string to number easier by using nsscanner or by taking a substring of your long string cutting out everything except for the number itself and then using the nsstring method integervalue or doublevalue
i know there can be problems with posts_per_page but nothing is working i ve searched a lot to get the query to display more than one post
i double checked the build.gradle s and synced the gradlew files once more
2 location + reverse geocoding - seems more reliable but requests location services on the device does it work on wifi only tablets and for it to be enabled and requires time to a fetch location b server call to reverse geocode
but on the other hand although new the ember.js package is actually more complete imo than backbone.js
note that some people feel that ng-show is a little faster than ng-switch and ng-if for file-based templates
ibm makes it easier for those who can t afford websphere application developer or rational application developer which are both eclipse flavour to use eclipse
145 the output is like Ã¢ ÂºÃ¢ Ã¢ Ã¢ ÂºÃ¢ Ã¢ it doesn t reverse when the range is higher than 145 it works fine in gcc for borland turboc the minimum range must be 65 otherwise the program prints strange values instead of reversing it
i read that settimeout is less cpu resources intensive than setinterval
i know i can do a client-side redirect with html but i understand that the server-side redirect is nicer
having getter and setter is a better thing in oop
use floating divs instead which looks like a modal dialog but are better than the pop-up
the snap.svg syntax is a bit more concise the svg.js code is more readable
now i have it so that the line is split into an array of strings using the .split method however it splits on white space and punctuation meaning that cities with names longer than one words won t work
in studio 3 much of this sort of functionality is still coming as aptana is going more of a textmate bundle route for a great deal of their features which i think is really cool
unless something has changed a lot with 2010 the basic vsts install is more or less the same as the pro version of vs - and then you install the team explorer on top to gain the tfs specific client-side extensions
also you can do this with textarea or better with pre html element
i ve been messing around with different ways of implementing this and would like a bit of advice on whether tcp or udp is a better protocol to implement the communication between client and server
using the same comparission above also shows more activity than camunda and activiti project_1 activiti project_2 processmaker
if you re really concerned with portability i m not sure that there s any better option than using printf and strtod and assuming that you may not necessarily have any more accuracy than the absolute minimum required by he relevant specification section 5.2.4.2.2 of the c99 spec.
this will be made less onerous by ruby-on-rails 3 which is intended to be orm agnostic after the merge with merb
to be able to use std allocate_shared with boost fast_pool_allocator as the allocator method using g++ 4.8 or higher with boost 1.56.0
i ve made some programs and saw that scanf and printf are considerably faster than using cin and cout
it is a great tool if you want to use git as a frontend for an existing svn server but for one-time conversions you should not use git-svn but svn2git which is much more suited for this use-case
since you tagged this with python you might find rdflib more useful than jena but the real question here should be about how to do the conversion not the library request since library requests are off topic for stack overflow
neither post or get is securer than the other in that way and so if you need security you should use https
swift is more strictly typed than objective-c
i would recommend artifactory much better than the nexus
also as mentioned elsewhere show is a better option to css visibility as hide sets display none and not visibility
memcpy is usually faster than strcpy for longer strings
if you select a versioning that is greater than the compatible versioning the file may be upgrade
saxon-ee supports streaming of large xml documents using xslt or xquery streaming is better supported in xslt than in xquery
if you will only use put remove get it s better to choose map
if you have six versioning less than 1.10 upgrade it
is this something that would be easier with paperclip shrine or refile
for example locality of references has influence on cache hits or misses which is the reason why quicksort performs better than mergesort
2 - i have read about myisam vs innodb the conclusion for me was that myisam is faster when it comes to read-only whereas innodb is designed for tables that get updated or inserts more frequently
if you re looking for more of a site-wide solution especially if you want the ui to do complex behaviors based on the url hash more than hide show a tab in one part of a page you might want to look into a proper javascript routing library like crossroads
make textview lower than imageview
the double_unit stuff is how random actually does it internally because multiplication is faster than division see floating point division vs floating point multiplication
since the screens of an ipad or other tablet is bigger than a phone s display and that would leave me with a bunch of open space i was wondering if there is something in codename one to have an image pop-up on a tablet but that it is not visible on a phone s display
after searched in google found that jackson has better performance than gson i plan to replace gson with jackson in my project but i got a diffrent result when run test code
before do git pull and git push it s better to make sure that git status result is contain text working directory clean
textbox autosizes to its content that s ok but when drag apperas the listboxitem becomes wider and move other items it s not ok
a presenter is better to accept some kind of a view factories or a supplier in general as we can already hold an existing view especially in a gwt case and let the presenter decide when instantiate or accept the view
and of course the results - if they are reproducible - might suggest that google-chrome is faster than firefox or that firefox just prioritises timeouts over dom events
when comparing my quicksort implementation with std sort on my compiler and my implementation of mergesort i noticed an odd pattern on large data sets when operating on 64 bit integers quicksort is consistently faster than mergesort
and you should not access vehicledataprovider before onresume in the life cylcle and no more after onpause
i have an expensive for-loop that is taking more time than it should due to dynamic casting overhead inside loops
edit although this answer works it is little more than objective-c transliterated into swift
i d definitely use ant or maven - my preference is ant because it s more flexible and i think it would suit your development style more than maven as well
today gradle comes with a full-fledged dependency management implementation that no longer builds upon ivy except for some traces that haven t been removed yet for backwards compatibility reasons
you re using des in your example which is a flawed and obsolete algorithm alternatively use 3des so i suggest moving to aes which provides better encryption
i used to use dbcontext for all of my db models until i read ways to optimize entity framework after following the steps i found my self forced to switch to objectcontext instead so there were alot of code changes to be done but i am not sure that i doing the right thing specially after googling the deference i ve noticed that dbcontext is newer and better than objectcontext and also i noticed that i lost alot of things while switching to objectcontext like migrations and find method and much more.
in general the way to handle this issue with a managed bean is absolutely right but keep in mind that if you have to deal with big data it would be a performance problem because the programmatic way using java data objects including operations such as sorting filtering etc. is much more slower than to work with indexed data xp dominoview
i have seen a lot of post where they are claiming that ember.js is much better than sproutcore but looking at the differences i have seen that the widget support is not there in ember.js
avcapturesession is far more rudimentary compared to avaudiorecorder - it does not provide any recording facilities by itself for example and so if you wanted to also record the audio you would need to use an avassetwriter to save the samples
the structure of the hmac algorithm makes it less susceptible to attacks on properties of the underlying hash algorithm
is a search through numbers int faster than chars in an mysql database
is swt faster than swing
while smartgwt has much more sophisticated widgets than gwt you still can t use uibinder in conjunction with it which is why i rejected using smartgwt
as an added benefit nginx can also serve static files much faster than apache and nginx also uses much less ram and can handle much more connections
the same result can be obtained also by comparing tostring of each map as you suggested but using equals is a more intuitive approach
as expected the performance got better with both and avx 2 faster than sse 4.2 but when i profiled the code with papi i found out that the total number of misses mainly l1 and l2 increased a lot
if the query itself and the response are small a few bytes consider using udp instead of tcp it s faster and you can use lower values of sendinterval
what would happen if my udp package is larger than mtu
i have had issues with dynamically created nodes that use filters and animatemotion has been a bugged in google-chrome for way too long... we use ff5+ as our interactive interfaces for this reason safari is getting better too
if you want to use inherited properties it works more like this
i ve had to replace lyebox with colorbox which is much faster and seemingly has less problems conflicting with other scripts lightbox fancybox and others wouldn t work for me
some people use array.prototype.slice to do that but i m not a fan and i think a for-loop is faster in most browsers - but either way i have nothing against for loops and the slice often feels like a hack to me
on the other hand passing an element and its attributes like maps to a call to document.createdocumentfragment which is slower than createelement followed by a write to the classname property
converting to maven requires more work -- afaik there is no official tool or wizard that allows you to generate a full pom.xml configuration from an existing eclipse project
i d recommend datamapper for orm not only it s way faster than activerecord but it s also very modularly built and plugins are actual gems that you can easily install
although quicksort runs in quadratic time as compared to mergesort which runs in linear-log time quicksort is usually faster in practice
the longer the arrays gets the more iterations your for-loop will need
in this case viewdidappear behaves more like viewwillappear ..
i know tcp is better to send file but i have a homework about sending file via udp protocol
onstart is less commonly used than oncreate
in my test keyup gives a smoother transition as compared to keydown
it looks like while google-chrome and safari are trying to do the right thing with 0px firefox is sticking closer to the standard
instead of toggle be more explicit with slidedown and slideup
in some cases hand-writing a for-loop is much faster than the equivalent accelerate functions because the compiler can optimize your loops better than the function
when comparison function is a callback function like in quicksort libc implementation quicksort is slower than mergesort by 15 on random input and 30 for already sorted array for 64 bit integers
not sure if it ll work any better than junit but there is testng
if you forget to use this and your default umask is more restrictive or less restrictive then you will need to re-run the non- sudo
in this case i would use coalesce which provides more levels than isnull rather than the case stement
it can be even shorter with show and hide
found a way to make sure the mouseleave mouseout works better
hiding state behind getter and setter gives you more flexibility to change the internal representation of the class state without breaking other classes that uses the state
des turned out to be even slower than aes but for my current requirements a much simpler algorythm rc4 is sufficient
hash password by using security salt is more secure than plain text password
the article painting in awt and swing goes into more detail
the other question why not use a concurrenthashmap here since it will provide some concurrent writes to different mapentries and provide more concurrency than readwritelock
however the qwidget gauge1 is always bigger than the other one.i want to use a qgridlayout because the application has to work on different sizes of a screen
while you are at it you might want to try the hikaricp database connection pool instead of c3p0 i suspect hikaricp is better at recovering from broken database connections
regearding your comment i also know that it can deal with flac better than wav and ogg that is not really the case
is postgresql a better option than mysql for partitioning tables by date
for comparison 0.68 usage means this outdated google-chrome release is more popular than the current and previous versions of opera the penultimate version of safari on ios and ie 9 or 10
i considered changing them to innodb to make the database 100 the same but then read the myisam is faster
in xna when is it appropriate to render your game content using more than one spritebatch
secondviewcontroller which is a subclass of firstviewcontroller also has a uilabel but has one more uibutton
overall common lisp is much more uniform than scheme and more radical language experiments if done at all are usually embedded as a portable library rather than defining a whole new language dialect
i am getting a problem using printf and fgets as in my code printf is written earlier then fget but it does not run it runs after fgets runs
it s easy much easier than installing freebsd or god forbid opensolaris pretty straightforward and the perl and python will be 64 bits out of the box and part of default installation
i have tried with sublimetext 2 and it work very very good better than gedit p
we don t actually multiplying it s slower than simple addition and as you can see we destroy temporary register t0 but don t touch s0 s1
2 however coalesce requires all arguments to be of the same data type thus being stricter than nvl which will first attempt an implicit conversion
you should treat submit as what happens after you ve done any pre-processing so binding to click events then conditionally raising the submit is better than always submission but conditionally stopping the submit
nginx is quicker though honestly you ll struggle to see the difference except for very high volume sites and has quickly become the web server of choice for a lot of people if you don t have any specific need for apache for your code
this way is better than having getter and setter in base of performance not to have reduntant code of two methods getter and setter
i don t know why arch linux is slower than ubuntu on your machine
in fact svn does stores binaries a lot more efficient than cvs for more info see the svn-faq
i think you should install phpmyadmin on your server this will allow you to access your database from work school cafe etc mysql-workbench is more advanced and gives you more features so you can deal with changing the structure and editing any rows columns relations and much more look at phpmyadmin s features it has most if not all
using multiprocessing is probably not going to speed up reading data from disk since disk access is much slower than ram access or calculations
which is more efficient is up for debate but based on cpu bulk instructions which can copy an entire block of memory in one instruction memcpy is probably faster as strncpy would check each copied byte for a nul character
i ve got a script for ensuring the user doesn t check more than 4 checkbox but i can t find a way to ensure that the submit button is disabled if they have selected less than 4 items
this is faster than the nprect but still slower than sin and cos calls
in firefox the render of new tiles and the panning is laggy this is not the case when using maps.google.com so it s not an issue of google-chrome being better than firefox
i think put and get on ignite cache would likely to be slower than native put and get on my inbuilt key value store
other posts which reference this error message seem to think it s a problem with not having an upgrade versioning of virtualenv but its versioning is higher than the troublesome versioning
better use google-chrome even thought firefox is not slower than google-chrome for once probably the tracing for the image comparison pays off yay
mouseenter and mouseout afterwards is cheaper for what you are doing and fires it s event only once
can be that the memory operations calloc memcpy is slower in one system
if the value of touchesbegan is greater than touchesended then an active touch is going on
the quotation you brought up just claim that maven does more than ant so that it s not fair to compare the two
if all you need is a different layout for portrait and landscape there s an easier way to do this
you might replace the max subquery with a rank max is usually slower only when cus_id is the pi rank might be worse
probably webm will load faster than standard mp4 but i am not so familiar with webm format
it is possible for swift to be faster than pure objective-c in things that you would traditionally use c or c++ for anyway
each line can do one of three things it can call a function which modifies it s argument start a while loops which is really more of a for-loop or assign a variable
ant is older and while it is still used in a number of projects it is rapidly losing ground to maven
oh and just incase you were thinking innodb is slower than myisam - the myisam implementation i tested was twice as slow in all counts
implementing icomparable is a more fine-grain way of comparison as it provides the compareto method which is a greater-than less-than comparison as opposed to equals which is simply a is-equal-or-not comparison
while 256-bit aes might sound less secure than 4096-bit rsa they might actually be quite similar from the offered protection
more over it seems that get requests are more lightweight than post under high load
as mentioned by loÃ£ c faure-lacroix js numbers are much more complicated than unsigned short
the compiler or the jit is likely to convert the first case to the second anyway since multiplication is typically faster than division
but when i change my maxbetamt to 241.55 or 2400.25 this message comes out max bet amount must be greater than min bet amount
it is a feature it is about objectcontext api but the same is true or worse with dbcontext api
the fact is not all routers support this scenario and always require port forwarding for udp traffic tcp traffic is easier because there is an on-going connection the router can maintain with the client
spidermonkey firefox is slower 50 of google-chrome max speed but the speed is consistent
udp is simpler protocol than tcp and you can still simulate features of tcp using udp
calloc is faster than malloc + memset because calloc knows that the mmap d pages are pre-zeroed and memset forces the allocation of physical ram
basically - httplib is lower level while urllib is high-level
i have no problem with methods declared inline in a header in some cases - a struct s constructor a simple method where inlining measurably makes it faster we have some math functions like this etc
even if underlying implementation is not so different memcpy is much faster because it does not have to check what it s copying strncpy will stop when it ll copy the end of string character null
for example on ati cards you ll want to manually vectorize code using float4 int4 data types or accept a nearly 4x performance penalty while nvidia works better with scalar data types
it might be that latency of various instructions is much better covered by the processors thanks to hyperthreading or cache behavior as sizes differ
i worked on it to make it more consistent between google-chrome and firefox
hex is easy octal is even easier to convert to and you dont need to do the backward thing for a quick check can reverse it by hand after you see the result
since you don t do updates i think myisam would be better than innodb in this scenario
java has build-in support for work with pkcs#12 keystore work with this containers doesn t much differ than standart jks keystore
i use objective-c more than swift
but then sorting by age grouping ak is more difficult i think
for the sake of completeness i would like to mention another less powerful algorithm with addition subtraction
what i have thought of so far is that tcp is going to be more reliable than udp and in rmi corba we want network reliability
i admit i only skimmed the rfc link but it looks like more than one spaces can be used as a delimiter so you might want to change those to +
the latter doesn t do any dynamic memory allocator and is more than 10 times faster than std to_string on boost karma benchmarks
use a radix tree wiki or trie wiki if you are concerned about performance.the radix tree is more memory efficient compared to a trie
i cannot tell if this happens in ie or edge also because it never happen to me with them but i m using them rarely because i m more accustomed with google-chrome and firefox s web developer tools - source console etc
mostly interpreted-language are a bit slower compared with compiled-language but i guess the difference is almost negligible in coffeescript javascript because of node.js
the consensus seems to be that corona is easier to use but that cocos2d-x has the advantages that come from being open source easy to customize merge with other code community etc
however even this version is about 2-3 times faster than using sin and cos on every iteration
all in all jackson is considered to be faster but i ve also read that gson gives better performance when working with large objects
for example public static void copy reader r writer w throws ioexception is more useful reusable than public static void copy filereader r filewriter w throws ioexception
good options are llvm libc++ static library fewer features more compatible with clang and gnu stl static library more features i had an issue that required me to turn the clang optimizer to -oz to prevent a segfault
instead you can support more than the jks and try the default keystore type and if it fails try the #pkcs12
while udp has less network overhead than tcp it generally relies on you the developer to come up with your own mechanisms for flow control fragmentation handling lost packets etc.
asymptotic analysis reveals order of growth of heapsort in the worst case is big-o n logn which is better than quicksort s big-o n 2 as a worst case
also changing your imagemagick install from a 16bit one to a 8bit may improve speed as i belive that is one reason graphicsmagick is faster
by the way the code with show hide is also more readable
a for-loop is more sppropriate than a while loops
after inspecting the test in ie 8 9 and seeing its results look like those of firefox i think there s an explanation for the google-chrome results i m pretty sure google-chrome webkit has a better optimization in the first version of the test especially the parseint part which gives a better result for parseint there
quicksort is not better than mergesort
add layout_weight properties to sub views as well.assign 3 to imaveview and 1 for textview now imageview always will be bigger than textview 3times and textview can not invade imagevies s space
if you want to batch and parfor at the same time open one less worker with matlabpool than you otherwise would
using the clipping version of drawimage will be faster than putimagedata
what you try to achieve is certainly possible with xquery or with xslt which is more convenient for transforming xml trees especially for multiple transform passes
as for whether to use xslt or xquery the proof is in the pudding xslt is better at transforms and xquery is better at queries
but settimeout would be better than setinterval because with setinterval if your previous ajax request is not complete and you start another request there will have multiple requests which would sooner be problematic
i assume that is parsed correctly because the two operators have different precedences meaning that associativity does not come into play and that your grammar correctly implements precedence although you should note that is a more standard example for showing that multiplication has higher precedence than addition since simple left-to-right parsing of gives the same result as your parser
spdy is a more efficient protocol than http
i just recently switched databases to postgresql which has given me a slew of problems although i must admit i like it a lot better than mysql
for that purpose i want to transform the simulink model into a c version and launch it from a matlab script so that the process would be much faster than opening simulink environment
one thing to note is the soak time you have for your application - if it is big then you might have to provision for more machines with ram and disk
i know that teamcity has a way of achieving this but i think that jenkins is more constrictive
firstly multiplication and division is actually quicker in some circumstances
i ve found that setting the selecteditem is more reliable than setting the selectedindex
here the for-loop header takes actually more time than loops body thus profiling results could be distorted.
in kohana for example also codeigniter but kohana is more flexible you can build internal requests with
i managed to use andlinux + wine to get this working but honestly i think the vmware virtual pc virtualbox route is simpler
furthermore swift is stricter than objective-c when it comes to initialisers
i m sure there are other holes like that too - but the code above will work on any system which supports paging and where disk access is much more expensive than ram access
i personally use codeigniter which probably falls in to the heavy framework category but is at least much lighter than cakephp and lighter than zend too i think
in a native application i would use udp for the most data player position ... because it s way faster than tcp and it s uncritical when it is lost
these are situations where udp is good but in most other situations tcp is better
on my vanilla osx yosemite it yields more precise results than file -i
and also does anyone know why is firefox so much slower than google-chrome in 3d rendering
filtering is a lot less expensive than sorting
be the result of form data probably url_encoded and use the correct request method get is perfectly correct but coming from an html from post is much more common
i built a site and the problem is google-chrome display font-size 1px bigger than firefox
update3 now it works here which means that i couldn t fully reproduce my bug to show it to you but in general the problem is that the height of 5x5 table in google-chrome is less from firefox on 22px which is 22px gap between table container and a table itself
before we move on i just wanted to mention that spring oauth2 already provides an implementation for the above interface meaning that we could make our life a lot easier by actually extends the only implementation of the above interface clientdetails which is org.springframework.security.oauth2.provider.client.baseclientdetails rather than implements it from the beginning leverage all that can be done from baseclientdetails and add our own custom fields hence the myclientdetails looks as follow then
a for-loop would be more compact but a while loops is perhaps simpler if you aren t used to python s loops
however there is a desktop application framework called griffon that uses the same language as grails groovy which should be easier than using swing or swt
pypy compiled with jit is almost always faster than cpython frequently by a large margin
it is said that if you have a mostly read based application you should use myisam as it is better than innodb
imho cmder is better in windows than cygwin to work with unix commands
for example the patricia trie or the radix tree that is far more space efficient than an hash table for strings but of course being a tree lookup computational complexity is o log n and building it is o n log n
why simd for-loop only 14 faster than foreach loops
mousedown mouseup is indeed the only way you can get notified of middle button interaction so detecting a down-then-up event without intervening mouseout event is more or less the best you can do
tcp is certainly going to be more reliable than udp since udp doesn t guarantee packet delivery which is probably why you application is hanging on the receive
in your example fn is attempting to call call but it s not specifying the context which typically defaults to the window object but in this case it just makes it undefined which triggers a weird error in google-chrome as you discovered but firefox is clearer about the problem
and the results is that foreach loops is 5-6 times faster than the for-loop
modulo is more mathematical if you like while the remainder in the c-family is consistent with the common integer division satisfying and this is adopted from old fortran
ant pre-dates more modern tools like maven and gradle that have this feature baked in
firefox on nexus 7 is a bit better at producing reasonable sample rate readings but the updating of the display is even more sluggish than google-chrome
note that if you have json and rest then retrofit is going to be better than pure okhttp
stripes the actionbean approach doesn t look much better than struts
lxml -- 100x better than elementtree
lxml is significantly more powerful and robust than beautifulsoup in my experienced opinion
also don t present modal vc from self at viewdidload at the time of this method execution the vc is often not yet presented itself viewdidappear is more fitting for such tests
my thought is javascript show hide option is better for usability and the customers journey especially on mobiles
using getter or setter function is better
many current processors chips incorporate more than one cpu and a cpu may itself be able to interleave a couple of threads
scalacheck s api is also a bit richer than quickcheck s api
while function calls can be a little worse than inline code for very simple operations repeated inlining of non-trivial functions can create arbitrarily worse code bloat
icomparable is an interface that defines that two instances of the implementing class can be seen as greater than less than or equals to one another
a very quick test suggests that the difference is probably negligible in google-chrome but that firefox is substantially quicker with indexof for short strings at least
i understand that laravel is what s hot right now but i ve never played with it and am not sure if learning laravel is more time-effective vs using codeigniter which i know pretty well but just doesn t excite me any more
a property is nothing more than a getter and setter function
you may want to use junit in the part of unit testing but testng is more than a unite testing framework
you might want to look at one of these options if you re running in a vm since xfce is slightly lighter weight than gnome although not all that much lighter these days
the first possible issue i can think of is that because udp doesn t have the overhead inherent in the transmission control that tcp does udp has higher data bandwidth and lower latency
the datagram is larger than your buffer so it gets trucated you get an error return from recvfrom and getlasterror returns 10040 wsaemsgsize
git and mercurial both handle this more easily that you re imagining and easier than say svn or cvs do
a quick googling says that apc is 5 times faster than memcached
then you should achive them with a counter and maybe a for-loop is better then while loops
i was going to use reliable udp but tcp seems more appropriate
however on smaller int sizes quicksort gets slower and mergesort gets faster
ntfs filesystems actually supports longer names 32k but there is no easy way to allow long names for programs
it s not necessarily true that the matlab fixed-point arithmetic provides less precision it can be used to provide more precision than ieee floating-point types
neither one of get and post is inherently more secure than the other just like neither one of fax and phone is more secure than the other
i ve copied a file over to a ram disk but i get an error message that doesn t make sense as the path is actually shorter than on the physical disk and is certainly less than 260 characters
i found jackson better than gson performance project activity better docs ...
fakeiteasy seems to have an overall nicer syntax than moq like the strongly-typed way the former deals with passing parameters to a constructor of a faked class
re-order your script so the subtraction test is timed first then the addition and suddenly addition becomes the faster operation again
i think jedit is equal to or better than notepad++
as you see md2 is also much much shower than the other hash Ã¢ the same outcome as with the php code but md5 is much faster than sha-1 and overall it took less time in delphi to do the same on the same machine as php
it seems ironpython is just slower than cpython for reading text files
i realize this is an older post but we just ran into the same issue and resolved it by setting the z-index of the bubble pop-up to something higher than the dialog window
when you add more than 5 uiviewcontroller objects to your uitabbarcontroller ios will automatically create the more button for you
even more oop-like with setter getter
yes division is usually much slower than multiplication
since you already learned c++ you should use something more serious such as tbb or ppl
i ve tested the sample on firefox and it s a bit slower than google-chrome but usable
the authors of redmine are trying to create a better trac than trac
the latter where is called without arguments does indeed have a lesser precedence than the properties accessor - so that your expression evaluates as new number.tostring
also sml has stricter precedence rules than haskell
grails upgrade if this grails versioning is newer than the versioning your
you could try running it in pypy - for some cases it can be significantly faster than cpython
in inheritance the father should not access the methods of the children it is better to inherit and implement new methods that have nothing to do with the parent in the child class
the difference between the two boils down to the syntax with which objects are instantiated - classical inherited uses the more familiar constructor functions and new operator which hide the inherent prototypal nature of javascript s object creation and inherited properties
or scikit-learn directly .for more details nltk 3.0 documentation
bad buffering can also be a result of a slow computer because statistics show that google-chrome is better for a normal-fast computer and firefox works best on slow computers
this keeps the upgrade versioning of myproject.web at the current versioning but when installed in a new project the versioning of mypackage.web never exceeds 4.0.x even when the latest versioning is higher
my question is how can i execute more than 1 prepare statement
for the stand of file operations writing to memory ram is always faster than writing to the file on the disk directly
the pypy jit for python is also much more complex than cpython but also typically much faster Ã¢ increased complexity is a fairly typical cost for speed. the four levels of disassembly for julia code give you access to the representation of a julia method implementation for particular argument types at different stages of the transformation from source code to machine code
still you cannot inherited from a as superclass cannot have a lower visibility than subclassing
srt is simpler than ass but lacks features so you may need to use the force_style option in the subtitle filter
in the event that the quicksort starts to degenerate it uses heapsort which is o n log n worst-case but slightly slower than quicksort on average to guarantee o n log n worst-case runtimes
data structure to implement reverse functionality of a dictionary that is more than one key map to a common value using python
i am guessing this is because modifying a double is a more complex operation than modifying an int
tcpdf was always slower than fpdf
if you want to accept a number rather than a digit and only a number strtol works much better than atoi as it allows you to check for failures
you need to create a fileoutputstream and decorates it with printstream or better filewriter with printwriter
a for-loop is usually faster than a while loops and it is more difficult to build an endless loops than it is by using a while loops
but as programs grow and structs deepen keeping track of what s been malloc d where and what s appropriate to free gets harder and harder
plus you have to make your tables myisam which is generally less suitable than innodb
myisam delivers better read performance compared to innodb at the cost of being less acid compliant
union forces a distinct to occur and there s little slower than distinct
having used it myself in my opinion it s also far nicer than swing in its api more like swt in that respect looks far nicer by default and far more flexible in what it allows you to do
i m concerned this is going to get worse as we put more tests into the specflow project
in mobile platforms except larger screens as on tablet the affix would be disabled entirely and the page would only rely on the responsiveness of the grid
anyway you will have a huge performance loss due to the fact that your disk is way slower than your ram
i confirmed that in debug mode the getline version is slower about 130 Ã¢Âµs vs 60 Ã¢Âµs for the fgetc version
finally sha1 hash are safer than md5 i tell you that because you used the md5 tag in your post
running pear -v gives me versioning 1.7.2 when i run pear upgrade pear it says my versioning is newer than the current noe which is 1.9.0 if ran pear upgrade -f pear to force an upgrade it downloads the files and installs successfully but i still have versioning 1.7.2 and cannot install phpunit
prism is more of a modularity framework and caliburn is more of a mvvm framework i know both have overlapping features but it would be great to take best features from two frameworks when they are combined
maybe a repeater is better but you will be fine with a gridview if you are familiar with it
ie edge s loading time is longer than google-chrome and firefox
also if you can do the above you can probably just as easily turn your code into a for-loop which seems more appropriate given your desire to a break out of loops b use the operator to cause side effects
uitabbaritem is a subclass of uibaritem everything is more painful because uibaritem doesn t subclass uiview
but if you want some header functions in header column like sorting or filtering that is more complicated and you have to implement by your own
udp is great if you plan to have your client for the game account for missing information by using approximation most fps games do this as well as just about any game that requires very quick reflexes where tcp ip is simpler will greatly reduce errors in transmission and be more prone to lag
why is quicksort better than mergesort
as far as efficiency rsa is going to be orders of magnitudes slower than aes so the trade-off you make is that you give up simplicity you give up the simplicity of using aes in favor of some rsa chunking in return for poor performance you get the slower performance of rsa.
i made a docker image to use it with my builds of a project in wercker i did this because i thought having the require packages already installed in the environments is better than installing them in each build of my project
alternate way is to use awt - which is an older and worse technology than swing and in that case you can t use flowlayout - it puts all the components into one row
instead of hooking into keypress events and such perhaps working with the built-in events like onpause onstart ondestroy etc is more suited to your needs
why the access modifiers for the getter setter is more restrictive has in my opinion something to do with easier implements interfaces which always have implicitly public properties
division is one of a number of operations which as far as computational complexity theory is concerned are no more expensive than multiplication
dbcontext is much simpler to use than objectcontext and will serve the most common development needs
jboss has a larger community than glassfish
also nginx uses a lot less memory than apache
hope you get the more clarification by this post
you can verify with a simple objdump symbols objfile.obj that the length of decorated symbols by using typedef s is incredibly longer than their similar counterparts split into struct s microsoft compilers have historically used a proprietary name mangling scheme
for more complex xml reading writing you better check xerces which is heavier than tinyxml
apache is more popular and has more features nginx is smaller and faster and has less features
note using treeset instead of hashset would give directly sorted arraylist and above collections.sort could be skipped but treeset is otherwise less efficent so it s often better and rarely worse to use hashset even when sorting is needed
innodb was faster when data was present already and generally performed better except for hdd-space - myisam is smaller on disk
i now think the combination of emacs and vim is better than either alternative
or generally speaking is it possible to add the same children to more than one parent
push log files to a central location ftp is faster than smb the windows ftp command can be automated with -s scriptfile
in short as an authentication protocol kerberos is far more secure out of the box is de-centralized and will put less load on your directory authentication servers than ldap will
as an example my android tablet s stock video player app has a feature that allows it to be less than full screens
in practical programming languages the distinction between the two is a bit blurred but is important to know that the c java for-loop is closer to a theoretical while loops while the pascal for behaves more like the theoretical for-loop
i still have to do more testing with the multiplication and division but other than that it seems to be working well
it is similar to incron however config uses a simpler to read ini file instead of a plain text file
firefox s default textbox includes more padding than ie google-chrome
also google-chrome s map function is up to 2x slower than firefox on my machine
he concludes that nunit wins for unit testing but mstest has much better abilities for integration based testing and team testing with team system
if you plan for long term i don t see more options than swt or swing for gui development in java
are you using the jquery ui accordian or using the jquery accordian which is more or less a series of show and hide which is used more commonly i would think
in your case whats happening is that your galaxy tablet has a lower pixel density and android down-scales the image from a xxhdpi to whatever density the tablet has hdpi or xhdpi ....so it your image is a 512px image android would down-scale it to 341px for xhdpi or 256px for an hdpi device
it runs on a number of platforms and supports more than just elf files i believe it also supports coff and a few others
as for the last question floating point arithmetic particularly double precision is much more complex than int arithmetic so on a reasonably modern pipelined processor each instruction will take longer to execute
phantomjs achieves a better accuracy than firefox slightly lower than google-chrome but in around half the time of firefox
i m doing a project at university which i decided to do in javafx as it is more stylish than swing but i m having difficulty to find an alternative to the filledoval library for the canvas awt as i can t use the canvas awt in javafx
java tends to be much more verbose than swift so i doubt what i m asking is too broad it is more likely that i don t know how to use the objective-c messagecomposer object because the documentation that i linked to above is unclear with regard to usage in swift
you can do this with beautifulsoup s html parser though the lxml.html package is somewhat more straightforward
i am using a for-loop which iterates i time and every time it is checked whether the ith number of the arrays is greater than 1 or not
i have just spent a few days playing around with web2py and really like it and i am wondering if django offers something more that i am missing out on
the while loops is essentially the same thing implemented differently but in this situation the for-loop looks cleaner and easier to follow
currently macports has many more packages 18.6 k than there are homebrew formulae 3.1k owing to its maturity
liblinear is considered faster than linear libsvm and often used for large scale data set
update i ve created a webhelper class that takes the place of webclient but provides more access to the necessary features of the underlying webrequest
i noticed that when i flip my phone from portrait to landscape everything gets bigger
is openrasta better than wcf
the decision on yours the tcp protocol used for connection oriented network that is more secure than udp
quicksort is more sensitive to input sortedness in a positive way than mergesort
looks like postgresql is a little more compliant than mysql so try this instead
or you can add a pop-up dialog which is more customizable
it might seem unintuitive but it has a lower precedence than multiplication addition and modulo operations
i got it to work by using a child process from pexpect which is much more flexible than telnetlib
also i am not sure why everyone is suggesting onblur isn t onchange is better for validation purpose
so every multiplicative-expression is an additive-expression but not vice-versa and this is what makes multiplication bind tighter than addition
consider taking a look at splinter which is a simpler webdriver api than selenium
tornadoweb and nginx are popular web servers for the moment and many benchmarkings show that they have a better performance than apache under certain circumstances
however since around 2006 think ie7+ firefox 2+ google-chrome etc browsers no longer provide the full file path they only provide the file s name without directory information
for semantic zooming you ll notice that d3.js is significantly faster than protovis
but if you are allowed to store whole tree into memory you can use lxml.html which is faster than beautifulsoup
a way with a partialfunction and implicit which looks more like your mapfirst
not many layout problems can t be conquered using it and its easy to understand as opposed to springlayout groupedlayout etc and far less code and more robust than gridbaglayout
why with this grammar multiplication have higher precedence than addition
this is an enormous amount of extra work and explains why calloc is faster than malloc and memset
first let me say that i m more experienced with verilog but have been plugging away with vhdl for awhile trying to fix this issue
but innodb has improved dramatically in the past few years and in most cases today innodb performs faster than myisam
often google-chrome is understanding more thing then it should and firefox is bringing you the reality back in your face eheh
for fat filesystems that s less complicated but still you ll have to study the fs for a while
consider if toggleclass is more appropriate than addclass removeclass
sse has precision more comparable to gpu you need float4 or float8 in your kernel such that compiler can produce sse avx which has closer precision to gpu
in ... for-loop it s consider better practice to loops trough it with a regular for
just to goof off a version using boost string_ref is much faster still due the reduced allocator
i did test it a while ago with the result that a for-loop is much faster than a foreach loops
it s not the first time that the plugin for firefox works better for me than the one for google-chrome
i like to use bufferedwriter more than printwriter and its working with the bufferedwriter
i hear oursql is nicer the mysql-python
this actually happens more commonly with tcp connections but i see no reason udp can t have this problem as well
where the parent can have one or more children many but the child can exist without a parent but it can never have more than one parent zero or one
another thing that bothers me is why in nhibernate always it is being used ilist and not ienumerable which has less functionality
is there a way to do this in an easier fashion with httplib or urllib
a realloc can occur significantly faster than a malloc memcpy and free
my stackoverflow search indicates that it can be turned off by setting setopt nonomatch then zsh behaves more like bash glob the pattern and pass it to the program if no match is found
nginx or lighttpd in fastcgi mode use less ram than apache and they can handle more concurrent connections
a much better solution is to be sure that the code that needs a reference to the active and displayed itemsform instance has one either directly through constructor or setter getter method calls or better indirectly through a m-v-c program structure
say your first versioning of application had the databasehelper extending sqliteopenhelper with constructor passing versioning as 1 and then you provided an upgrade application with the new source code having versioning passed as 2 then automatically when the databasehelper is constructed platform triggers onupgrade by seeing the file already exists but the versioning is lower than the current versioning which you have passed
the reason for this is that and is strong than or it s like in math where multiplication is stronger than addition 3 5+3 15+3 18
trac s issue tracking is little better than bugzilla s...i know a lot of folks love trac but i find it very inflexible
i have used this pattern with apache before and nginx seems more capable in most respects so i m sure this must be possible
well jspm is much larger and ambitious project than bower
you can use isnull also in place of coalesce as isnull is comparatively faster than coalesce
there are many more out there magento oscommerce zen etc.
so then i think to go with that approach i would end up with a for-loop and loads of add calls but surely that is even worse than the arrays copy isn t it
addclass removeclass is far more efficient since it contains all the styling externally where it s easy to add remove that styling to the element when needed
the while loops runs 3000 times faster than the for-loop
boxlayout is far easier than gridbaglayout because you don t have to learn how to specify constraints
i used soundcloud api and sdk and it is better than the grooveshark api which till now i don t know how to embed songs and use my own player anyways soundcloud is good just try it goodluck
however if you re making a pop-up dialog it s better to detect if the user is not on a mobile device then use the css position fixed
a multi-character-constant is a literal int uses the character-literal-syntax with more than one chars and has an implementation-defined value
there appears to be a common mis-conception that post is more secure than get simply because it seems more obvious how to get a browser to manipulate the post variable
have you considered changing to innodb - it has much better concurrency support and in some contexts will run faster than myisam
this is to learn something new but also because it seems like implementing maven within ant is less of a standard than is just pure maven.
i have directory with many folder each mail folder has more folder into
however quicksort s worst-case performance is significantly worse than heapsort s is
for-loop is faster then foreach and foreach is faster then for in loops
if it s a very deep inner loops however and you need to squeak out every last nanosecond my experience has been that with release build code a for-loop indexing over an arrays is measurably faster than a foreach loops with a slightly smaller performance loss for using delegates with linq vs
two words of warning against wxpython it is not possible to install it via the popular fink package manager on mac os x currently which makes it far less portable than pyqt and tkinter
and also apple does might not confidently announce that swift is more faster than objective-c in all the cases
the for-loop question is more of someone building a loops with exit criterion inside the actual loops
as far as i know the division is more complex and slower than other operations like addition so is my code incorrect then
is keras consumes more gpu memory than equivalent tensorflow model training
that said modifier keys are important in vim even if less than in emacs
knuth-morris-pratt which is classic or boyer-moore which is sometimes faster
because int comparisons are more efficient and simpler than unicode chars comparisons
pbkdf2 also uses a more complex construction in particular hmac over direct digest to make recovering the input password from an output value more difficult
i think udp will perform better than tcp gcdasyncsocket in your case video transfer
if the code doesn t run on php 5.2+ then you can t use a current phpunit versioning which is definitely more of a concern and my first general recommendation is to find any issues an php 5 upgrade might bring
a pipe write read is atomic up to pipe_buf chars and an int is way less than that so the reads are predictable
it is likely that you could do an sha hash of 100kb in well less than 10 second though and though sha-1 is still theoretically flawed it is of higher strength than md5
png achieves better compression than gif because it applies a pre-filtering step before the lossless compression deflate roughly equivalent to lzw. see wikipedia s explanation of png filtering
the priority level of ng-controller is lower than that of ng-include
charles has a much better ui than fiddler
memset behaves like strcpy but the difference is that memcpy copied the data as it is byte but strcpy copies the formatted string as well so takes more time than memcpy to execute
however my experience is that configuring it in apache is significantly more complex than configuring it in nginx and even with worker it still is not quite as efficient with nginx
for radio button and checkbox it is better to use change events using .on event handler attachment
stringr is newer based on stringi internally and is often even faster
myisam is more prone to locking problems than innodb i believe
lxml also has more features and offers beautifulsoup too
having said that web2py has a lower initial learning curve than django as it was specifically designed as a learning tool
since i am more familiar with jackson here are some aspects where i think jackson has more complete support than gson apologies if i miss a gson feature
settimeout is better than setinterval here because setinterval will start at every 5 secs but settimeout will start once each time your job is done and wait for 5 seconds which will make your script adaptive to server response timings
also using a separate httpwebrequest or webclient gives you more control over proxies handling redirection authentication etc
to explain why a for-loop is faster than a for in loops is basically understand the underlying data structures used to store the data in memory
myisam generally performs faster because it lacks certain functions innodb has such as rollback... but it has only table locking
using jdialog instead of joptionpane is better to put number of data
division may be heavier than multiplication but a commenter pointed out that reciprocals are just as fast as multiplication on modern cpus in which case this isn t correct for your case so if you do have 1 x appearing somewhere inside a loop and more than once you can assist by caching the result inside the loop and then using y
in practice the fifo queue approach is often faster than using a priority queue dijkstra as mentioned in this answer are there faster algorithms than dijkstra
so far this works how i wanted on google-chrome but it doesnt look the same when on firefox and looks even worse on ie 10
i like caffe but the amount of gpu memory caffe use is larger than mxnet i test in resnet-50 with mxnet-memonger
the reason i ask is i am running proficy ifix 5.0 and when i run aero it adds annoying scrollbars to everything as the titlebar of the window is bigger than it normally is
i d have one project team responsible for localization which may well involve more than just translation - different countries have different legal requirements currencies payment providers etc. and one team for improving the code base
i read in couple of blogs that in java modulo reminder operator is slower than bitwise-and
you can also supply a timeout for these requests meaning any requests that run longer than the timeout window will be terminate after all
in theory insertion sort and quicksort are worse than heapsort
a better way to do that instead is taking in an ienumerable which is more generic than icollection since icollection implements ienumerable and simply checking it for null and else returning any from linq s operators
a key-stretching algorithm like pbkdf2 applies a quicker hash like sha512 thousands of times typically causing the hash generation to take 1 5 of a second or so
i guess that the maven version contains much more than the ant version
the reason for using lxml for such a task is that it cleans html files better than beautifulsoup do
on the other hand relaxing from private to protected public is less traumatic because you don t have to worry about previous access to that property from without that class
mouseover rather than on mousedown makes it easier to catch moving
i have been working with linear parsers lately and noticed the performance in google-chrome v37 was much slower than in firefox v30
it uses swap space on disk to allow for processes much larger than ram
edit using an enhanced for-loop is a lot better than using arrays
we are having an issue with uploading ipa files to our mdm solution when there is more than one info.plist present in the ipa file
uiview is more generic than uiwindow and should be preferred
generally when passing lots of data to the server to be processed or stored using post is a good idea since get has a lower limit than that of post
you don t need to write any new members - it s just a marker interface - but there are other methods you can add to give more control over serializable and deserialization
innodb is a safer acid compliant engine with some integrity features that myisam lacks
so basically when box2d is more about how objects will behave themselves during application running the scene2d is more about how you write your code before application running
puremvc is more invasive than cairngorm meaning that your code is heavily dependent on the framework you have to subclass implement the framework classes interfaces but that doesn t mean that cairngorm isn t
swift seems to be less dynamic than objective-c in these stuffs
if not multiple fgets calls will still be faster than multiple fgetc calls because the overhead of the latter will be greater
according to this benchmark nginx is a little bit better than lighttpd for serving bigger static contents so nginx would be a good choice for static flv video contents
pyquery uses the css selector syntax familiar from jquery which i find more intuitive than beautifulsoup s
you might want to use r markdown and knitr which is easier than using latex and r as also zhaoy suggested
that being said i think svn is better in every other respect and you probably shouldn t start a new project with cvs
it s just a matter of preferences and browser implementation eg firefox works faster with brackets while google-chrome works faster with the dots
since multiplication is more expensive than addition you want to let the machine paralleliz it as much as possible so saving your stalls for the addition means you spend less time waiting in the addition loop than you would in the multiplication loop
the problem is that the dropbox folder is no longer in my user directory so r cannot find the directory.
go to your user directory c profiles youruser there should be a folder called .m2 may be hidden
just a tip but from personal experience i ve found that freebsd works much better on low-end hardware than a modern linux distro does
same passenger + mri 2.3.0 is 3 times faster than puma + jruby on same rack app
from testing this in google-chrome and safari it seems google-chrome is more forgiving in that it parses the style string and puts the right style in place for you but safari does not
thus write-heavy data structures are probably better implemented mutably and with something like a skip-lists where you only need to lock locally while read-heavy data structures are probably better implemented immutably where a tree is a more natural data structure
usually i find swift s method naming to be cleaner than objective-c s but init methods can be an exception
django s is better web2py s appadmin is for administrators only
ultimately if the structure of a loops is more expensive than the operations within loops and the tiny performance overhead from loops is actually significant then you might have a case for-loop unrolling
in opera it goes little bit lower than in firefox
as others have stated the python for-loop is more like a a traditional foreach loops in the sense that it iterates over a collection of items without checking a condition
if more than one uiviewcontroller hangs off the applicationÃ¢ s uiwindow only one of these will get the messages for changes in orientation
scenario where udp is better than tcp
tcp - more reliable than udp but this comes with some overhead there is a distinct connection a better match for games which require less frequent data transmission such as turn based games as is your game
the only problem is when i hover the parent the children is blinking more like fading out and then fading in again the jquery is doing this but i dont know to fix this
edit i was hoping not to turn this into another flame war but i guess that s inevitable so i will just say that i have considerably more experience with autotools and no desire to learn cmake or scons or imake or ant although i seem pretty much stuck with the latter when working with java these days or whatever new tool is invented next year or the year after
is there a better way than show hide that would be easier on the memory performance
the libsvm results seems much more stable but scikit-learn results have some drastic fluctuation
the floyd-warshall algorithm has a worst case performance of o |v| 3 where as dijkstra s has a worse case performance of o |e| + |v|log |v|
the size of maven jar is bigger then ant jar i don t know why help me please
this overlap is somewhat forced when the draggable is bigger than the droppable
ilist is stronger in that it makes more guarantees than ienumerable
why is this slower than memcpy or memmove
when i generate rsa key pairs by openssl it seems like private key private exponent is always less than public key modulo
while ruby and python are both interpreted-language and operation-for-operation slower than compiled-language the reality is in executing an application only a small portion of cpu time is spent in your code and the majority is spent into the built-in libraries you call into which are often native implementations and thus are as fast as compiled code
when the user wants to check for an upgrade download the version-file if the currently installed versioning is smaller than the most recent one then download the apk and install it
moreover tcp has more processing overhead than udp
eventually i went back to post because we needed the fix quick but it has been bugging me because semantically a get is more correct in this case
postgresql is worth learning and much more advanced than mysql
i am using calayer s because as suggested in documentation calayer s are lighter than uiview and i have hundreds of them
an earlier than versioning clause in conflicts prevents dpkg from upgrading or installing the package which declares such a conflict until the upgrade or removal of the conflicted-with package has been completed which is a strong restriction
that is pointless if you are expecting more than one output from your resultset you need something more than a jtextfield maybe a jtable
specifically it makes it possible to write objective-c code that plays nicely with swift which is more strongly typed than objective-c
i want to do this in tcsh i know bash is better to use but i have to use tcsh
i have no idea about appfog but heroku is more than capable for running scrapy
last version on ibm s website is from 2008 redhat enterprise 5.2 and fedora 9 - has anyone an experience running this ibm sdk on fedora 13 or at least any version higher than stated fedora 9 and is linux available of sufficient testing
the reason heapsort is slower in practice than quicksort is due to the better locality of reference in quicksort where data elements are within relatively close storage locations
i guess the point that the article is trying to make here is that a facade is easier to implement when you already have this command-pattern in place
of course as a general rule it s highly recommended to wrap your ajax calls in a unified method that concatenates the csrf token to the request be it get or post although post is safer and much more correct from architectural perspective so when you make ajax calls you focus on the business input values only and don t need to worry about csrf
fragment primary support more dynamic large ui screens like tablet.because tablet screens is much larger than normal handset
for example exposing the students property in swift means different places can all modify it and the delegate would be notified also it s not clear to the coder that setting students property would trigger a delegate notification for averagescore whereas having a dedicate method in objective-c makes it more clear
this may make for various race conditions and may necessitate using events which give you earlier notification than mouseup mousedown mouseenter mouseleave mouseover mouseout
stderr is better than stdout for errors for a couple of reasons
uu-parsinglib is definitely worth the time to explore but i would suggest that getting familiar with parsec first is the better course for these reasons
also it seems jackson lib has better performance than other packages such as gson which i haven t tried personally
based on this answer here s how you can simulate a double click using mousedown mouseup mouseup is probably better since click is fired after the user lifts their mouse and not when they first press it
however it is not possible to rotate in the current situation since both children end up in becoming lesser than a parent
struct foo is easier to parse then typedef d foo as the name-lookup is simpler
by promoting the mating of more similar parent the children are less likely to be much worse than the parent because the parent just were compatible
theano is still faster than tensorflow in many respects and supports a wider range of operations
jackson is more suitable if you have a complex deep json tree because gson creates a lot of temporary objects which leads to stop the world gcs
if your primary user base is using ie6 7 or even 8 the page speed is going to be significantly slower than firefox or google-chrome
protected functions maintain a weaker invariant than the public one before and after each call
it s just a supposition but try recreating the form widget onsuccess or even hide the form onsubmit actually onclick is better and show another form to the user
better for you to use bluestacks android-emulator it is much faster than google android-emulator
i am not certain if xcopy or robocopy is the best solution for this but coming from server administration i am more familiar with robocopy
networkx is much easier to deal with and usually performance is good enough but for large brute force algorithms like this igraph will probably be at least an order of magnitude faster
unfortunately i dont understand what you mean by stating ratingbar is smaller than textview
qvector is better than qlist in this case because it s easy to resize it
postgresql is much better suited for data warehousing compared to mysql
edit as gregs points out in the comments you cannot be sure that the private exponent of the key you want to encrypt is smaller than the modulo of the key you want to use to encrypt with
if vim seems too much by the moment i think that kate is better than gedit
if your curl is older than that versioning then you need to upgrade
you can do this either in a push or pull based fashion pull is probably simpler just poll for changes
in this default implementation the jks format is better suited for a single keystore that is to handle both trusted entries and key entries in the same container
mongodb is fun to toy with and i ve built a few apps using it myself for that reason but it s almost never a better choice than postgresql mysql sql server etc
modern operating systems usually get in the way especially if the file is larger than ram you will end up swapping code since the system will treat your already stored on disk data as swappable
i did this very successfully with scipy.ndimage in the floating-point domain way better results than integer image processing like this
type book why do we need anything more than http get put post
i m using facebox and fancybox both smaller than thickbox
svn was supposed to be better than cvs but in some areas that didn t work well
manytoone if you plan to have a tree as a parent can have more than one children
vba is in fact a superset of vb6 not a subset -- vba has more functionality built in than vb6 itself
when you use post data is a alot more safer than get and you can send large no
swift in that case would not be safer but less safe than objective-c
if in-order processing is required a much better design would be to use another message processing library that supports a pull model which i think would fit your scenario much better than rebus push model
that suggests another aspect where a declared properties is more than a pair of accessor methods that is more static type checking although it is undesirable here
so if i modify the nsurl path with a new image because nsdata bytes is already greater than 0 i don t make the additional call to fetch the new image
for example post request are considered more secure than get request as creating a post request is relatively harder than creating a get request
in my testing the slow-down from using tensorflow ranges from about 1.5-3.0 times slower than using theano but its performance will depend on your application
other databases where it was about the same for a transactional database as oracle sql server where were better than mysql postgresql etc
there is a lot of already done frameworks like flask and django that gives you more power easily
btw when you use settimeout or setinterval it is better to pass it an actual function instead of a string with the source code for a function
i was told that postgresql is a better choice than mysql for displaying hierarchical data so i installed postgresql and i m ready to go
when you analyze a program with valgrind memcheck it requires more than twice as much memory than the program would do by itself
in any case vorbis clearly has the most coverage google-chrome has more of the market than safari now opera is about half of safari and obviously firefox is huge and it doesn t really have the strong opposition that theora has
i would recommend strtol which provides better error handling than atoi or sscanf
for multiplication division it s harder ie more instructions
seems like paperclip is more file oriented and carrierwave is more object oriented
the difference is large enough that the constant factor in front of the n log n term in quicksort is lower than the constant factor in front of the n log n term in heapsort which is one reason why quicksort is much faster than heapsort
if puma or unicorn makes this easier or more robust i d love to hear that
in google-chrome it is appearing higher than the original in firefox
xna + monogame --- monogame s performance seems only slightly lower than libgdx can build to most platforms
scheme is intentionally more compact than common lisp and you ll find that you can learn the language very quickly
you might be better off with a profiler like visualvm or chronon
you can write a simple test script to verify this but using test unit rspec or minitest is even better
myisam is slightly faster than innodb and implements the fulltext index which is quite useful for integrating search capabilities
is html better than odf as a templating markup for generating emails letters documentation for rtf pdf
this is of course subjective but i think learning common lisp or standard scheme is generally more useful just for the simple fact that you then will not be limited to one compiler
when browsing news sites with firefox it will display a rss icon in the addressbar if the site has rss feed which makes it easier to discover feed
cypher seems much more clear to me than gremlin and in general it seems that the guys in neo4j are going with cypher
i have done it by using ogg files instead of using mp3 files in my application ogg files consumes less amount of memory
instead of using a uitableview in this instance perhaps you might consider using a uicollectionview - they are built for something like you describe more than a uitableview
there exist processors on which using an integer vector load movdqa to load data that is consumed by a floating-point operation requires more time than using a floating-point load to get data for a floating-point operation and vice-versa
im going to have a second for-loop that makes more arrays and names these arrays as the strings from my previous arrays
other than the fact that get has one character less than post i doubt there is any performance difference
use a singletable strategy and if you thing one of the subclassing has more number of fields and need a separate table then mark that subclassing as a secondarytable using secondarytable annotation and use primarykeyjoin there is an annotation for this to join with superclass on pk column
so i went with the alternative approach of using subclasses for uitabbarcontroller and uinavigationcontroller which feels much cleaner and only slightly more verbose
this means that once you can t scale vertically any more by adding ram disk speed etc to a single server you will have to be careful about how you choose to shard
if you want to get data from simple list thnn foreach loops is good to use but if you want to data from exact position or to store from id than for-loop is better
i faced with the same problem in firefox google-chrome limit is greater as i see
often especially when using mink to test web applications you will find that behat goes faster than your web application can keep up - it will try and click links or perform actions before the page has had chance to load and therefore result in a failing test that would have otherwise passed
i have read many times that one may not use more than one objectoutputstream or objectinputstream
consider umbraco its architecture is definitely better than dotnetnuke s
if you re interesting in reducing the size of the resulting cookies you should consider using ecdsa rather than rsa to produce the signatures - ecdsa signatures are considerably smaller than rsa signatures of an equivalent security factor
it is relatively unlikely that they ve got anything faster than memmove memcpy available
alternatively you could initialize i outside of the for-loop but then it s scoped larger than loops itself
strncpy is not safer than strcpy it just trades one type of bugs with another
that s easier with phpquery or querypath
so intutively it appears that to explain the variance we should go for mixture of more than two poisson distribution
my question is similar the same page in my pc renders fine firefox google-chrome but the same one on a server rendered smaller by firefox google-chrome ok
each iteration in quicksort is a lot simpler than heapsort
using declarative effects is better than thunks for testability but the saga pattern can be implemented on top of imperative or declarative code
lemmatization implies a broader scope of fuzzy word matching that is
that s basically possible but it would take hours as hard disk access is so much slower than accessing ram caches
for example pyqt is already available for python 3 as well as 2 and you can use postgresql a splendid open-source sql database engine much more standard than mysql via py-postgresql
to save both subprocess s stdout and stderr is more complex because you should consume both streams concurrently to avoid a deadlock
i m seeing a strange issue on windows in google-chrome the framerate is almost 2 times lower than in firefox on mac google-chrome and firefox have similar framerates
also you might take the time to compare postgresql and see if there is something about it that meets your needs as well or better than mysql
you may also find that opencover will work better than partcover as it has 32 and 64 bit support as well as supporting .net2 and .net4 - and copes much better with target processes that spin off more processes to do the actual testing
short answer if you can tolerance with any packet loss udp is better otherwise tcp
swift is stricter about runtime type correctness than objective-c so duck typing alone is not enough
xrange will give you an iterable object that won t use memory as you iterate a for-loop is cleaner than a while loops + counter if you ask me
using dedicated methods for getting and setting properties is also more clear in inherited
gevent is inspired by eventlet but features more consistent api
usually division is a lot more expensive than multiplication but a smart compiler will often convert division by a compile-time constant to a multiplication anyway
the plugin defaults to requiring a post request to logout but using the config setting you reference you can make your application more convenient to use but less secure by allowing get or post requests
i d expect gcc g++ is more popular on open-source oses
if the currently installed versioning is older than the updated versioning then you could display a please visit the store to upgrade type message instead of the main app ui
so a question for those who know better is datamapper newer than activerecord
the syntax for nginx configuration is different but more clean than apache
however converting from nsstring to nsdata gives more reliable json data
this allows me to keep all of my models from having to inherited from a base class that has a messages properties and gives me more flexibility
post is better but if you want it to be truly restful you should ensure that the uri uniquely identifies the resource and use put
sublimetext has better performance than atom-editor
aside from obejctive-c convention and best practices nserror is much more robust and flexibly than nsexception and allows the caller to effectively ignore the problem if they want to
note that udp packets bigger than the mtu s at every hope between your hosts will be split by ip
a stateful service is typically harder to develop and scale than stateless services
the code in the setter is far more interesting than the getter should it not take precedence and be defined first
but since division is pretty expensive i think that this is even worse than 2 multiplication
that among other things is why tcp is considered more reliable but slower than udp
my linq query return type would be more adequat with ienumerable int it works when i do this but i was wondering if i could mix in the same array list queries that would have handle strings double or whatsoever.
jemalloc and tcmalloc with some setting changes can be more aggressive than glibc to release memory to the os - but again it depends on the allocation patterns
it is optimized for downloading larger files where the setup overhead is amortized over the size and number of downloads http is very light-weight you can communicate to an http server using telnet much easier than ftp especially before passive ftp and is designed around html -- the concept that in the course of your navigation you will be visiting many different servers and grabbing only a couple of files at a time from each
as hroptatyr mentioned the multiplication is quite fast and it s much faster than division
personally i m using emacs right now which i find easier than vim for searching and navigating the code but everyone has their taste
the strange thing is that when streaming is done via rtsp unicast rtcp generates both sender reports and receiver reports but when streaming is done via rtp multicast only sender reports are generated
tldr in firefox filter is slightly faster in google-chrome that s the opposite
if you want the users to select only one option perhaps a dropdown or radio button list is more suitable rather than checkbox
i know django forms uses post but in this instance i feel that get is more appropriate which means i don t have to use django forms but does that mean i also don t have to validate the data
minitest or rspec is more or less global to your test suite in that all of your specs will be written using that same framework
fltk is really a full-blown gui toolkit though rather small as gui toolkits go that has a built-in glut emulation that at least the last time i played with it seemed considerably better implemented than glut itself
but if the use of mongodb is a must then i suggest that you reconsider using django in the first place because mongodb has a better integration with flask through mongoengine
don t use a for-loop when a while loops is more appropriate
however ico files if stored properly are not significantly larger than png files because since windows vista ico files can store png
if you are using anaconda conda is a better alternative to virtualenv as it manages conda packages which are not limited to just python packages
innodb is harder to tune since it has more knobs but a properly tuned innodb system can often have higher throughput than myisam due to better locking and better i o patterns
division and multiplication have higher precedence than addition so what this is actually doing is
as you can see the keyup events of numpad5 and numpad6 occured earlier than their keydown event
the ansi standard function coalesce is simpler than using nvl and decode which should be obsoleted anyway
turns out using onunload is behaving as documented in firefox but google-chrome is just smarter with it or something still investigating but i ll mark this question as answered
since ireadwrite implements ireadonly ireadwrite is said to be a subclassing of ireadonly although subclassing is more accurately used to describe a class which inherited a base class rather then implements an interface--for the sake of simplicity they are very nearly the same concept
you should see impala as sql on hdfs while hive is more sql on hadoop
in other words serving static files from django will have worse performance than using apache or nginx
also mysql version starting from 5.5 - innodb performs faster than myisam
making the members private and providing getter and setter is no better than making them public in the first place okay it s a bitter better for debugging purposes but conceptually it s the same
i guess rsa is older and dsa is newer
4 some email providers might mark that email as spam however most spam checks are based on spf and dkim checks more than email existence checks
also note that using post is absolutely not more secure than get because the request parameters aren t immediately visible in url
but unless you re using such excellent testing practices and patterns i d be suspicious of abstractions that have a single concrete example -- interfaces with just one implementation no less than abstract-class with just one concrete subclass
this is one of the few cases where a while loops can be clearer and simpler than a for-loop
with really basic calls to the database iqueryable is way quicker but when do i need to think about using an ienumerable in its place
web2py may be young but the mailing list has 2000 messages month which is similar to django and far more than turbogears
due to that swt looks more native than awt swing
example the salt field might only allow a 64 characters while the generated salt might be longer therefore when you save the salt it gets trimmed which ultimately changes the hash password
personally i d say yii might have the edge as it encourages convention more than codeigniter would
if you re doing non-unit testing testng might be a better option than junit
i need help in a vba macro that ll delete files in a directory that contains more than 2 _ and is older than 3 months old however there are some folder sub folder in the directory that must not be touched or modified
some people have said that for reads myisam is faster but recent improvements in innodb have either alleviated or eradicated this difference
am passing the word asdasdasd to the text area with the id source and triggering the click event.after that trying to check whether the result value which is wrapped under the newly created span tag or not.for that am checking whether its parent with the id result_box has more than one children
in its stead you can use isotope - which does filtering a lot easier than masonry
in java-8 permgen was replaced with metaspace which is more flexible in terms of memory usage so you rarely need to tune its size explicitly
and that is for performance reasons assuming that a gethashcode implementation should always be much faster than an equals implementation
for this reason it seemed natural to me to initially load the file into memory and interpret it later at my leisure since reading from ram is supposed to be much faster than from disk
i m working in a spring mvc project and i want to use a template engine i originally choose apache velocity because a slideshare presentation that says it was two times faster than thymeleaf page 41 and since i m working with big tables i need to use a fast template engine does apache velocity supports html5 if not is there other template engine that supports html5 that is not thymeleaf
i don t know how safe could it be and how difficult is for the hacker to determinate the technique i use the thing is that the result has the same length as the hash and is harder to determinate a salt so if for any reason in the history hacker uses a rainbow table and catches a probable result it will be the wrong
curl commands seem to work as do some other post commands from older code but when i log out req.body all i get is
i require a c c++ macro to trace the for-loop iterations in the existing source code and to print some message if loops is running more that 50 iterations
cassini was much better than iis express but doesn t properly support the integrated pipeline
...i suggest doing all of the scripting from within the vbscript file and avoiding the use of .cmd .bat files completely if you can as vbscript is much more readable and powerful though i prefer using the jscript language instead but that s just me
new delete operator are usually invokes constructors destructors and they are a little bit slower than malloc free
i ve noticed however that jruby is more sensitive to memory leaks than mri
to me the path without x86 is also more visually appealing and indicates that it s a modern application - adapted for 64bit operation where necessary
maybe an interface that isolates the properties accessor is better
stick with post on any action that does more than get data avoid xss-issues
frankly if you need to increment decrement a for-loop makes sense if you don t know the bounds and there is no real increment decrement a while loops makes more sense
it s not true unit testing however it does run much faster than mysql or postgresql
i would like to be able to let children have more than one parent
murmurhash has 64 and 128-bit versions so you can experiment between the two and it s faster than md5 largely owing to md5 being a cryptographic hash function whereas murmur doesn t have the added expense complexity of being cryptographically secure i m assuming that you re not concerned about anybody attempting to intentionally generate hash collisions or anything like that
now - your i7 cpu have 4 cores + hyperthreading which results in more threads spawned for processing thus you can get more exceptions because for example 4 things can be processed at the same time when exception occurs
devise is mostly used for authentication but cancan is better to deal with user privileges
nunit has better support for parameterized tests than mstest
however the isolation part of acid sounds more like consistency model in particular the sequential consistency model
prefer map filter and reduce to for loops in general but donÃ¢ t obsess over it sometimes a for-loop is better
while loops aren t normally used to iterate over arrays as for-loop syntax is less verbose and allows the sentinel variable i to fall out of scope while the for-loop syntax does not
other then hiccup and enlive there is the lesser known fleet which is closer to popular ruby php solutions
if you want to have all all shortest paths from all nodes to all other nodes you can just run dijkstra from each node or you can try bellman-ford which is bit faster but a little bit harder to grasp
i d have said that postgresql is more security aware than mysql supporting roles more authentication methods ... but that the database itself has generally a very limited impact on the security of an application
certainly tcp has more overhead than udp
ext4 is a reasonably mature modern filesystems while xfs is older but still quite reliable
you can have more than one get post etc per resources by defining different routes
get is basically for just getting retrieving data a get should not have a body so aside from cookies the only place to pass info is in the url and urls are limited in length get is less secure compared to post because data sent is part of the url
to my knowledge and research so far - javascript s native for-loop is quicker than arrays map for iterating through the arrays
if for some reason you want to use an implementation that does not give you a full parse tree then i would suggest parsing the resulting html using lxml a python wrapper of the c lib or html5lib pure python both of which can return an elementtree object and are much faster especially lxml and more forgiving of invalid html especially html5lib which acts more like real browsers in the real world
i m wondering if there s a way to effectively force a type on instance variables rather their setter and getter that s easier than manually defining them
for something more robust check out highcharts or d3.js or something built on top of d3.js like nvd3.js
i m binding a grid view inside a for-loop which executes more than once.now when loops ends the data in grid view is the data binded at the last run of for-loop i.e all previous binds in the for-loop over overwritten.i dont want this .i want new rows to be inserted at each run of the for-loop ..plz help somebody
iterate over the primes already found which are less than the square-root of p
xquery is more amenable to static analysis than xslt because it lacks the very dynamic template despatch mechanism
i think you ll find that your team will like either trac or redmine more than bugzilla or mantis
for instance quicksort can outperform mergesort although mergesort is provably better than quicksort in the worst case
since you don t need animation and want to stay with loss-less compression you would get somewhat better compression with png instead of gif and png is patent-free
it s also easier to use read.zoo instead of read.csv because merging time-series is a lot easier with xts zoo objects
and postgresql has fewer experienced administrators than the big databases and mysql which i believe contributes to the reputation
i had the idea to switch automatically between get and post for example if cookie set because get is more fast and cache able and post is more save
test code updated so you can see that both it works identically whether using varargs or not will fail if your home directory has less than 5 sub folder
these two are completely different logically speaking and you should choose only one of them to go further with note that swt is more customizable and tries to combine the best from awt and swing while swing is more limited and uses the platform s native widgets
from a hacker s point of view a get forgery is much easier than post forgery at the first you only post a link at the second you need to point to a malware website with hidden iframe and autosubmit forms but both of them fail if tokens are checked
compared to ienumerable and icollection ilist performs much better for large or dynamic lists because it provides an indexer allowing us quick random access
i use tcpreplay to replay it on an interface but the problem is that the number of attempted packets in tcpreplay is different less with number of packets showing in wireshark
in the above example the instance of exprbinopadd is a child of the instance of exprbinopmul although precedence of multiplying is higher than precedence of add which results from the proper consideration of the parentheses
if you want to have content synchronized between all the microservices in your case the header and footer i d suggest zookeeper it s designed for distributed orchestration and has more of a push model - you d update the header in zookeeper and all of your services would receive that update almost instantly
note that at time of writing rouge has lesser language support compared to pygments
overall kohana is more flexible than codeigniter and a great base to build a web application and api on
2 caf seems a little better than wav but not much
note that a quadtree can be queried very quickly and efficiently but updates are a bit more costly that is if your items move a lot across your map this becomes more complicated to do with a good performance
you can see if you look at the bottom and right hand edges of both google-chrome lines up perfectly but firefox seems further in both directions and i cannot work out why either in firebug or google-chrome dev tools
sometimes a class attribute could have more than one getter or setter let s illustrate with a silly short example
as we can see copying manually with memcpy is always slower than realloc because in this scenario malloc is guaranteed to allocate new memory and you re forced to copy the data in every allocation which shows us that realloc is indeed reusing the same address and enlarging the block size in some cases
generally speaking innodb is slower than myisam as innodb is atomic while myisam is not
i did this with for-loop too and while loops was clearly faster than for-loop again
and a wiki for why postgresql is better than mysql
i m trying to get cloudinary direct uploads working on a rails app using carrierwave and accepts_nested_attributes_for to submit one or more images with a post
i like that ini is more for config purposes but with todays interest in json it seems more logical for the config be designed with json in mind
you can use python ncurses it s a part of standard library on nix systems or you can use urwid that is a higher level library for creating console interfaces
performance swing components are generally slower and buggier than awt due to both the fact that they are pure java and to video issues on various platforms
so latest codeigniter 2.0 is better than yii according to this benchmarks
so even if your ram is much smaller than your disk you could assume you can read data that s already in ram 90 of the time or more
post is also more commonly used for partial updates as put generally implies sending a full new representation of the resource
however my tests have shown that on a 64bit system an anycpu prefer 32-bit application which i confirm runs 32-bit can allocate more memory than an x86 one
i want to design a screen which contains some ten identical components each component contains textview and imageview .what s the better way to design it
more than likely prepare failed and is false instead on a pdostatement object
firefox has even fewer as far as i know and opera has none
here the content for the length item is this is a super duper long snippet because we need to see how labels behave when they more than barely extends onto multiple lines. the content for the power cycle item is have you tried turning it off and back on again
i want to set my own time limit rather than use the browser s default i believe google-chrome s is much longer than firefox s
but goto is better than break when you have nested loops like that
now this basically boils down to an observer pattern swing implements this kind of functionality in it s listeners changelistener springs to mind as a possible candidest but propertychangelistener is a more powerful option as it generates events based on the property that has changed
the client post scores and fetches highscore lists from the server and everything seemed to be working perfectly we had been testing it for a month with no problems and the code is really simple with not much more than a put get
since socks proxy is in theory nothing more than a ssl tunnel i thought i could give that property another try
well swing is richer in terms of out-of-the-box components than awt
a post request can include all the information that a get request does plus more which makes it seem like it should be able to do everything get can do plus more
if picasso doesn t satisfy you for any reason you can also try android-query which does much more than picasso it s not only for images but the same rules apply
carrierwave is a newer gem than paperclip and it looks a lot more flexible
finally i haven t done much with animation but i think you re entirely correct - d3.js provides more animation support than protovis especially in terms of animated transitions
thus i think firefox is perhaps more right but other developers at google-chrome think otherwise
add is faster than mul but if you want to multiplying two general values mul is far faster than any loop iterating add operations
while objective-c was good at dynamic type inspection swift is much better of you allow the compiler to do the type checking at compile time
bluff charts get really weird when scaled to more than 800px flot has a very limited api and the tooltips on multi axis dont work plotkit and jquery visualize doesnt have tooltips and i couldnt find any good documentation on gpraphael my best shot was jqplot which was meeting all my needs until i tried to print it on paper they print unaligned
the reflective approach using an existing class like beanutils is less coding but probably an order of magnitude slower than calling getter and setter in a simple way
i mean it came as a surprise to me that drupal is so much faster than wordpress and joomla
tripledes is generally not recommended because aes gives better security more efficiently you might like to see some comparative timings of block ciphers that i took in java to see just how bad it is
it works nicely but from the rich ui perspective it s boring so i was wondering since the draggable image is bigger than the droppable how could i do assuming it s possible to have the droppable container suck the bigger image until if fills its dimensions
in general it is nicer in c to have the caller allocate memory not the callee - hence why strcpy is a nicer function in my opinion than strdup
i am using postgresql before which i tried mysql mysql is even worse
the repeater is still faster than the gridview but the difference shouldn t be big if you code it right
it s hard to guess whether this will really be slower or faster than using strcpy followed by strlen though
i remember it says something like division takes much much more time than addition
i ve only done one experiment with angular material myself and i wasn t experiencing any real performance issues at the time but i did read some people writing about it being slower than plain ionic
note i know the jxtable variant of jtable has some more options for filtering and highlighting rows but i did not find a solution yet.
i have configured tomcat with apache web server in past and never slowness problem before and practically speaking nginx is said to much lighter and faster than apache web server
it seems to work fine in google-chrome but in safari it causes some hover issues on links
git-rebase creates a tidier history while git-merge back and forth may create a complex commit graph in the end
i don t think this capability utf8mb4 exists in mysql 5.1 as evidenced by the query below making this yet another reason why you never run a versioning on a slave that is lower than the versioning on the master and when doing upgrade you always want to upgrade the slave first
0 a do while loops that pre-decrements count --count and compares to zero is better than a for-loop that compares two variables
it s worth pointing out that in general the foreach loops is more expensive memory-wise compared to the for-loop see here for details
on some hardware platforms it might turn out that int types work faster than chars types so the selection of the specific type becomes a speed-vs-memory trade-off but once again in many cases when the range of chars is naturally sufficient it might make more sense to use chars instead of int
they say that implements runnable is more preferrable than extends thread
but if you re dealing with children that have more than one parent then you re dealing with graphs and for that reason mysql it s not suitable for you
probably the most important point is that apache ignite indexing is a lot more sophisticated than hazelcast
however if you re developing a serious application sdl is more likely to be the tool you need to use as glut abstracts more than a real application would normally want to
i understand you are trying to load more events that are currently shown on screens so that they are cached and prev next switching works faster
isnull is faster than coalesce
not totally sure what you want to do but using a while checking if the user input is equal to next and if not trying to cast to int using a try except is a better idea
over the last year it looks like mongoid has been more regularly maintained and updated than mongomapper
in production it is much better to use a more sophisticated server like phusion passenger or unicorn since they have better performance than thin mongrel or webrick
if there exists a np-hard problem that is not in np to the best of my knowledge no such problem has been proved to fall in this category at this moment of time such problem is harder than np-complete problems
in that case the answer is basically both. normally int won t be bigger than a processor register unless that s smaller than 16-bit but it could be smaller a 32-bit compiler running on a 64bit processor
the confusion comes from the fact that javame is so much more than just midp cldc
more importantly in this case i think post is more appropriate than put
i run the ab test several times with same results post is faster but get is lighter
tcp is a slower more reliable protocol than udp is
so simply httpwebrequest is better option then webclient
hi everyone i need help with this i ve already set up nginx + php and it works great faster than apache my problem is how to setup a multiple projects in one ip
for my website i noticed that tooltip delay in firefox was much higher than in google-chrome
cakephp is considered slower than codeigniter but you can tweak it to enhance speed
in this example if target_aspect_ratio is bigger than original_aspect_ratio height is targe_height and width is calculated by target_height original_aspect_ratio
property declarations are nothing more than compiler-generated getter and setter methods
microsoft has the microsoft speech api sapi however if you want simple ivr it is better not to reinvent the wheel and customize an asterisk implementation which i guess falls under the great ivr library for c++ category it s c not c++ but if you know c++ you should be able to understand the c . using asterisknow you may not even need to write any custom code it may do what you want already
i ve even tried to pin archetypes and atcontentypes so that the buildout uses older versions example those used in plone 4.2 by adding the following to my pinnedversions.cfg file which gets called after everything else
thus the for-loop is faster than the foreach-loop if the arrays must
the problem with using tcp is obviously that it is a lot slower than udp
directory.getcurrentdirectory will give you the current folder which is more of a context as you can create a shortcut and pass a completely different folder as your current directory than the one where your exe is present
i personally would use aes for my encryption as it is lighter and more secure than tripledes in fact i think it is the de facto algorithm at the moment
my guess is that scalacheck being initially written as a 1-1 mapping of quickcheck makes it easier for haskellers to jump into scala
i am using icheck plugin to make my checkbox and radio button looks better
again same error but while loops clearly survived more than for-loop
common lisp has a separate namespace for functions which makes operation like this more verbose than with scheme
disk is 100x slower than ram
phusion passenger is the de facto apache mod and yes it s better than webrick which is really only good for tiny sites or testing
udp scales better than tcp because of reduced states that need to be maintained in the operating system
secondly the current version of pypy consumes much more memory than cpython in a rather large set of cases
i could just throw away customsetup and put all the custom code after super but having that abstract method makes clearer what you re supposed to put there
the thing that makes sinon a better choice than jasmine spies is that it is capable of programming spies expectations withargs ... .called.
the operating system will give your program all the resources it needs the reason your process is not consuming all the cpu is probably because it s waiting for the io sub system more than the processors
http streaming servers will in most cases use tcp as their network transport rtsp servers usually offer rtp over udp which is more suited to multimedia streaming where some errors packet loss can be tolerated with the benefit of lower latency and less network overheads
drawimage seems to be much faster than putimagedata
maybe it is but it is much easier than launchd agent in other session from daemons when implemented right with different corner cases support
rint is measurably faster than floor or ceil
see also why malloc + memset is slower than calloc
try painting via a qimage -- the qpainter textantialiasing is more likely to be honoured that way
and last if you know the number of loops it is much easier and better to read when you use a for-loop instead of a while loops
if i don t have a grammar i ll use parsec it is more flexible powerful than happy and its more fun to work in haskell than generate code with happy and alex
if i enable this then any setup is ran every time it will be asking for upgrade either it is on lower versioning over higher versioning or higher versioning over lower versioning
since i have seen many reports of the macports package manager being less reliable than the fink package manager i would suggest installing fink and then simply doing
fasttext is not better than word2vec as for as semantic similarity is concerned
in simple words we can say performance of repeater is far better than gridview
any db tech is fine with me as long it does not need lots of ram and uses less disk
use the floatvalue nsstring method or a nsscanner which is more powerful and flexible
now i want to work on this read-only also i have better experience with bazaar than svn so i want to change this repository from svn to a bazaar repository for working locally how can i do that and one additional thing does svn support local repositories like bazaar
average asymptotic order of quicksort is o nlogn and it s usually more efficient than heapsort due to smaller constants tighter loops
in ios 5.0 and later you can use clgeocoder of core location framework as for ios lower than 5.0 mkreversegeocoder of map kit framework
post is more secure than get this is just a quick example
also ie and firefox seems to work better than google-chrome
i am setting the policy to constrained-resize to get rid of the extra column based on this so post tableview has more columns than specified
according to the postgresql which i gather greenplum is based on documentation for sequence manipulation functions it should return the value most recently returned by nextval in the current session.
vim already comes with a file explorer that does a lot more than nerdtree called netrw
cron jobs works well with wordpress even if a server cron is better
getter and setter gives you more flexibility in general than properties
i think using post is more elegant and has more options for further development than passing them via get
nunit is more widespread mbunit has the most features but mstest has more manpower behind it
you will notice that ie11 edge takes 10+ seconds whereas google-chrome firefox takes less than a second
reason why double can t be declared volatile it s 64bit which makes it more than the word size on x86 which prevents it from being declared volatile in the cli if i remember correctly
i have studied the x86 assembly and architecture and it appears to be a lot more complicated than mips
i ve heard it suggested that i use nginx as a reverse proxy in front of apache and node.js is that a better solution than just nginx
the comaddin base class makes it a bit easier to create an office add-in and reduce infrastructure code to be more familar with vsto - thats the whole idea
i d send an action from the child to the parent it s always easier to communicate upstream than it is downstream due to the fact that parent don t always have children
post is also more secure than get because you aren t sticking
a pattern i also use is to make the nstableview slightly shorter than the nssplitview and have buttons at the bottom add delete etc
you should always use the timeit module for time trials it is far more accurate than cprofile here
make the form get not post because the request is not changing anything on the server so get verb is more appropriate and also the get verb will pass all the form values as a query string parameters so you ll get the desired effect
to get more help with that post information about your table structures and content
what i am hoping to get from this post is a better way to do this or hopefully someone can tell me why is happening i know that the latter might be hard since it can be a bunch of reasons
the most straight-forward c implementation is 100 times faster than cpython pypy is 10-30 times faster and passes the challenge
even if you give the inputs a attribute firefox renders them wider than google-chrome
pcap.net uses c++ cli to wrap winpcap which is considered more efficient than pinvoke
the markermanager has a more involved setup than the markerclusterer but it does allow for more customization of what and where it displays
tcp is but udp is faster
basically you are implementing a view container much simpler than uinavigationcontroller and uitabbarcontroller
on top of that the i2c bus is slower than spi because there are control data exchanged
using ng-hide and ng-show is better then doing it manually maybe something like this for the directive template
if you want to use sql i strongly reccommend postgresql it seems to deal with large databases and frequent writes a lot better than mysql
bigger better than wordpress you re typically looking at joomla or drupal there are others these are just the most common ones
in my opinion a for-loop is usually better for doing something a specific number of times and if you re just iterating over every item in an arrays foreach is usually more straightforward
my c s-function is faster than my embedded matlab function block in matlab environment but when i use it in rt-lab the embedded is faster
using capybara instead of rspec is a better solution for request intergration tests
java object serializable deserialization is not faster than xml writing and parsing in general
it may not be the most elegant method but when you just need to convert something ad-hoc thinking of it as comparison and subtraction may be easier than division
numpy min max is much faster than the build in functions but only for large arrays below lets say 50 the buildins are faster
issue you re experiencing with a video working in landscape but not portrait sounds more like an issue with the email client than your code
is there any reason mousedown should be inherently faster better than mouseup
note that if you convert your png files to gif images they are likely to look uglier as gif files can only have 256 colors and do not support alpha-transparency
in other words if a subclassing is more accessible than its superclass then the access modifier of the superclass loses effect
finally i also made a benchmark test which shows that substr operation is slightly better than sapply grepl and significantly better than vectorised grepl alone
i am asked to apply to all the actions of one mvc project for security reason says post is more secure than get which i disagree with
there are various object systems you can load as libraries when you want to do oop but integration with existing code heavily depends on the scheme dialect and its surrounding culture chicken scheme seems to be more object-oriented than racket for instance
to be able to calculate very big numbers bigger than 64bit 128bit
so for creating a friendship post method suits better than get
google-chrome seems to allow this i do not know why but firefox is somewhat stricter
a while loops makes more sense to me than your use of a for-loop
jboss 6.4 had no problems with that but yes wildfly is more strict looks like
note the use of std getline is safer and more convenient than std istream getline
unfortunately the directory also is a git repository and has a .git folder in it which is much bigger than the directory itself
this is a huge performance boost look like myisam is much more quicker for fulltext in mysql than innodb
is there anything more i should do more than changing post to get
my main and pretty noob question is it ok from an mvp perspective to have a presenter that communicates with more than one interactor or should just be one interactor per presenter
i have a comment on your for-loop q is never considered in the stopping condition therefore putting it within loops is more logical in my opinion
this is because the swift dictionary is more strongly typed than the objective-c nsdictionary
since emacs is much older than the extensible vim as opposed to the relatively non-extensible vi it has a much larger collection of extension modes covering almost any purpose you can imagine
first its not a bad idea to use node.js to satisfy your requirement the uniqueness of node and added advantage compared to conventional technologies like apache-php is clearly explained in this following video why node.js is better .the notion of node being just used for advanced or complex applications is wrong you can use node for building applications which are very simple to anything of huge proportion.it would be a not so comfortable task for a node beginner to code without using any frameworks but by using this web application framework called express you need not code from scratch and its very easy to setup html pages using its simplified html templating language called jade and route requests also you can even use your html pages if you are not willing to use jade for rendering the views of your application .here are the series of tutorials which would help you tutorials on beginning with node.js basics of expressjs
the reason is that the modulo is slower than subtraction
it has better translation engine than git-svn svn2git that preserves more svn concepts like ignores eols etc
3 a first of all if you haven t done yet change the storage engine to innodb which has row level locking and in newer versions of mysql has more optimization than myisam has
this question is similar in nature to whether ant is better than maven or c# better than java
keith pointed out that haskell has a more powerful type system but it can also be said that ocaml has a more powerful module system than haskell
imperative is the traditional step by step recipe approach while declarative is more this is what i want now you work out how to do it
if you re using older versioning it is better to upgrade and avail benefits of c++11 features as much as possible
some background i m learning haskell now having earlier worked with scheme and cl and a little foray into clojure
use either bcrypt on its own or pbkdf2 in combination with your sha-512 although sha-1 hmac is more than enough
1 it seems loading the sound file through nsdata rather than nsurl works faster later in playing
if you compute modulo a power of two using bitwise and is simpler and generally faster than performing division
basically it seems like cmmotionmanager is much larger and slower than uiaccelerometer is
so i wonder the benchmark is also influenced by the installed extensions or google-chrome is really so much higher than firefox in performance
now if you aren t generating your html server-side and are instead writing it by hand you can make your life just a dash easier with a client-side transformation like this
i think i generally agree with your summary - it makes sense that postandasyncreply is slower than post so if the caller doesn t need to get a notification from the agent when the operation such as putting value into the queue completes it should definitely expose a way to do that using just post
sproutcore has a better data store api than the one cappuccino has
mergesort is more difficult to implement in-place but the out-of-place version is very cache-friendly - i suspect real-world implementations accept the o n space overhead - ram is cheap but memory bandwidth is a major bottleneck so trading memory for cache-efficiency and speed is often a good deal
when send a udp datagram larger than the mtu size only the last fragment of the udp datagram is putted out to the destination
i m not totally sure what you are asking malloc minus free is less than the actual usage because of the memory fragmentation if you really need that number you have to use custom allocators which are tiny wrappers around existing ones everywhere in your code which is going to be painful
on google-chrome it s significantly faster to do this using 1 0 but on firefox it s slightly faster to do this using bool
as already pointed out in other answers memmove is more sophisticated than memcpy such that it accounts for memory overlaps
i would not test that compressing a particular input produces a particular output because that might break if you upgrade the compression library to a versioning that does a better job of compressing
if you are worried about memory then do look into scikit-learn since equivalent models can use significantly less memory than nltk
from a practice standpoint - excluding accessibility - modal windows provide an alternative that are less startling as say dialog boxes and feel less intrusive than pop-up windows
calloc does the same thing as malloc but initializes all bytes to zero -- useful when you want to insure all memory is initialized and only slightly slower than malloc
i would need a scalable database so probably postgresql would be better than mysql
in minitest i could add this check for each class with 1 line include diameterizableinterfacetest. in rspec it takes 4 more lines
i looking to use a suite of nlp tools for a personal project and i was wondering whether stanford s stanford-nlp is easier to use or opennlp
it is a great tool if you want to use git as frontend for an existing svn server but for one-time conversions you should not use git-svn but the right svn2git which is much more suited for this use-case
i found the production of wmv much better and easier than flv because all windows flv encoders i tried are not really good and stable whereas pretty much every tool can natively output wmv
we sort of settled on it but later found codelite and liked it better than codeblocks
i ve read that carrierwave is much faster without using fog
it uses lxml underneath and is much faster than beautifulsoup
i haven t tried any of these in a jsf 2 application but i would recommend using the primefaces one at least the documentation is better than richfaces
if you want a different look than what is provided by the uisegmentedcontrol using the uitabbarcontroller is the better option
memcpy is more efficient than memmove. in general use memmove only if you have to
keeping your business logic in ejb jar will pay off when you ll need more than one war in your ear different security realms etc.
since you noted thoughts on other browsers would be helpful opera s kiosk mode seems more powerful than google-chrome s

the rss feed-splitter component of mule returns only a single item even if the feed has more than one items if the pubdate for all the items is same
the internal view hierarchy of uialertview is much more complicated than it appears and starting from ios 7 it is not even added to any uiwindow so it s no big surprise that it doesn t participate to the responder chain as you expect
when i test the app with 2gb of allocated memory instead of 12gb i saw that the performance of the cpu when using ram is better than when using ram disk when i just write data into my db 15 vs 17 cpu usage
when all you want to do is jam a bunch of shapefiles together or convert a large series of rasters to a common projection gdal ogr is faster to startup and run as it doesn t need to load the whole arcobjects com library to access one or two functions
why don t you do a simple test that tries to read and display an image in a jlabel first since using a jtable is more complicated than using a jlabel
mef seemed a bit easier than prism and i started to do a hello world mef app with this tutorial
my observation is that you get the webpage title using webchromeclient in lesser time than using webviewclient
you d still have to filtering to get a range though it ought to be faster than sorting at least
but if some of the 14 parameters are optional it becomes a bit hard to read then i think either the use of separate getter setter is more readable or a paramater object mimicking named parameters
i think you can best use the for-loop this gives you a little bit more control over loops
so just change your versioning to something else which must be greater than the upgrade versioning so that again first condition will be false and system will not check further and will connect without using tls
so firefox is better than google-chrome - but both suck in that regard
note that you should check if index is within arrays bounds in such cases and that system.arraycopy is more efficient and arguably simpler than a for-loop for copying arrays
it works great in google-chrome and safari haven t tested ie but i m sure it s somehow worse than firefox
apparently almost completely compatible lodash runs quicker apparently but underscore.js has better doco imho
fixing bugs in swt is much harder than in swing most classes in swt are final or contain hostile checks in the constructor to make sure no one extends them the package is signed so you can t simply replace classes and so far i tried several times to compile swt from sources - and failed
you could also use apache cargo which is more general than the tomcat maven plugin
i have taken on someones project that has automation using task scheduler while i am more familiar with cron jobs
it is a structure similar to but twice as space-efficient as the dawg that is more efficient than the trie which only compresses prefixes
they use iframes in firefox which seems better but in google-chrome they do this by putting manually defined span and font tags
however a sdp object local description by firefox does not contain datachannel at all and moreover the sdp is much shorter than google-chrome and less information bundled
memcpy is still a little bit slower than memmove
using for-loop is much simpler if you use condition as limit for breaking loops
this gives me but when i loop through it i get duplicated parent when this parent has more than one children
i am using the compareto method in java to try and check if a certain date is greater than or equals than 24 hours after another date
if your .so are statically linked to c++ runtimes - you should free objects in the same module where they were allocated since new delete is something more than malloc free and need some extra info to work properly
is it possible however to implement common lisp s macro system in scheme which is more powerful than syntax-rules using syntax-case
when i demux an mp4 with ffmpeg the provided sps at the beginning of the raw h.264 stream is richer than mine
i ve found that the font-size in firefox is a bit larger than in google-chrome
i can order by id but this doesn t feel reliable as even though i know in this case that children will have a higher id than their parent i can t guarantee this will always be the case in every circumstance i want to use a cte
other solution is to upgrade websphere with newer libraries as per ibm websphere upgrade service instructions
you cannot use mocks in conjunction with roboguice it s better to let robolectric provide the context you need here
ok i think i may have fixed my problem i changed the logic and so i m now using a for-loop i could have still used a while-loop but i think a for-loop is better
why is using spatial index and stdistance slower then the more complicated query with sin cos and acos
rest assured though that strcmp is better equipped in the general case for string comparisons than memcmp is
reloading pages data or program code from disk which is much slower does not usually happen very often as long as the program is actually running and as long as the machine is not desperately low on ram
you need to just change the siftdown function so that the parent is always the smaller than the children
quicksort has better locality of reference than mergesort which means that the accesses performed in quicksort are usually faster than the corresponding accesses in mergesort
there are some rough edges in terms of the api but it s generally much better than java.util.date and java.util.calendar
an interpreted-language surely makes it easier but this is still entirely possible with compiled-language like c
the underlying reason for this and various other avx limitations is that architecturally avx is little more than two sse execution units side by side - you will notice that virtually no avx instructions operate horizontally across the boundary between the two 128 bit halves of a vector which is particularly annoying in the case of vpalignr
i hacked together an alternative approach that achieved a much higher fps 60 or more under both google-chrome and firefox
i found that numpy s 2d fft was significantly faster than scipy s but fftw was faster than both using the pyfftw bindings
depending on the rest of your code you might be better off with getter and setter
division is always much more expensive than multiplication
it iterates through the most recent folder returned by the dir command each returned on one line and after it encounters the 4th it stops if there are more than 4 folder
the cpu is indeed slower on sparc 1.2ghz and as answered by one of the sun s engineers t2 is usualy 3 times slower for single-threaded application than modern intel processors
no cross-database queries if you need something like that mapping mysql databases to postgresql schemas is probably easier
snprintf but in c++ std ostringstream is far better
note that diffseconds can cause an overflow when the difference becomes larger than int32.maxvalue error the datediff function resulted in an overflow
but in my location jboss is more popular than glassfish so i have a idea
memcache data lives in memory and isn t persistent so is for more transient data
4 is nvidia cuda technology is easier more flexible than ati brook+ language
i set ecpm for inmobi and mobfox higher than for admob
this ibm technote has more details on the signals part what is a signal and why does this matter for websphere application server

virtualbox is slower than vmware
hence post is more secure than get
on an unencrypted connection post is no more secure than get
are there any cases where awt is more useful advised to use than swing or vice-versa
rickshaw is a graph library focused on time series whereas d3.js is more of a framework so it gives you much more functionality
an efficiently configured mysql is better than a badly configured postgresql and vice-versa
generally a pop-up is a better option for a login dialog and a pop-up would allow you to easily navigate to the main page
after looking into the issue with the inspection tools of both browsers it seems that firefox is making the #main_nav_bar ul 10px wider than google-chrome
i tried a few ides on ubuntu and it just didn t seem right - gedit is lightweight and i actually enjoy using it more than textmate on os x
carbon emacs is closer to the unix emacs experience whereas the aquamacs people have put considerable effort into os x integration
c++ s stl is getting better and better yet it s not nearly as huge as boost and is not intended to
i used atoi to convert the string to int but for a more robust solution it s better to use strtol but for your example atoi is more than enough
using getter and setter gives you more control over the validity of your objects giving you the option of testing values that are set to ensure that they are reasonable etc
everything is better than a checkbox or a button with autopostback set to true nowadays in year 2011 2012 soon
qtoolbutton is much more complex under the hood than qpushbutton
the scenario you described is perfectly fit into an aggregation or multi-module project from my own experience compare with ant maven provides a more efficient reasonable and native way for managing multi-module project with inter-module dependencies
when i try to access it with a for-loop where its index is less than the arrays length i get the following error message typeerror function object is unsubscriptable
from my personal use i experienced about 5 - 10 times less disk usage due to tokudb s compression and it s much much faster than myisam or innodb
i am less familiar with postgresql than mysql but
works on some rubies better than others jruby and rubinius are recommended efficiency on mri is decreased due to gvl global vm lock
in addition to that the crossing off may be less work than a division don t know about python it is for c arrays
in ie java-script load slower than firefox safari and google-chrome
1 if i copy more than one folder to the watched directory one of them will get handled none of the others will get processed
for me graphicsmagick is performing far better than imagemagick
there is also postgresql its a bit more robust than mysql and is free just the same
in ejb3 there is no such thing as stateless is better than stateful session beans
child components have weaker connection with its parent than subcomponents it was expected that parent has no idea how many children it can have which is appropriate for most controls
i have found that delivering your application with already scaled images having ldpi mdpi hdpi is the better approach
i have the jersey resource classes bundled within a larger war as jar file which is now residing underneath web-inf lib folder on websphere application server
we have now turned our multiplication into an addition which is much easier to do
how you handle things server-side is far more critical than client-side validation which can and will be ignored by malicious users
due to the work flow change our qa members would like to have finer control over the push pull operation on the release server they d like to allow only specified user s with user credential s to access to specified repo s
mri has a gil so why is it faster than jruby in handling requests
i had worked on jboss for a year and on weblogic for more than a year now my experience with the web logic is good compared to jboss weblogic is more stable and robust it can handle more than 3000 concurrent requests without throwing a single exception where jboss failed to do so and admin console for the weblogic is excellent but i think weblogic is more complex then jboss
since json can store arrays i can create quite complex config with it and it parses faster than ini files
if you are on linux eg ubuntu you may try gedit for ease of use with some plug-ins but to handle very large files you re better off with vim
i m not sure httpmodule is still better then httphandler
if your in to python there is nltk as already mentioned by it s author but there is also scikit-learn which provides much more than just clustering
but if the action is aimed to handle crud request post or put it s more convenient way to use forms
now you can get all those same features with flask if you re prepared to do some integration work but the argument can just as easily be made that django is better for beginners precisely because it does come with all those things built-in
the time profiling instrumentation is more efficient at gathering data
actually on intel sandybridge-family at least mul imul 64bit 64bit 128bit is faster than imul mul 32bit 32bit 64bit
using the ajax method really shouldn t take much more than using post get
tcp ip is supposed to be more reliable than udp ip see this comparison
hdfs high availabilty is only available when you have more than one namenode configured
google-chrome also is susceptible to this same issue although it does a significantly better job than safari at getting the realtime api re-connected
ravendb more than couchdb but that s neither here nor there
in enhanced er modelling subclassing inheriting from more than 1 superclass is called multiple inherited
in fact given that google rejected pointer event on the ground of speed which ie solved by gpu acceleration it can be said that google-chrome and webkit in general - safari is even slower is lagging behind on this front and the only way to help is contributing code to chromium webkit
the switchover to nginx really had little to do with the rewrite rule and more to do with getting away from apache 2.2 default upstream version for centos however with nginx rewrite rules are more straight forward than apache s imo
if your watch doesn t have usb support moto 360 and other induction only charging you need to enable bluetooth debugging slower than through usb though
a webclient is much easier than a webrequest
but keep in mind that in many cases being stateful or not stateless is no problem and not all stateless applications are by definition better than stateful ones
the fact that the subclassing is more selective only actually writes about what it writes is new functionality especially in light of the fact that the superclass promises nothing
and check against a number versioning in your code if the database versioning number is less than your code versioning number call a method for to do the upgrade
please note that you can use erlang or elixir which is much easier
if multiplication is slower than addition instead of doing
lot s of free stuff available look for anything implementing amqp for example and not limited to apache s attempt - activemq zeromq as listed above rabbitmq which is more complete than zero and even red hat are in the game with red hat messaging
pypy is faster than cpython s sum intrinsic because it can figure out that all the elements of the array are numeric and slice out a bunch of per-element overhead
edit basile starynkevitch mentions that strtod is better than atof for this job as it gives the ending character
this is called a strength reduction optimization because division is stronger slower more expensive than subtraction
incidentally the scrolling on the windows version of safari is fine albeit a little slower than ie opera and firefox
finally even if somehow you could manage myisam to perform better than innodb that doesn t mean innodb is inadecuate at all
if a function is static thus not exported anyway and only called once within your code and you never use a pointer to the function chances are good that gcc will decide to inline it automatically as it will have no negative impact the binary won t get bigger by inlining it only once
but thn i get presented with a setup maven plugin connectors dialog and the pom.xml file shows more errors
speed is usually faster than gdi and slower than directx and depends greatly on how you do things seen something to work 60 times faster after rewriting in a sensible way
the children still do not need to know about the parent and the parent gets a more direct event as opposed to a signal connection
jtextpane is more high level as jeditorpane strange naming
if you need to add more than one folder for searching see the msdn for documenation on adddlldirectory for the steps required to allow for multiple search directory
and ram access is much more fast than disk access
so glfw is just a library for creating windows in a better way than lwjgl did before
a uiview is no more than a fancy wrapper for a calayer Ã¢ bringing uiresponder events animation conveniences among many other things
ubuntu is the more user-friendly of the two i think ubuntu is actually one of the most newbie-friendly linux distros so if you are new to linux ubuntu is the way to go
the way i like to see more than one for-loop in list comprehension is like the nested loops
i ve found some comments and references that seem to indicate that setting the height greater than the width will cause the browser to change the orientation automatically but in my testing that only works in opera used to work in opera but not anymore
post has a higher overhead marginally if we re honest but it all adds up but it doesn t become part of the url so can t be seen by say a casual observer over the user s shoulder - whereas get can
notice that a children choice solution can have more than one parent and that choice can be either an array or one element.
based on akrun data.table idea i translated the data.table code to dplyr tidyr is easier for me to read that s all
is there any cpan module that would make this easier preferably with automatic getter setter generation
wsimport is better don t use wsdl2java
unicorn is supposed to be faster than webrick
swt community is smaller and it doesn t provide that many tools as swing does
my question is is fast implementation of pow x 0.5f faster than fast sqrt x
processing rss feed is more comfortable
in terms of performance rtp udp streaming is far better but there is no guarantee that it will get transported through the internet via routers nat boxes proxies etc
if you have dynamic element sizes you can t write out child pointers in preorder so postorder traversal is more appropriate
if your versioning is older than that it won t work and you ll need to upgrade
safari is more funny than google-chrome i can easily make google-chrome cache my page but safari does not
that s because removeclass is executed faster than fadein method you can remove the class when animation is complete
here s the solution for post variables as well which is probably trickier for more users than the get solution
1 okay so it is technically possible to allocate it as one big blob and then wire up the 20-element array to point into the desired offsets into the blob.Ã¢ Ã¢ this convolutes free ing though and usually isn t necessaryÃ¢ for most use-cases the performance gains would be negligible and you d still need to malloc a separate array of pointers that address into the 2d blob .Ã¢ Ã¢ you typically only see 2d-blob allocation when data is massively 2d Ã¢ such as image data Ã¢ and access syntax is eschewed in favor of syntax because it s no less efficient than what the compiler would do and doesn t require more than one malloc free pair per blob of data
it requests memory from the os kernel but the request is not satisfied until the memory is written to with memset . this allows for greater efficiency in the system s memory management but it can result in misleading malloc behaviour
since i agree using getter setter is better way
as you know apc is much more faster than memcached if we re fetching keys from a single server
opencover is newer and is also on github opencover on github it has 64 and 32 bit support and overcomes some of the limitations that partcover has memory and results delivery
you might want look at robocopy as it has many more options than xcopy
udp packets smaller than the mtu will not be fragmented but the mtu depends on more factors such as ip options and vlan headers so it may not be greater than 1500
that fits better with both pandas and patsy s way of representing things
quicksort consistently has less recursive calls than mergesort
put each token +- of final command string in a list maybe a binary tree works and sort that list to tell the calculator that division and multiplication has the highest priority in the mean time addition and subtraction has lower priority
jython is more unpredictableÃ¢ sometimes almost as fast as pypy sometimes much slower than cpython
so i think before following the convention of getter and setter it is more important to follow the convention of variable naming
for example maxwage and minwage are more meaningful than max and min
there are tonnes of posts blogs on this so just google mongodb working set but as you know access from ram rather paging to disk is quicker
oddly enough new array size is almost 2x faster than in google-chrome and about the same in firefox and ie measured by creating and filling an array
this server side product was openfire but you could use ejabberd for even better performance - openfire is easier to set up and maintain though
using a separate icomparaer comparator approach is a more generic form of using a sortkey field with the additional ordering mixed into the comparator because such a field could be used by such a icomparer implementation
getting your project migrated to vb.net is certainly easier when you keep the old vb6 controls
see what happens when tcp udp server is publishing faster than client is consuming
4.c i am working on aix so i only have sh and ksh no bash therefore i cannot use the array tools provided by the latter that s why i thought of awk that and the fact that i think awk is probably stronger though i might be probably
safari still uses the older version while google-chrome uses a more current one
the result is that using d3.js can feel a little lower-level - you have more control but you have to be pretty familiar with svg syntax to do some of the things protovis does much more easily
i also have .js files being redirected to javascript engines as well for main.js in google-chrome it tries main.v8.js in safari main.nitro.js in firefox main.gecko.js
buf1 buf2 and buf3 is small enough to located in l1 cache and l2 cache l2 cache 1mb .both of sse and avx is band width limited but with the datalen increase why do the avx need more time than sse
maybe google-chrome is working faster than firefox try adding a wait with expected conditions
bazaar is more discoverable if you are given the tool wo any documentation any semi-competent user will be able to use bazaar that s not so true with git
you can also use jersey-client it is gae compatible and much easier than httpclient
if the md5 from your select query results in a hash that is larger than the last record in your table you might get no records from the query
i have a problem with my code i already make a code with mouseover but it was very slow to display per row my picture edit so i read that mouseenter is faster i hope because i have normaly 2000 row
the direction of evaluation does not affect the results of expressions that include more than one multiplication addition + or binary-bitwise | operator at the same level.
i am specifically trying to connect it via usb serial as the device needs to be mounted unattended and bluetooth connection seems less reliable plus extra cost for bluetooth capabilities on the device so potentially more cost effective over usb serial
multiplication is not more difficult than repeated addition
also i find that web inspector in safari google-chrome is better
as for apache vs nginx in regards to your django app it seems that mod_python is indeed faster than nginx lighty + fastcgi but that s no surprise because cgi regardless of any speed ups is still slow
why height in google-chrome is bigger than firefox of input
in my experience google-chrome has better javascript performance than firefox
but for the task you describe you d probably be better off with docx4j with which i m involved or apache-poi - especially if you are trying to do this server-side or in an environment where the client pc environment is unknown
if we express combinations of states in an nfa as states themselves we ve got a dfa with a lot more states than the nfa but which does the same thing
i think your code has no problem except that angular has deprecated legacy promise methods success and error of http after version 1.4.4 you should use standard then method instead if your ionic depends on higher angular version
tunnel udp packets is somewhat more difficult
here is what it would look like with testng it s a little more contrived with junit since you can t pass parameters directly to test functions
serializable deserialization becomes a bigger bottleneck when you scale out to a session server or use sql server to manage session state
i know js and i ve maked extension for google-chrome before but i think making for firefox is alittle harder
datediff becomes more difficult to use as you have more dateparts in your difference in your case looks like minutes and seconds
the requests library can handle post put delete and all other http methods and is significantly less scary than urllib httplib and their variants
when i launch it with firefox or internet explorer the box gets immediately to a huge distance from the margin much bigger than the width of the screen and now i noticed that if i run it with stackoverflow s snippet function the box does not move
give it a try works perfect for me what it is doing query get the all the post with a left jon with comments table so when a post has comment them n it also has the comment_date if no comments posted on the post then in result set it will be null so i have merged the comment_date with post_date so which post has the greater date for comment_date or post_date it will first and so on
in any case raf will enable the drawing to be synced to the monitor so in any case it will be a better choice than setinterval settimeout in cases such as these
depending on how your application is structured this means you may want to have your own base class implementing iresource which creates your custom not found resource for all of its subclassing or better make a wrapper since composition is better than inherited
2-3 times faster than mergesort or heapsort
it combines efficiency of a trie trie can be seen as a special case of dawg but is much more space efficient
- you can also consider using webm which is a free alternative to h.264 and has better support on some platforms than fragmented mp4
i am starting to understand that even though emacs is more powerful than vim vim is at least 10 times easier to use less keystrokes and requires way less modifications
the ipb which has less queries runs slower than mybb with more queries
but still labwindows cvi is more targeted for a test environments where e.g temperature controller measurement equipment needs to be controlled
i want to type tex equations in onenote send them to mathtype which converts it to mathml and has a more feature-rich editor and send them back afterwards
clang llvm has much better separation between the parser and the other parts of the compiler chain
note strncmp is safer than strcmp
quadtree is better for big open spaces and octree is better for in-door spaces with many levels
but goto is rarely used in modern coding it is not likely to perform any better than a do-while loop after compiler optimizations are applied and it has limitations on how it can be used
also this way mvp pattern becomes more testable as you can mock the view with fake object and test your presenter in unit tests
viewport manipulation is easier with lattice than ggplot2 that s why i choose a bwplot
keyup is more preferable than keydown because keydown may occur multiple times if user keeps it pressed
the get is usually faster because it has no encapsulation sends data via url usually with a 255 character limit as post exists encapsulation by being sent by the body of the http request
using checkbox to check uncheck is better than radio button
is sqlcmd always that much faster than ssms
the autojit compiler realizes you re multiplying by all 0s and removes the matrix multiplication completely and simply returns a matrix of all 0s in the 1s it skips the actual multiplication part and just does the summation part of a matrix multiplication which is slightly slower than just returning all 0s finally the final one actually forces the compiler to have to do a matrix multiplication since it can t assume the answer
isnull is marginally faster than coalesce
it s better than having getter and setter to do the job
but for 32-bit and 64-bit microprocessors data alignment and bulk data access is key int accesses are frequently much faster than chars accesses and long long 64 bit may be faster still for some systems
printwriter is more effective than filewriter and filewriter is needed anyhow but this will work also if you want to do multiples people then just for-loop it and dont forget to close
even when it s bigger than my jscrollpane s jviewport the knobs will not appear on the scroll bars and i cannot scroll down on the canvas
hadley wickham released a fundamentally new version of dplyr with a new underbelly called rlang which provides a more consistent framework for non-standard evaluation
but break is no better or worse than goto
warning language-lawyering follows. there might be a loophole that allows for extended int types with a wider range than _bool but a narrower range than chars
what is the true rationale behind all the private and protected stuff when we can just make our life as a programmer easier by using public for everything
multicore refers to a computer or processors that has more than one logical cpu core and that can execute multiple instructions at the same time.
and the whole purpose of maglev is to have a ruby implementation which can deal with heaps that are orders of magnitude larger than ram by storing them in a distributed cluster on disk
sha is better hash than md5
if you don t have someone around to help with jqgrid you are better off with datatables
edit as pointed out in the comment lodash is likely to be a better solution than underscore.js
better use keyup event name as in my example because keydown requires one more click for the last symbol to be updated
but consider this it s literally impossible to do any better than interlocked operations for cross-process communication with atomic updates and no locks are held
anyways mysql is bad and on longterm especially if you are enough good for java i suggest you to use some better db with postgresql you were really satisfied i think
i understand that the background-color one doesn t require an http request and that the background-image takes more processing
i have too problem with text in the firefox is bigger maybe bolder as in google-chrome .
this generally uses a hash algorithm that is much faster than md5
you would be able to circumvent this by first running mvn clean install on magnicompcommon s pom.xml then on model pom.xml but this is much easier done by invoking maven directly on the root pom.xml
i understand that children cannot have a higher opacity than their parent but is there a possible workaround for this
for your view to expect an ienumerable you need to change your view declaration to be also if you really need to perform a find use iqueryable first them return the result as ienumerable since the payload on ienumerable is smaller than iqueryable
check out configobj its the slickest method i ve found so far and definitely more flexible than configparser
while neither the declarative nor imperative approach is really better than the other both have their merits
if you need spatial data capabilities postgis with postgresql is better than mysql
is postgresql better than mysql for such purpose
ie s vml is slower than other browser s svg
so decide what you want to use direct3d is significaly faster than gdi
first entity-relationship modeling is more than just an erd
and i do as much work as possible on our linux centos 5 system simply because the tools on it are still newer than anything i can find readily packaged for aix solaris is somewhat better
i see that the microcontroller used in commercial devices are much cheaper than the avr or pic
a treemap costs a lot more than a linkedhashmap and adds nothing to your project if you only need to keep original insertion order
this is still slower than for-loop mostly due to intermediate arrays creation but much faster than stream version
while widget logic can help you do much more than hide or show a widget to logged in logged out users
after testing it seems that myisam is faster than innodb when using when there is no where clause
not only is it more expensive in terms of developer costs designing a cpu is vastly more difficult than writing user-space assembly code but it would increase the transistor count of the processors
that i gave to every link in the set of links home about us products contact and it seems that firefox is making that 1px margin much bigger than safari or google-chrome and distorting it
for some reason the second children class .main-body lightseagreen color of a column-layouted flexbox container .content-main plum color has a bigger height than its parent which i do not want it to
the difference between pylons and pyramid are the merge of repoze.bfg and turbogears which brings more api resources
being php parseing it is nearly eg the file needs to be opened closed etc as fast as having the code at the top of each script and much faster than ini and xml config solutions
the real dataframe has more columns in the multi-index
in the example the getter is still public like the entire property while the setter has a more restricted access here private
that said the date class is much better in php5.3 -- it even has dateadd subtract functions which would also solve your problem much better than strtotime .
and any python orm will make it easier to switch out your database if you find something better than mysql like postgresql
there are many options for client-side mvc or mvvm code organization such as knockout.js and ember.js but personnally i prefer backbone.js which has less magic but offers more control
if you are looking for the latter then flask is a micro framework that is considerably smaller than django
is there anything obvious in ubuntu that would otherwise be making sfphpview- render run slower than centos
i m using homebrew as it s newer than macports and i don t know enough to choose between them
as you said google-chrome is faster than firefox so the webdriver is trying to interact with the dom before when elements are not yet visible exist
heapsort can sort in-place and doesn t have the worst case quadratic behavior but on average is slower than quicksort in most cases
multiplying is still somewhat more expensive than add on modern computers and compilers go to some effort to replace them with one or two shifts+add instructions
basically ie sometimes caches ajax get requests so setting the ajaxoption s httpmethod to post is a less fragile way to construct an actionlink
i m just looking for something a little more polished than vim or emacs but not quite as heavyweight as netbeans or eclipse
since i provided a getline example above your read loop can be much better written with fgets as follows
here i started above testing with the aim that c for-loop performance will be better than c# loops but it goes exactly opposite with my understanding and gone with this question and agreed...but when i increase the upper range of for-loop the c performance goes well as compared to c#.
the only problem that as far as i know using drawimage is slower than using putimagedata and it was required in old browser versions like firefox 2 or such
this is much faster than the division by repeated subtraction method since it converges to the result quadratically instead of linearly
i used it because it is small 6 kb compiled with just the extraction making it far smaller than dotnetzip which is more than 150 kb and is more permissive than sharpziplib
speex is designed for speech and should perform better than wma mp3 or other audio codecs that are designed to handle music if you are just encoding speech which i assume since you are grabbing from the mic
i am working on a code which needs to be time efficient and thus using cufft for this purpose but when i try to compute fft of a very large data in parallel it is slower than cpu fftw and the reason i find after finding the time for every line of code using high precision timing code is that cudamalloc taking around 0.983 sec while the time for rest of the lines of code is around 0.00xx sec which is expected ..
direct3d appears in principal to be easier than direct2d but has poor text font handling in the latest version
but i wonder why is division actually slower than multiplication
if you won t be changing the string in loops it is better faster to store the value in and then include it in the for-loop
so i have a post system and i want the box to get larger as more post come in
active directory is far more than ldap - at the very least you d need kerberos but it also tightly integrates with dns both srv and a records which d require significant trickiness to fake over an ssl connection
i ve read that direct2d is much faster than gdi so i figured i would give it a shot for dealing with constantly updated variables
i think using for-loop is much more easier than using foreach loops to do this
on ubuntu 12 04 the kernel must be upgrade and docker installation is more difficult
there is an easier method than using noindex nofollow
inherited is more useful when a new subclassing wants to change the way a method works if you just need to change the data the class uses to work probably an approach like this would do the trick
there are many other small differences railo is generally stricter about syntax and semantics than adobe coldfusion and often those decisions are driven by performance concerns in that compatibility with adobe coldfusion would make railo slower
bundler is a better way to manage application dependencies. there is a plugin rbenv-gemset for getting the same results as rvm s gemsets but sam clearly favors using bundler instead
the exact algorithm you choose will depend on a combination of how fast you need it to run and what kinds of shapes you want to support convex are the easiest concave is harder shapes with holes are harder too
if the file is huge and computation takes longer than the timeout the worker thread is terminate an error message is shown and no intraline difference is displayed for the file pair
change the contentsize of your scrollview.your uiview size and uiscrollview size is same if the uiscrollview contentsize is more than its subviews size then scroll will happen change the line overviewscroll setcontentsize cgsizemake screenframe.size.width screenframe.size.height-25
the results varied from a browser to another firefox 4.0b12 is faster using but google-chrome webkit and opera is faster when using
a public getter or setter gives you more flexibility - when we try and read the variable might not be ready
for the merge layer i prefer using other merge layers that are more intuitive such as add multiplying and concatenate for instance
finally we all know that multiplication and division have higher precedence than addition and subtraction so we can remove the extraneous parentheses so this turns into
if adding 2000 entities and saving the changes at the end dbcontext is 3 to 5 times slower than objectcontext btw. i know that adding a large amount of entities would be better using sqlbulkcopy but that s not the point
hi there i have define more than one tabitem in my tabcontrol
sublimetext or webstorm are far more accessible than vim so it usually happens with their editor rather than mine
this uses pdo and prepared statements which patches the sql injection vulnerability in the most elegant way possible not mysql_real_escape_string and also uses bcrypt for hashing passwords which is infinitely better than one md5 with no salt
i don t consider it smoother as cin cout dialogue is not smooth imho
edit #2 but this was faster than a for-loop for a test i ran on an arrays of a million points
postgresql supports recursive queries in the form of recursive common table expressions which make querying heirarchical data easier than in mysql and also give better performance
what could be the reason that makes iis slower than cassini
q1.i know that post is better than put for name-value pair parameters as the get exposes it in url and post doesn t
each tab contains multiple radgrids as radgrid is heavier than asp.net gridview
i ve heard that configobj is easier to work with than configparser
the one thing to keep in mind is that spreadsheetml is more similiar to presentationml than it is to wordprocessingml in file structure inside the package for every sheet there is a seperate file
that s why even picky compilers do not issue a warning if you shift a chars wider than 7 bits try it - you ll get the warning only if you shift wider than an int allows
templating rows like this is possible in a gridview but the listview control is much better suited to this type of data
what i want to do is if you try to select more than 6 checkbox it will automatically disable all the button however if you tap the even one of the checked checkbox it will make all the checkbox checkable
well suppose you want to upgrade a to v1.1 and that this versioning does no longer use b or use b v2.0 which has a different api
although maybe you should instead find some 32 64bit recent book for your os as the 32b protected mode on x86 is much easier to learn only the graphics output is not as straightforward as it was back in dos era but if you will mix your asm files with c++ loader which would for example initialize some window surface as argb memory array you can pass that pointer down to the asm routines and toy around with pixels in the same simple way how the old 320x200 mode 13h in dos worked
especially in an interpreted-language like php where classes add more overhead than a compiled-language
in the remote case those operations are not simplified assuming that there is a jit that maps the multiplication and add opcodes in a 1 1 relationship to their cpu instruction counterparts in most modern architectures all integer arithmetic operations usually take the same number of cycles so it will be faster multiplying once than add four times just checked it addition is still slightly faster than multiplication 1 clock vs 3 clocks so it still pays using a multiplication here
it seems your apache is more busy than your nginx
i just tested geolocation on firefox 3.6 and iphone safari os 3.1.3 the result is interesting firefox is more accurate than safari
this works in latest google-chrome and firefox and seems cleaner than bind to me
first question is it normal that innodb is much slower 7x slower than myisam for such usage
if you find that innodb is much slower for inserts updates bear in mind that it offers a much better level of durability - if you tune it for approximately the same durability as myisam then you ll see good performance hopefully
if you are looking for the size of the file the fseek ftell solution seems less syscall expensive
it doesn t support avi at the moment but imho mp4 format is better suited for h.264 anyway
rvm supports more then just .rvmrc one of this files is gemfile with either the bundler directive to specify ruby
give better performance than qlist because qvector always
logic to handle enter + mouse click is placed on keydown and mousedown it could be moved to keyup and mouseup if makes more sense
note that in this case the isnull would do the same as coalesce but looks better for this application in case you add some new language
macvim sublimetext is much thicker whereas textmate is slicker and sophisticated
ignite is much more ram-hungry than hazelcast
then use the guide you found to upgrade it to v3 as v2 - v3 versioning upgrade is rather smaller
by the way if you like minimalistic approach there is also scite editor which is my personal preference for doing small bits of code it s even more lightweight than notepad++
the only way it would be broken up differently would be if addition had a higher precedence than subtraction like multiplication does
one of the things that makes lxml better than beautifulsoup is support for proper css-like class selection or even supports full css selectors if you want to use them
note the bit that says so fewer than cnt packets may be processed - it s up the the pcap implementation what it does
also if you open to moving away from mysql i ve found that postgresql has much better resolution of deadlocks
i have read in a site that another benefit of having lighttpd in front of apache is lower number of child processes
innodb is actually faster than myisam in quite a few cases so it depends on what your application s mix of selects updates concurrent queries indexes buffer configuration etc
standard post request is not more secure than get one
safari renders open sans bolder than in google-chrome so you would need to apply a lighter font weight for safari open sans google web fonts rendering in google-chrome
if you are storing varchar type data you should really be using one of the latter two types clob if you are storing various varchar data and xmltype which is a more specific type of clob anyway if you are storing strictly xml data
the fact that using getline with iostreams is faster than fgetc at least in release mode runs counter to the reasoning that copying all that data must be slower than not copying it so i m not sure what all optimization is able to avoid and i didn t really look to find any explanation but it d be interesting to understand what s being optimized away
i am wondering if i can submit the paramaters to via ajax show a loader image after submission it but once the file is complete return the file for download
decoding nullpointerexception is going to take a bit longer than illegalargumentexception filepath must be supplied or whatever
this works just fine but i ve read native javascript sort performing slower than implemented mergesort and quicksort that there are faster options especially if your requirements meet certain conditions
bower is more similar to npm than to component
like matzi suggested udp gives you lower latency and lower packet overhead as the header is smaller than tcp but on the downside the delivery of the packet to the destination is never guaranteed ie
for example an addition is typically much faster than a division
i personally believe that it is not worth the effort because basic is a nearly dead language and there are lots of languages better than basic ocaml haskell common lisp clojure scala scheme go d ...
as far as i know the and-operator has the higher precedence than || or-operator in most of the languages
xcb presents a more direct view of the protocol than xlib does so you often have to look at either the protocol specs or xlib source code to find out what the underlying protocol request is to find an equivalent
go is much more c++ like and low level oriented than c# and c# has only a few functional features while scala allows you to write typical functional code more verbose than ocaml or haskell but similar
since post is better suited to transfer large amounts of data or difficult formatted data it is the established standard for submitting forms but it is in no way safer unsafer or more less secure than get requests
since the next is not far the number of backtracking steps is much fewer than with greedy matching
if you think that writing two apps for both versioning is a better idea then should i write app on wp8 first and at the end remove special wp8 features to downgrade it for wp7.5 or maybe i should write wp7.5 app and then add some wp8 features to upgrade it to wp8
what s currently baffling me is in my results tcp finishes almost 2x faster than udp
but maven and ant are so different that there is no real point at comparing them and maven is still much more than ant + dependency management
show less will be hide and load more button will be show .thanks
you can use appium more mobile oriented than selenium and you can use c# to write your tests
you need two button one for up and one for down or you could use one button and a checkbox for up or down but i think two button is simpler
while the rest of the browsers report the correct width of the document firefox reports a smaller one example at screen resolution of 1920x1080 ie google-chrome and safari reports 1920 while firefox reports 1903
because it seems you re going to deploy a cluster i think titan is the better choice unless you re willing to pay for the enterprise edition of neo4j to support clustering
pypy is supposedly faster than cpython while gevent is based on co-routines and greenlets which supposedly makes for a faster web server
this is the reason why udp is much faster than tcp
in couchdb cloudant this is usually better done as a view than an ad-hoc query
i have to develop a better queue that works more efficiently than the fifo queue
though mysql is more popular than postgresql but instagram is using postgresql maybe due to these reasons
i believe what s happening is that odata uses merge verb that is more efficient than put put requires sending all fields while merge sends only changed data but in your model field b is marked as required so you get a validation exception on the client side
but in certain scenarios myisam works better than innodb
postgresql is a bit more restrictive than mysql
if the latter is what you want you could use rtf which is somewhat easier than the doc format
all the .net methods i tried were slower than vba and vb6 but the best ones were able to use the xll interface which gave better results than the automation interface
personally i think moles is much better suited for mocking the unmockable and i prefer a combination of moq for my own interfaces and classes and moq for framework and externalities like file i o gui db connections etc
get and head being much more frequent than post
edit i m not a java expert but i think that in java members of new array are initialized to 0 or null so calloc is more correct than malloc in my code
okay safari ios is more strict than google-chrome android when it comes to this all fine but it still needs to enable me to allow the connection through
the easymock support is complete but the mockito plugin needs some more work
you d basically need a set of procedures to act as controllers - parsing vars more likely as get post cookie performing any data lookup building + filling the model and then another set of procedures that at as views - taking what s in the model and rendering it for the user
interpreted-language execution speed are slower than compiled-language true but once there is need for more speed you can call in compiled stuff through gems or micro services
firefox extensions have much more power than google-chrome and have wider access to browser s internal api
the storage costs in hadoop are much cheaper than vertica netezza greenplum and the like
i found another approach using the cairo context passed to the handler of draw events but it resulted in capturing a region of the parent window that was larger than the drawingarea
side note union all is faster than union distinct but based on your requirements you need union distinct which can be written as simply union
icollection adds counting and ilist then gives richer functionality including find add and remove elements by index or via lambda expressions
keras provides a simpler quicker way to build and train models in tensorflow at no performance cost since the models are still being run by the same tensorflow engine
i have different behavior on firefox and google-chrome for the bellow code and i think firefox is more correct
about tcp udp tcp is typically slower but more reliable so by default go for tcp but there might be reasons for choosing udp like streaming multicast broadcast .
if the getter setter is any more complex than that i would use get_x and set_x
also see this other so answer about the misconception that udp is always faster than tcp
firefox is easier and better than google-chrome in finding the element from the webpage
should be as fast as 3des aes turned out to be much faster than 3des in software typically 5 to 10 times faster
ie is usually slower than firefox google-chrome is fetching lot of external resources
so what is with svn that your company dislikes so much and cvs does better
firefox may be sniffing the document s encoding with more flexibility than google-chrome is
setinterval vs settimeout i used settimeout instead of setinterval which gives more control over timing
engineyard does provide application-level support too which is a fair bit better than what heroku does
ecdsa is much faster than rsa for private key operations so it should definitely be preferred over rsa when high efficiency is required unless rsa is still fast enough something that may very well be the case
this is only a guess and is not based on actual performance testing probably wicket will be doing better than vaadin
nginx is actually quite a lot easier than apache in my opinion
i was wondering if someone could explain to me why field access seems to be slower than getter setter method access and also why the last 8 iterations execute incredibly fast
i m trying to avoid tcpclient because udp is faster but would this work in tcp since it s streamed
also strtod is a better alternative to atoi
if i try to add more than 1 ssl binding i get the error at least one other site is using the same https binding and the binding is configured with a different certificate ...
note that you re using to different clients webviewclient and the webchromeclient you need to know the difference between them the main difference is that the webviewclient is more configurable
i find the ant one much clearer than the maven one
however from time to time i want to set more than just setter and getter
nvidia and ati architectures differ enough so that for certain tasks such as bitcoin mining ati is vastly better than nvidia
finally consider that you can have more than one qthread as well as more than one qobject running on a qthread
image is an abstract-class so i think the real question is which subclass is more efficient for your program
hey guys can anyone tell me why my code in this jsperf seems to indicate that a for-loop is actually faster than a while loops
words like arbitrary processing and neither not safe make post sounds less secure than put when there is a choice
i read somewhere that adding a different salt to each hash makes it more secure
one one ubuntu distro fuser -n tcp 3000 will report a process if i own the process yet on another linux distro i think centos it won t report the process even if i own it
i heard that i should upgrade beatbox to something more than the versioning 21 to be able to access the forecastingitem object so i tried apt-get update upgrade beatbox but i still get the error
also keep in mind that calling show and hide directly is more expensive than callind .css display and .css display none
no and there won t be any time soon because google-chrome s add-on api is more restrictive than firefox
and lastly the properties makes refactoring easier for example when the value later is no longer stored in a variable but is calculated inside the properties accessor or comes from some other source variable
right now queryover is much more robust in the nhibernate community mainly because it is based on criteria queries which have been around for quite some time
note i do not know much about ninject but i worked with spring.net that is much more complicated
the latest stable firefox 3.6 is fast but for example google-chrome is even faster
firefox allocates lots of memory during that preloading up to 20-30 times more than google-chrome or safari do and even twice as much as ie
i would expect a while loops to be slower than a for-loop since it needs to test a condition before each iteration
this low level network capturing is not something i am normally akin to i m normally higher up with fiddler or charles but considering this isn t via http i need to go lower down the stack
we use google-chrome though which i believe uses more ram than firefox
innodb is newer while myisam is older
also remember multiplication is much more expensive than addition
razorpdf uses an older version of itextsharp which i believe was the latest free itextsharp version
the uipickerview is nothing more than a uiview with one or more uitableview and background and selector views
windows dmd produces omf while coff is more popular now
it uses settimeout however settimeout is a better solution than setinterval because it will only queue a new one if the previous one is complete
bitshifts just go easier with hexadecimal than decimal and is often more convenient to read than octal
in fact with optimizations like spdy you might find that a tls-secured connection actually performs better than plain http
i recently got this error with tomcat 7.0.21 on windows 7 when a war contained jars which had duplicate class definitions a class was defined in more than 1 jar within the war s web-inf lib directory
so for one time initialization code like setcontentview or initializing variables the oncreate event is a better place
however it is not easier than yacc bison
firefox encodes more characters than google-chrome
almost always innodb is a better choice than myisam
usr local lib python2.7 dist-packages theano sandbox cuda init .py 600 userwarning your cudnn version is more recent than the one theano officially supports
my codebase is front-end only so after doing a little reading i thought bower would make more sense than npm
you can feel like post is more secure than get all you want but it s a false premise
using npm package is a little bit harder than using bower package
use post instead of get it s more secure
my firefox adds more chopping to video playing itself google-chrome plays the video much better
mergesort is more natural to implement for linked lists but you can do quicksort very nicely
i just found out that if you re using google-chrome you trigger antialiasing at 49px or higher however with firefox it s set at 257px or higher
one addition for embedded cpu architecture they have to be usually cheaper than mainstream processors so that they do not raise the product s life considerably
an example of why coalesce is better than isnull
if there is no parent child relationship consider named pipes made with mkfifo 3 or af_unix sockets see unix 7 and scoket 2 .... which are bidirectional af_unix sockets are much faster than tcp ip or udp ip on the same machine
obviously very similar to the virus answer above the difference being that while viruses usually replicate spread do a preprogrammed inconvenient thing a botnet is more of a take control of your machine for a future usually nefarious but dynamic purpose. i think the hosts your agent can more easily change with a botnet too
innodb handles inserts with composite primary keys quicker than myisam
i use the slidingtablayout for the tabs and if i am right it prepares the fragmnets near the opened fragment so 1 more reason against the onresume onpause open close
icefaces provides more good looking components than richfaces
i really like thompsonÃ¢ s Ã¢ Åhaskell the craft of functional programmingÃ¢ because itÃ¢ s well written and haskell allows an easier start than other functional languages while being completely pure unlike lisp or scheme
but i was working on server-side and probably for client-side it s much easier
after fixing css background-image style formatting to get better compatibility with firefox and ie i found that google-chrome intermittingly loses the background images when you scroll up and down on the page
memcached around 4-5 times slower than apc but run as a single process that can be touched everywhere in my environment
for those answers which use a method isprime int boolean there is a faster algorithm than the one previously implemented which is something like
quoting rapidxml s author i would like to thank arseny kapoulkine for his work on pugixml which was an inspiration for this project and 5 - 30 faster than pugixml the fastest xml parser i know of he had tested against version 0.3 of pugixml which has reached recently version 0.42
that happens because pixels size in google-chrome is bigger than in firefox
put to the api a message describing the outcome of the game post is acceptable put is better for idempotency
you can indeed execute scripts on almost any page using content scripts that can manipulate the dom allowing you to add an onsubmit event listener to a form more reliable than onclick on a button as it is fired however the form is submitted - hitting enter
if your query was parent .child and there are many parent that have no children then parent .child would probably be faster than parent .qsa .child
the dbi versioning is less likely to be the source of the trouble but it would still be good to upgrade to the most current versioning
any byte other than 0xff will introduce a start bit into a serial channel and a missing byte in the tcp udp implementations is even less likely
however in the comparative table i linked get is listed as less secure than post
there are some instances of implementations that i have seen for some methods that throw nullpointerexception if argument is null but that is wrong implementation in those cases illegalargumentexception makes much more sense
yet from my point of view texreg is more efficient that stargazer and easier to customize than xtable
as abhishekkharwar said there are many other ways to do this better as using uicollectionview or uitableview but you have to decide what fits better on your app needs
openpgp is simpler than x509 but more limited especially if you wish to have a strong legal meaning behind the certificates
a for-loop is more natural than a while loops but you requested no for
reader writer since jdk1.1 in java are newer than inputstream outputstream since jdk1.0
this sample rate might be lower as only google-chrome and firefox are supported
ie is less performant than safari google-chrome and firefox when it comes to js - but have you really developed a page that is unusable in ie with js turned on
nothing is 100 safe but innodb properly used is a lot safer than myisam against data loss and corruption
you re right postgresql has much better support for sql and other advanced features so there s a very good case for why postgresql is superior to mysql
at the moment both postgresql and greenplum are open source products so you are free to chose any of them but of cause postgresql community is bigger atm
now i m trying to do the same thing with imagemagick to be more correct with magick++
but for someone who doesn t even know what an integer is numbers without fractions values is probably clearer
i ve used ferret in the past with few problems although i ve heard sphinx is better
but i have a problem dragging to a droppable that is smaller than the draggable
the foreach loops is slower than the for-loop yet most people don t rewrite all of their code to use the for
sorting all the objects before filtering is sure to take longer than filtering and then sorting a smaller data set
in my opinion using isnull nullif is faster than using case when
that way the hash salt is more random and your data a bit more secure
the md5 hash is no smaller than the uuid so it doesn t help with storage
with caliburn it is even easier since you just need to bind a property on your viewmodel to selecteditem
now the response i got from my boss is that i need to prove that innodb will run faster than myisam
strcpy could be better replaced by strncpy which does some bound checking
the reason the pull model works better than the push model in this case is as follow
using a filesystemobject is more powerful than dir because dir only returns a string while filesystemobject lets you work with files and folder as actual objects which are much more powerful
posting here an example showing how to implement same approach but now applied to qtreewidget which a bit more involved than qlistwidget
the ram is much faster than the hard disk
so if all you need is to serve images instead of doing additional processing in java the ram disk approach is indeed faster also uses less memory
as i said this may increase the speed especially in an environment where modulo is more expensive than simple subtraction but you would want to actually benchmark it to be certain
but loops doesn t work like an old c-style for-loop where is checked on each iteration which is part of why this loops is faster
and i ll just add to previous comment if 128bit number has prime factor larger than 64bit then it certainly has a factor less than 64bit
nginx apache fits better with nodejs
i have found one benchmark in which yii is faster than codeigniter and another benchmark in which codeigniter is faster than yii
try using innodb instead of myisam innodb has more optimization tricks for select statements especially if you only select indexed fields
the pinoyyd post is neater and get straight to the point how do i authorise a background web app without user intervention
in c memory most other things are managed by the programmer so strdup is no worse than forgetting to free malloc ed memory failing to null terminate a string using incorrect format string in scanf and invoking undefined behaviour accessing dangling pointer etc
see this blog when you have 10000 request koa performs better than express
4 tcp is a slower than udp
memcpy will always be faster than strncpy for any real world situation even in the corner case i spoke before look page_copy_fwd_maybe
the idea of saying break out of the nth nested loop is worse than a goto from a structural perspective
why does memcpy perform slower than memmove on my system
the official tutorial on bitwise and bit-shift operators has more information about other related operators and xor left shift right shift
trampolines never runs more than one thunk at a time so if you break
data-size xml very verbose but usually not an issue when using compression and thinking that the write access case through post or put is much more rare as read-access in many cases it is 3 of all traffic
division is per se slower than multiplication however i don t know the details
multiplication is far easier and faster for a cpu to do than division
redmine handles multiple projects and sub projects far nicer than trac
i searched a bit and found that dill can perform better than pickle with classes but i am having problems to implement it
armv7 is usually better but for arm fixed-point arithmetic is usually a lot faster than floating-point implementations
aside does this mean rebol is more homoiconic than lisp
any attempt to reuse a single parentedtree as a child of more than one parent or as multiple children of the same parent will cause a valueerror exception to be raised
not necessarily better than the repeater suggestion but another option is to use a gridview control and a datatable data structure
addition and subtraction is worse as these have to be done in sequence of two operations and the second operation requires the first to have completed - this is not the case if the compiler is just producing two add operations on independent data
try-catch is actually slower if there really is an exception-handling thrown
ubuntu has nicer frontend and could be more suitable for windows emigrants while debian is more for backend guys
as far as security goes post is much better than get as the data is sent behind-the-scenes rather than embedded in the url making it the typical protocol for login info
here for what it s worth is a pipes-csv variant which just compresses each parsed row into an unboxed vector of int s by hand this easier than finding double which is what this csv is really storing using readint from the bytestring package.
regarding cloudant it s more or less just couchdb so to connect you can use these libraries from the couchdb wiki
for something like a search where you are retrieving information it might be okay but for anything that stores information the post redirect get pattern is a better approach
for those who are more comfortable with maven you could add this dependency to your pom.xml file
sproutcore makes use of bindings better than cappuccino currently does
i personally think the while loops looks less clean than the nested for-loop
performance of jackson is better than gson
i m currently coding a upgrade system which will do best to avoid more than one upgrade path for a specific higher versioning but it may exist due to versioning branching
using mef for the add-in architecture over prism can be cleaner because the reasons for each project are vastly different and mef has a cleaner model i think it can also act as a basic ioc container
in the case of cryptographic hash functions like md5 it is even worse
while the delphi pascal syntax is more text oriented begin end or and so the underscores look a bit strange as you don t expect them there
additionally if you have strdup then it is much more convenient than strlen + malloc + strcpy with identical result including the same obligation to free the allocated storage when you no longer need it
in this particular case it would just copy the 3 bytes as expected but why use strncpy when memcpy is a simpler solution
the standard doesn t specify anything deeper than malloc and free which leaves c libraries free to implement them to work in their target environments
the mp4 implementation is more widely used and wouldn t require a webm fallback in most browsers
owl and rdfs are more expressive than rdf which means here that you can capture more complex relations for instance you can also represent the link between sets of things rdfs subclassof or use transitive properties hasancestor
erlang has a steeper learning curve compared to elixir
if loops body can throw a checked exception a for-loop is clearly better
how to get more than 20 post from instagram using their api
using getfrontbufferdata in directx method is slower than gdi itself
you may find this task easier with pexpect which is a third-party module for automating subprocess keyboard interaction
normally quicksort is faster than mergesort which is faster than heapsort
mutation is typically easier to do this with than crossover
safari behaves better than firefox but an error message Ã¢ Åone error in opening the pageÃ¢ Ã¢ shows up in the status bar if you remove the iframe during the load event
this doesn t happen in google-chrome and is less frequent in firefox than in ie
because division is often much slower than multiplication if performance is critical you might keep a table with powers of ten and their reciprocals
performance difference memcpy is usually more efficient than strcpy which must scan the data it copies
i can see that my skeleton mxml module is slightly larger than my actionscript module 66kb vs
if your shell is bash or ksh or zsh it s much safer and easier to build up a command with an array rather than a string
myisam tables have smaller footprints than innodb ones myth
when such individuals are subject to crossover their children are likely to be worse than either parent
after a few test hashmap linkedhashmap and treemap are way slower than arraylist and i wanted to use them just for the ability to create submaps
other than the four options provided by the cookbook - return new user username password salt roles - i need about 20 more fields with getter and setter
the for-loop is faster than the foreach-loop if the arrays must only be accessed once per iteration
i have a default installation of mysql and postgresql on my os x box and mysql is 2x faster comparing queries that are warmed up by repeatedly executing the query
if the database is sophisticated enough adding an explicit order by clause will hint that sorting is more optimal for the grouping operation as well as the sorting can then be re-used in the query execution pipeline
you can also read up on how to make rvm work with passenger 3 it might be transferrable to 4 with gemsets though in my opinion using bundler deployment is much better option
so it is considerably less then what facebook states in their documentation at least looking by the date however by count it seems you get more than 50 post
rethinkdb is more similar to pouchdb couchdb
it worked in this case in my first part with chars i tried to look at my first part which works fine and i noticed that chars is easier to convert to int basically i don t need to convert it but with string it doesn t work this way i tried to google it but i can t find proper solution
apc is faster on a single server - but memcached is distributed
real life often involves more than merely spaces delimiter words
even though git-svn is easier to start with here are some further reasons why using the kde svn2git instead of git-svn is superior besides its flexibility
one more edit if you want to use getline instead which you asked about in the comments - and it s even safer than fgets since it will increase the buffer size as needed you would change to change the code a little bit
is bower a better fit than npm for asp .net 5 projects with separation of source and build files and if not what s the recommended way of doing it purely with npm
a for-loop should be used don t you think what loops makes is more clearly stated in the for-loop
while this is fine in some cases where flexibility is needed reading a line at a time with getline of fgets is the better choice
the team behind protovis has since created d3.js so this is likely a better option than protovis
i tried here but google-chrome doesn t show any styling except font color while firefox shows some more
superclass defines more general features of the objects of its subclassing
i can do this in bokeh but i have other issues regarding interactivity which plotly manages better
if you have a team which feels more comfortable with setter getter why not
i have links of term on sidebar when i attach more than one post to term it get repeat
on all of the other browsers i ve tried safari opera ie google-chrome it looks much less nice because all of those browsers scroll half a screen at a time
...web api relies on system.net.http library for getting request headers and this library gives a null for httprequestmessage s content.headers.contenttype in this case and web api sees that content-length is greater than 0 but no content-type header and hence returns a 415 unsupported media type
remember that multiplication even with strings binds tighter than addition so we must use brackets
multiplication is much harder than addition
of course this is no fewer keystrokes than sudo python although at least you wouldn t need to enter a passwd
i think the problem happened because the padding left right of uitextview is bigger than uilabel
the problem is that to do so you need to use objectcontext instead of dbcontext which makes things harder
hashing with sha md5 or any other algorithm solves the problem of key protection because you don t need to keep any secret value other than salt but salt is significantly less sensitive than encryption key
as mentioned above as you remove items the arrays gets smaller so a for-loop is probably not the best solution
i ve came to kohana from codeigniter which was a little bit bigger documentation and easier to understood but as far as i found out many programmers say that kohana are alot better than codeigniter
in my opinion using jquery show hide is a better solution at this point in time
you can get soap services to work on iphone but it s a lot more work than just get or post ing against an url
i think it is older than the uicollectionview and therfore explains it for uitableview
at the same time the compilation phase for a dfa is typically more complex than for an nfa and dfas don t have all the capabilities of nfas
a jlist would probably be better than a jtable
unfortunately this doesn t work as children can t have more than one parent
if any of the children also has -webkit-filter npx the filter gets applied twice once for child and once for parent
lately i have used notepad++ a bit more than vim
i m new to protovis although it is no longer under development and d3.js is the newer software
from what you re describing perhaps a gridview or datalist is a better option
post is no more secure than get over the http protocol
1.0 faster than a for-loop iterating over an indexed arrays of 1kk elements for 9.0 plusmn
honestly though postgresql scales much better than mysql
vhdl is more popular in europe and verilog is dominating in the us
since that appears to generate index-color gif files which are smaller than the png files that doxygen generates
another reason to consider this route is if parsing xml files is more complex than filtering off node values grouping elements assigning new ids filtering by attributes
that said using a standard sort with either comparable rows or a comparator is much better than mixing up the sort logic and the comparison logic
next you ll find that the threading model of nginx is much more efficient than apache s for what you re doing
i cannot propose any db not knowing your specific needs but if you want to use a free software which excludes oracle and you re not already experienced with mysql you should try postgresql which is more powerful than mysql
i can help you with lodash which is a superset of underscore.js and much better than underscore.js when it comes to performance and consistency see lodash vs underscore.js
it is said that get method is faster than post but i don t know why is it
the reason for doing so is to reduce hardware cost as division is more expensive than multiplication
isn t there an easier way than the for-loop to build this arrays
in addition as mats petersson said memmove is cache friendlier than memcpy
this question is not to discuss if using copy constructor is better than serializable deserialization or not
memcached is more along the lines of a distributed object cache vs something like apc or xcache which stores php bytecode in memory so you avoid having to parse it each time
yes udp is much much lighter than tcp
so while the writes my be sequential on disk for datasets larger than ram these random reads will quickly become the bottle neck
i want to use accelerometer but i learnt that gyroscope is better option to calculate the accelerometer
for eps is the same situation the post script is more readable but you should apply all necessery transformations on object before get its size
and my guess as to why an element is being dropped is your compareto method never returns a 1 in any case so elements are always considered to be less than or equals to other elements which is probably screwing with the treeset
the subclassing overridden method cannot have weaker access than superclass method
you may also want to have a look at dill which covers slightly more cases than pickle
if you need a globally accessible variable or properties that s more suited to a base class that your classes inherited from
division and modulo are indeed costly hardware operations whatever you do this is more related to hardware architecture than to languages or compilers perhaps ten times slower than addition
which one goes better with netbeans phpunit or simpletest
i am trying to make a dialog pop-up that displays more information about an entry in a listview
comparative to other themes of swing sysnthetica substance etc. quaqua theme takes more memory
png does everything except animations unless enhanced with apng that gif does and better
in the cases where auto can be used it is more concise than decltype as you don t need to provide the expression from which the type will be inferred
it takes a page off of the free_page_list updates mem_map zeroes the page and returns the physical address of the page. here s another post that explains it well and also explains why using calloc is better than malloc + memset
worst case for quicksort is actually worse than heapsort and mergesort but quicksort is faster on average
a comparator class is better since use of comparable would mean using
saving information to a variable and therefore to ram is always faster than direct to disk
so you can t reject the null hypothesis that tolower is as faster as toupper and thus your experiment has got errors
unless you know exactly what you are doing do not use the same layoutparams for more than one viewgroup
here s another article that describes the listview control and why it s probably a better fit than the gridview
even this blog from 2007 shows benchmark results that innodb is on par with or faster than myisam under most workloads
i had mentioned that in our rails application all select queries dropped below 100ms after switching to postgresql whereas some of the complex joins generated by activerecord would occasionally take as much as 15s or more with mysql 5.1 because of nested loops with inner table scans even when indices were available
i know it is much easier by using ggplot2 but i need to get it done by lattice
i use all the events for the drag operation so maybe the initial move is less laggy perceptually in this case
first of all if it was not for the relative complexity of the expressions here scipy would have been definitely the better option over sympy
from my experience mstest is much slower than nunit
the lack of salt is harder to expoit here than with password hash since the hash is not directly known
its weird when i use source sans pro it looks bolder on google-chrome but when i switch to safari it looks thinner
also if you want a hover effect you re better off with mouseenter and mouseleave which jquery provides for browsers that don t already support it
modules such as dill are doing a better job than pickle
that way each thread can pick up a link when it s ready which makes more sense than partitioning in advance
please especially test on safari because it has some more problems than firefox and google-chrome
making abstract-class before i had more than one subclass in mind for them
then we found glibc also have same issue but increase rate is less than tcmalloc
i find the best way is to create a cache session folder in your systems directory is more safer i put important things like logs and cache in system rather than application folder
strncpy is more recommended that strcpy because protect your code against buffer overflow
you insert in there but never select from there as far as i know today myisam is better than innodb in this case
in the hopes that this will further my goal of squashing out the stupid for loops are inherently slow canard for r here is a re-working of your first version still using a for-loop that is more than 40x times faster
i believe it is much much faster than using tlist descendant or tstringlist
i probably feel fseek might be bit faster than fread as fseek changes the pointer position to the new address space that you have mentioned and there is no date read is happening
doing something similar with sorting and filtering however is more tricky because i do both of those at the sql level
if your working set is larger than your ram the operating system will be constantly swapping pages out to disk to make room to swap in pages that an application wants to access
p.s. my recommendation would be to remove jsonobject conversion and instead return an object of actual class as internally spring uses jackson which is more powerful json framework then org.json
the pattern above is very likely recognised by your compiler and replaced by highly optimised code which will be as fast if not faster as memset but not calloc
this can enable the user to download an upgrade patch that is much smaller than the installation package for the entire product
serializable and deserialization process runs slower
i believe that the reports are using something more along the lines of vbscript edit oregonghost says vba which actually makes more sense than vbscript than vb.net and very limited at that
in addition using crypt to hash password is better
at some point if you re doing randomish queries and your working set is sufficiently larger than ram then you ll be limited by the small number of random iops a disk can do
edit as mentioned by chandresh using the ng-show directive with a true false value would be a better option than using ng-class
in a congested network yes udp will send its packets faster than tcp this is because tcp takes then congestion into account using a mechanism called congestion control
this is happening because i am trying to separate out the search terms based on spaces since spaces comes more natural to users then comma separation or pipes or any other delimiter
for example nginx is much faster than apache
a qfile may be used by itself or more conveniently with a qtextstream or qdatastream
since a proper implementation of dijkstra is faster than bellman-ford use dijkstra unless there are negative weight edges in the graph
i have found though that since i started using the asset_sync gem which uses fog instead of aws-s3 gem i don t have any more trouble with paperclip and s3
one way that you can consider for hide information not totally but more stronger than get of user is create a json with your infos and send a post request to your page
if you don t plan to move to mobiles later tkinter or pyqt may be a better choice than kivy
on myisam tables in some cases the subselects tend to be faster than grouping by queries due to the fact that grouping by in myisam is quite expensive due to sorting materialization overhead
but then your setter is less restricted than your getter which is odd.
i have been testing the practicality of openmp gnu parallel sort algorithms in the c++ standard library and have found the parallel quicksort algorithm to be significantly slower than the mergesort algorithm
this is slower than getter setter
you should check out losswise it has a plugin for keras that s easier to use than tensorboard and has some nice extra features
i believe post is better than get
in other words the per-comparison-overhead of heapsort is higher than the one of quicksort
if you compute the length of the string for unrelated reasons or have the length of the string from other resources it s unclear to me whether memcpy is better or worse than strncpy
these are also kept up-to-date much better than the ubuntu debian repositories
the community is smaller than grails but the project is supported by springsource who is quite active in the community
however gambit scheme has smoother access to c c++ code libraries which far outnumber common lisp s libraries
when it comes to deletion it even gets worse when saving at the end of all entity removals dbcontext is around 18 times slower than objectcontext
the scipy numpy matplotlib clan is much better at dealing with huge amounts of volume data than matlab or at least gnu octave in my experience
so normaly you could use heapsort but most times quicksort is faster
reading audio files from ram is much faster than reading audio files from hard disk
the point of using okhttp instead of the defaulthttpclient by apache is that okhttp is threadsafe for android and better supported by retrofit
by something fancier i m referring to more delimiter than spaces grammar punctuation etc
third in my experience going from safari to firefox is usually less problematic than the other way around
templates will be inline in the standard meaning of inline which is more related to the one definition rule than to actual code inlining
they re good for code-size but often slower than sse avx loops
in the long run you ll have less troubles with supporting tablet multiple screens sizes and you can easily re-use them in different contexts
the question is about is there really any platform where memcpy is faster than memmove
a111 addition is equal or better than subtraction
i believe it is significantly simpler than opencv which on a raspberry pi for example takes around 1gb of space and over an hour to build whereas cimg is a single header-only file that you include in your code with no libraries needing to be installed which can do what you ask
indeed you ll handle php object with getter setter which is better in my point of view
sorting is more important to me than filtering so if i have to have both sorting and filtering target the same representation of the data i ll just give up on filtering working
ps radix tree is usually faster and more compact then trie but suffers from the same side effects of trie comparing to hash tables though less significant of course
as painful as it s going to be for both of us to perform the upgrade it s probably better to commit the time now and get the code up to the latest versioning than to try to find an older versioning that reduces the effort
in a single thread world is different you can use a sorted set a binary tree or your custom data structure that would perform better than concurrent skip-lists
while ant is cool maven is cooler
it provides similar css selector syntax as jquery does and it s much faster than beautifulsoup because it relies on lxml to do the parsing work
from my experience of both i would suggest that velocity is a little bit simpler but freemarker is more powerful
in addition for doing powers of two bitshifting is usually a little clearer than doing exponent though choose whatever works for you
xts extends this further but zoo is a better starting point
when one of the strings is a prefix of another the performance of compareto is worse as it still needs to determine the lexicographical ordering while equals won t worry any more and return false immediately
when you extends you incorporate the code of the superclass into yours sometimes there is no code to incorporate so implements is better suited
the initial read has to access the disk which is a lot slower than accessing ram
it is also proper browser behavior firefox is just stricter about it than google-chrome is
please notice that counting with where is not slower with innodb than it would be with myisam
it depends on your requirements but setting up a usb connection is sometimes easier than managing a bluetooth connection
information - use memcpy as it s faster than strcpy and we know
one can implement a version of quicksort for a single-linked list but normally this is only interesting as a puzzle since mergesort is much easier to implement and works equally well or better for sorting linked lists
if you are not notifying or doing anything else then the automatic getter setter method is the quicker to develop that is not claiming it is the fastest or slowest to execute though
a better answer than apache-poi is to use docx4j
maybe someone more skilled with theano lasagne will see a solution
could i use mapply to do this more succinctly than running melt and dcast separately for each of employed girls guys
nginx or other server is not much more efficient than apache
if you are more comfortable with mysql because you should install postgresql locally if you are going to use postgresql for production then you should consider using one of the mysql add-ons heroku offers
with mri i d use forking with jruby there s more of a case to be made for threading
i assume applying iqueryable will be much faster than the ienumerable not to forget i was able to use iqueryable on the other entities without any issues
but if convenience is more important than efficiency yes you probably should consider a tree model not dom necessarily xom is better for example or data binding jaxb or xstream
side note check-out the json.net serializable which gives more options and better control over the deserialization process
quite apart from the fact that the language vb.net is far more feature rich than vb6 the fact that you have developed in vb.net means that you have made extensive use of the .net class libraries including system.security.cryptography that you give as an example
i know nginx has lower memory footprint and little faster than apache in serving static files
no objects come magically into existence in swift any more than in objective-c
and it said memmove might be very slightly slower than memcpy
ok if we say that the parent is always bigger than the children because it is above them we write
post is a little safer than get because the parameters are not stored in browser history or in web server logs. also data is not displayed in the url
what s the deal i thought actionscript would be nicer than mxml
that is because that style of loops is a better fit for what you are doing than the for-loop you used earlier
innodb is more complex while myisam is simpler
the reason for this intuitively is that the last multiplication does dramatically more work than any of the previous multiplication so much so in fact that summing up the work of all the preceding multiplies gives something asymptotically dominated by the last multiplying
plus the overhead of doing it is extremely costly- hive queries against hbase are on my cluster at least an order of magnitude slower than against plain hdfs files
udp is really faster than tcp and the simple reason is because it s non-existent acknowledge packet ack that permits a continuous packet stream instead of tcp that acknowledges a set of packets calculatd by using the tcp window size and round-trip time rtt .
i used firefox as it can be configured to download to a default directory but i don t think the google-chrome situation is any better
i ll just add that if the 128bit number is prime or has a prime factor larger than 64bit then there will be no solution to your problem
in my experience hashing is always faster than sorting for joining and for grouping
i don t see any form properties in the code you posted so either the posted code has been modified or the properties is higher in the inherited tree simpleformcontroller
in google-chrome the button is wider than in firefox
i try to fit a gam using the gam package i know mgcv is more flexible but i need to use gam here
drools and jess have a higher power than swrl but protÃ£ gÃ£ supports swrl in that it supports owl so the use case is to support multiple swrl implementations
if you do it over ssl https it is probably more secure
for the vm layer i like the containment pattern more than inherited and at this layer i also implement inotifypropertychanged which is also a properties of the vm and not the data model
however for a variety of fft problem sizes i ve found that cufft is slower than fftw with openmp
in either case mongoose is going to add a tiny amount of overhead so it s likely to be technically slower than mongojs but not by any meaningful amount like it takes 5.1 seconds to insert 20k records vs 5.0 seconds
in addition to the other answers usually simple multiplication is way more efficient than using pow
it is semantically influenced more by java sml haskell and a very obscure oo language called gbeta
the perf hit will be ridiculous i know apple say swift execute faster than objective-c but this is low level so it will be harmless
it supports fetch pull and push and is more stable for me than hg-git similar features from hg to git
alarmmanager should also be more efficient than timertask
since you don t want to repeat yourself it s very tempting to put all your validation on one side or the other but there are tradeoffs either way and it is true that server-side validation is going to be slower than client-side
i don t need more than atomic read operation and atomic write operations i have no use for fetch-and-add compare-and-swap etc.
i would like it to be more real time than post get so would like to use socket.io or failing that web sockets or failing that real sockets
how can i connect a method and not a command with a binding from the viewmodel to an attached event to ask in a more general way with caliburn micro
i start off with something like mysql and then later on i might decide that postgresql makes a better fit - and if i have done everything the propel way switching to the new engine is trivial - rebuild and go
how can i find all div and span tags with order preserved.with beautifulsoup it is very simple but i switched recently to lxml since it is much faster than beautifulsoup
if your requirement is to store a key with value as json then mongodb is a better fit in this scenario as by default mongodb stores data in bson which is json + additional data types
the lack of this kind of holb in spdy and http 2 makes these protocols more efficient than http 1.x
note that it currently does not support true parallelism you won t have two threads running ocaml code in parallel but it doesn t matter as ocaml is much faster than many other languages for example on a quadcore the language shootout shows that ocaml outperforms even haskell with multicore capabilities
division is slower than multiplication due to some reasons
also a post request would be better than a get if you re sending json
and using keras or lasagne is way simpler to develop nns then pure theano which was just side research project in montreal to support development of pylearn
i try to make shooter game on c# with sfml.net but i can t imagine how to make an ability to shoot more than 1 bullet because now i have just one null-object of bullet-class and when player presses space key this object gets link to the new bullet
interestingly enough sincos seems to be even slightly faster than sin without cos and the gcc compiler will use fsincos when you compute both sin and cos - so it does what i d like hotspot to do or does hotspot too
you can avoid duplicates and still run much faster than union distinct which is actually same as union by running query like this
either is capable of doing it but swing is more modern and supports components jtree jtable .. and functionality double-buffering built-in key bindings plafs support for rich text that is missing from the awt apis
the number of ie addons seems to be far lower than firefox and google-chrome extensions - why s that
i find the simple solution ant calls maven more obvious
redmine was written to be a better trac than trac
gridview has much more bells and whistles than datalist
however i feel like angular ionic provides a better way of doing so that i missed
if you re looking for small implementations you might get better results with bottle or flask
but i don t want to use a for-loop as my json arrays has more than 3 entries and if i request a lot of data in short time it takes long time till the for-loop goes through every entry
i finally figured out that keypress has a better compatibility than keydown or keyup on linux platform
just because multiplication has a higher precedence than addition doesn t mean we need to perform all multiplication in the expression before doing any addition
which steps of aes encryption makes it less vulnerable than des
edit2 seems as if i m wrong re post being more secure than get
in an oltp database like mysql or postgresql it s better to use a range query over an index where you keep track of the last value seen on the previous page
your object literal cannot have more than one getter or setter with the same name
the code is written like this in the belief that a shifts and adds are significantly faster than multiplication and b the compiler doesn t know the best way to multiplying by ten
tcp is a bit slower than udp but more failsafe
if you can t afford lost packets then tcp is probably a better option than udp since it provides that guarantee out of the box
however note that post is not much safer than get
the fact that bcrypt produces hash slower than md5 because of security reasons is also clear for me
that will make it easier to do operations with this value equality greater than less than addition subtraction etc...
i wonder why everybody missed that multiplication is much faster than division
all of rsfalcon7 s suggestions can be combined into a super rule do as much as possible in unshared resources l1 l2 caches - implying economizing on code and data requirements - and if you need to go to shared resources do as much as possible in l3 before going to ram before using synchronization the cpu cycles required to synchronize is variable but is slower - or much slower - than accessing ram before going to disk
consider using force.com canvas now ga which is an added-value iframe with more security and easier integration with salesforce apis than raw iframes - see
in my regex replace modifier with public private protected replace returntype with the return type and replace methodname with the method name.
disclaimer i am more familiar with haskell than ocaml so i may not be doing things in the most idiomatic way
mouseover events can occur multiple times so mouseenter is a better option for this
even though nunit now includes the most popular mbunit advanced features mbunit is still more feature-rich for example
which product mallet or weka is better for text classification task
it s slower than simple for-loop from 1 to arrays length and ipairs is deprecated in lua 5.2 anyway
since ant is more of a scripting tool and doesn t impose structure or lifecycle like maven and gradle you simply manually invoke ant when you want to use it
in this situation storing password hash and the salt is more secure than storing the credentials encrypted or not because an attacker would have no way of getting the password back even if he manages to get his hands on both the hash and the salt
from what i have read on here i here that nunit is more popular over mbunit
so yes - toupper is more reliable than tolower
if there is a long execution time the execution time is greater than settimeout or setinterval to set the time
onchange is a better choice than onblur or focusout because blur and focusout also fire when the contents of the text field hasn t changed
in addition x86 is furhter complicated because there are generally separate documentation manuals for 32 bit and 64bit processors i m not familiar enough with arm to comment here
profiling is known to slow pypy a lot more than cpython
please note however that this architecture implements tcp which is much slower than udp and will not work for any type of fast-paced data intensive games but should accomplish your goals given your description above
those answers was that calloc can allocate larger blocks than malloc can and etc
this solution is cleaner than implementing comparable by your dto because you can create and use many comparator acording to your needs
there s not really a graceful way to break out of for l although it is much faster than a goto loop
note most recently i have been using bazaar and hg with fully powerful regexps so may be looking for stuff more powerful than git provides
i generally use interfaces are too enforce a common behavior that a group of classes share whereas subclassing is more appropriately used in cases where you can achieve serious code re-use through inherited functions properties
value for -sym argument should be local directory on your disk for obj local armeabi folder that contains libndk_databases.so file
in term of speed square rooting is easy a few arithmetical operations for some newton-like method but it is not clear what asin does probably quite costly cos is likely to be one order of magnitude slower than sqrt and thus one square root is likely to be quickier than those two transcendental function calls
which java framework awt or swing makes more sense for something this simple
nginx will definitely work faster than apache
if you measure properly you ll see there s essentially no difference enumerate is microscopically faster than xrange in this example but well within noise
solr - the collapsingqparser is really a post filtering that provides more performant field collapsing than solr s standard approach when the number of distinct grouping in the result set is high
my assumption in the question above is that disk is as fast as ram or faster than ram
i would like to combine hover onmouseover with onclick
generally you can have as good performance for reading as in myisam in innodb tables - you just can use count without where clause and you always should have a suitable index for where clauses as in innodb table scan will be slower than in myisam
however consider that pypy might do the linear search 100 times faster than cpython then a few times might be dozens
i need to create a menu based on that list but cannot simply list all post and get it because it is a busy blog and has more than 2000 post
ie8 is the same and firefox is much better but i ve migrated away to google-chrome now so would like to stick with the one browser if possible
postgresql license bsd is undoubtedly more simple than mysql s
a for-loop is nothing more than a glorified while loops
haskell has fewer industrial users than ocaml and although it does have multicore support it is still being developed in a very unproductive direction
you can avoid duplicates using union all and still run much faster than union distinct which is actually same as union by running a query like this
i would like this function to work in firefox ie google-chrome etc but at the moment it only works in google-chrome and older than firefox version 49
again this is perhaps more clear than using raw sql and only requires one query but this one query could be very large it will return all items and their categories and doing the grouping filtering yourself is probably less efficient than letting the database do it for you
it returns a byte arrays of all the pixels which can be iterated much faster than a for-loop with a call to getpixel inside nested inside another for-loop
between these glfw is much closer to glut in character -- a small toolkit for abstracting away most of the os-dependent parts so you can produce opengl programs with relatively little hassle
edit i tried ie google-chrome firefox to test and i found firefox reflects changes faster than others
we can also do more than show hide
wicket probably has more resources than vaadin
this is one of the trickier differences between tcp and udp
a lot of articles about bazaar will tell you it is a lot slower than git or mercurial
apc gives you some more functionality than memcached
variety of supporting widgets is probably the single area in which archetypes is still stronger than dexterity
to be trying to implement them using different protocols tcp and udp is even odder h323 voip is the only applciation i know of which does this
so the avx version does indeed appear to faster than the sse version both for the original implementations and the optimised implementations
jvm hosted languages are generally going to be faster than traditional mri ruby and both java and scala are generally faster than jruby when it comes to raw cpu capabilities
i also use objective-c more than swift but here s what my guess is as to what the objective-c code would come to
as the previous poster points out this would be easier with jsr286 portlets wef and non-wef as the eventing is standard but it s not impossible with jsr168 if you re limited to that version in the short term
though making use of javac api in a nb modules hard to do something better than a getter setter
until people have more experience with google-chrome i would think firefox is a better choice
this method is more general than show hide as it can be extended to any style rule
i think you are confusing deprecated which means the api method calls are marked to not be deleted in the future and should not be used which being replaced by newer features as in gridview and listview
this will work directly with avassetexportsession which is much easier than playing with avassetwriter unless you have a very specific requirement typically you need to manipulate the actual video frames
nonetheless i tried to compare the sum of all test speeds and in some cases nunit is faster and in other cases mstest is faster
the console for safari and google-chrome imo is better
asp with jscript is 100 times better cleaner simpler nicer than vbscript and makes my job a joy rather than a vbscript head ache
also i ve used a for-loop and not jquery each loops on the sections elements because a for-loop is much faster due to the lack of function callback an each function has
it may even use a different server software say nginx or lighttpd that has less overhead than the traditional apache setup
onÃ¢ running the application in single step mode also into the standard library functions strcmp and strtol it is even clearer that the processor has to do many more instructions to run an integer comparison in batch file than a string comparison
however for some reason ulkit is making a background-size larger than my background-image
to copy a string in c use carefully strcpy 3 often strncpy is better
however integrating cefglue into your winforms or wpf app may be more difficult than cefsharp
better approach with addclass and removeclass using hover
yes that may since your allocating with new but deallocating with delelte yes malloc free is safer here but in c++ you should not use them since they won t handle de constructors
from an interface design standpoint you want user-agents to make post and put and delete more difficult than get or at least distinctly different so that users can rely on that difference to hint when their actions might cause a change in the resource state because they are responsible for those changes
nginx is very fast much lighter than apache
also note that they are much slower than proper getter and setter
most likely sqlite3 needs to be upgrade to the most recent versioning which has a newer node-pre-gyp dependency which in turn should have its own updated dependencies to work properly with modern versioning of node
the octal encoding mechanism is less error-prone than hex so i ll demonstrate using octal
generally i ve read many time you should do ajax calls as get requests not post because post produces more overhead and traffic
there are multiple reasons why the swift code is slower than the objective-c code
regardless the irc protocol is more simplistic in nature can handle orders of magnitude more client connections than xmpp for the same memory utilization uses less bandwidth on the wire doesn t require authentication although you can add this feature etc
presumably you know that it is precisely that no node has more than one parent or more than two children
compilers are getting better with inlining the use of function pointers where the function is actually known but contemporary compilers certainly don t always inline-functions calls through function pointers even if all the context would be there
but in c++ std ostringstream is better and typesafe as joachim explained in his answer
i have a button that is bottom constrained to the bottom of the imageview however should be top constrained to the bottom of the subtitle textview if subtitletextview is taller than imageview
from what i ve noticed lately using case with aggregates min or max performs better than pivot although not as pretty
warning you are using requests versioning which is older than requests-oauthlib expects please upgrade to 2.0.0 or later
it is more intuitive for than vim or emacs for the beginners
on the other hand swift is easier to learn especially if you have objective-c background so it can be adopted during the time slowly and paralelly with using objective-c
myisam is actually better than innodb for spatial data btw because it also supports r-tree spatial indexes but not as powerful queries as postgis. if you just need points though innodb or myisam b-trees are adequate
stephen string search or a compiled dfa you can construct them from an nfa which is easier to make
using the same data google-chrome does in less than 5 seconds what took ie and firefox 10 to 15 seconds to accomplish
if we use hex because it s a simplification of binary that makes things easier on the programmer is easier to read than binary and carries more data etc. why do we not jump to the next logical step base64
depends i came from php4 and didn t really touch the level of oop needed for the php5 kohana framework i ve used classes and functions but the hmvc is a process on it s own to learn when it comes to kohana vs yii i d have to say kohana is easier to pickup
post would spring to mind but i think get is a more appropriate method because 99 of the time you only supply a bunch of parameters to these types of actions
basically while sending udp packets larger than mtu ip fragmentation can occur if it s supported on your platform but not all platforms support it
i read in some blog that orientdb performs at least as good if not better than neo4j while also offering more complex types like mongodb would
i explored itext and chose it over pdfbox it is perhaps 2-3 times faster than pdfbox and adding page is implicit and automatic
in this case i converted the cvs to svn and found the file size on the hard drive it was on my own laptop at the time but it was much smaller in svn than in cvs but there could have been some compression applied i dont know but everything on the web said svn would actually be bigger than cvs
cloudpickle might be a good idea for your problem as well it has better support in pickling objects than pickle not per see better than dill and you can pickle code easily as well
it is a great tool if you want to use git as frontend for an existing svn server but for one-time conversions you should not use git-svn but svn2git which is much more suited for this use-case
you linked to a question about a war vs a jar while spring boot s jar is indeed a jar it contains more than what you usually put inside a jar
for time measurements use google s cpu profiler it gives way better results than gprof
generally speaking udp has less overhead than tcp allowing you to receive more data but this is not a strict rule and is almost negligible in this context
in the case of core data running with a local sqlite store your predicates and sort descriptors get turned into a sql query so there s no need to instantiate and work with objects Ã¢ the sorting and filtering happens much more efficiently on the backend and constructing objects is necessary only for the results
mergesort is slightly slower than quicksort but it does not have quicksort s susceptibility to pathological cases
isnull will be faster i think because it has lesser function code implementation for itself making it faster than coalesce
according to my experience yii is easy to use but it has some pros and cons too every framework has but i used laravel on some projects and i think laravel is much more better than yii
nginx is typically faster than apache but with a low request server it hardly matters
perforce offers more advanced branching and merging capabilities than svn
this is apparently no accident if these are left out of underscore.js lodash composability is better than features
i m working in matlab in which nested for-loop is used to collect data and store in cell arrays however i want to collect data and the inner loops is collect further in the same cell arrays according to its position
there are several q a for why is innodb much slower than myisam but i could not find any topic for the opposite
you can also check out the open-source miglayout which is much more convenient that gridbaglayout and also a bit more powerful
to send large blocks of data via udp you need to chop them up into pieces smaller than the mtu for the network segment across which you re transmitting them
note also that in general it is best to follow the pattern of reloading pages with get after post which makes you less susceptible to form resubmitions in which case using sessions for storage is the better solution
the questions should i use for-loop or is it better to do it recursively next insert will be called after previous is done should i check if saved.length datalength and then return the arrays or is there some better way how to do it
miglayout works similarly to gridbaglayout but is more powerful and more expressive
other options to check are relaxng which is more flexible and powerful than xml schema or schematron which allows for exactly this sort of validation that needs to go deeper than structure and simple type-checks
if you insist on having the data in 2 arrays it is easier to iterate the arrays using a for-loop with an index instead of a foreach loops
union all is faster than union distinct
looking at the implementation of equals and compareto in java.lang.string on grepcode we can easily see that equals is better if we are just concerned with the equality of two strings
if your array s retaincount is greater than 1 at the start of dealloc some other object is retaining it at least temporarily
isnull is better then coalesce because of how datatypes are handled
my lwip can send udp packets to pc but my pc would fail to reassemble when the udp packets are larger than mtu
for the division-to-multiplication case you are assuming that multiplication is faster than division
you can build apps a lot quicker with yii due to the code-gen and active record but it will be a bit harder to learn than codeigniter
if we try to uninstaller or repair it it would show the install welcome screen and if we go further it would end up with our install condition failures because required prerequisites software is no more there
i know this question is a bit older but in es2015 there is a new data structure called map that is much more similar to a dictionary that you would use in c#
quicksort is approximately 40 faster than mergesort on random data because of fewer data movements
though similar in ui and ux sublimetext performs significantly better than atom-editor especially in heavy lifting like working with large files complex snr or plugins that do heavy processing on files buffers
i use both gentoo and ubuntu and i see that emerge the package manager of gentoo has a higher readability than apt-get aptitude just because it uses way much more color output than the latter
i currently have myisam and i would like to stay with it because it had far better performance than innodb in my case but i heard that innodb has acid transactions
if you are looking for something not as complex as axure justinmind but more powerful than moqups balsamiq you could also consider infragisticsÃ¢ indigo studio which can import static mockups from balsamiq and make them interactive and protoshare
just copy the content of your code in doget to dopost it should work or else set form method get but in case of password validation post is better and write your code for validation in dopost
this is because your ubuntu system has newer system libraries than your centos one
in reality the inline keyword has less to do with inlining code and more to do with allowing legal violation of the one definition rule
if the subclassing is more specific then it might fill in all by 2 of the arguments to its superclass __init__ method
you can also try a quadtree it has some better perfomance over a r-tree
memmove on the laptop runs slower than memcpy but oddly enough runs at the same speed as the memmove on the server
rewriting the while loops as a for-loop is nicer and makes it less likely to get an infinite loops
i have successfully set up vvv on virtualbox in the past but i ve been told vmware is much faster
which of the two consumes more memory is not defined and depends on the input sequence to be sorted as well as on algorithm tuning parameters see the comments to one of the answers to why quicksort is more popular than radix-sort
in some applications tcp is faster better throughput than udp
also remember that dns requests can use tcp if the request or response would need more than 1 udp packet
you want to make sure the code will work when users upgrade more than 1 versioning and that the update statement only runs the one upgrade it is needed
you ll probably need to get data anyway so the unique salt is probably faster too because you won t need to calculate the hash over username
for example if you want to implement an equivalent of std map it would be a pain to do it with a red-black tree but a skip-lists is much more manageable
both comparable and comparator work for you but i suggest comparator because it doesn t require you modify person class you only need the write an implementation class based on the sorting attribute therefore comparator is much more flexiable
construct java.util.calendar is comparative slower than java.util.date
also your get_int would be better written with fgets or getline if available and strtol
lxml will let you use xpath here which i think will be less painful than beautifulsoup s interface
the situation is critical if on some platform libtiff provides a narrower functionality and does not link to libjpeg which will not be available on that platform at all so the above command for linking will fail due to unsatisfied library dependency
and dbcontext is much simpler to use than objectcontext and will serve the most common development needs
i know firefox google-chrome provide svg support and i have the feeling that google-chrome is faster at rendering but maybe there are other standalone svg renderers that i m missing
for static file serving i found nginx performance lot faster than apache
nginx is more picky about case of file names than apache
as an added answer there is also the aggregate-functions which is more general than sum
apache made a claim that apache 2.4 will offer performance as good or better than nginx
openrasta is much more mature than wcf web api
as mentioned by ifloop this would be running a cpython c extension module on pypy which often works not always but is slower than on cpython
transcendental functions are always much more slower than addition or multiplication and a well-known bottleneck
characters post is more robust and secure than get
it s a shame postgresql isn t more popular than mysql since it supports exactly this feature out-of-the-box you d only have to share one sequence object between tables.
also note that for form submission it is typically better to use the onsubmit event as opposed to the onclick event since forms can technically be submitted by hitting the enter key as well as clicking the submit button
as accuracy goes i ve noticed that for directions here in north carolina mapquest is slightly more accurate
however when i run my program on windows 8 dev preview it always pop-up dialog that asks user to enable .net 3.51
i ve been using images to store data since editing binary data through paint.net is much friendlier than most hex editors
so my question is how do i determine what the last modified file is from more than one directory actually need it for four different folder
even if all the traffic resides on the same network the client traffic will have been throttled by your wan capacity which is always less than your lan capacity
for batch puts it s better if you construct a list of puts and then call because it uses a single rpc call to commit the batch but depending on the size of the list write buffer may fflush it all or not
first vb.net can be used to perform this xslt transformation which is really simple as you said just applying the xslt stylesheet at server-side if it is considered better than at client-side or even just sending the processing instruction for that to the browser
be aware that there is more than just powerpc and i386 although these are the safest architectures to choose for a universal binary
does this mean that the old adagio about jruby being faster than mri ruby is gone
i know that probably issuing dotnetfx45_full_setup.exe q will have no bad effect if installing on a system that already has versioning 4.5 but i still would like to not install the upgrade if the upgrade already exists faster and less problems
if you do not implement gethashcode union will call equals which will work but is slower than gethashcode
with innodb there is less time lost from table locking while myisam is faster in table readings
a database using a separate server to manage multiple clients such as mysql or postgresql is a better choice if performance is an issue
i think mouseenter mouseleave is better than hover
strncmp is a little bit safer than strcmp because you specify how many comparisons will be made at most
hammer.js is a more full-featured touch library has many swipe commands than fastclick.js most upvoted answer
swift s compiler is also doing a lot more than objective-c s compiler considering swift is more strongly typed and does not required specifying imports among other things
innodb when tuned well performs better than myisam
if too much memory is consumed it might swap to disk which is slower than ram
mayavi has more options for moving the camera than matplotlib but it doesn t seem to have a way to rotate around the y axis so i m guessing i ll need to perform some complex calculations on the azimuth and elevation to achieve the same result - but i m at a loss as to where to start i m new to working in 3d space and my brain doesn t think that way yet
there is a certain irony here given that within xslt push stylesheets are generally more idiomatic than pull stylesheets
running the same test on linux with gcc similarly pegs int and long as similar and both faster than chars although the difference is less pronounced
ping is just low level icmp protocol defined in internet layer whereas tcp is more complex protocol defined in transport layer
you need to error check strtol and ensure there are as many passed before using them -- strtol is better than atoi as helps detect errors
but since ntlm is less secure than kerberos why isn t it the other way around
you will need about six times less disk space to store and memory to process your dataset compared to innodb or about 2-3 times less than archived myisam
i resolved the problem the point is that a pkcs#12 file as a pfx contains more then 1 certificate so it must be loaded in this way
then you use it as seed in random which is less good that one is a non-cryptographic prng and its output may exhibit some structure which will not register in a statistical measurement tool but might be exploited by an intelligent attacker
a uiview is no more than a wrapper for an underlying calayer
it turns out that if comparisons are cheap mergesort tends to run a little faster because quicksort spends more time fiddling with pointers
web2py has more focus on simple is better than complex but django has more focus on explicit is better than implicit
cssviewer a firefox google-chrome extension is way faster for checking font sizes and other typographical properties like font weights and line heights also color on elements one after another than devtools inspect
mysql is more preferred db choise for symfony projects symfony mysql symfony postgresql so choosing postgresql is a rare decision and maybe there are some pitfalls those we have to consider
i know that when it does the whole configuration settings are representing a much smaller screens than the tablet s screens but how can i tell if this is a regular phone device with a small screens or a tablet running compatibility zoom mode
in 6.7 a graph it shown that states that the performance of a objectcontext linq query is better than dbcontext linq query
you d be better off with memcpy which is probably close to what your compiler gives you for free if you just write the class the normal naive way with no std array and no pointer gymnastics
speed isn t important here but in other applications it is good to know that regexes are very fast 100 times faster than lxml and 1000 faster than beautifulsoup
use firefox rather than google-chrome - google-chrome with dev mode is much slower than firefox
may be postgresql takes less time than mysql
an incredibly rough eye balling of the numbers they posted showed bazaar to be 2-4x slower than either git or mercurial in the use cases tested
is there any situation where using charfields along the django choices is a better option than using boolean int smallintegerfield
webstorm + pycharm + rubymine + phpstorm though to be fair rubymine has more features than radrails atm
i think ie uses bigger font than firefox or google-chrome by default
as far as when awt may be more useful than swing -
actually your code doesn t work on firefox because he is less forgiving than google-chrome about errors
imho loops looks better with a for-loop iterating in the right direction
getline is far more flexible handling the allocation of space for you with fgets it is up to you
firstly while a for-loop is not wrong here a for each loops is more appropriate
if noop a put may make more sense than a post which would imply creating a second connection
direct2d is more or less dead nowadays and one would use direct3d also to render 2d
as others have said illegalargumentexception is an option but i think nullpointerexception is more communicative
the good thing about this macro is that it should work with c89 and c99 compilers 1ll can be replaced with 1l and long long can be replaced with just long and ll with l of course if your c89 compiler does not have the extended long long type from c99 and it also correctly supports types smaller than int chars and short
nobody has ever accused git of being easy-to-use no tortoisegit for example although i hear it s coming so you might be better off with svn beanstalk
so for such an application is it will innodb be a better choice over myisam
probably using a jlist or a jtable is a better choice than display records using text fields

tcl is no better nor worse than perl ruby python or any other scripting language in this regard -- they all do basic file operations with equal aplomb
no hate against gson but in my experience jackson has been more featureful and the lead dev is very good about addressing bugs feature requests
i did some research and found that udp may be more suitable in this case because udp hole punching works much better than tcp hole punching
coalesce is the more standard alternative of isnull
if you care about your user s passwords at all use something more complicated than md5 and ideally you should have a salt string of some form
you can use treemap instead of linkedhashmap because you dont want to retain the order of insertion and for sorting treemap is better choice
i really like postgresql s indexes which are far better than mysql s
the question is avx scalar is 2.7x faster than sse when i vectorized it the speed up is 3x matrix size is 128x128 for this question
performance is browser and device dependent for example firefox handles objects better than arrays while google-chrome prefers arrays
imho any modern mvvm-framework like catel caliburn.micro mvvmlight reactiveui is much better than prism
i haven t tried coded or retrospectiva but i ve used both redmine and trac and in my opinion redmine is better because
so that the strncpy is more secure than strcpy
instead of mucking with httpd.conf you might get better results with .htaccess
is strcmp slower than strncmp as one can give pre-calculated string length to it but strcmp does not receive such information
this is a lot more pom.xml code but i like it better than the maven-shade-plugin because it does just what i want and nothing more
quick takeaway of the benchmark jackson performs 5 to 6 times better than org.json and more than twice better than gson
no guarantee but it s rather likely. in your case it s even more likely as linux freebsd and os x are all posix-compatible
this python3 cgi https server used to work a few weeks or months ago but now no longer works under linux ubuntu
if you have access to memcached or apc on your webhost some shared plans disable this functionality look them up as they are considered fairly high-performance forms of caching as it utilizes the system memory directly memcached is more suited for distributed systems
list comprehensions are preferred over for loops but they essentially do the same thing if a for-loop is more understandable you can break the expression above to a for-loop it looks like this
webclient has a much simpler interface than httpwebrequest and takes care of reading and writing from the streams for you
i read about python following pemdas that is precedence of multiplying is more than division
beautifulsoup is a python package that parses broken html while lxml does so faster but with high quality html xml
if your service already has an rss feed things are even easier with the rss reader integrated in the buzzbox api
you probably don t want to go back to anything earlier than delphi 3 but some pascal programming books can be helpful
or if you re really focused on only doing opengl i may suggest using glfw which is the better glut but you ll have to draw the menus yourself using opengl
then instead of using datainput outputstream you should use an objectoutput inputstream makes it easier in my opinion
html5lib parser does a better job than lxml or html.parser handling the debate element in this case
you need to control many logging configurations i think the logging agent on ubuntu debian is better choice
im new to swift but i like it more than objective-c as it looks a bit like java does to me from syntax wise compared to objective-c
nevertheless i need a dynamic list for my loops with nested loops which is processed more than 500 times and multiple if-statement therefore the arraylist
you ll want to have multiple radio button each with it s own value to set some property to although this is weird for a yes no you are better off with a checkbox but if you had multiple values this is how radio button work
if i m not mistaken when capistrano makes the current folder it is actually a shortcut for lack of a better term to the most recent release perhaps symlinked directory is better
is it possible that the division is six times slower than multiplication and
the swift compiler is doing a lot more and is quite a bit newer than the objective-c compiler so it unlikely it will be as stable fast for quite some time
building on the previous good answers stringwriter is actually much more versatile than stringbuilder providing lots of overloads
this code is more for an example and in this example below it is checking to see if the versioning of notepad.exe needs to be upgrade that means the versioning stored in the property table value notepad_verson is greater than the versioning of notepad.exe on the system
the comment of hanky that linked to myisam versus innodb tells you more about the differences
as one good programmer can be more productive than two average programmers i vaguely remember an old ibm study concluding someone in the top percentile was 27x more productive than median it s useful to see the same programmers doing it both ways
regarding comparison between gridview and listview my experience is that listview is more lightweight as compared to gridview
since the filesystems is more than likely fat or fat32 protecting it permission based way would be more convoluted
the x86_64 64bit platform is much more than twice the width of the x86 32-bit
although firefox is a better browser for developers than google-chrome cause it gives you more tools to work with
on the other hand the secure tunnel created in a vpn is far more secure than remote desktop
craig wrote the removedata is just a hack to allow more than one qtip to be bound to a single element at any one time hence allowing multiple jgrowl s
postgresql is a little more strict than mysql about type conversion and does not let you implicitly cast convert between numbers and strings
calling suppressfinalize on an object implementing a finalizer does nothing more than set a bit in the objects header which the runtime checks when calling finalizer which will suppress your finalizer from running
i m using xamarin.android to write c# but the native java rsa key generator is much faster than the mono one
or you could do it in a way more readable fashion with rvest which ultimately uses rcurl and css selectors
on the downside pdfbox is less mature than itext so it has less features and documentation available
that doesn t cover some of the more fundamental problems with maven such as its namespaces breaking java namespaces and xml namespaces it s build unit the pom.xml having no relation to anything in the actual deployment environment think about it when you separate via poms what are you actually accomplishing in the finished product
in it developers seem to agree that grouplayout is a more effective replacement of springlayout
i have tried to put my imageview in a linearlayout and put a weight on it but if my imageview is smaller i have a blank between the imageview and the textview
get is better for some cases but it seems to me you should use post instead
in .net they have a little bit weird names whereas in scala they have the same standard names they have in other languages select is map aggregate is reduce or fold selectmany is flatmap where is filter or withfilter orderby is sort or sortby or sortwith and there are zip take and takewhile and so on
swing is better and few people remember how to use awt components
post explaining why spi is faster than i2c
and im not shure about this statement javascript likes settimeout more than setinterval which gives a little performance boost
the style was common in vb6 with optional parameters but imho and according to microsoft in vb.net overloading is usually more elegant than optional parameters
if you need the result as a string you can use the absolutestring method of nsurl it s typically better to use nsurl instead of nsstring for urls though
t s purpose is to test the thesis developed by steele and sussman in their series of papers about scheme that scheme may be used as the basis for a practical programming language of exceptional expressive power and that implementations of scheme could perform better than other lisp systems and competitively with implementations of programming languages such as c and bliss which are usually considered to be inherently more efficient than lisp on conventional machine architectures
the normal for-loop is useful when you don t want to visit every element in the arrays or if you have more than one loops variable
also google-chrome has a great tool that allows you to edit css on the fly which i find more useful and quicker than using firefox s extensions
an interpreted-language will typically run one to two orders of magnitude slower than a compiled-language
i understand redmine is more of a trac clone but retrospectiva seem to support agile methodologies via a nice plugin
the above works deleting .bak files older than 7 days in those folder my question is how can i reverse that and delete .bak files in every other directory that s older than 3 days without deleting the ones kept from the first query
unicorn does not use less memory than passenger
there is the mono project that aims to allow .net code to run on mac and linux but between the two delphi being pascal is somewhat more portable
so your for-loop will complete before any of the timeouts run and before any of the ajax success callbacks run and all of the timeouts are scheduled to run 2000 milliseconds after loops finishes more or less at the same time
it s can be done in both server-side and client-side but in server-side there s more benefits like database searching before parsing page html and testing routines
i am using postgresql btw which can do more than mysql incase that changes things
as in title why is multiplication much faster than subtraction in this example
use an in-memory dataset clientdataset as teran suggested in the question comment thread you can still present your large data to a tstringgrid if using it is compulsory but a tdbgrid is more appropriate
for all the reasons linked in the comment and elsewhere svn tends to be a much better enviroment than cvs or vss unless you have some weird requirements - so if you can successfully import your history and save the company money i wouldn t see why the bosses wouldn t go for it
your listview item s height is looking bigger because your are applying 17dp padding and 4dp margin at the top and 7dp padding and 4dp margin at the bottom of the textview ...so its taking total 32dp extra space excluding your textview
microchip is more successful in industry and has better tools than avr
even if there are no inherited enumerable properties it is still more work to do than not
i feel like the getter setter example is more clear and hides the implementation details of what name and description are
since cakephp seems to be much lighter than zend-framework i would suggest that you take a look at cakephp
compared to a non worker version in google-chrome my benchmark is somewhat slower in firefox it is much slower
nginx Ã¢ without any optimizations done Ã¢ is much faster than apache
i read that flask for beginner is better than django because educational reasons at the same time django have django oscar
is nginx + php-fpm is suppose to do server operations much faster than apache + mod-php due to efficient usage of memory and other resources
it seems that settimeout has bigger priority than setinterval which could be delayed
it seems mysql is more forgiving with this than postgresql but in every case you use a reserved word you should escape it
cut and paste in vim takes more steps than in emacs iirc
don t use getimagedata putimagedata for clipping since drawimage is easier and faster.
and even though everybody says ruby is slow buildr was 2-6x faster than maven
keep in mind that using setinterval is less efficient for this case then using settimeout which doesn t require comparing times at all as it schedules the alarm to occur at a particular time as setinterval will use more processor cycles to both schedule a check and then to compare the times
that would mean i d need to do a post rather than a get though get makes more sense when i m just getting some static data right
vim is more powerful and textmate is worth the price tag
properties specially automatic properties in .net 3.5 are more concise than setter getter and less lines of code less code to maintain less bugs
at the time this was faster because addition was a lot faster than multiplication but that s no longer the case
some user-controls s are larger than the tabcontrol and got clipped so i modified its template by wrapping the contentpresenter in a scrollviewer with horizontalscrollbarvisibility and verticalscrollbarvisibility set to auto
python respects this definition whereas in most other programming language the modulo is really more like a reaminder after division operator
the quanteda package is faster and more straightforward than tm and works nicely with tidytext as well
what are your strategies best practices when it comes to dealing with a reasonably sized sql server database anything larger than northwind or adventureworks - do you use multiple filegroups
this approach will radically reduce heap space usage - disk space is cheaper then ram too
use myisam usually much faster than innodb if your data base isnt transaction oriented
i already know that ember.js is a more heavy weight approach in contrast to backbone.js
occasionally the stdout needs more than a write method fflush is another common one which stringio will handle
i want to add a calayer inside an uiview and this calayer will be smaller than the uiview
i suspect your curly braces aren t in the correct place as per scheff s comment the scope of the page variable is contained within the for-loop and you are attempting to do more operations after loops is over
sometimes a linux distribution contains far more than an operating system but is informally referred to by a single name such as ubuntu and so the line between what the operating system is the linux kernel and standard libraries perhaps and the applications that merely ship with that operating system the gnome and kde environments on linux is pretty gray
on your screenshot div width in opera is bigger than in firefox and google-chrome
since bit wise operations can be done very fast and division operations are relatively slow this type of modulo is much faster than doing a division
another reason to choose nvidia is because that s what the hpc system builders have been building systems with since nvidia made a huge push for gpgpu computing where as it s less backed by amd ati
in addition jemalloc tries to optimise for cache locality since the act of fetching data from ram is much slower than using data already in the cpu caches no different in concept to the difference between fast fetching from ram versus slow fetching from disk
for example using renatoargh s test google-chrome is faster with option 2 firefox with option 1
if you absolutely must connect to a database hosted on the cellular network end i would suggest you try setting up a vpn openvpn is a good product available on many platforms or using a reverse tunnel it s simpler but you will need to setup the reverse tunnel everytime you want to access remote database
i know udp is faster than tcp for various reason
for example if you had a class in which it would make sense to do addition before multiplication how could you make the addition operator have higher precedence than the multiplication one
you could manage more than get or post like put delete...
edit based on the tests done by multiple people and by theory isnull seems to be a better option over coalesce
this also affects how it is stored which leads to myisam being slower than innodb on insert due to myisam requiring a full index re-write on every insertion
it is entirely possible that in most implementations the cost of a memmove function call will not be significantly greater than memcpy in any scenario in which the behavior of both is defined
also very particular that this should be done on centos or amazon linux which makes things worse for me as i have been on ubuntu for long
so turning a non-vr game into a vr game that doesn t make you sick will unfortunately take more than mouse keyboard emulation
i admit javascript isn t my strong point and have a much easier time with objective-c and swift
my friend used beyondcompare however i am more comfortable with winmerge
skipping a simple type like boolean or int is easier since you can just call readboolean or readinteger without bothering with the readlist functions
into swing application i like to avoid using it with swt but is its more easier its ok
datamapper idea is definitely better than activerecord
can the geocode gem support more than one geocoding step
opted to use arduino from command line because it suited my needs so far i know avrdude and avr-gcc is a more complete or better way to compile upload from command line correct me if i m wrong
if a listview or gridview is a better approach i am open to that as well
in fact i think it is fair to say that bellman-ford is more similar to dijkstra because of its use of iterative relaxation
i haven t worked with awt much but swing is much better from the gui developer s point of view
ironpython has had more time to focus on performance improvements but ironruby has made significant performance improvements as of late
even though git-svn or the nirvdrum svn2git is easier to start with here are some further reasons why using the kde svn2git instead of git-svn is superior besides its flexibility
i ve found that bootcamp was slightly faster than vmware non bootcamp image but i still use vmware the majority of the time because i like using the host os for things like mail chat browsing
since the author of the specialized memory allocator has more knowledge on the size of the objects allocated from the pool and how those allocator occur the allocator can use the memory more efficiently than a general purpose allocator such as the one provided by the stl
in that sense reliable udp cannot be faster than tcp
if you used aes then you might see a better speedup over the des 3des observations
the nstextview process is much simpler as you only need to attach the nstextstorage object
however svn protocol is much faster so i suggest using collabnet svn for performance reasons
or whatever you branched from so the resulting history will appear i started from later version and the merge back will probably be fast-forward it s easier to work with especially since you are rewriting the actual history to logical changesets anyway
talk about sql server 2005 adventureworks is better than northwind
bazaar is a distributed version tool just like git but is imo simpler to setup and use
operations like prepend and insert are usually faster than with qvector because of the way qlist stores its items in memory see algorithmic complexity for details and its index-based api is more convenient than qlinkedlist s iterator-based api
ps you can also migrate to postgresql it s smarter than mysql when choosing right indexes
my understanding was it was written in vanilla python cpython but if you are more comfortable with ironpython it shouldn t be hard to translate
this is the one thing i think sublimetext does better than emacs
you used a older versioning of vagrant before 1.5 versioning and made an upgrade to vagrant greater than 1.5 versioning
in the previous example break is better than goto
the height of the blue bar in safari and google-chrome matches but in firefox it is smaller
it turns out i had a hard coded maximum index in my for-loop which was bigger than the arrays i was trying to assign to
redmine handles multiple projects and sub-projects right out of the box and overall seems nicer than trac
for comparison of strcpy and strncpy which is the safer alternative see their manual page
however you cannot do anything more than get the content -- you cannot add headers cannot use post
for example sometimes a for-loop is faster than the built-in arrays methods in some browsers
firefox can get away with more than google-chrome before aborting
you could use rsa but a symmetric algorithm like aes is faster if you can find a way to exchange keys in a secure way
try vtd-xml it is much faster than jdom upto 10x and dom4j or dom and also memory efficient
the solution has a modular design and better performance than ffmpeg or libav at the current time
lxml enables you to search for elements using xpath which i think is easier than using beautifulsoup s api
the wording in your question seems to suggest you don t care as much that the output is mips but rather you want the output to be less complex than x86
all of racket s languages can interoperate so your language of choice is up to you though the rnrs languages tend to go unused in the racket community #lang racket is much more useful for writing programs than any of the scheme implementations but they can be useful if you want to write programs that run on different scheme implementations
using the newer integration between clutter and cairo specifically the clutter.canvas this will draw a circle to the screen
for example you know foreach loops is heavy and if we use for-loop is better
but i guess google-chrome i have version 10 should be much faster than firefox 3.6
other than that accepting a get request might be - depending on the server side rest framework - slightly more light weight than post requests
edit taking into account what was said in the comments though it looks more secure and is recommended by w3 see touheed khan s answer post isn t more secure than get and as riggsfolly said
this is a use case where a for-loop is cleaner to use than a while loops
as gnibbler pointed out cpython is slower in the simple implementation but pypy is jit compiled for much faster code when you need it
when you know both objects are arrays method is a faster way to check equality than for-loop
udp is generally faster than tcp as it does not have to do the overhead checking of consistency that tcp must deal with
i like the auto-complete feature of pycharm but from my experience it is slower than spyder
i m using the module graphlab in my python script and many more such as pandas and numpy etc graphlab module only works on python2 not for python3
when touching the destination buffer of memcpy memset b2 0 buffersize... then the first run of memcpy is also faster
if the hot data won t fit in ram on either machine then disk i o performance becomes more important than ram mostly random read i o and the fsync flush rate
i need to make sure that each of these top mail directory sa44-3 is not larger then 8gb so the script should calculate the size of each top level folder and if its over 8gb create a new one called eg
i wonder if there are any optimizations something more efficient than memcmp memcpy maybe just using a for-loop or breaking it down to fast assembly instructions that can be done to this subroutine
i suspect that this may be the case because ie and google-chrome need to know about the content of the div earlier than firefox
angular is built around the belief that declarative code is better than imperative when it comes to building uis and wiring software components together.
if you want to get more out of infowindow and put html content in them i would recommend trying infobox
sometimes get is a better option in those read-only scenarios because it makes your url scheme richer and avoids these sort of post warnings
if you use twig which i like better than smarty - although i still prefer self-restraint+plain php most ide s that support django templating should work with it since the syntax is nearly the same
i have been reading about cakephp but it seems a bit more complicated than codeigniter
make sure you re using a source control system that supports branching and merging i ve had experience with perforce and svn and while perforce is better svn is free
each individual iteration of the code in the foreach loops takes less than a second per worker and looking at the outfile it s clear that processing stops within a minute of turning the monitors off no matter how many times it s been through either the foreach loops or the parent for-loop
however post is a bit more safe than get because get could be stored in the history
all-in all the reason is that nsmutablestring is able to do more things than nsstring and can do anything nsstring can hence the direction of inheritance
in the competing programming a lot of problems are never meant to be solved with cpython but with pypy which has a faster integer-arithmetic and a git-compiler but otherwise a python interpreter just as cpython
in addition another coworker said cvs was a lot more popular than svn
yes mod is more expensive than multiplication as it is implemented through division
i would suggest you start with scheme and more specifically with racket formerly plt scheme
memcached is faster than apc as zend_cache backend but you still need apc extension installed even in development mode to get a great speedup of your code
yes adding more code than getter and setter is fine in your domain objects
udp is more of a fire and forget whereas tcp maintains a connection state
textureview will display opengl-es rendering but is much more flexible than glsurfaceview and will follow the normal layout hierarchy in android which allows views to be moved on the display
in theory quicksort is worse than heapsort
you may also try to signal the same page about a valid log-in by sending some information to the same page using the post or get methods post is more secure but i don t recommend it for this purpose at all
then for class i ve used the addclass and removeclass is better then change it attributes
then you have to check that beta1 - beta2 alpha1 - alpha2 is greater than min x1_line1 x2_line1 and less than max x1_line1 x2_line1
pros of objects faster disk read is slower than ram lesser dependencies of the system s state
as last resort resolution i don t suggest this for security issues using ssl is always safer switch your registry to use http instead of https
cocos2d-x already works with marmalade so if you want to take your cocos2d game to ios android symbian webos bada rim qnx and more check out marmalade
when i evaluated monomac it was less mature than monobjc
myisam is much faster for reads but since it locks the whole table for writes this is where overall throughput drops compared with innodb
qstyleditemdelegate is newer and the qt documentation about qitemdelegate states that
for simple accessor like these properties syntax is better than methods
i m on a mac os x 10.8.2 running firefox 18.0.2 - it actually runs the game faster and smoother than my google-chrome 25.0.1364.99
if everything is correct why keras perform so much better than lasagne
innodb implements mvcc multi-versioning concurrency control so locking is much more complex than with myisam
i assume you re using linux or f# would be a much better choice than either ocaml or haskell
i am pretty sure it is not possible to compute polynomial division more efficient than multiplication and as you can see in the following table this algorithm is only 3 times slower than a single multiplication
it looks normal in google-chrome every column doesn t resize after updating whereas in firefox it gets smaller and smaller
memory is thousands of times faster than disk so if something gets read often having it in ram is drastically faster
using nginx rather than apache to server the images nginx generally works better to server static content such as this
google-chrome renders longer input fields than firefox and ie
if that is the case using periodic spline from mgcv gam is much better
it could be a sni problem if you use any kind of load balancer https proxy or more than 1 ssl certificate on the same ip
if blackberry device software versioning is higher than os 6 then continue the app otherwise prompt user dialog showing upgrade os first and exit the application
fast clicking on ie has slower response than firefox google-chrome and safari
the intuition is that division is a more costly affair than multiplication
is there any better algorithm than normal quicksort radix-sort for this problem
this does not happen in google-chrome or firefox and happens much less often locally where the response of the server is much quicker
if you need to do anything more complex than put file or get file take a look at edtftpj free
this is better than using a second view a bit larger as a calayer is lighter than a uiview and you don t have do modify the frame of myview which is good for instance if myview is a uiimageview
i rather prefer grep since it s much faster than comm and also does not require the input to be sorted
precedence rules specify priority of operators which operators will be evaluated first multiplication has higher precedence than addition pemdas
to wait effectively without spending any more resources cf 3.5 provides manualresetevent autoresetevent manualresetevent provides more control over the reset event and hence most recommended to be used
then when testing the password for correctness you hash it the same way and then compare the results -- sha1 is a common hash for this md5 is better than nothing
a solution i ve used is a simple subclass of uicontrol which allows more customization than subclassing uibutton and less hassle than nsattributedstring et al
std string using appropriate std string reserve has no reason to act slower than std ostringstream in this situation
you can t get more than 20 post if you are a sandbox user
if you have to do a lot of this honestly testng is more flexible but you can absolutely get it done in junit
locking unlocking in the getter setter is much safer you cannot forget to do it and more convenient the lock does not have to be directly accessable everywhere you use the property than an external lock on every property access
on a tablet i don t have this issue because the screens size is bigger and i make videoview always on screens
code upgrade require system downtime and if you have a large cluster that cannot run more than one versioning of code at once you ll need to take the entire cluster down at once
at least in firefox and safari it looks much better
they re much bigger than the uiview of which they are subviews
2 executemany is better than execute as it makes for you the prepare statement
if you have the ajax use get rather than post this is simpler then you can test the response by just viewing the page with the appropriate query string
stemming gives better performance than fuzzy search because it is done when indexing and the actual search can be performed as exact match
the waf benchmark has less of a pronounced difference in performance and i d guess that the answer would be more complicated some factors pypy does better some factors cpython does better and overall cpython comes out slightly ahead
jogl is more java-like whereas lwjgl provides more gaming functionality on top of opengl access
nosql solutions are better than mysql postgresql and other rdbms techs for this task
as such creating a radio button rather than checkbox is a better solution
i guess one of them is that the push model is less coupled then the pull model
i suggest postgresql it s more capable has more features and better support for complex queries and datatypes than mysql and has a lot of tuning options
a requirement that the constructor in the superclass runs before any code in the constructor of the subclassing keeps things simpler
there is a firebug version available for google-chrome firebug lite but the firefox version is much better and i d highly recommend you at least try it out
so you can access the arrays at any index between the range of 0 and array.length - 1 alas if you wanted to use a for in loops to iterate over an arrays you certainly can however a regular for-loop is more appropriate
which will never be true have in mind that the and-operator binds stronger than the or-operator
for me they serve pretty same purpose to hide complexity except accordion is imho better for continuous-reading it s easier to quickly go to next section while tabs seems to be more random-access
a last suggestion is to convert your db from myisam to innodb but i think this requires some investigation because it not always the case that innodb is faster
i m not too eager for using swt though since i m more familiar with swing
sure that s probably compiled or jit d away but you should avoid division in performance critical code it s far slower than multiplying
128bit transactions tend to be faster than 64bit which tend to be faster than 32 bit
also it does appear that firefox consistently handles this better than ie or google-chrome
after several tests i found out that my heapsort is way quicker than quicksort i think it should be the other way around my selection sort is also faster than insertion sort
recompiling ubuntu kernels is harder -- it will require working with debian build tools
going to go ahead and say that gson is a lot more user friendly albeit less powerful than jackson
the distinction between int64 and int32 in mongodb is more about bson storage size
as you can see defining a singleton class in swift is much easier than in objective-c
also we see hadoop s sqoop is much faster than spark for this part but it writes to hdfs which will needs a lot of work to be converted to dataset for spark uses
it s the only conceptual modeling tool available for relational data the others - erwin and its ilk - being at best logical modeling tools with nothing much better than entity-relationship diagram and ddl synchrnoization which are also provided by object role modeling tools
b magma runs always slower than lapack sequential around 10 times slower
entity framework s iqueryable implementation is more picky about creating new objects in objects than regular linq to objects ienumerable
as you can see just doing the multiplication is many many times slower than add or subtract
can someone please help to how use that script using the pypy as i heard it is much faster than cpython
and regarding your first question it is definitely possible to encrypt decrypt messages directly using rsa there are only technical and performance reasons aes is much faster than rsa why rsa is used only to encrypt a session key and aes is used to encrypt decrypt the messages themselves
also i think the webclient class is more idiomatic these days than hand rolling httpwebrequest
getline is probably better than getchar in most cases
xquery works better than xslt for this because it s more amenable to static analysis as it lacks the polymorphism of xslt s template rules
glassfish however performs better than jboss and has a very slick gui-based admin console whereas jboss can only be administrated with a command line
here my problem is date input field in aligning correctly in firefox but in google-chrome it is displaying bigger than all other text boxes
the usual wait time of the post is not too long not too larger than get so i don t think that should be an issue and post always gets back with a 200
of course there are many things that make life easier with getter and setter pattern like hibernate that creates proxies on entities
however when it comes to error reporting on failed cron jobs that takes some more advanced know-how in the nix space which maybe you aren t interested in tackling at this time
in general i have found google-chrome to be more finnicky than firefox
i ve used both db systems before and while postgresql is great for it s licensing terms and standards compliance mysql is definitely easier to get up and running quickly
client-side validation is more responsive to the user but always back it up with proper server-side checks
gsl can do fft s but fftw is better at doing that
folder objects undoubtedly give the fullest access to file information but the older dir function is easier to use and allows specification of a filename template so i have used that
you can use alpine linux docker image it is very light and is better than both ubuntu and centos image to be used as the docker
then for reading i find textscan to be more powerful than fread fscanf the differences between them all are summarized here
google-chrome can read lots of locale-specific date time formats but firefox is pickier
this is usually seen in dynamic interpreted-language but is less common in compiled-language
unless it s a usb keyboard mouse and 8042 emulation is disabled where you would need a usb stack but you can use the boot protocol for the keyboard mouse which is simpler
fdo provides those features too interestingly thanks to integration with gdal ogr in some places like fdo provider for gdal but it feels more like a framework whereas gdal ogr feels more like a library
granted fat is an easier problem but they claim to support many filesystems and it would be my first choice
if you need something a little more robust go with ember.js or backbone.js
also you can determine if someone is submitting a form or getting the form by checking if _server request_method post which is cleaner than using a get url parameter though i guess there s nothing wrong with the other approach...
problably the problem is that mousemove event may fire earlier than mouseenter in some cases
while boost is more modern c++ it also harder to use for non trivial tasks - and without a modern c++ experience and deep stl knowledge it is difficult to use correctly
all this will be much easier with yeoman 1.0 which will be more customizable and will let you use whatever gruntjs tasks you want
qwindow is more low level than qwidget
it s not my experience that nsurlsession is any slower than nsurlconnection is
sorting in java is a little bit more work than in sql on the other hand filtering is more versatile when implemented in java
if you use older version of gcc compiler or if your code under tests runs on vxworks or vxsim you might have a better chance with cppunit than googletest framework
sorteddictionary has faster insertion and removal operations for unsorted data o logn as opposed to o n for sortedlist
graphicsmagick is not that much faster -- and the outputted file sizes are significantly higher than imagemagick
but the for-loop is not reading writing the last part of the parent file which is less than the arrays size
on price and support alone then nexus pro makes sense until you get to 67 users at which point artifactory becomes the cheaper option
btw - i went back and did the upgrade again with bigger jumps between versioning actually ran the site after each upgrade and it went perfectly
sha1 is better than md5 because it is a longer hash so can accept more values without collisions although collisions are still possible
stringr provides more human-readable wrappers around the base r functions though as of dec 2014 the development version has a branch built on top of stringi mentioned below
google-chrome shows weird error but firefox shows more specific issue
how does free know how much memory to be free d which was earlier allocated by malloc or calloc
if they are going to use any non-maven way to retrieve them ui rest scripts ant gradle then you can go with any path and name you like and you ll get full support from artifactory uploading searching etc. with nexus which is much more maven-centric you ll better stick to maven notation
watch out you can t query a superclass if you have more than 1 subclassing then something like in jql
if the worker processes do other things than just calulations read from or write to disk they will have to wait a lot since a disk is a lot slower than ram
if i create the same cclabelttf once then i can t add it to more than one ccmenuitem because it will give runtime error about label already added
emacs is more powerful than vim it s scripting engine is far more flexible and there are far more scripts modes and the likes built around emacs
realloc is worse than malloc in that you will need to have the old and new pointers valid during the realloc
any one of the reverse proxy systems can likely do this nginx is popular too and generally has easier configuration than apache but i ve never used it with https
i m trying to get deeper with post and pre incrementors but am a bit stuck with the following expression
i want to removeclass when scrolltop is more then 200px
take a look at mouseenter and mouseleave events they are better than mousemove and mouseenter combinations
to say directx is faster than gdi is also something of a simplification - wpf and gdi-based rendering technologies just have different performance characteristics
sometimes i got asked on some interviews what benefits does innodb have against myisam and when myisam is better than innodb
you can simulate an anchor using css cursor pointer and events like mouseenter and mouseleave which is more work but does not break the expected behavior of an anchor tag
here is a simple performance test showing that in google-chrome filling is faster than clearing i am not sure what goes on with google-chrome and canvas nowadays but in firefox clearing is many times faster than filling both significantly faster than google-chrome
from the wildfly console i understand that the undertow subsystem is receiving more or less 20 requests per second and using the application in chrome i see the requests pending for more than 30 seconds
for example it looks like unicorn is a better choice on heroku than puma
more generally sml tends to be rather more elegant while ocaml has some more advanced features quirks and users
i will say that nginx tends to handle heavier loads better than apache though so take a look at that
to answer the real question why is myisam slower than innodb i can t give an authoritative answer
settimeout is used in lieu of setinterval which is more cumbersome when it comes to killing the cycle
i m not aware of any architecture where --counter or counter-- asssuming we re talking about simple datatypes like int chars etc is slower than ++counter or counter++
you could argue that the struts style is simpler and you can do it in wicket too it just isn t optimal but keeping the state only in the server has many advantages
i am aware that postgresql interpretation of the sql standard is stricter than mysql and that consequently this type of query won t work...and have read a number of posts on stackoverflow and elsewhere on the subject - but none of them seem to be the definitive answer on this subject
in this respect ubuntu is less desirable on a server than rhel or centos which stick to more mature versions
g_new and g_new0 both take the same arguments unlike malloc that takes less arguments than calloc
sortedlist tkey tvalue uses less memory than sorteddictionary tkey
i know postgresql could be considered more mature than mysql with regards to locking thanks to mvcc - can i use row-locking or some other feature in postgresql instead of the token field
note however that for high traffic websites we do modify the joomla core and we also switch the tables from innodb to myisam regardless what others might think here myisam is much faster than innodb
imho wordpress is better do work and customize than joomla
myisam is better than innodb when you don t need those advanced features and storage speed is more important than other concerns
gecko is often considered to consume less memory than webkit but this depends a lot on how the browser is implemented
although an enhanced for-loop on a string arrays is much faster than it is on an more on that below the .tostring .split overhead would appear to still dominate and make that version slower than the arraylist version
important note placing these calls in viewwillappear and viewwilldisappear instead of viewdidload makes this easier to handle as it will work reliably even for multiple pushes and pops of the same view controller and you won t have to clean up after it in the previous view controller
with django it is easy to use postgresql instead of mysql so i tried it with the same query and same data in db postgresql is much faster that mysql x10 more faster while using inner join analyse shows it uses indexes unlike mysql
elapsed time is generally higher than cpu time with the exception of a multi processors environment
in my understanding repeater is most suitable since it faster than gridview
you could always use https that will work both on http and https websites but loading a https resource is slower than loading a http resource because of the encryption and ssl handshakes
the package is bigger than udp s package but smaller than tcp s package
and a thing about codeigniter i asked some time ago people about it and most says that kohana based on codeigniter is better
so md5 + strong password + average salt is better than usual password + phpass
however that is much worse by a factors of 10000 than what i am currently doing which is for matrix x for putting and x.getrow idx .todense for taking
this makes firefox 50x faster than google-chrome and 70x faster than safari is there any known reason for that
owl is a more advanced language than rdf
with 0.13 m2e this no longer works as the maven builder appears to put things in target your-artificat-version-snapshot web-inf classes
note that udp is more difficult to work with than tcp because packets are not always guaranteed to be delivered
nobody uses awt anymore because swing is much better
i know i2c is more complex slow than spi uart etc. but it s a constrain
i totally understand the error and assume that the mysql implementation is less sql conform than the postgresql implementation
you use pickle might fail dill is more stable
the only way to copy arrays that is more efficient than for-loop coding is system.arraycopy
while i personally think maven is a better tool than ant in the long run our experience will make maven3 a better tool than maven2
if you are running that versioning or higher or after you upgrade follow these steps
using macports or homebrew this is rather simpler
i know that addition operation is more trivial than multiplication operation
now there are some implementations like pypy rpython which run a static-typing phase and should favor much better than cpython here
we could check that void mymethod int i is more specific than void mymethod double a if any invocation handled by the first method can be passed on to the other one without a compile-time type error
ram is a lot faster than disk
by using a salt value typically you want this to be a random number the hash won t match the dictionary the chance of them pre-calculating all passwords with all possible salt values is exponentially more difficult
note that for more complex builds a java build solution like ant or maven is probably more effective
less is a css extension that enables reuse and encapsulation of values color values for instance improves inherited allows a better nesting of related properties and operations also
because hql is more or less superset of jpql it of course works also in hql
bazaar is imho easier to learn than git
section 4.13 of better builds with maven describes using cargo to deploy a war specified using maven coordinates but that s serious overkill given that we re using jetty
if the message you re encrypting is large enough not only will it take more time to process but the rsa encrypted message might be larger than an rsa encrypted aes key plus an aes encrypted message
the extends keyword is more general in this sense since it s used to mean that the generic type could either extends another class or implements an interface
the serializable seems quicker but deserialization much slower and the app is doing more deserializing than serializing
the features stemming from those discussions permit less extreme fork than processes which is symmetrically like the provision of more extensive independence between pthreads
this will force to upgrade if the upgrade versioning is newer
common lisp is an image base language although usually to a lesser extent than smalltalk
if the only purpose is improved testability then exposing methods as protected or public is an easier option
get is more often used on unsecure type of datatransactions like for example a searchform and post is used when you want to make more secure things like a login form
lan is more or less stable wan can be with network issues like
although if you aren t interested in using adobe cs you can use ubuntu distro which is easier than other linux distro and quiet popular so you won t have any problem finding solution
google-chrome recent builds only and firefox are behaving very strict in this regard no matter how much content you have it will be no bigger than your viewport while opera presto behaves more like a table 100 is treated as a minimum not a maximum
first don t use wav as it takes up too much memory mp3 is better
to be a randomaccessiterator it must support these operations plus a few more such as addition and subtraction
pypy is currently more than 5x faster than cpython on average
i prefere lxml it s a harder to understand but much faster than beautifulsoup
shortly put running some benchmarks on a page doing some database operations and serving static dynamic content has shown that plain cherrypy was twice as fast than nginx and memcached and about half faster than lighttpd
my personal experience is that webrick is faster in my development environment than unicorn and thin os x in a pretty big rails app lots of gems routes etc
it s hard to explain but just imagine that i move this layout to 300px x then on the phone it works because the screens isn t that large but on tablet it will probably not work because the screens is larger
i read a lot about gradle and it seems to be a better solution than maven or ant
i suppose that once we start adding elements from h2 as children to elements of h2 then we will have to start checking whether that child is less than the parent and if not we swap them
other cpus take three or four cycles to do a multiplication which is a bit slower than addition
i have used both prototype scriptaculous as well as jquery in many projects and based on what i am seeing it appears jquery has the more plug-in available so am leaning towards using jquery
iostream is said to be slower than cstdio but i suggest you use a profiling tool here to find the best set of options here
after all innodb shouldn t be slower than myisam when using count + where but that s exactly what is happening here
for this to work the getter setter approach is a better fit
if a flac file is newer than the corresponding mp3 file or the corresponding mp3 file doesn t exist then i want to run a bunch of commands to convert the flac file to an mp3 file and copy the tags across
nginx is faster than apache handles slow clients better and is generally easier to use
in my personal experience it is impossible to modify the browser behavior in google-chrome if the addon api does not allow for it - in firefox this is much easier to change as much of the interface logic is written in javascript and there are api s for just about anything
given that i know little about apache modules i would try to remove apache from the equation try writing a simple c program that does little more than a dlopen and possibly the subsequent dlsym then exits
implements gives larger errors because i tried with extends
imho creating templates for joomla is the easier than most other cms i know typo wordpress modx as you simply have to replace parts of the static version with joomla tags menu content etc. it still needs some time to get used to the system but its not that hard
scheme is perhaps more approachable than haskell however
both get post user can put any thing in it and you must filter any input that user make it in your form example the value in textfiled sent to server by post method and that don t make it safer than get method the difference between them that the textfiled value doesn t visible in url
using the same code for serializable and deserialization is even more of a pain i cannot off hand figure out how
is get method is better than post method if you use a form
assuming you are trying to create a 32 bit int out of 4 chars there is probably more checking you can do but at a minimum i would turn this into two methods convertchararraytouint and another one that does each shift shiftcharleft chars numbits and hide all the casting ugliness in there
you iterating i in for-loop so after first loops i is higher then rows
as i understand it an np-hard problem is not harder than an np-complete problem
jboss eap which is based on wildfly deliberately has a slower release schedule
graphicsmagick is a fork of imagemagick that is faster and has fewer bugs this is what flickr uses internally so it should be good enough for you
btw if this hyperlink is not in a databound control like listview or gridview it is far better to set the property from the code behind
i am currently using union all and a distinct in the outer query as this proved much faster than using union s for the uniqueness of data
or is there something about multiplication that is more convenient than division in programming
while you don t get the whole post you do still have to query the database for the id of post with mood grumpy so unless you have lots of post it s probably easier to just go with the answer dorel gave
put is designed for file uploads moreso than post which requires doing a multipart upload but then it comes down to what your server can do as to which is more convenient for you to implement
using onkeyup or oninput suggest by mohamedrias rather than onchange event is more suitable in your case
although this thread is more than a year old it still merits from the fact that no one mentioned about the not so recent innovations of nginx lighty and other web servers which scale much better than apache at higher concurrency and consume lesser resources
if you have long-running requests i think the performance will be pretty bad because apache use one thread per connection nginx performs much better
firefox - good a bit slower than google-chrome
i m currently using carthage as a dependency manager and i know cocoapods is more popular and maybe swift package manager will be something in the near future - so i d like to be able to publish the extensions so people using any of these package managers can easily add them to their projects
coalesce is more cross-compatible than isnull or nvl it works on mssql oracle mysql derby et al.
union all is better than union because it avoids a sort you know you ll get a distinct set because you re joining on two different tables
directx is in general much faster than gdi due to the fact that it has full acceleration on most video cards
my initial idea was to use radio button for the options because of its exclusion functionality but maybe using checkbox provides a better solution
because if the first word in arrays is shorter than second one you need second for-loop
i don t recommend sending such parameters via url get it is better and safer if you use post form method
qweb is nicer templating tool and it was created by odoo and its designed to work cross language originally which can be forked from git - qweb
if you get a difference between swift and objective-c it s more because swift is probably better on optimisation
but i think using fseek and ftell is better and easier
a suffix tree is more or less an advanced trie here you can also search for any substrings in o c as for the trie
i have found that jedit has better plugins for providing some of the more ide-oriented capabilities but like boltclock said notepad++ is really just a powerful text editor and does not try to be a one-stop-shop ide
since you re using android and retrofit i suggest using okhttp wich is better supported by retrofit and android thread safe the way to this is the following
they both are able to handle much more current users than apache lighttpd or nginx.
quicksort and mergesort is longer and seems more complicated but it is o n log n
if you just want the fun of linux command line programs without access to all of ubuntu cygwin is smaller and might be faster
setinterval is more useful than settimeout here as it recurs automatically and you don t need to keep setting it
well actually you would be better off with checkbox control and you can make it look just like regular button
the other distributed tools are a lot faster svn is slow as hell even cvs can be faster sometimes have much more useful features than svn are developing rapidly while seeing any new feature in svn takes years
nsurlsession is newer than nsurlconnection if you are using swift language then you can use your own custom methods by using nsurlsession or you can use alamofire
should i change my project to trie or is there any other good reasons where avl tree woud be more efficient than trie in case of phonebook
onkeydown although it wouldn t work for pasted data where onchange is probably better
warning users yhonax .gradle caches modules-2 files-2.1 com.google.guava guava 21.0-rc1 ea4681eb116c7335370adaad583010e0681cc53b guava-21.0-rc1.jar com google common collect immutablemap.class major versioning 52 is newer than 51 the highest major versioning supported by this compiler.it is recommended that the compiler be upgrade
nsurlsession is much more powerful tool than nsurlconnection
i have a quad core processors and the threadpoolexecutor is set to 4 core threads but when i submit my callables hundred or so to the threadpoolexecutor java never uses more than 25 cpu
the problem is that windows ntfs is slower than typical linux filesystems for these lookups
also typedef struct is more c than c++
using just the keyfn return a comparable value that matches your requirements is much easier than implementing comparator
suffice to say ie and google-chrome start having problems at larger heights than does firefox
using specific method such as addclass removeclass and slidedown slideup makes it easier to debug your code and see what s going on
i wouldn t call post more or less secure than get
ios google-chrome is more ios safari than google-chrome itself
note that centos software versions are older than debian s but versions of opensuse software are newer than debian s versions
as powelljf3 said post is more secure then get though it can still be gotten to
what i did not expect is that outputstream is much less bytes than inputstream although i have yet to make any modification on doc
but in general you will find that lxml is faster more effective and has an api which adheres closely to a python standard the elementtree which comes with the python standard library
i have been trying to do this in firefox webextensions but if it s easier with google-chrome i will try it that way instead.
i used get because is faster than post if you need it just to get a list of element for suggestions
m_expr can expand to a u_expr because unaries bind tighter than multiplication operations and a_expr can expand to a m_expr because multiplication operations bind tighter than addition operations
the private exponent is always smaller than the modulo so you should be able to encrypt it using the raw rsa operation if you make sure to remove the prepended zero
this really surprised me because i expected mri to be slower than jruby
hello to all i am developing an application that needs to send a image via the udp socket.i know that tcp is a better protocol but playing with kryonet in java i have learnt that udp is better for this type of application.i have this small class that i have made
it is widely used to have a separated tag with the postfix -alpine in it to indicate that alpine linux is used which is a much smaller base-image than the debian image
this is due to the simple fact that firefox has been in the extension business longer than google-chrome or ie
division algorithms are slower than multiplication algorithms in most cases
google-chrome or safari on a mac could be much faster than firefox on a pc especially with newer apis
post makes it more indirect to intercept and read the payload than get but not safer
in my experience passing css js through controllers slower than pure apache nginx request
if you don t need anything like that you may use swing or swt it s more of a matter of taste
is there any way in haskell to get the constant that is the largest and smallest possible positive rational-numbers greater than zero that can be represented by doubles
since it s an arrays it s better to use a for-loop with a counter variable i which starts from 1
please note that if you don t fix umask and create more than one directory with os.makedirs method you will have to identify created folder and apply os.chmod on them
garbage-collection may be slower than malloc and free for programs that allocate at once all the memory they need and work with that
it is a massive over simplification in some cases and plain wrong in others to say we know that myisam is faster than innodb
what you need to use is an xhr or ajax request to get the next 10 post it is much better to do it this way rather than hiding them and activating them as needed because even if you hide it the browser still had to download the content
it may be that the kernel heuristics for servering tcp connections is more aggressive than for udp sockets since tcp connections require more state and more continuous processing than do udp sockets
however if you have a current production mysql versioning that is earlier than v5.7.7 then the removal of this restriction on views should only be one of the criteria being assessed while making a decision as to upgrade or not
fink has more packages than macports
since this structure is not exactly related to game logic and technically it can then be reused by implementing an interface for the callback so that you can use this keyboard elsewhere where you want to have your player to type letters using mouse it s better be separated from main logic
the best reason i know of for not destroying dependents is that more than one parent model has_one or has_many children
for the purposes of reading the user s input i would recommend using std cin which uses a similar syntax to std cout and is really more convenient
ansible unlike chef and puppet uses agent less run
this allows you to use the assignment operator instead of memcpy and requires 1 less call to malloc - the one you make
use httpwebrequest instead of webclient it s slightly less convenient but not by very much and set the keepalive property to false
my menu links seem in google-chrome correctly but in firefox my menu links are 1 px smaller than google-chrome
again we see the pattern of it getting faster during the first two runs after which it settles somewhere in between slightly faster than yarv and the other jruby and slightly slower than rubinius
in general is myisam faster than innodb
ejml looks really good it works almost 2x faster than jama on my data.
a solution in xslt would work too but if you are not already using xslt then using xquery makes more sense here i guess
in my experience google-chrome will be a lot faster than firefox to debug huge js files
as jogojapan said using std ostringstream is a better choice
there is a more detailed comparrison between intern and protractor in this blog post here
and if you just want something faster or more scalable than svn then just buy a commercial product - i ve used both perforce and rational clearcase and they scale up to huge projects without any problems
in my testing so far google s pagespeed addon is far and above much better than yslow
but integer arithmetic arguably is inherently simpler than floating-point
the first difference is that division is much more expensive than addition
also see why aes is more secure than des
when i was googling info on nginx it appears to be faster than apache and works well in serving static pages
so if it takes 1 second to generate each hash it becomes a bigger time sink than it would have been had you used a fast hash such as md5 of a version of sha
in my cases postgresql was better than mysql mysql do not completely support unicode
i ve read that timsort is better than quicksort both in the best and the worst case although it uses a bit more memory
it doesn t even matter much what algorithm is used - one could even use md5 or md4 and the passwords would be just as safe there is a slight difference because computing a sha-1 hash is slower
floating-point arithmetics is by far more complicated than integer arithmetics
that is enable to your program to use more at least than one thread more than one processors if necessary that is by definition capped at 1 single virtual core of full use thus 100 of cpu that you see on top on linux or equivalent in other system
or perhaps ienumerable is better since ienumerable types can be cast to iqueryable to be used with linq
calculating primes takes more iteration than checking for a palindrome
d3.js has a steeper learning curve than chart.js but once you get the hang of it you can do pretty much anything graph related with it.official site is here
you might want to try emacs - it has an inbuilt tutorial and some people like me find it easier over vim no flames pls
in terms of interacting with javascript youtube is miles ahead of vimeo and performs much more reliably
i have come up with a few ideas such as traversing the html document tree to its leaves adding up the length of the text and only seeing what other text the parent has if the parent gives us more content than the children do
you are right that using tcp is probably better to use for something like this or even an existing protocol like tftp
this works perfectly fine but our company has more than 1000 grouping that would be imported if i don t set a filtering for grouping
on your platform a int is bigger than a chars so you are walking off the end of the array and undefined read really bad things are allowed to happen when you do that
for some things easier than ggplot2 or ggmap
i don t think they have a natural precedence unlike say multiplication and division being of greater precedence than subtraction and addition because they can be built from subtraction and addition
it s conceptually more sound as subclassing a thread suggests specializing its behaviour while runnable s are more like task containers - favor composition over inherited
it s simple and nginx is even more ridiculously fast and lightweight than lighttpd
it also gets broken even more in ios google-chrome which is an older version of safari
that it would perform quicker with get put calls
looking at the cmath header from gcc s libstdc++-4.8 one can see an explicit pow double int is no longer present this case is handled by the following template which promotes the int to a double
one of the main advantages people discuss when choosing nginx over apache is higher performance in serving large numbers of static file so when using laravel are those static files loaded as dynamic php files
3 use thin instead of webrick - thin seems easier to configure for ssl
i am currently looking at yii and while its more complex than codeigniter the documentation is much more informative and therefore understandable than cakephp s
x86 have more complex instructions than mips
you can view it live on cssdesk this method works in a lot more than google-chrome but breaks in firefox 3.0 and just doesn t work in a number of ie versions
anyway for the past year i ve been using fink and apt-get on leopard because i m more familiar with debian ubuntu
the script was tested using myisam and it indexes products relatively fast much much faster than innodb
a set or bag is easier to map in hibernate and requires fewer database columns
many times catching an attributeerror or typeerror is simpler and apparently faster
where instead of expected many-to-one is much more complex and partially expressed many-to-many
beyond the license issues clang llvm builds much faster than gcc and in apple s benchmarks and my own experience creates better-performing executables than gcc
myisam used to be faster years ago but if you use any reasonably current version of innodb then innodb is faster for most workloads
multiplication and division operators have higher precedence than addition and subtraction in c++ same as in scientific notation
if using the versioning of groovy you want and frequent upgrade is more important then consider gmavenplus
the reason is encapsulation is far more than getter and setter
you can also do it manually with put and get which is more c-ish
which is basically the same thing as the factories then depend on sub-factories but at least they are lighter than presenter views services and they don t need to load the sub-factories until they are needed
in this case i found while loops is better than for-loop because if i want to achieve the same in for-loop i have to assign the value of counter to another variable
this is easier done by filtering for a single date but because you said that companies might cease to exist at a given year i grouping data by month first
part of the point of svn was to make the use of branches and merging much easier than in cvs
no practically floyd-warshall is faster than dijkstra s for all pair shortest path generally
i agree with the other answer that it shouldn t be in viewdidload - you ve got no guarantee the view has been added to your window at that point viewdidappear is a better place
it s a lot easier than ant fully compatible with eclipse use maven eclipse eclipse to create eclipse projects and easy to configure
in practice it ll take longer than quicksort which is why quicksort variants are favored over mergesort in the real world
also for tcp udp portability is much better
with datamapper this is somewhat more work than with activerecord which provides it s own db tasks
i understand that get requests are meant to read data while post requests are meant to alter data if a post request is sent more than once dicey things can happen
however i m not sure you want pass parameters via get if you have a form and url isn t callable from outside of your application post is far better
if the constructors and destructors are empty like for built-ins new and delete shouldn t be slower than malloc and free are
i want to set imageview and textview on same line in linearlayout but the imageview is always higher than the textview
or does this mean firefox is less secured on that point than google-chrome
if you are interested in why quicksort is faster where is a link quicksort superiority over heapsort
disclaimer all this would be needed just to throw an illegalargumentexception which is less idiomatic than a nullpointerexception
tcp is slower than udp and you ll have to mitigate that in realtime multiplayer
however if the subclassing returns a narrower subtype of the superclass method return this is called a covariant return type and is allowed in java since jdk 1.5
you can also use scgi it is a lot simpler than fastcgi
if you have a secure ftp sftp server or secure http ssl https server then curl can accept ssh keys although using an ssl key is more commonly accepted on the internet. it can use those keys to authenticate and establish a secure connection to the directories which have been made public to your user through the server
the restful services are rather thin and completely stateless whereas the admin console is stateful and has more interactive functionality and therefore more memory and processing required
this relates to another question i asked a while back at size of qt containers is qmap much larger than qlist
if your versioning is older than 5.0.0 run pip install --upgrade notebook to upgrade
under some conditions gson has proven to be a lot faster than jackson there also exists jsonp and json.simple
it s going to be a performance memory trade-off anyway because writing one int is generally faster than three chars separately
it s possible that jython and ironpython are much faster than cpython as well as they are backed by heavily optimized virtual machines jvm and .net clr
a quadtree is a simpler data structure than the r-tree
you can also use compression on the tables to keep them smaller but innodb is vastly better than myisam at data integrity
not able to get more than 100 post in single rest api call for the linkedin company updates
is keras faster slower than tensorflow during training
can maven examine and resolve internal dependencies of non-mavenized jar library defined earlier by ant
note after doing some benchmarks i found that sorteddictionary is faster for removal but sortedlist is faster for adding and indexing by key
but according to this answer a for-loop is executed faster than the equivalent while loops
it seems that ie and firefox are less strict than safari
in most regards postgresql is slower than mysql especially when it comes to fine tuning in the end
which should at least perform better than explode str_replace and substr solutions
even simpler and probably even faster because multiplication is faster than division is dav s answer which is the most natural algorithm.
and apart from common misleading information where post is safer than get it is not
apache s design is thread per client while nginx uses the reactor pattern meaning - nginx can handle much more traffic than apache as a web server about 50 times the number of requests
i m not familiar with the infeasability of iqueryable but this blog post seems to indicate that iqueryable is much more preferable to ienumerable because iqueryable allows access to the underlying expression
worse than opera and firefox on the desktop as well
so here fgets is reading more than one integer at a time from file so atoi is not getting the integers in file too
for lists containing 1000 elements the dictionary zip version is the fastest the generator and the list comprehension versions are virtually identical and they are 1.5 times slower and the functional map reversed is considerably slower
then you might switch to except all similar to union all which might be more efficient than union because it avoids the distinct operation
it s model it s much more twisted than svn cvs git
here it is conceivable that subtraction is slower than addition
the uinavigationcontroller is more of a behind-the-scenes organizer for holding and displaying other uiviewcontroller s
so for even small inputs quicksort does less work than heapsort and is physically faster for every n
i now understand that a windows specific tool such as xcopy xxcopy or robocopy probably is better for backing up but for now i prefer the simplicity of cp and not having to dive into windows command line
django is very batteries included meaning that it comes with much more out-of-the-box than say flask and to me a large part of that the user auth system
jruby is faster than 1.9 mri matz ruby interpreter the standard in certain areas
on my hardware copying a 1gb text file line by line using bufferedreader and bufferedwriter takes less than 5s in some runs and more than 30s in other
post is absolutely not more secure than get as to man in middle attacks
so bandwidth was probably viewed as cheaper than server ram and disk storage
if you re more interested in latency and small amounts of data then something udp based could be better than tcp but you d need to build extra logic for ordering the messages and retrying the lost ones
with careful optimization however you can make addition 61 times faster than division
threads in direct2d is more granular than in gdi and gdi+ so that the
first just a heads up you may want to try firebug+firepath on firefox which is a more handy tool than google-chrome s developer tool
i ve used it without any guilty feelings and can see no reason why it is worse than using malloc memcpy
i have used sitemesh and it is good for wrapping a set of pages in standard headers and footers but tapestry is better for creating components which are used on many pages possibly many times per page
innodb delivered 4.6x higher throughput than myisam while achieving
r-tree are much faster than quadtree for nearest neighbours queries
on one hand slick2d is fast and simple but it seems lwjgl is more adaptable in the sense that it has both 2d and 3d capabilities
however using a salt offers more protection against rainbow tables precalculated hash tables so they re still worth using
get is basically just like post it just has a limit on the amount of data you can send which is usually a lot smaller than post and a semantic difference which makes get not a good candidate from that point of view even if technically they both can do it
android 5.0 api 21 allows surface input to mediarecorder which is often much more convenient than mediacodec
lwjgl is much more aimed towards gaming with opengl where as jogl is more worried about complete and perfect bindings to opengl opencl
when compared to jax-rs jax-ws makes it easier to support the ws- set of protocols which provide standards for security and reliability among other things and interoperate with other ws- conforming clients and servers
if i remember correctly lodash argued they were faster than underscore.js because the use non-native functions for key operations
i also would prefer to avoid service workers in the implementation so that this works in more than just google-chrome and firefox
because mongo 3.0 required greater than versioning 1.4 which i was running i had to upgrade the driver at the same time
it means a declared properties is more than a pair of accessor methods getter setter
however lets say i want g to do something more complex than multiplying by 2 like ask the user for a number and add that like so
to receive a file in your api i would use a put request simpler than post multipart and fetch the data from the stream php input
google app engine does not allow us to schedule more than 20 cron jobs
you could use slick2d it is way easier to use and works with lwjgl
your problem is that your procedure has more parameters then you pass to it on mybatis call so at any point after the missing parameter you should have your ora-06502 pl sql numeric or value error error since the following paramters doesn t have the same type on the order you are passing it
as mentioned direct2d is an option also--it is functionally a layer on top of direct3d that supports more 2d specific functionality as well as excellent text support
so the compiler can t make the optimization because it can t tell if you wanted the exact behavior where multiplying is better or the implemented behavior where the scale of sum affects the result of the addition
in this case using malloc and free is likely easier though to help with compatibility you may want to define them as new and delete
if you haven t used cocoapods before it is a cocoapods is a dependency manager for swift and objective-c cocoa projects. more information is available on its website here
lxml is faster than elementtree but i ve never found an application where the speed boost paid for the hassles of distribution
i m guessing maybe ie s js engine is a little slower than firefox google-chrome which allows the user to do things they shouldn t but i have no idea how to confirm this or how to deal with it
have you considered creating an object structure for these files and serializing them java object serializable and deserialization is much faster than parsing an xml this is again considering that these 500 or so xml files don t get modified between reads
this might look a little nicer than md5 hash but you would have to ensure url strings are not used several times
an m3u file is nothing more than a text file listing mp3 and or other format digital audio files to be interpreted by player software as a series of audio files to be played in succession
aes will indeed yield a considerably faster result than des
post isn t more secure than get
specifically jscrollpane have height bigger than jinternalframe
any ideas how to use the command dir to more than 1 folder in one command
as an example of the second option i ll use imshow here because it makes more sense than contourf for random data but contourf would have identical usage other than the interpolation option.
since you ve switched to lighttpd the webserver itself is going to use fewer resources than apache would but apache is rarely the bottleneck unless you ve run out of ram or seriously misconfigured it
even though aurora has better capabilities i prefer marathon due to auroras complexity overhead and lack of ui for control api
you can use either to create a new memory block which is separate from the original but naturally strdup is simpler since it doesn t require a separate malloc strlen call
using post prevents this particular attack but is this actually any more secure than using get
using a while loops we can control the flow of i better than a for-loop
drupal 7 mysql 5.0.15 or higher with pdo postgresql 8.3 or higher
nginx is faster than apache and the configuration is easier
the get request is marginally less secure than the post request
use post instead of get it s better
for 5 000 000 ints still stored in memory quicksort becomes suddenly worse then heapsort and mergesort
first amdahl s law is older than hyperthreading so the law itself assumes you have physical processors
is file based caching faster than the mysql mariadb postgresql
edit in response to the comment armadillo does not require lapack but works better with it and better still with tuned blas
innodb has a higher resource consumption rates then myisam so keep that in mind
to be able to express what you were trying to do the operator would have to be able to do more than just boolean because right now your has a bool and int around it
internet explorer s limit is lower than firefox s or google-chrome s and varies between versions
different browsers do this in different ways f.ex ie has less slots than google-chrome firefox
using any kind of non-trivial maven pom.xml makes is more visible though
then make changes to that choice either as an optimisation float takes up less space than double so if you are storing a very large number of them that might be a reasonable choice to better match some outside-imposed criteria or because it won t suffice when you need to use long rather than int
i actually found the setup of nginx much easier than lighttpd not to mention that you can install a macport of nginx port install nginx +ssl that does not contain the ssl-breaking bug that lighttpd suffers from here
speed does matter here myisam is still slightly faster than innodb especially for reads
since the files are all bigger than ram this translates to actual disk usage
a dsa signature generation could be somewhat faster than a rsa signature generation maybe up to twice faster
your average debian or ubuntu user is more likely to be familiar with apt-get than with cpan
i use gradlew and want to create a string in my build.gradle which goes over more than one line to make it more readable
so i inspected the compiled firebasemessagingservice which was the subclassing of com.google.firebase.iid.zzb and had zzae intent method as private but its subclassing firebasemessagingservice had protected access i know that subclassing cannot have weaker reference than its superclass so i guess there is something wrong with firebasemessagingservice library
don t think of it as udp is faster and tcp is slower because that s just wrong
but if you d like to extends this api to be used by the external services then you ll be in a much better position with implements oauth 2.0 using doorkeeper because you can easily configure for example a authorization code grant for them
if you don t need the cryptographic properties then a non-cryptographic hash or a hash that is less cryptographically secure md5 being broken doesn t prevent it being a good hash nor still strong enough for some uses is likely to be more performant
i guess firefox and safari handle huge numbers of elements better than google-chrome
hex is just less verbose and can express anything a binary number can
first you can use double-quotes or q it just takes more work than single-quotes or q
plyr is an older version of dplyr so i would use the newer one especially because it come in the tidyverse group
if you are able to enforce browser usage i find that google-chrome on android preserves line breaks when copying and pasting much better than firefox
which brings me to the point - if transaction ids are per savings account they would be sequential in other words you will be better off with the qlist or even better a qvector because it will be a little more efficient since you will only be appending transactions
if you definitely need svg and want to only use existing elements you may want to look at snap.svg which is raphaels younger sister and shares a lot of the same codebase or another like svg.js
so viewdidload is called slightly earlier than viewdidappear the only difference is that when viewdidappear the view have been already drawn instead in viewdidload the view has still to be drawn
it is working only for simple .php files but wordpress is more complex and after long period of loading it show elgg nothing found site loaded
based on this not created by me the while loops is 22 slower than a for-loop in general
to see a full example of a maven pom.xml that includes more libraries from play look at the sample pom.xml included in the play-pure-maven-plugin s repository
you will notice that the tcp header has more fields than the udp header and many of those fields will be populated by information from the handshake
my personal opinion is that it is vastly more useful than strncpy and strcpy
the best way will be to use httpd.conf even if .htaccess seems easier
if for some strange reason you can do the obvious do.call would be more efficient than mapply
it is common knowledge that division takes many more clock cycles to compute than multiplication
client-side validation is faster than server-side because the validation takes place on client side on browser and the networking time from client to server is saved
since you re using lxml why not use it in a more direct manner lxml is believed to be faster than beautifulsoup
i am using udp because it is much faster than tcp but sometimes i need the know for sure if the packet reached to the other side in my program i can not use tcp at all so i am sending ack packets
if you site is located on single box you will get much better results with apc which unlike memcached is not distributed by nature
as i understand websockets are on top of tcp and have higher latency than sctp that underlies webrtc when for example sending binary data between server and browser that also could be 2 peers in webrtc
now my question is if there s any circumstances that if we use declarative too much it will confuse the developer who read the code and switching back to imperative is a better solution
i have been trying get data out of new reddit post but theres limitation where you cant get data from more than 100 post
is this why post method is more preferred than get or does it really matter in any case if it internally uses post or get
note please do tell me if lxml is more easy or this elementtree
as a practical matter a cons is simpler than a list so you can get the value with a straight cdr rather than the conceptually more complex cadr the car of the cdr
on some arm platform im working on memmove was 3 times faster than memcpy for short unalligned load
mongodb s server-side document representation is a json-like binary format called bson which has richer types than javascript json and preserves field order
postgresql has better support but the support by mysql depends on the used storage engine
why uitableview reloaddata is more efficient than reloadingsections even there is only one section
thus i think vaadin is more suitable for intranet and takes less time to develop your app while smartgwt is better for more complex gui or unstable connections where additional roundtrips matter
for example tcp has much more flags window-length syn ack etc - and also starts and ends a connection in a very stable way - the three way handshake - while all udp has is source ip dest ip length source port dest port and checksum
apc is more an opcode caching system than a key value memory database like memcached altough it can be greatly used for both purposes
instead of the above for-loop you can also use the following loops which is even more efficient as this removes the need to find the square-root of the number
newsletters in email campaign tools like outlook gmail hotmail has less css support
it s 4 times faster than using malloc free and copying your data when scaling up
anthony williams fixed-point maths library provides a complete analogue of the standard maths library for a fixed data type that is typically around 5 times faster than software floating-point on the same target
this is a more general problem with maven 2 it doesn t allow any pom.xml code reuse expect properties and custom plugins
firefox is slower than google-chrome which boats one of the highest javascript engines a modified version of webkit
that being said i understand that it might be for your assignment but converting boolean into multiple unsigned int is more like useless c optimization to me
the code you presented will never pass more than one uiviewcontroller to the uipageviewcontroller
ati seems to tell more than nvidia
so using g++ is better than gcc
a clob is a safer way to handle the soap request than an xmltype because the data returned may be longer than 32767 bytes
as an aside i would suggest a while loops would be a bit clearer than a for-loop without a next clause
i would not mind changing to for example bazaar or git if needed i am a bit afraid of git to be honest everything i read about git seems 10x more technical than anything i read about mercurial or bazaar and installing it on windows seems to imply installing all sorts of secondary software it seems but that is another matter
memory allocation in java is 5x to 10x faster than malloc calloc etc
i suspect that the reason people write scheme style macro systems in common lisp is more for the pattern matching than for the hygiene
not sure why you just accepted a terribly biased answer like best solution stick with coldfusion or railo from coldfusion is just better
i ve figure out that even though myisam has locking contention it s still faster than innodb in most scenarios because of the rapid lock acquisition scheme it uses
you have to realize that this is a common probelm with joomla and wordpress as i explained to you in my other answer to your another question here is joomla 2.5 much faster than joomla 1.5 querywise
there is no need to do anything to make bundler work with rvm but there is one thing about bundler that makes it harder to use
and how do the differences make liblinear faster than libsvm
i also had good result with umbraco cms it s a bit more lean than dotnetnuke but not as user friendly and definitely not as popular
whether writing the for-loop like that is a good idea or why is it not just using the erase-remove idiom are different issues as a matter of fact the previous loops is arguably better than erase-remove for a list the concrete situation is that the semantics have changed and because the type is syntactically compatible with the previous one the compiler will not notice that the code is wrong it will not point you to that function and chances are that you will not review rewrite it
your spf record requires more than 10 dns lookups to process
enumerate is also more appropriate than xrange
you could probably also configure snmp to run over tcp instead of udp which makes tunneling easier
on the php docs link above they say a put request is much simpler than a post request when uploading file along with this advantage what other advantages disadvanatges do the put has got compared to the post
yes vhdl was once much more feature-rich than verilog but later revisions of the language verilog 2001 verilog 2005 systemverilog etc.. have cherry-picked most of the interesting features and there is far more robust toolchain support for verilog and its variant these days in addition to it being the dominant language in use in the us in my experience vhdl is only used here when dealing with extreme legacy blocks and in academic contexts partially due to the tools support mentioned previously
according to stephen canon modern implementations favor taylor expansion over rational function approximation where division is much slower than multiplication
monodevelop is more of a replacement of an ide for mac and linux in windows the recommended thing is to use visual studio or sharpdevelop
i don t really think that jtable will help you here anyhow better than jlist - it has the same rendering strategy
the engine is myisam i ve heard people recommend switching to innodb but many others said myisam is faster with large amounts of data in terms of counting and innodb better for safe transactions
according to many benchmarks uwsgi seems to provides better performance than gunicorn and if the performance doesn t change significantly you ll be able to focus your investigation on nginx or ec2 configurations
union all performs better than union union works like distinct first order by then remove duplicates
i think it s a better idea to show a div as dialog in the middle of your website because the chance that this is pop-up blocked is smaller and it s imo less annoying
i think using settimeout is safer than setinterval
in my task manager i see how the memory of google-chrome or firefox is getting bigger and bigger up to 512 mb
like the fadein and fadeout is faster than the actual changing the picture
like the rest of rest wadl is lightweight easier to understand and easier to write than wsdl
technically mergesort has a better time-behavior Ã® nlogn worst and average cases than quicksort Ã® n 2 worst case Ã® nlogn average case
anything sent larger than the mtu with df set will result in an icmp error message being generated
you ll probably find that lxml runs faster than beautifulsoup but in my uses beautifulsoup was very easy to learn and use and handled typical crappy html as found in the wild well enough that i don t have need for anything else
a while loops is imo more complicated to read than a for-loop
tcp is much slower than udp but when the two machines are not on the same lan udp is not reliable
you could try the block of code in the viewdidload method which is called earlier than viewdidappear
if your batch file only needs to run on windows vista or later you can use robocopy instead which is an even more powerful tool than xcopy and is now built into the operating system
fwiw i was able to solve my problem with greensock using tweenmax to animate individual paths inside and this worked in firefox gecko and webkit browsers safari google-chrome it does a better job of calculating the origin not exactly sure how but it worked for me
when you re not worrying about shadowing this is more flexible if the named of the object changes
third since the question is tagged multithreading if the old process is running more than one pthreads then the new process inherits all the mutexes conditions etc of the old process in the state they were in when fork was called
this can be done in much better fashion by avoiding for-loop provided if you choose to change your arrays structure with predefined index some thing like var
ubuntu linux is more strict when it comes to opening files that are already open the line
strncpy is not safer method to use as strcpy
i think the argumentexception is more appropriate because the invalidoperationexception documentation says that the object itself on what the method is called has to be in an invalid state right
in my experience this is a much simpler sell than trac bugzilla and all the rest
i suppose it has something to do with dc.js s mouseover event listener which is not bound to the svg in dc_plot dc.js d3.js and crossfilter.js are added at the client side
bufferedreader is useful when is used with large streams such as a file fileinputstream and in all cases the read method returns one character while behind the scene bufferedreader reads more data depends on buffer size from related inputstream and caches it to improve performance
i would see if i got better results with isnull instead of coalesce
plus once spdy becomes more common ssl slow down won t really account for anything much
now the problem is the css animations which we have are not getting rendered smoothly in the webkit browser provided by javafx but same code in firefox or google-chrome is quite smoother
mysql run 4x faster than postgresql
the incrementor in the for-loop is more of a while 1 endless loops
in ie6 7 8 and in google-chrome text has proper size but in firefox it s bigger
using getter and setter is more expensive because first the vm will lookup the method from a virtual method table and then make the call
which i think makes sense because extends from a class should take higher priority than implements from an interface
i would suggest scheduling your jobs using something more sophisticated than cron
i also find ant with ivy to be better documented than maven although that s not too difficult
however i found that vmware is much more stable full screen resolution much much better to handle the iphone connection via usb and i didn t have yet any crash when on virtualbox it s quite often
the effect is more obvious in firefox google-chrome is better
webclient is easier but httpwebrequest is more powerful and allows for more control
edit since you say you can t add a none option and want to use a checkbox even though i strongly disagree on checkbox where a radio button is more appropriate - a common ui error .
however i think that ecj is even better than javac my opinion .
plenty of others don t use a delimiter at all and require you to start a new segment polygons if you re more than x distance away from the last point. furthermore these things often wind up being multi-gb ascii files so reading the entire thing into memory can be impractical
if the bundler is newer then version 1.1.2 it will remove bcrypt-ruby 3.0.1-x86-mingw32 automaticaly
dsa signatures are signficantly shorter than rsa ones
here in so i found a lot of questions asking something similar and the answers normally said you can use cglib or asm or javassist is better than cglib or bcel is old and is dying or asm is the best because it gives x and y
so for instance heapsort is faster than quicksort in the worst case but slower in the average case
so make sure you code has a working set of less than 16 128bit vectors or 32 64bit vectory at any time
by the way i would suggest creating rar self-extracting archives instead of zip self-extracting archives as with rar compression the exe file with the right switches for best compression using additionally also solid archive options could be much smaller than with zip compression
an hmac is a better way of adding your salt and pbkdf2 is based on hmac - see below for more detail on pbkdf2 - there s a good discussion at when is it safe to use a broken hash function
whilst somewhat similar to skype facetime and facebook video chat google hangout focuses more on face-to-face-to-face group interaction as opposed to one-on-one video chats and utilizes sophisticated technology to seamlessly switch the focus to the person currently chatting
so in simple terms this should give you a feel for why division and hence modulo is slower computers still have to do long division in the same stepwise fashion tha you did in grade school
if you re diligent about making graphics for at least the main three densities ldpi mdpi and hdpi then you should not see over-large icons except where the screens is physically smaller than your layout expects it
is nerdtree really much better than netrw
after that is done you can go into security details where get is slightly less secure than post - see the comments for details.
i have fireworks 8 as well as photoshop cs3 on my windows pc but i m more familiar with fireworks
then postgresql is much better than mysql
anyway if you re willing to do advanced 3d stuff mayavi is way better than matplotlib
i think this is better done with a metaclass in order to handle both runtime and subclassing method decoration
in safari and google-chrome it is better but still has visible juddering
while wordpress is great the simplicity of it gets the better of it joomla is far more flexible and has a huge support network and extensions library
very fast static assets nginx is faster than apache at serving static assets css js images ... and uses very little memory to do so
for internal work i ve found out that fossil uses little bandwidth much less than cvs or svn and is able to synchronize huge projects in a blitz even via an adsl or a 3g connection
0- less than floating-point less than lt fl for fixed-point compare
if necessary i am willing to use the twitter api directly to do the search instead of using rss but for my purposes using a feed is more ideal
division is a lot more expensive than multiplication
finally if you want to optimize your program to number of lines - trading off engineering practices - you ll have a shorter program with mouseenter and mouseleave events
as noted in the comment by quandary the pdfsharp library offers a more relaxed license mit compared to the commercial or agpl license offered by itext
if kernel versioning is less than 2.6 then we recommend to upgrade it
why is firefox so much slower than google-chrome on my laptop
slick2d is made to work with lwjgl 2 lwjgl 3 however is way newer than slick2d and therefore slick2d does not support using lwjgl 3
my reasoning for this is that i may want to add aesthetics to the plot and ggplot2 allows this more than plot
i know innodb is heavier than myisam but just how much more
objective-c -documentary provides more content than the documentary for swift
another alternative that people might mention is clion which is from jetbrains but its closed-source not well supported and whilst it might look nicer than qt-creator it has more or less the same features but is much more resource-heavy and laggy so i d pass on that
if you take the binary search approach then there is scope for doing this smartly - spotting when successive tests in the same binary search return the same letter and so assuming that as a minimum range size then aborting any possible range that s shorter than that - but chances are you d do better to code this up using the separate searches
please read trough it for a better grip over cron jobs in laravel
but this popular wsgi benchmark says eventlet is way slower than gevent
couchbase looks more like a memcache server with a persistence layer powered by couchdb and maybe it does not fit your needs
this is one way in which innodb is sometimes better than myisam
the geocoding api works better than geocode normally but has usage limits and the implementation is bigger
both frameworks are fairly easy to implement flask is much easier than django imo although django has a built in authentication layer that you can use albeit more difficult to implement in a client server scenario like you need
these two lines are in the .htaccess at root level of the site - the configuration in the main httpd.conf is considerably more complex but just that sets particular options for the ssl within the admin area and doesn t affect non-admin areas so i know this works whether it will for you i cannot say
for load testing jmeter is better option but you have quite enough funding then go for loadrunner neoload rational performance tester and for cloud try blazemeter
i think the idea of having a single event aggregator for parent module and its children is cleaner
mp3 or aac compression format is suited for music content and amr is better suited for speech content
however they may be cheaper to operate depending on how much data you are expecting to store with each session key holding large quantities of data in ram is typically more expensive than storing on disk
you can of course improve it for instance using a proper callback rather than an inline event and do more with it show hide the play button but this is it in its simplest form
a direct2d is slower than gdi
strlen is fast alloca is fast copying the string up to the first n is fast puts is faster than printf but is is most likely far slower than all three operations mentioned before together
even if the hypothesis of the while loops being faster than the for-loop were true and it s not the loops you d had to change optimize wouldn t be the outer ones but the inner ones because those are executed more times
i have a clue to the answer may be currentculture is for a broader class of language en and uiculture is for more specific variant of the language like en-us but am not sure if this is true
a get is a bit quicker and than a post in an ajax scenario
i personally think combining prism with mef makes this type of situation easier though since mef allows for easier dynamic extensibility for roles
libc++ is not 100 complete on gnu linux and there s no real advantage to using it when libstdc++ is more complete
cpython probably has better ide support at present than ironpython - so this may be a factor in the choosing of one over the other
and my test result show it s more accurate than math.h s sin cos at -m_pi angle +m_pi range
the addition is much cheaper than other operations like modulo and division and array access
in outlook.com hotmail it looks closer to the results shown with gmail
in theory the while loops is quicker because the for-loop looks up the length attribute of foo every time though loops but in real-world use it s going to make an immeasurably small difference
there is almost always some driver issue between them but in general nvidia is better for opengl has bugs in directx implementation and ati amd versions only is better for directx has bugs in opengl implementation
also the onfocus event would be more appropriate than onclick because it handles other scenarios such as pressing the tab key to change the active input
post is also more secure than get because you aren t sticking information into a url
testng offers you more options and possibilites how to run your tests and in which order especially something junit can t
for instance in some benchmarks lighttpd is even faster at serving static resources than apache
ironically enough its object model show more details than it hide - good for learning but bad for abstraction
firefox just provides far more access to its own internals and system to the extensions so its technically possible to do more with them than with opera widgets or google-chrome extensions
i will not argue why and if nexus is better than artifactory as it would not be fair and would only cause flame wars
you can use asihttprequest which is quite better than cfnetwork
you may also use handbrake which is a simpler encoder than ffmpeg
instead of explode use preg_split and then use s+ s spaces + 1 or more times as delimiter
your fixheap2 fails to consider the case where both children are valid but have keys smaller than the parent s
i just want to know if i use post method for login api then is it safer than get method
if for any node total resource allocation makes more than all ram cores disk available you are at risk most often at risk of spark task or yarn child being unable to start
considering sorting is more complicated than summation median filtering will cost longer time
the math.floor ceil method being marginally faster than parseint and mod
at my company we have found memory mapped files to be much faster than loopback tcp ip for communication on the same box so i m assuming it would be faster than udp too
udp is much faster then tcp but tcp has flow control and guaranteed delivery
jruby support - unicorn s a better choice than thin but it doesn t support jruby
i haven t read anywhere that apple llvm clang compiler produces bigger executable so my guess is that i might not be using the optimization settings in xcode properly
if however you do need something quicker than division and modulo then bitwise operations come to help
udp port scanning is possible but it is harder than tcp scanning
i find using tcp to be very reliable and it can also be very fast if the traffic is stream like meaning mostly unidirectional additionally building a message framer on top of tcp is much easier than building tcp on top of udp
lodash is more modular than underscore.js underscore.js around 5kb lodash around 17kb but is generally lighter because you only include the specific modules you need
i naively assumed that gradlew is better than ivy then when i created my build.gradle the dependency management is even greater mess than of ivy s for the first look
pytables seems more flexible but i am unclear about what the most direct way of using it to save a full pandas dataframe with multiindex and all
while it is true that a simple shift or add is often faster than a multiplication but not always Ã¢ multiplication are faster than you might think the only way you could use it here inside the loop is if you first checked to see that you were supposed to be multiplying by 2 and the cost of doing that check more specifically the cost of making the decision as a result of that check is far more costly than a simple integer multiplication
i found simpletest was even easier than phpunit to set up
in looking into different frameworks the routing mechanisms they have and the different alternatives employed to make them go faster such as with codeigniter wordpress yii and symphony with alternative caching options how would you do a like-for-like is it possible
see also the retrofit guide which uses okhttp and makes it easier to
in my view cakephp seems much more lighter then codeigniter but i never used either one so i can t judge
if you want loess-based smooths in the gam try package gam but mgcv has a wider range of penalised regression splines and has a more modern approach to smoothness selection in the individual splines
most particular platforms restrict the list of calls that can be interrupted to a smaller set than pthreads allows so you d have to look at the linux docs to be sure exactly what is and isn t eintr-safe but the epoll family of methods along with read recv write send and friends are almost certain to be unsafe
try django-ckeditor redactor it s more simple but redactor itself isn t free and i think fckeditor is more flexible in the configuration
though earlier uiview and uiscrollview have the same area after keyboard shown the blue uiview becomes smaller but its subviews button text fields is outside its area
i guess google-chrome is a bit more forgiving than firefox
the trouble is choosing a good value for x since for this particular page google-chrome is so very much faster than firefox which is faster than ie
i have installed these two tools with the official package of ubuntu and also with the package of debian that seems more updated
obviously in this case the call could return more than one item if there was more than one folder named test in your directory tree
as craig revealed within the announcement of swift it is said to be faster than objective-c by far
using dependency injection e.g autofac this is much easier to assemble than before and with mocking tools nsubstitute moq this is much easier to do than you think
directx has a wider scope than opengl in that directx is composed of directsound directplay and direct3d etc
the flwr syntax of xquery is quite intuitive if you have an sql back-ground imo xslt is the more powerful language when dealing with one input one output situations especially if the output will not be xml
on somewhat limited processors like those in high-end cell phones floating-point may be somewhat slower than integer but it s generally within an order of magnitude or better so long as there is hardware floating-point available
-- does udp always perform better than tcp
sctp is not better than tcp in any way but it does something different
needless to say each product has more than one prop which is kept in the producthas table
in fact when a tablet has a larger than standard screens size the tablet with detachable keyboards available these days mobile versions of the site can look over-optimised for space which is the reason why browsers allow tablet users to opt to display sites in desktop mode
as dimitre says xslt is much better at this class of problem than xquery
while erlang is more expressive ocaml pattern matching is simpler which means a simpler language definition compiler etc. and you still can do what you need at the cost of writing more code
my guess is google-chrome is caching more agressively and thats why you are seeing worse load time on firefox
the problem with this code is that it doesn t quite work on firefox and works even worse on opera
now i assume you are worried your techno might not read a compressed mp3 which should be smaller than a wav from my memories
it may be that macports doesn t help i have been luckier with homebrew than macports when installing cgal
is the best solution to add a new column called engmaterial and add the english translation there or is it possible to solve this in a better way with localization in .net
then ie seems to be reasonable but cant be faster than firefox or safari
for integers multiplication is harder than addition may be slower than addition etc but may still be very fast as long as there is sufficient cpu-power dedicated to it
to answer part of your second question with .net if the post is larger than maxrequestlength part of the .net configuration but smaller than maxallowedcontentlength part of the iis configuration you can create a custom http module to get at the portion of the post that came through
a basic for-loop is slower than a for - loops with simplified test condition
if you re fine with moving to another text editor then i would strongly recommend geany which does the same thing as gedit but is more fully-featured and can allow for execution of code in the same application
therefore innodb can handle higher levels of concurrency better than myisam
there are workloads where postgresql is better and there are workloads where mysql is better
additionally using java.util.date is not good practice at all since most of its method are deprecated so i suggest you to use java.util.calendar which is more flexible
i use firefox with firebug and yslow and think it s more reliable than pagespeed
a solid state drive may even be faster than a ram disk which surprised me
regex is a nfa and is as such in most cases slower than a dfa or hand-written parser
ienumerable is more abstract and is generally preferred to list or ilist if possible
both use debian packages and ubuntu is based on debian but is more user friendly
my usual rule-of-thumb is that xquery is better than xslt for simple tasks whereas xslt is better for complex tasks
it will produce the desired layout with a gridview but indeed the asp listview is a better choice
i have found that using jquery javascript inside an updatepanel is more hassel than it is worth as you always need to output the jquery javascript using the scriptmanager or the scriptmanager.registerclientscriptblock
transparency is also an issue however google-chrome seems to handle all three better than firefox
post is not more secure than get as itÃ¢ s also send unencrypted
but a large period prng takes up more memory for maintaining the internal state and also takes more time for generating a random number due to complex transitions and post processing
i did a search on the web but i was unable to find any evidence that suggests that pypy s memory usage is much more than cpython
the overheads are typically smaller than malloc free in c or new dispose in c++
i heard correct me if i am wrong that innodb is better for tables that will be updated a lot because of row locking opposed to myisam s table locking
now on windows if the ntfs filesystems has less than 5gb disk space it displays
several things i found in the cocos2d forums lead me to believe it s an issue with the zlib implementation on ios but i ve tried using both stb_image and lodepng to avoid zlib and those libraries actually performed even worse than libpng
beststat is innodb so i have row-level locking and consindering i do a lot of inserts-updates it should be faster than myisam
1 - why ant script generates more .class files than maven
this is a very simple case which will do that asuming your children always have a higher id than their parent
hashing is one way you can prove this to yourself by taking an md5 or shasum of a large file since the file s size is larger than the hash output by pigeonhole principle hash can t be restored.
malloc is much easier to implement if there is no free
if you have more than one post with the same com_id in eve.com_id you will get multiple post in your result
well setinterval and settimeout essentially try to do the same thing but for your case setinterval method will be more accurate than settimeout
btw microsoft azure storage explorer in my case showed only some subset of folder which is much worse than displaying duplicated directory so i switched to azure explorer mentioned above and it s worth recommending
so your app code is actually run via uwsgi and cherokee is more like a proxy server
eta to answer your question in more general terms let s say we had the number of subjects and levels set up in advance increasing the number of factors is more complicated unless i m mistaken because then it would no longer be a two-dimensional matrix
if you know the lengths of the strings memmove is a sensible choice - and nominally faster than strncpy because it does not have to check for nulls as it goes
so in my view using swing is simply easier unless you have more experience in swt
the indirection has some costs and is kinda ugly so if you want to keep this functionality you might be better off by implementing accessor methods and only log in a subclass of core
it is worth nothing that in a link where udp and tcp are sharing the bandwidth tcp is better behaved than udp in that it will try to limit itself to avoid congestion
if you take a look at the associated guides you ll see core animation and layers does require hit testing though that s relatively easy but it s far cleaner than the uiview doing all the drawing and more efficient than many subviews
tvos is more similar to ios than it is to watchos although they all have some similarities
in general it s more noticeable with mouse than keyboard
for using a fileformat i thought mp3 uses much less memory than wav because all the formats are based on wav but just compressed
get is more appropiate for idempotent queries while post is more appropiate for action queries but you can shoot yourself in the foot just as easily with any of them if you don t understand the security architecture for the application you re maintaining
how can nginx performs better than apache
mongodb stores everything in memory anyway and works in a similar vein being a key-value based system however i believe mongodb is more flexible as it allows for storing bson objects within themselves
firefox thumbnail 4 times smaller than on google-chrome
if there are more than one innodb tables that need a composite auto_incrementing primary key add an extra primary key to the myisam table
plugins such as fancybox and colorbox jquery offers much more flexibility
to that extent i had to make a few changes to my server-side presentation layer but as a result i think my client-side code is cleaner and more focused on processing actual user events
the general problem is that the subclassing is more specific than the superclass
data density in code128 is better than code39 - since it gets mentioned that often in other replies
owl is richer than languages such as rdf schema rdfs
so that your rtp over udp becomes more resistant towards packets losses
if you have a customer who is willing to work with you a bit it might shed some light on the situation to get a crash dump with adplus or maybe simpler with sysinternals procdump when the error message is showing
i have an app that uses the public part of the twitter api the on who not requires to login but with the update the login is required so i need to implement oauth i ve seen there are libraries like twitter4j who makes this easier but my app has a lot of code and i don t wanna rewrite it not now so i ve think to use scribe or oauth-signpost but i dont realy know how to
maybe this would have all been better with boost but i m still learning stl and didn t go that way
this seems too deep in the original code so i won t touch it but if there s any possibility of flattening the stored array it will be a speed boost even if you can t transpose it multiplying add dereference is faster than dereference add dereference
in my tests i found that one of the loops i tested titled for-loop is astronomically slower than the other loops
webmap toolkit leaflet became popular and easy to use while openlayers is more powerful
i think the conversion to builtin int types for the binary-and operation is likely to make it much faster than working chars by chars because python s int is written in c rather than python
i would like to use a lighter framework than ruby-on-rails sinatra ramaze camping but am concerned that by doing so i will not be able to use a lot of shared libraries that have been tailored to ruby-on-rails in the form of plugins
it looked weired to me that you are trying to return a subclassing s instance from a superclass s method since superclass usually means a more general concept
i have read that quicksort is much faster than mergesort in practise and the reason for this is the hidden constant
nginx with its own mod_wsgi seems to perform even better than apache but hey you didn t ask about that
note that there several advantages to leaving the lua code duplication generated by moonscript in your lua files at least for oft-used operations class definition is probably not one of them but moonscript does way more than that
maven is a better alternative as build system compared to ant
if you want to do this - and are in-fact okay with having more larger hash data to store compare - you would be much better advise to simply run a different hash function other than md5 that is either more secure and or uses a larger number of bits
there ll be no functional difference between the constructor being public or being protected but making it protected gives a clearer indication of the intended use
in world nosql mongo world perhaps the schema is a little more flexible than mysql postgresql and thus changing the schema is more common practice
if you are using something like paintcode or have large chunks of uikit code in swift change it to objective-c it compiles far faster
on stable versions of google-chrome the permissions show allow and it still won t connect even with firefox works older versions of google-chrome work
and one more suggestion instead of using qtreewidget i think qtreeview is a better choice if you can explain the issue a bit more maybe i can provide some sample code
bcrypt is considered the most secure way to implement password hashing with salt because it is slow - much slower than an md5
on i386 the dyld stub is much faster than the powerpc equivalent so we didnÃ¢ t bother doing extra work to bypass it
salt sha-512 offers a higher level of security and implementing a scheme where you stretch the hash is even better do some high number of iterations of sha-512 - starting with the password+salt of course
deserialization is harder than serializable
it works fine even for italics but i m aware that the user s browser is being asked to make a best-guess here and have noticed that google-chrome will make individual chars appear slightly fatter than firefox when i do things this way
one option is to install testdriven.net which makes it easier to run unit tests on any of the major unit testing .net frameworks nunit xunit.net vs tools etc
a for-loop is more appropriate than a while loops in your code
memcached is more for caching database queries and improving performance in that regard while apc is more for improving performance of php code
note that memmove has more overhead than memcpy because it has to determine which direction of copying is safe
is for-loop is faster than while loops
quicksort time complexity is typically o n log n but it s worst case is o n 2 which is avoided with the switch to heapsort since heapsort is always o n log n but slower than quicksort so it s only used to avoid o n 2
keep in mind that i am using lodash by john-david dalton instead of underscore.js because lodash provides better performance and a custom build process
am i better off storing my screens in variables and reusing them when i switching screens or is it better to dispose of each screens when i m done with it and then create a new instance of the screens type i intend to switching to
i suspect the computational demands of flac decoding are probably considerably less than ogg and if dsp gets you excited taking the time to figure all this stuff out is 100 worth it even if the flash route possibly leads to disappointment
this method can handle more delimiter than spaces by the regex being used
this is better than alarmmanager pending intent - no wakelock draining of battery etc.
on many machines particularly those without hardware support for division division is a slower operation than multiplication so this approach can yield a considerable speedup
this response thus assumes that a request using the post verb would not use the uri to transfer sensitive information or it would be no better than get
this really helps keeps parent branch more stable than children
personally i develop on the windows but deploy on debian where couldn t find the scrapyd package at all at the time i was working on it and noticed that performance of scrapy is considerably worse than on linux box so you might reconsider your target
if that isn t sufficient a lot of standard python code can be run on the pypy implementation which generally faster than the cpython implementation
it s very heavyweight and not fully featured for forms so prism or freshmvvm works better as these are designed for forms from the ground up but if you do use mvvmcross for forms its easy to go native if you need
i m not familar with the facebook api but the fbconnect success looks more like an objective-c selector instead of a url
i found d3.js to be rich library but highcharts is more interactive i guess
this is because ubuntu 15.10 uses a newer version of libc and libstdc++ which is not available on debian 8
seek_hole support in the ext4 filesystem was added to linux in the 3.8 kernel ubuntu 12.04 uses an older kernel than that - your kernel version is 3.2.0-45
also for animations google-chrome chromium behaves much better that is why i use it for development but do my general browsing in firefox
again because atom-editor is still in the beta stage sublimetext has much more native plugin packages
for the 10 tests on the same list the results should be quite the same at least all showing that quicksort is faster than mergesort or vice vesa
owl has more structure than rdf
you could put a smaller uiview as subviews of your selectionview and change tha background color of that view
as you have already seen when you eliminate memset datasrc 0 n the first memcpy is even slower because the pages for the source must be allocated as well
get and post are relatively common put is less common so may not be covered in your server implementation
however it may be that maven-jaxb2-plugin uses a newer version of xjc than you re using with enum
using proprietary extensions from firefox is almost as myopic -- you ll have a hard time convincing all visitors to switch to firefox for your site from ie safari or whatever else they prefer and although the range of devices on which you can install firefox is broader than those on which you can install ie you re still cutting off devices such as iphones and android a segment of the market that s growing much faster than traditional pcs
the for-loop just initializes the arrays which that each slot in the arrays is .211 higher than the one before it
furthermore it is handier than google n-gram as for a given phrase it does not simply output its absolute frequency but it can output its joint probability conditional probability and even the most likely words that follow
i m aware of the differences in general the facts like tcp is more accurate while udp is more fast
note also that using nsmutablestring is more efficient than creating a new nsstring each time a letter is added
i suppose this is one of the reasons for the misconception that udp is slower than tcp
the tostring should be slower than parse since division is generally slower than multiplication
i ve written chars counter c extension to python looks like 300x faster than collections.counter and 150x faster than collections.default int
i did something like this in java me and performance was way better than doing post get
google-chrome doesn t implement the sizing correctly and firefox does although in your case the default behaviour of google-chrome is closer to what you want
please note this approach is much less efficient than grouping and filtering in a dataset query if it is based on a database
i ve found that postgresql is in my expirience is slower as mysql
performing this asynchronous testing is actually possible in qunit but is handled better in another javascript testing framework jasmine js
there is a limitation on creating virtual hosts for name based virtual host while using ssl 443 port so if you want to have more than one https port enabled you will need ip based virtual hosting
also maven projects come with a different directory structure and seems to be doing much more than what ant does in the spring source tutorial
about comparing double - since they are double not int it is better to compare the difference below half-tick or something like that but need to be careful with that
myisam is more susceptible to data corruption than innodb and usually innodb performs better because it caches both data and indexes
although post is more secure as compared to get when ssl is present
personally i prefer jackson as according to test benchmarks it s faster than gson
multiplication is faster than division so the second method is faster
ok after a whole day of trying to get this to work i ve abandoned uploadify and am now using plupload which seems much better
i don t want this to be a mysql postgresql is better than postgresql mysql debate
how sctp is better then tcp
nawk alas aix don t have sort and unix sort is far more superior then any hand-made sort in awk
ubuntu is getting closer but there are still numerous things with linux that will keep the grandmothers of the world from using it
i m more familiar with objective-c than swift and haven t had a chance to test this yet but this should be close
tee then writes more data t and tries to read from the pipe then goes to sleep until cat writes more data
because in my server logs it s showing a lot of post with million of ping while the other pages have been get is a smaller amount of number
i think the preview function in openkm is more well than alfresco
but still scanf printf is usually faster than cin cout
i think updating dependencies with maven is pretty easier than dealing with ant but of course you could select the other way if you feel more conifrtable
i feel a little less than swift asking this one but i have become exhausted going in circles on the swift objective-c function calls
you will also likely find the performance characteristics of your ocaml code more intuitive than haskell because of haskell s lazy evaluation
auto is one chars longer than int so the lexer definitely has to do more work
i had a hiccup in firefox but found a fix after figuring out firefox is a bit more picky than google-chrome when defining svg attributes
for instance strncpy is mostly useless it gives you nothing more than strcpy
in many discussions and even in mysql documents it has been mentioned that in case of updates innodb performs much better than myisam
i know that ie s javascript engine is slower than google-chrome and firefox but i m throwing this out there to see if the so community can pick apart my code and suggest better ways of doing this as i am not the greatest front end programmer
this one is more for bigloo - is it more functional than ecl
the posts you see seem to be logical as jsr286 is a newer spec and there are some features that make jsr268 portlet not a jsr168 portlet
get is faster than post
the union all with a distinct gives better performance though i believe..
is the modulo really weaker than the addition
if you want open source postgresql is much smarter than mysql as well
at first i tried reading the original pdf with a fileinputstream and finding the signature hex strings to split it into smaller files with a fileoutputstream as i have done with jpgs
if a key is longer than the hmac supports it ll usually be hash to the proper size
one thing to note is that std istream getline is more secure than std getline so should be preferred in some situations
the problem is that memcpy is only slighly slower than memset when i expect it to be about two times slower since it operations on twice the memory
only when packets can be discarded unordered can udp be faster than tcp
while png is definitely better that gif occasionally there is a use case for needing to stay in gif format
i have read some comparisons of junit and testng and it looks like testng has more configuration options
and then i saw that they put functions under transform that did much more than just get data
if i were able to upgrade the server s versioning of mysql to 5.5 would innodb be a safer bet than postgresql
in specific i would like the uinavigationbar in the uitabbarcontroller s more view controller to be an instance of my class
the lxml library is proven much faster for parsing and un-parsing xml but celementtree is much faster for certain kinds of manipulation
however after attempting multiple times i m actually getting worse results with ogg files than i am with mp3 s - but the problem is the opposite ie when the loop is supposed to go back to the start of the ogg file it actually seems to start again but from about 2 or 3 seconds into it ie no gap it just doesn t loop correctly
somehow the layout algorithms in prefuse seem to display a better layout than in jung rendering is also better i think though most of the layout algorithms in prefuse are based on jung implementation
we ve seen that swift uses a more static method dispatch than objective-c which unless a class dervices from foundation nsobject prevents the style of swizzling based on remapping method implementations at runtime
or maybe that is one of the reasons why visual studio gives slower codes than gcc g++ compiler
udp is unreliable and tcp is more than adequate in sending 1000 s per second
powermockito might integrate a little easier with testng but i have never used it with junit
your table sounds fairly large so i doubt it s being held entirely in memory but it sounds like innodb handles indexes better than myisam anyway plus since you re being so specific it may be caching the result of the query
on the foundation you have either udp which is unreliable but incurs almost no overhead but very well suited for broadcasts and tcp which is more reliable therefore has more overhead but is easier to use
i ve looked at the question at why is quicksort better than mergesort
if you re focussing on pure client code then i find webstorm to be an excellent javascript html ide - even better than aptana
my conclusion now a days wadl is more common that rest and integration frameworks like camel cxf already supports wadl generate and consume because it is similar to wsdl therefore most easy to understand in this migration process soap to rest
i had previously sent those commands via bluetooth but the connection fails too often to be useful and is slower than usb
some people were saying that postgresql is better for security purposes whereas mysql is becoming more feature rich.
furthermore 3des is much slower than aes
i couldn t understand why paxos is better for split-brain scenarios or other network failures than traditional bully algorithm because i can easily find out when quorum of nodes leave from the cluster without using raft
use nio it is much easier than using inputstream outputstream
usually better than filewriter already suggested is to use fileoutputstream which also like filewriter has an append parameter in one of its constructors and which unlike filewriter does not silently assume the default charset encoding slightly bad practice imo
my question is that will postgresql suffice for having such a large number of entries while performing both read and writes or should i switch to mysql because i heard mysql is more advantageous to read heavy tasks
indeed it would be relatively easy to preprocess a bison grammar file but it is easier with jison because you can compute the grammar programmatically and pass it to jison as a json object
my intuition is that transient properties would incurr less overhead than persistent properties because they do not need to be persistent and read from the database so converting them to persistent properties will likely only make things slightly worse
i am curious to know if detecting the visitor browser with client-side script is more reliable than server-side script
using the properties and the accessor allows for more flexibility for example key-value-observing is only possible using the accessor
setting the xhtml namespace as the default namespace might be useful though sadly in xquery this also makes it the default namespace for the output - xslt does this better
if you are on linux and have chosen blas and lapack from a repo it is very likely that they are much slower than openblas
if product3 is installed and installed versioning is lower then upgrade
while a lot of development has been done with stateless connections to solve most problems sometimes it s just simpler with stateful connections
so if something works on safari it s more likely to work straightaway on google-chrome more than it is on firefox - but that s just a family resemblance at the end of the day you ll still have to test each as every webkit browser product and version still uses a different version of webkit
as harypyon suggests storing the children is a more efficient way of viewing this problem than storing the parent and then computing the children
the multiplication are the bottleneck of the calculation even though they may be one instruction a multiplication takes longer than an addition
code is almost working but children divs are a bit wider than parent and i am getting a wrong value of offsetwidth
allocating more memory with malloc does not prevent the memory error if the free call inside the dosomething method is incommented
i m very sorry for the long question but i thought instead of dividing the question into several post it is more convenient if they are put into one place
as long as the dataframe is small your assumption that the put process is faster than the get seems true we can fetch all 5 items within one loop of while not q.empty
ubuntu 12.04 ships with the ffmpeg fork libav in version 0.8 which is more compatible with ffmpeg 1.0+ or even later ffmpeg versions iirc
the desktop tablet version is working fine its when the screens gets smaller and the smartphone version loads the image doesn t work as it should
my only problem is that is seems that using uicollectionview is a better approach and i have read some seemingly off-hand comments about icarousel being a poor approach
the for-loop will take too long if my arrays has more than 100 items
in a heap when there is any change in the heap insert delete update then the heap is restructured in a way such that the common priniciple is maintained in above case the parent remains always smaller than its children
binding threads to cores prevents the operating system from moving around threads between different processors cores which speeds up the executing especially on numa systems machines with more than one cpu sockets and separate memory controller in each socket where data locality is very important
you should use a for-loop which is more convenient to loops in an arrays
as for production side of things upgrading your database in transaction msi-style installation is much better than attempting to upgrade at each app startup since you can potentially end up with desynchronized database-application versioning
multiplication and division is even more complicated but it s possible to do using a similar system
you may also want to look at aquamacs which currently has a beta for the latest emacs and offers somewhat better os x integration than the default build
postgresql is faster than mysql s innodb
i could do a post but get is much faster
innodb is slower than myisam but in which cases
innodb is relatively newer than myisam and is transaction safe
branching around whether it is with goto or break just makes it harder
so if you re on such a processor and if you have no dependencies in your code you don t need the result of one sin computation in order to start the next one then you probably won t get much faster than using sin and cos directly as they will be fully pipelined achieving an effective rate of 1 per cycle
this is due to the fact that profiling need to instrumentation the code to keep track of invocations - this can interfere with the jit s ability to inline those methods and the instrumentation overhead becomes significantly larger than the time spent actually executing the methods body
you can take a look on gradle which for me could provide more freedom than maven but is easier to use than ant
i thought there were quite a few more with list foldable traversable but it looks like most were made more generic some time ago as i only see the old less generic type signatures in old stack overflow message board questions
if there is a run for a particular serialnum earlier than the minimum date of the range it won t be excluded
if you are working on physical machine that has cable and wireless connectivity then you will have more than one ethernet adaptor choise
not all of the reasons given are necessarily valid but one important one is that unless you re google server-side cpu cycles are a lot more valuable than client-side cycles so it s easier to have the client compile optimize what is quite often dynamically generated html javascript rather than the server
the ienumerable side of linq which works on in-memory objects that are already in the heap will almost certainly perform better than the iqueryable side which exists to be translated into a native query language like sql
the difference between crc32 and md5 is that md5 generates a larger hash that s harder to predict
as i understand it web2py supports gae better out of the box than django
according to benchmark both sefan and the while loops answers take the same ammount of time fruity the while loops answers take a bit shorter with the for-loop answers in second but the multiple loops do answers take far longer
so why is google-chrome less efficient than firefox and ie
are compiled-language better than interpreted-language or vice-versa
since the upgrade the content authors are complaining that the experience editor performance is much slower than previous versioning
this could mean that put is now slower than get and we have to wait
while openmpi supports more connection protocols there is an infiniband-enabled version of mpich called mvapich
performance of programs in compiled-language is significantly better than that of an interpreted-language
there seem to be some issues in the windows phone framework and in the windows store framework in fact related to elements that are children of other elements and how when the parent element has been destroyed the framework thinks the child element still belongs to it elements can t have more than one parent
using a database system such as sqlite or mysql that follows the acid principles is much more easy as the database system guarantees consistency atomicity of the transactions isolation and durability
firefox is more technically correct in this case as it outputs the state of the object at each point in the loop whereas google-chrome is apparently waiting until the end of the loop to output each console.log but i m not aware of a standards specification that covers the console host object
some newer with backbone only and older with marionette since marionette uses backbone both uses underscore.js
large objects google gson performs faster than jackson and simple json
however i m not really much of an emacs user and the preferences menu in aquamacs is less than clear on where and how one might make such a change
and now i have learned that innodb uses more memory at-least while reading than myisam engine so i am trying to change the default engine of mysql to use myisam
the biggest difference that can be produced between the two of them will always be to quicksort s detriment and it involves lists that are already largely sorted or contain a large number of ties when quicksort does better than mergesort the difference will not be nearly so great
socket tcp udp uploading is slower than native windows copy when there are more than 1 clients
it works as i want but it looks a bit messy and i ve read that sometimes breaking from an outer for-loop within a .each loops is more neatly achieved with javascript
mysql does a lot of implicit type conversions postgresql is rather more strict and requires you to say exactly what you mean
myisam is faster in data warehousing situations such as full table scan reporting etc.. but innodb can actually be faster in many cases with normal oltp queries
i don t want to use myisam because innodb is more advanced
you might benefit from combining each proj into a single war but i do think this is really one of those the grass is always greener problems
in fact each uiview has even more than 1 corresponding calayer
in google-chrome typeof is slower than the other two but in firefox it is the fastest
2 if your host machine laptop doesn t have more ram then you might want to find alternative android-emulator like genymotion bluestacks which takes less memory than android-emulator
my understanding is that although dbcontext is newer it s not necessarily better than objectcontext it just provides a different api that might be considered simpler but doesn t that depend on the use case
better use apc on apache server it will be much faster than memcached because you don t need to make a tcp ip call to connect to memcached
if you want to do more than just get the uniq output you could put your own java class or command line program rather than use usr bin uniq
based on the output in this example one conflict is that datalab currently has oauth2client version 1.4.12 installed and the google-api-python-client library requires a version of oauth2client that is greater than or equal to 2.0.0
having different ones based upon screens size is reasonable bigger margins on tablet though the mix then would be something like res values dimens.xml and res values-sw720dp values.xml
this is better than normal findviewbyid because the views are create on compilation and are injected automatically inside the activity at oncreate being way more efficient than your standard initialization
you can also use any editors likes sublimetext aptana which gives better flexibility to write code for beginners
the basic one and i think the simplest is okhttp but you have to understand that okhttp is no more supported but still work when you downgrade your sdkversion the best solution is to use volley or retrofit
so a protected is more restrictive than public and private is more restrictive than protected
seaborn is a higher level library above matplotlib
it seems like udp will more efficient than tcp
the operations are always algebraically simple never involving anything more than addition multiplication subtraction division and taking powers
if you didn t implement comparable and didn t supply a comparator it is much better to error out than to just silently sort your list in semi-random order
for instance zeromq can leverage udp multicast to run faster than any tcp protocol but the application programmer doesn t need to learn a new api
mockito s a much older library than jmockit so you could expect that it would have many more features
the benefit of both apache is more powerful and extensible useless if you don t need that power but anyway... and lighttpd is faster at static content
while not really a console skulpt.org runs python code client-side with no plugins or anything which makes it a lot faster than a server-side prompt
quicksort is worse complexity than mergesort in the worst case.
if you switch between portrait and landscape when viewing this on an ipad3 you ll need to refresh the browser window between switches you can see that portrait mode is choppier than landscape
this all works well and good in firefox but when i try it in google-chrome which supports more html5 features it tries to load the url undefined in whatever directory i m in
i have simplified the app so the post is shorter but the basic problem is that if i get test in workouthandler - it cannot recognize methods in wardenstrategies or loginhelper unless i also include those files in the handler they are already included in app.rb
pyenv operates on a wider scale than virtualenv - it holds a register of python installations and can be used to install new ones and allows you to configure which version of python to run when you use the python command
the reason for not having strcpy i m guessing is that strcpy can be replaced more efficiently with memcpy for constant strings and if the string is not constant strcpy is a bit more complicated than memcpy anyway so not as beneficial to make inline optimisations for
in most cases quicksort will run faster than mergesort even though the worst-case execution time is longer
server-side checks are better than client-side
1 in-place merge sort is used when you want to sort a list in o nlogn time while using less space than standard mergesort
if it s only an accessor getter giving back some data than a properties fits better
for more complex reports you ll need to have more control over grouping and sorting controlling the order of both
there is an addon that can even remove the menu bar Ã¢ you ll need to learn keyboard shortcuts this is a good idea anyway moving a hand to from the mouse is much slower
but this is not a good regex because matches zero or more times with greedy for every search it will go to the end then it will backtracking to match the
a trie is better than a binary search tree for searching elements
udp is a connectionless protocol which has zero error-checking it is that is the trade-off with tcp it is faster than tcp
i would say behat + mink is more useful for that purpose
but under what circumstances is the bellman-ford algorithm better than the dijkstra algorithm
strncmp is more secure than strcmp
it works similarly to mxmlc and compc but compiles faster
jvectormap comes with more pre-generated maps than jqvmap
ps i d suggest using lodash instead of underscore.js if possible as lodash development is more active but that s my opinion
one important reason is because hex is alot shorter and easier to read than binary is for humans
we know that myisam is faster than innodb when we don t have many concurrent updates inserts
you can create custom controller to serve that files and use send_file mentod in it with disposition inline also you may be interested to x_sendfile_header setting to serwe that files with apache nginx which is faster
recursive is usually used for traversal and binary search tree but this tree is more similar to trie of only 2 character in alphabet
you can change your database to myisam -- i m guessing you re only reading from the tables in the database otherwise if you have read write transactions innodb is the better choice
the game will be a graphical roguelike 2d rpg requiring more than libtcod ncurses but no 3d graphics thats why i m using pyglet for now
if you re looking for a ctrlp equivalent webstorm has a fuzzyfinder that s actually much more powerful than ctrlp
we found redmine to be a better than trac simply because it is easier to use
some people say get can be less safe than post -- but to the seasoned user this doesn t make any significant difference because they can intercept and modify headers of the request
i think safari renders the moves better than google-chrome
i have a smaller uiview as a subviews to the main uiview on my uiviewcontroller
upgrade_250 the wordpress 2.5.0 upgrade will be run if the database versioning is less than 7499. each of these functions run their own data migration and population procedures some of which are called during the initial database setup script
by these numbers and only these numbers vhdl seems to be more widely-used than verilog
i prefer the bash c for-loop it doesn t require conditionals to escape loops and looks neater
i don t think you should make the assumption that udp is faster than tcp
i don t think there can be more than one get or post per request but per open connection certainly
if it s faster than sin cos then you can use the identity
or taking a leaf out of friedi s book taking advantage of sorting the array first but using reduce instead of filtering which is slightly simpler because it means we do not need a iife to close around a previous item
after jgauffin suggestion i used johnskeet code and found that the for-loop with arrays is faster than following
does that mean the the view controller has multiple uiview or that the uiview has more than one calayer
because there s so many differences between browser s javascript engines as you notice with firefox and google-chrome it s harder to do code optimizations for all of them
using compatibility as the central point in the versioning number makes it easier for users especially if te product is a library to judge whether or not they can expect a smoothe and safe upgrade or not
there is a big discussing between object-oriented and procedural approaches and more generally between declarative and imperative ones and each approach has its upsides and downsides
innodb does support transactions and referential integrity but the trade-off is that it is a bit slower than myisam
headline qqmlapplicationengine is newer and more powerful than qquickview
but in many cases addition is faster than multiplication
if you don t understand the subtleties between push vs pull architecture then i recommend that you start with xmlreader because pull is simpler to understand and easier to visualize
i noticed calayer had worse performance than uiview
generally speaking dfa is faster but nfa is more compact
1 split those tests to unit and acceptance and use a tool like codeception to help you do acceptance which is way more elegant than phpunit for this kind of test
what you re looking for is linear regression and scikit-learn is much better than nltk for this see
i d say iqueryable is more suitable for interaction with a database than ienumerable is
in safari it is several pixels higher up than in firefox and google-chrome and significantly lower in opera
i ended up using scriptaculous for most of my animations simply because it provides smoother animations and more configurable than what jquery ui provides
udp is extremely faster than tcp which is suitable to stream a user s voice input
i m looking for suggestions for a workable stack a good ui framework that will work well with ember.js or an alternatives Ã¢ perhaps i would be better off with angular and ionic etc
my speed test claims that svg is significantly faster than canvas at least snap.svg seems to be significantly faster than fabricjs
they are slower less efficient than addition subtraction but they are much faster than looping and doing repeated additions
why is innodb so much slower than myisam in my case
according to some benchmark tests lxml is nearly 100 times faster than beautifulsoup
in a for-loop of more than 100 loops
minitest has much more than most people know for example minitest spec has bdd matchers akin to rspec minitest mock is a mocking system and minitest benchmarking is for performance profiling
if size is known normally a non-naive implementation of memcpy is faster than strcpy since it takes profit of the cpu s data bus size
x86 doesn t support higher precision than 80 bits but if you really need more than 64bit for a fp algorithm most likely you should check your numerics instead of solving the problem with brute force
as a pragmatist i m inclined to use get because implementing it is way simpler than post
the sensible thing is to use ant or maven maven is easier better in most cases
base r seems to work fine in linux windows 10 uses 20gb of disc space whereas ubuntu only needs a few gb the ram needed with ubuntu is slightly lower
the main problem i know is the while loops the logic behind it is not correct because last didah is always bigger than n for-loop counter
it uses less overhead than smb cifs and therefore acchieves greater performance - also - there are many versions of smb in many versions of windows that might not be compatible with each other
there is a perception that udp is faster than tcp but i think it depends on the situation - take a look at this discussion for some further discussion on speed reliability etc between udp and tcp go down through all the high scored answers
as you ve already said ant is more a replacement for gnu make while maven is primary a buildout dependency-management application
shellcheck tends to be more explicit than bash
in wireshark i note that the number of cipher algorithms being presented by ie is a lot less than firefox and google-chrome
it might have been faster for listing whole directory but when filtering out files and only accepting folder it takes far more time
it s horses for courses personally i m much happier with textmate or vim and a nice cup of coffee but it s what feels more comfortable to you
there is a difference between the different storage engines though myisam is faster for a lot of select innodb is faster for a lot of insert update because it uses row locking instead of table locking and the way it handles indexes
if you want to store text data only using textarea or textbox is easier
in my fragments data handling is taking place starting from oncreate which happens earlier than onstart
very small object google gson performs faster than jackson and simple json
even though they re hash salt it s still better that attackers do not see them
things like cmd c dir don t know why - and yes i do cmd c dir in cases i am in some kind of shared network folder with thousands of files and ls is significantly slower than dir
however i read that swift was the successor of objective-c and i would feel more comfortable with swift syntax
again though the time profiling instrumentation is far better suited to the job and it definitely works
i would say vaadin would be easier over wicket as the default ui elements look really good
the idea is that if they are using ie then they must install google-chrome frame and if they are using less than firefox 4 or opera 11.5 then they must upgrade their browser not not sure if the way i am doing that is correct
historically floating-point could be much slower than integer arithmetic
today png is much more popular than tiff so if you re writing files outside of your own data store png would be a more common choice and you d need to work through nsimagerep to get there
i did some reading on kombu and it seems to be able to do what i m thinking of although at a much lower level than celery
update for our purposes bltoolkit ended up being a better solution than nhibernate
when i expand the widgets on the left pane by clicking on the controls and the height of the qwidget of the qscrollarea is bigger than then height of the qscrollarea itself the scrollbar appears as expected but it s overlapping the content of the qscrollarea
i m looking to see if anyone has a workable solution so i can basically switching between this big banner and a smaller format for mobile browsers where the screens size is smaller and doesn t break my responsive site
one of the reasons we want to move is because swift is more secure than objective-c
when i posted this on facebook someone said that since firefox is open source project developers optimized math.min but google-chrome didn t since google-chrome is just a modification of chromium but beside that above statement is not quite right that makes no sense because that doesn t explain the reason why google-chrome s and firefox s math.min a b performs in similar speed and google-chrome s math.min a b and firefox s performs in same speed because if firefox is faster than google-chrome then google-chrome s math.min a b should be much slower than firefox s
tcp sockets- guaranteed delivery bigger payload than udp cumbersome to setup for web based solutions
it would be better to use malloc over calloc unless we want the zero-initialization because malloc is faster than calloc
i think fasta might be better at finding alignments between dissimilar sequences than blast but blast is better at aligning similar sequences
also forgot to mention junit testing framework and a great eclipse plugin eclemma for code coverage much better than cobertura ecobertura and easier to use and of course you can try maven as the other post mentionned or try ant as build tool
you might have even noticed the fgetc version is simpler than the fread version
judging from the benchmarks posted on the pypy speed center it appears as if pypy is faster than cpython for all but two of the tests presented
because i heard that for-loop is much faster than foreach loops
btw i believe that in some weird cases you might get 0 as the number of bytes returned by write a non-blocking pipe or socket - but that is generally the eagain error - or some weird socket there are more than tcp or udp sockets
im trying very hard to like virtualbox but so far i find it so much worse than vmware in so many ways
i want test unix-like operating systems on historicial computers like commodore amiga atari st and i386 cpu and run posix compatible apps like pkgsrc x window system and blackbox wm for 40mhz higher versions minix 1.5 is best os for those systems better than netbsd but it is not posix-compatible
i looked it up and the logical-or operator has a higher precedence than the conditional operator and the conditional operator has right-to-left associativity
which java profiler is better jprofiler or yourkit
also i d use fgets rather than scanf as it is inherently safer for the same reason that printf is safer than printf
innodb is a better choice as myisam is really old engine and would fade away in near future
there are many reasons why git-svn is worse and the kde svn2git is superior
i would like to apply a hash code solution on my webpage which is more compact than md5 and sha-1 because i want to use them as keys in a json hash table
possibly part of the reason of my problems is that the original code from ramnath uses rmaps while i m using rcharts also developed by ramnath as it is more developed better integrated with shiny and of course includes leaflet
i tend to prefer leaving the cors handling to the http server nginx apache it gives more flexibility to the people deploying your app
instead knowing that we want to grouping by these columns we can make the application code to do so simpler by sorting by these fields
to our suprise innodb took hours more than myisam
just wanted to weigh in my two cents what serialworm and thephpdeveloper said share the fact that memory ram is much faster than any disk io bound operation you come up with
wondering if there is an easier way with a for-loop - looping through an arrays or similar
for example try hiding a dom of of 200+ children in google-chrome vs safari vs firefox you will notice google-chrome takes 20+ sec safari takes 5+ seconds firefox takes less than 1 second
font looks sharp in google-chrome safari ie8 not as good as other 2 but less fuzzy than firefox
generator expressions are generally preferred to map and using the dictionary constructor is more canonical than dict.fromkeys
i suggest that you start with scheme and then move on to common lisp as scheme is simpler
i wrote a detailed description of the sstable format on scylla s site scylla is a more efficient c++ re-implementation of cassandra to which i contribute
if there is network congestion rate limiting or traffic profiling or if the udp message size is larger than the mtu
speaking about usability personally i would prefer gnutls api but at the time openssl looks more preferable to use
a for-loop is more natural for this than a while loops
innodb tables are even slower than myisam tables for inserts and the delayed key write option is not available
for what it s worth the while loops is a safer and more idiomatic way to loops over a file s lines in a shell script than the for-loop with backticks even though you see that a lot
apc access is a bit faster something like 5 times faster than memcached if i remember correctly as it s only local -- no network involved
so i repeat and clarify my question from the heading how would i split the byear column into three or more columns with or spaces as delimiter
regarding weblogic and jboss i d prefer jboss weblogic is more complex
the first load involves reading alot from the hard disk which is slow even ssd is slower than ram subsequent loads should be faster though 3 seconds on the ssd seem to be odd
some people may argue with me on this one but i find pypy to be faster than cpython
agreed that using odp.net is better than deprecated system.data.oracleclient

i realized that emacs would load slower than vim but this seems ridiculous for a fresh install
i also know implements runable is better than extends thread
can anyone explain why heapsort performs better and under what circumstances quichesort would be better than both quicksort and heapsort
because fink is reputedly more stable than macports and has many more packages
the first thing i ve noticed that in ie version 8 to be specific a callback attached to window.scroll or .resize seemed to fire so many times more than in google-chrome or firefox while resizing the window or scrolling
as of now i think dotcover and resharper combined are less expensive than ncover
the only scenario in which post is slightly less susceptible is that many websites that arenÃ¢ t under the attackerÃ¢ s control say a third-party forum allow embedding arbitrary images allowing the attacker to inject an arbitrary get request but prevent all ways of injecting an arbitary post request whether automatic or manual
also calculating md5 hash is significantly faster than sha-256 and should be favored for performance reasons for any application that doesn t rely on the hash for security purposes
cdi is so much more mature than seam 2 bijection jsf 2 is so much easier than jsf 1.2 that any kind of application development will simply be much more fun with seam 3
i am not sure it can satisfy you but hebrew test is 4 times slower than persian
because it appears that your filtering are not mutually exclusive that is a data point can be in more than one filtering grouping i think that your best bet is likely to make a vector of your filtering then loops through that vector though i would use lapply instead of a for-loop
i ve found some things online that state that the height must always be greater than the width and have seen in the java source checks for this with accompanying messages that this is the case but cannot find a reason why
is there a way to load it in node.js or is there another proxy that can be used to monitor changes in array for server-side code that will work far greater than client-side code as it will be receiving yuge requests
or if you feel more comfortable with webclient i personnally prefer it over webrequest
dotnetzip is much easier to use than sharpziplib example of zipping all files in folder
it will continue to be available but since opus is better than speex in all aspects users are encouraged to switch
i ve found that in my jtable which is in a jscrollpane nested in a jinternalframe there can be issues with scrolling and resizing when the jtable was larger than the jscrollpane
however some things ant handles better than maven and if there s not a maven plugin for it it may be difficult to handle in maven
while dotnetnuke is a much bigger market it seems to be crowded with a lot of competition versus umbraco which is smaller but it looks like it lacks modules in certain categories
when using yslow or pagespeed which is a better tool try and use control+f5 to refresh your page so the site is forced reloaded without any offline files
janusgraph is a more up-to-date version of titan despite the low version number
however if you don t have specific reasons to use anycpu then you could still use x86 because in some cases the performances are better than 64bit code
nunit is more popular because it was there first therefore more articles about it on the web and better tooling and because most programmers don t care about or need the advanced features that mbunit offers
also about firefox i know still less than google-chrome and i m not sure about how it innerly manage resources among threads and if it is even possible to achieve what i want but if possible i d need to do the same work with firefox threads
bellman-ford as suggested in your question tends to be slower than either dijkstra s or a - it is primarily used when there are negative edge-weights which there are not here
since im using fixtures would this maybe be a db cleaner issue im not using it right now as im only using pre-created fixtures currently i ve never used db cleaner with minitest as im only familiar with using it with rspec and factory girl
if you don t want to remember or google up all those methods every time you need to iterate an arrays just stick to the good old for-loop which is way faster anyway
now i m not sure if i d say postgresql is generally better than mysql -- there are certainly things that mysql does much better and so it certainly has its uses -- but these are a few things i absolutely love about it
as many people have noted the average case performance for quicksort is faster than mergesort
mmmm graphicsmagick is somewhat less developed than imagemagick in many respects
alternatively zen-cart looks simpler than magento but without some of the flexibility

the aes key is encrypting much more data but is much faster than rsa encryption
while webclient may appear to be easier to use than httpwebrequest it is less flexible and will automatically perform it s callback on the ui thread and if you re downloading files in the background you almost certainly don t want this
i expected avx to be about 1.5x faster than sse
you are better off with jacoco than cobertura
i m assuming using https without a ssl certificate is atleast more secure than doing the exact same connection over plain http since atleast it s encrypted and an evildoer would have to make a much larger effort to intercept en decrypt the information
though all data is usually unsafe basically user data sessions are safer than the post or get or cookie or simply request and some server variables since you set it yourself
and now we know that for-loop is faster than while-loop
used to be firefox but google-chrome is nicer out of the box
it s said to be better than udp or tcp for communicating by processes in the same os windows xp here
google-chrome is more flexible in this sense than firefox which is why it works there
grafana is more of visualization only while kibana is for searching the logs is that right
sergio suggested nginx + unicorn or nginx + puma but nginx + passenger which replaces unicorn puma is much easier to setup performs great uses less memory works better and has more features
to use this in a loops you can write a simple for-loop which always checks if the index stil is smaller than the arrays length
i know gitolite better than gitosis
storing that info on the server-side is probably more common with the client-side only given his the session cookie
myisam uses less memory than innodb and the actual data files are often quite a bit larger for innodb
firefox is more picky about characters that are set in uris than google-chrome
why is ie setting the readystate to complete so much earlier than google-chrome and firefox
however i wonder if this is the best way of doing this if you want to observe specific behaviour you might be better off isolating a specific input file and debugging against a local pseudo-cluster and if you want system metrics you could do worse than give ganglia a lookm as it is pretty mauch already built into hadoop
theoretically udp should be be 30-50 faster than tcp because it s missing the extra trip for the ack and has a smaller header overhead however in reality there are many cases where tcp would outperform udp just because of congestion control
and else is explained why requestanimationframe is better than setinterval or settimeout
did i configure something wrong with kairosdb or opentsdb is actually faster
the function then allocates space to a new pointer with malloc and does a memcpy operation or loop-and-copy although memcpy is probably better
with typical libraries on common modern hardware sqrt is faster than atan2
nginx can be configured to only respond to requests matching a predefined pattern far easier than with apache
in java you can call option s isempty isdefined and get without any special hassle the really useful option methods such as getorelse are another matter. checking the result of the isdefined method in an if-clause should be faster than checking exception-handling in a try-catch block
if you still would love to manage onclicklistener i will tell why onitemclicklistener is much better than onclicklistener
the reason it happens is to enable you to work with int which is faster than working with chars values
innodb seems slightly faster than myisam but this is really marginal
if your getter takes more than one argument it s not called a setter anymore

gson is simpler jackson is faster
after running a modified version of esailija s jsfiddle test to include the documentfragment it doesn t seem to make any difference in google-chrome or opera for that matter so it appears as though google-chrome is simply slower
emacs or vim is not significantly better than vim or emacs
is type get faster than type post cause i am curious how both work
i ve used both for the same project boost is better integrated with the stl and especially c++ exceptions
postgresql with the optional hstore module might be better than mysql at this.
if the taskproperty class is decorated with datacontract attribute and with datamember attribute for each property the deserialization is much faster than when it is decorated with serializable attribute
if you want to do a split slice operation on a pie charts first you need to create a pie charts with slices.here from what i understand you tried to give the option split charts first which actually is to make differrent pie charts in the same row or column which needs more than one pie-chart
vba being a whole lot less than vb6
instead of net http i can use httparty curb rest client or typhoeus which makes everything easier but i can t find any similar solutions to replace enhance net ftp
the data type text requires more space in ram and on disk is slower to process and more error prone
another reason but rather a minor one is that get is easier to exploit that post as there are more ways to trigger get request than to trigger post request
for listening changes into jtextcomponent is there documentlistener if you have to need control over inputed char sings whitespace chars or word s you have to implements documentfilter
udp is connection less but at the same level as tcp
secondly if you want the superclass variables to be accessible by your subclassing it s better to use protected than public
the setinterval and settimeout ways you have shown are identical except that setinterval is more clear
but in your case alertview is displayed above alertcontroller ie why it feels like uialertview is whitier than uialertcontroller
i would recommend lxml for html parsing it s simple and considerably faster than beautifulsoup can be as much as two orders of magnitude
in general avoid awt for swing which has much greater power and flexibility although it too is showing its age just less so than awt
should i use settimeout or setinterval which is better
by splitting mousedown and mouseup there is less runtime parsing no checking events less code per run of each etc
i think you would like lemp e stands for the nginx and for a lot small projects it would be better than apache
if you use a where clause though it changes the execution pattern to use indexes so in general innodb will be slower than myisam on full unrestricted counts where as the performance matches up on restricted counts
under a gnu linux distribution like ubuntu everything is much more easier and you can just plug in your device without installing anything you just have to set the right permissions for the device once
first if you generically want to apply the same function to each element of an arrays and there isn t already a built in vectorized way to do it you could use arrayfun although often a simple for-loop is faster and more readable
when i reload my html pages its button select and checkbox are goes added more and more.because all the html data fetch from a data base and after added new things in the page i store all the html of the page in data base and when i display this page agiain becuase of jquery mobile its button select and checkbox are increased check here visit jsfiddle.net sharma9853 gbe6p 7
ajax calls using get are more performant than post according to yahoo
i know that xlsxwriter is way faster than xlwings and have functionality to add border but it is just a writer it can t update already existing spreadsheet
and also i don t want use for-loop because it would cause trouble if the arrays size becomes bigger
while other algorithms like merge sort and heapsort have a better worst case complexity o nlogn usually quicksort is faster - this is why it s the most common used sorting algorithm
i heard myisam is faster but others say innodb can be fast also but it takes abit more to optimize it
stargazer is at least in my experience more general than latex from hmisc
for an oltp type system innodb is usually more sensible than myisam did you check the contention before trying a different engine
if your sorting needs are more complex than asort or ksort as previously suggested then write a function to plug into uasort
though openrasta looks more mature than wcf web api i m still a bit confused
ant is simpler and older and the default just called a java project maven is newer more powerful and flexible
with all of these declared transitioning between portrait and landscape is much smoother with much less lag
use router-outlet in the parent component and make more than one children route in the routing file
using libjpeg inside cimg is definitely better
magento is way ahead and has larger extensions than opencart
alternatively you can use an ssd with file storage in varnish to reduce disk io bottlenecks when using an object cache larger than available ram
using coalesce is better option than isnull or case..when for this problem since the input values for the coalesce expression can be evaluated multiple times
i would really like not to run both apache and nginx i did switch everything to apache yet found it loaded my proxies slower than nginx
firefox produces more space compared to google-chrome
edit h.265 hevc is even better at compression 50 of h.264 size in some cases but support is not yet widespread so stick with h.264 for now
a major upgrade uninstalls the previous versioning and installs the newer versioning which is most similar to what you ve described though in most cases small updates and minor upgrade are more fitting
i think stateful client stateless server makes you more aware of the amount of data that is transported back and forth between tires
its the multiplying that historically was slower than the add
i tried constraints spacing each imageview with xdp it is ok if all textview are not higher than the imageview but if a textview is higher than a imageview it will overlap
select queries in myisam runs 2x faster then in innodb but the updates and insert queries are much slower in myisam
in terms of speed calloc is likely to be faster than malloc + memset if memory needs to be zeroed out
to be honest i prefer to use tcp but if udp works better then i have to use udp
the use of gevent is also a performant option but slightly lower than eventlet
either way my observation is that reordered stdout stderr output is more prevalent with an eclipse console than when you are using a native console
vb.net is a better language than vb6 use its com capabilities to save you from writing endless sketchy vb6 code
also linearsvc class from scikit-learn performs even better than liblinear whch is also surprising considering that it s a wrapper of liblinear
in java if you want a graphic user interface you can use swt or swing and swing is better than swt
i also think working with seaborn is much easier using pandas dataframes and not numpy arrays
if you ask if a uncompressed wav which contains pcm data is better than mp3 then yes but the question sometimes is how much this better really matters to the human ear and how much postprocessing you have to perform on that data
if i resize the window and a widget with a highcharts is bigger than the window i want to resize it to make it smaller and gridster should recalculate the positions of the others
this is done on an extremely large image and i feel vips might do a better job than opencv on this
i need to connect more than one keyboard mouse with a single computer
i am using custom delegate methods but when i run this the get request is performed earlier than the post so i cannot get the key before the get is done
based on my own experience i would look into a gem like minimagick which provides a nice interface to imagemagick which is a more common library for the tasks you re trying to do
i ll get better with formatting and being more specific with the post
fadeout is simpler because it will hide it for you automatically when it is done so you can save that code and it automatically waits for the animation to be done before hiding the element something your current code was not doing
the position of the list in firefox is always higher than that of google-chrome no matter how i padding or margin the list
all works fine over the past few deploys i had to add some columns to my table and due to upgrade statements that are executed if the old database versioning is lesser then a certain database versioning
tcp has to do a lot of error checking to ensure that your packets don t get dropped and so tcp is much slower than udp

if you care a lot about efficiency or really need tens of thousands of connections then implementing your specific protocol in udp will always be better than tcp
is the performance of pull better than push in this scenario
using apaches httpd.conf is faster since accessing the .htaccess adds a small overheadÃ¢ apache checks every directoryÃ¢ and parent directoryÃ¢ for the file and it will be loaded for every request
since servers omit the working copy you should generally expect server-side bare repositories to be smaller than client-side non-bare repositories
my question is why is malloc + memset so much slower than calloc
this means the amount of data you could pass by using post verb is much more than by using a query string and a get method
this should handle all cases of setting the properties makes them easier to implement in your inherited classes and cleans things up
much faster than serializable deserialization though
i am wondering why brisk detector detects much less keypoint than the orb detector
i need show files from qfilesystemmodel in qtreeview and customize that tree to show one more column with qcheckbox so user can pick 0..n files from that qtreeview
but because of the overhead in the for-loop and the second arrays it is slower as the before mentioned arr.filter as shown by this jsperf
sdwebimage claims that afnetworking doesn t cache the image itself but just the http response so sdwebimage is faster in recalling the image from cache and presenting it
in this case i used one or more spaces as a delimiter s+
on the subject of performance on sql server isnull often performs better than coalesce but the latter is ansi compliant if that is important to you
they merged with dojo which in my opinion is a better choice than dwr
the description is related to objectcontext api but dbcontext api is just wrapper suffering same issues actually dbcontext api suffers even more issues in this scenario and because of that i will skip solution with manually setting relationships
kerberos could be considered as a better option than ntlm
magento is much better if you can find a good magento developer to customize it for you but opencart is easier to use
update just tried it on firefox 30 and it did not experience the same slowdown in a worker thread but it was slower than google-chrome when run in the main thread
with google-chrome safari it s less so
for example setting the background-color on a transparency element turns it black...rather than the intended color.
now that you accept more than simple get post json or xml your model will have to distinguish between each request type and know how to parse them
i haven t played around with it recently but i think bcolz is more flexible here in terms of mixing dtypes but doesn t give you all the pandas dataframe conveniences obviously
in theory encoding client-side is no more dangerous than encoding server-side
puma will tend to optimize itself by spawning more threads and its performance should range from no worse than unicorn in the pure cpu case to being vastly better than unicorn in the case of an app that sleeps a lot
but swift is less dynamically typed than objective-c and has less support for reflection
where application authentication authenticationservice is nothing more than an extends of the zend authentication service and implements the identityproviderinterface
parallel processing is by far a more strict mode of execution of the code-units tasks threads... than just a concurrent run of code-execution simultaneously just by coincidence using more than one cpu or processors core and other shared resources to execute a program or multiple but mutually absolutely independent computational units
i did a lot of research and most people said that split is better than stringtokenizer and bufferedreader
i guess the reason you observe this behaviour with just a guess it could be wrong is because the parent process is terminated earlier than its children so your terminal s prompt is printed before some of the children s output
easier than ncurses would be to use urwid
note that capturing stdout and stderr combined is actually easier
moles is more often compared contrasted to typemock in that it offers a set of facilities outside of moq and or rhinomocks sweet spot
while gulp gruntjs is very popular for build automation which includes bundling all dependent javascript in file and minifying them in to one file webpack browserify is a better option as it supports module import
i had better luck with the x86 one than the 64bit version in win 7
creating elements on mouseover mouseout is much more work on the browser then having those elements created already in the markup with display none
also when your setting up the server i would say start with nginx it s uses less resources than apache
if you really want something with php then i guess bugzilla but imho trac is better
i was expecting that udp would be faster but tcp is on average two times faster than udp
with spreadsheet formulas i don t think that you can do much better than that min max construct
and perl like any interpreted-language is much slower than a compiled-language
either use less ram by either reducing the scope of your project or finding a way to encode your data more densely or use a avr microcontroller that has more ram in the first place such as the atmega1284p
compared to callgrind kcachegrind the profiler runs much faster having max 5 slowdown typically and it s much deeper as to why the code runs slow as it understands vectorization and running in real time means i o profiling is accurate
programmers like to use this property to speed up programs because it s easy to chop off some number of bits but performing a modulo is much harder it s about as hard as doing a division
in xda-forums i read about memu - most powerful android-emulator for pc better than bluestacks
vs.net makes tons of i o calls and ram disk are much faster than real disk
therefore the parfor loops simply must be slower than the for-loop because it has to transmit data to the workers for them to operate on
should i be surprised that the keras theano backend is about 18x - 19x slower than the keras tensorflow backend
at least use xcopy robocopy is even faster
depending on your specific situation these two handlers tend to be better choices than using mouseover and mouseout due to the way they handle event bubbling for descendants of the bound objects
and if you have to convert to the same case to make comparisons toupper is better than tolower
recently someone suggested to me that division is always more expensive than multiplication
i give up using popupwindow and use dialog instead after some tests i found dialog is far better than popupwindow there are quite a few problems with popupwindow
but if codeigniter has a bit too much bloat for you maybe you can try kohana which is a bit less bloated than codeigniter started as a fork
i have a similar problem to this question only i am not learning generics so want a practical solution and my method is returning more than an int or a double
if you are developing your hbase application in java i recommend using the raw hbase api - that is more powerful than thrift rest avro etc
than use bcpow on the integer part and bc_exp on the fractions part which now converges from the get-go since the fractions part is smaller than 1
here is the blog post about the comparison how tidekit would be better than tidesdk
recently i ve stumbled upon a parralel.for loops that performs way better than a regular for-loop for my purposes
gitolite is maintained has a dozen features more than gitosis and the author actually responds to emails
a dictionary map makes more sense here not an array of arrays
tcp socket is even more likely than udp socket but both work
pypy has a higher recursion limit than cpython normally
like bruz says cappuccino is probably more freeform at the data layer than sproutcore
splinter simpler than selenium
for a few bytes passed in just one call probably the bufferedwriter is even worse because it problably later calls fileoutputstream
the bson becomes even more annoying to work with when exporting data from mongo to another db platform this is the case when dealing with big data that is collected and you want to merge it with some properties from the back office mongodb this means a lot of pain you need to transform the binary objectid to a string in order to join with the id in different platforms that do not use bson representation
in my opinion post requests are not more secure than get requests and the data can be easily intercepted
wxhaskell is probably a little easier to build if you are not on linux gtk2hs is likely easier if you are linux hosted but both are pretty complex to build to be honest as there are a significant number of dependencies in both cases
try to increase timeout value tcp is slower than udp
i know that perl performs better for some regex but will the tcl performance really be this bad in comparison
i am not going into how to do rewrites on nginx because it is much more complicated than apache
with the transitive dependencies declared even if they are used explicitly the maven pom.xml becomes more verbose
alternatively you could accept a-za-z0-9 0 4000 note the space which should get you more than one words but probably not anything after the first punctuation
firstly post can seem more secure than get
a dawg has better memory performance if the strings have many common suffixes but they are more expensive and difficult to build and update so start with a trie
it shows that rsa encrypt is faster then aes encrypt
with subclassing is trickier because any private members of a class are not inherited by the subclassing but protected and public are
addition is cheaper than multiplication
3des is more expensive than aes for example
not sure about this but multiplication should take more time than addition so it s slowing it down ex
sorteddictionary offers same advantages than sortedlist but performs better if values to insert are not already sorted
naturally interpreted-language will run slower than compiled-language as compiled code can be ran blindly by the cpu where as compiled code needs to be checked ran line by line
i have read about ienumerable and iqueryable i have read that iqueryable is better with linq because when you use where clauses it creates the exact query it needs but with ienumerable it retrieves all rows from database and then filters on memory
what i find strange is that the getter for distance depends on status and the setter acts more like a setter for status
if your company s concern is to avoid big unknown libraries which is prefectly understandable i d advise you to stick with lwjgl which is smaller that jogl
use robocopy it s much more powerful than xcopy
i speak of great experience in this area as i have developed my own cms over a cumulation of years and selling the cms becomes even much tougher as joomla wordpress and drupal have a price point that you cannot complete with
my app is a python wsgi with cherrypy and works perfectly in appfog but i don t wan t cherrypy to serve static content i think that apache or nginx is a better option for that
since we are dealing with images and changing them on change of select i would prefer changing the src of image rather than using show hide method.it is more simpler
i know this can be achieved with junit but in my experience it is easier with testng
xcb is simpler to use has a better response to a multithread environment but lacks documentation while xlib is a more dated complex tool better documented and fully implemented
3c why does my uiviewcontroller which is inside my uinavigationcontroller has a longer height than the uinavigationcontroller
pbkdf2 is more secure than a simple hash or even a salt hash
filtering on the grouping data is more processing-intensive because the grouping must be completed first
the memcpy to memmove which peforms faster
you didn t elaborate on that point but if you were simply looking for a more secure algorithm than md5 take a look at hash coupled with an algorithm like sha512
using qmap instead of qhash seems more reasonable as neox recommended on his comment
for some reason fadein works better than show or simply removing a hidden class via removeclass if you take that approach
the capturing group 1 in the first pattern is greedy it first matches everything and takes as less as it backtracking
in firefox it takes some more time compared to google-chrome safari
now do i have to make a query so that tuples v1 v2 are selected where the max review of v2 is strictly less than the min review of v1
i have tried weka too but mallet is smarter than weka on this aspect
myisam has some problems with many recordings and other bugs and innodb is now better
i had the same problem with jsdom and switcht to cheerio which is much faster than jsdom and works even after scanning hundreds of sites
as a rule of thumb multiplication is faster than division on all cpus
is this due to firefox being more strict than google-chrome
you can use udp as well but if you are dealing with firewalls it is probably going to be simpler with tcp
i m sticking with firefox debugging of my angular 2 app outside of vs code as its user experience is better than google-chrome especially when working with typescript files so i ll stick with that for now unless i can figure this out
it should be noted that interpreted-language are inherently many time slower than natively compiled-language
pig in general has a very limited number of evaluation functions and when you start doing things a bit more complicated than min max count you need to get comfortable with writing udfs
in my testing google-chrome is nicer it pops-up the unresponsive alert whereas firefox apparently doesn t care
for instance for this really_trivial class i just assume that move semantics cannot offer anything more than return-value-optimization and nrvo already does when copying around instances of it
so what makes geddy significantly better than connect
i remember somewhere i have read that calloc is slower than malloc because calloc performs initialization to zero after performing memory allocation
assuming that you are building a webapp jspm is more suitable for managing your frontend dependencies than npm
if your objects are sparse then a quadtree or related data structure r-tree etc. is probably better
which will lead to performance issue all programs will be work slower because read info from disk is slower than from ram
some protocols are more complex because what s needed are some but not all of the features of tcp but more than what udp provides
gnu gdb fedora 6.8-37.el5 or gnu gdb gdb redhat enterprise linux 7.0.1-37.el5
mysql is more widely supported and a little easier to use but postgresql has some very cool features and functionality that s worth taking a gander at
also note that it is easy to implement your own stack on top of udp that performs worse than tcp
based on what you have provided i cannot tell if google-chrome actually does load faster than firefox
during my tests of innodb v myisam i found that when i did resolve any contention issues the innodb model was 40 slower than myisam
i suspect codeigniter doesn t have quite as flexible a structure it s smaller and lighter than cakephp but a quick look at the cakephp manual to see how behaviors components helpers and the vendors folder may be helpful
the draft c++11 standard tells us that unless stated otherwise the order of evaluations of operands are unsequenced and if the same scalar object is modified more that once by unseqeucend side effects than we have undefined behavior
remember malloc is quite expensive action and free costs even much more than malloc
see but if you are using a linux distro there may be shortcut instructions that make it simpler under ubuntu for example there are shortcuts in
for general testing phpunit is a more well-established product while behat is focussed on tests written using bdd methodology behaviour driven design
with one arrays one can do which is easier than a for-loop
why do people say cakephp is somewhat harder than codeigniter for people new to mvc
as disk is 1000s of times slower than ram as the memory usage increases your machine grinds more and more closer to a halt
i find using system monitor that consistently 100 of one cpu is used when i run the program directly in terminal whereas when i run it in bash in a loop a maximum of 60 of cpu usage is recorded and seems to be linked to the longer completion time although the average cpu usage is higher over the 4 processors
in safari 10.0.3 cloneelement is 31 slower for the jsperf test mentioned above in google-chrome createelement is 17 slower for me
keep in mind however that following the robustness principle of be conservative in what you send liberal in what you accept the interpretation of int in the boolean context is somewhat more relaxed
it s not clear to me what you want but i ll mention that the date class also has a compareto method which can be used to determine with one call if two date objects are equals or if they aren t equals which occurs sooner
additionally ajax is nothing more than get or post requests that a script carries out for you asynchronously allowing you to use the server responses in a document without reloading the entire page
google-chrome is more permissive with delimiters when it comes to dates thus formatting the date with dashes works with google-chrome but not with firefox
if you have more than one ethernet wireless cards name might change a bit.
2.the division by 2 can be done by bit - shift operation is it really slower than addition
i know summernote does that but fckeditor is a more complete tool than summernote so i cant switch to that
a table is generated using nested while loops and i do understand that a for-loop is more suited for this and got it working using one
h.264 is more often encapsulated in mp4 container and vp8 in mkv
postgresql is good too but mysql is undoubtedly more popular and you re going to find more hosts that provide you a mysql database for instance if that matters
so using easymock with junit should give you better coverage and better tests than junit alone
here is a screenshot of how it is displayed on internet explorer better than firefox but not centered like in google-chrome
textcontainer s height need to be set depending on the content height for it to work and that is no better than using uitextview or uilabel
an unsigned 64-bit integer type requires compiler support which your compiler lacks so you cannot create it sorry
the second quote suggests that without jit using a trivial getter setter is slower than direct field access eg
if you are sending stuff there are a lot more considerations than just shipping costs you may need to fill in specific tax forms for some countries and depending on what your site is selling you may need special processing for some countries try sending coffee to thailand -- you need to obtain permission from thier ministry of agriculture
adfs has more powerful claims transformation capabilities than acs
evidently though mod-alias can be somewhat faster than mod-rewrite all other things being equal of course
not only is nginx supposedly faster than apache at delivering static content but this also offloads your rails application for every image stylesheet javascript or whatever other static content
a document in mongodb is more or less like a json structure bson to be specific
i ve been attempting to upgrade to php 7.1 using phpbrew and elected to install it with nginx as i read everywhere that it was simpler than apache not that simple in my humble opinion
cakephp is newer more feature rich and heavier than codeigniter codeigniter is designed to have a much smaller footprint so you will most likely find yourself creating functionality in codeigniter to match cake s
here is a bash script that can use after you installed bash from msys or you can sort it with a linux box - ubuntu is no bigger than 800mb and can run as livecd without interfering your current windows system and the livecd can double as a system saver when needed
is it because google-chrome has much better javascript support than firefox
when get is better than post
gave up and switched to sharpziplib as it doesn t blow up on simple extract but sure would be nice to know what was wrong with dotnetzip it has a nicer api
which doesn t do what you want because multiplication has higher precedence than addition
i have tried creating an if statement inside a for-loop to say if loops is more than 0 and the div is open then run the code so if the div isn t showing then do nothing - but this doesn t work
furthermore i do not have control over the engine Ã¢ myisam or innodb innodb performs better due to row based locking instead of table as in case of myisam
udp communication is connection less as compared to tcp which need a connection
it seems the from a readability and usability standpoint the hex representation is a better way of defining binary numbers
it s highly recommended way to implement screens switching with navigation drawer and you ll experience much less pain and see that screens switching is way faster
indeed floyd-warshall s algorithm is better than dijkstra s in this case the complexity for dijkstra is o m n 2 and in this problem m is much much higher than n so the o n 3 time complexity of floyd-warshall is better
i decided on nvidia for a couple of reasons while ati might be faster on paper nvidia has a more mature platform and more documentation so it will be possible to get closer to the peak performance on this platform
the invisible square link is about 200px higher than firefox google-chrome positioning
worse with mysql if you drop multiple indexes on the same table it will re-copy the table once for each index you re removing instead of being smart and re-copying the data once without all the indexes you re dropping. is something like this happening with postgresql
avoiding them by modifying vb6 is lot easier than fixing the issues in vb.net
it s slower than apc but it s faster than memcached redis etc
i would be very interested in seing the solution in objective-c also but swift is more important for me here
anything that you do with http is more or less equivalent with spdy and neither is really anything but an implementation detail of your soa work
lubridate is another package from the tidyverse it makes easier work with dates and times
in general postgresql knows more tricks for how to optimize complicated queries than the mysql optimizer does but it also relies heavily on your having given the optimizer enough data to work with
the documentation sucks but it s very lightweight there s a good community even on so it s more simple than symfony and more powerful than codeigniter the first version of kohana was based on codeigniter
concerning the problem your printpiglatin could use the existing function strcpy or better strncpy which is safer in regards to buffer overflows
i want to write a server tcp or udp which performs more than one task while listening to more than one port
the division has higher precedence than the addition so what you re calculating is sumaverage1+ sumaverage2 5 which is integer division which is probably not what you want
use .val and .keyup using keydown doesn t register the newest value it registers the value before so keyup is better to use for this
i was thinking of using the accounts app but django-userena seems better so i created a project zero with pinax and tried to integrate django-userena with it
it s because that quicksort is generally faster that people use it instead of mergesort
with this in mind customizing the css of a wicket app is significantly easier than vaadin for the simple reason that you control the markup
i have two primeface calenders which are used to select from and to dates.i have set the max and min dates for the two calenders which are updated using the ajax dateselect event so that the max date of from is never after the min date of to and the min date of to is never greater than the max date of from .my code is something similar to this
in ssms it takes more than 1 minute to complete while in sqlcmd it takes no longer than one second
linux however is less forgiving and has a filesystem that is case sensitive at least my dev ubuntu version does but i guess it is the default for linux
ntfs is much more complex and time consuming due to the more complex nature of this filesystems
now back to the question my guess based on reading tests published here would be that the proper multi-thread apache architecture should scale better than nginx on multi-core cpus
it s far more efficient and cleaner than charindex substr
innodb provides more complex keys structure than myisam foreign keys and regenerating keys is really slow in innodb
first it creates 10 5gb files 50gb is way more than machine ram so not much help by os file-cache then starts a zookeeper client which is supposed to keep its connection with the zookeeper server up by sending pings heartbeats regularly then makes 10 threads doing random-access into the 10 files creating a lot of disk io but really no real usage of the cpu
i guess google-chrome is smarter about me being careless than firefox is
+ consider that the implementation of tcp stack is much more complicated than udp more instructions are executed there
i think a tool like lodash or underscore.js is more suited for something of this nature
if you are trying to support all users on all browsers then you will certainly need to do testing on those browsers although actively developing on those browsers may not be necessary whereas if you only need to support webkit-based browsers google-chrome safari or webkit-based browsers and firefox that is less testing that you need to do
listview gridview is more work but is faster
asymmetric encryption ex rsa is no more secure than symmetric encryption ex aes
the code is riddled with classes which contain nothing more than public shared attributes variables and methods functions the result of which restrict the application from opening more than one project at a time
correct me if im wrong but i think the apk for mobile can be used to install the app in tablet.your problem would be in the ui coz mobile has smaller screens than tablet
Ã¢ when using drawimage coordinates will be rounded for you you might want to do the rounding yourself since it is floor that is used and that ceil that gives smoother results
so the 115 seconds will be reduced to 3-4 secs plus the encryption decryption time used for aes which is much faster than rsa
on safari everything is slower than on firefox still the object property access is more than two times faster
iis express would only be used by people who don t have access to iis or want something that is lighter than iis but more like iis than cassini
first fiber won t compile with apple clang because of the use of thread_local which apple does not support according to what i found online they think they can implement it better than standard llvm and don t want to introduce it only to break abi later
since eventually i d have a button that runs some script on the smeow values and send it to a different request i had a look at the tabletools plugin but it doesn t really play well with server-side tabletools is more focused on the client-side source
i think to safely use put on a public website requires even more effort than using post and is less commonly done due to potential security issues
in my tests snappy performs better than lzo by the way
wan is less stable than lan
but as i checked-out some example apps from spring source repo and it seems that maven is more preferred and powerful than ant
now i can understand that a ghash takes a bit longer than hmac because of the galios field and such but beeing 2 times slower compared to the slowest hash algorithm i know is insane
anyway transmit a salt and hash password is always better than transmit the plain password
also have a look at nginx for example it is fast and uses less memory than apache to handle client connections
scheme is also a good language for that purpose and it is simpler smaller than lisp
std copy to be more efficient than memcpy or memmove because it
jax-rs is much younger than jax-ws jax-ws had a final draft in 2006 jax-rs came out in 2008-9
justmock less expensive than typemock but still expensive
for complicated reasons having to do with the internal electronics of the cpu for most modern processors it is faster to perform a direct branch where the destination address is encoded in the instruction than an indirect branch where the address is computed at runtime
apache is like a 4 by 4 contains everything you need nginx is more like a ferrari not much there but it does what you need it to
while i think the move to swift is prudent but i think it overstates the case to argue that swift is significantly more secure that objective-c
yes storing the password even reversibly encrypted is worse than a salt hash of some sort due to password reuse
executable size of swift application is much bigger than size of objective-c application
why it is said quicksort has better constant factor than heapsort and therefore quicksort is better than heapsort in average
in other words is mysql better or worse than postgresql to handle unicode etc
at first glance it must be significantly faster because strcpy must be significantly faster than printf
firstly though we tend to use signed more than unsigned values which would lean us toward short but also ushort is not a cls-compliant type and there s hardly any point introducing an incompatibility with other .net languages in obtaining compatibility with com
i m not sure if printwriter or filewriter is better but printwriter worked for me
and it will prevent overlapping cron jobs if the cron interval is shorter than the job duration
http is slightly more performant than https as the ssl handshake doesn t need to happen however anybody hackers can see everything that your users can see
ember.js is larger than backbone.js but thanks to expires cache-control this only matters on the the first load
additionally i would advise that the your view explicitly checks that the request is a post and if not make the assumption that it is a get rather than the other way around as you have it this is safer as get and post are not the only request types and you definitely need to know that you are dealing with a post request if you want to deal with variables submitted in the post request
the c++-way is more readable in my opinion and new and delete are safer than malloc and free
this post goes into more details how to get charles proxy work with android 7 nougat
a better word than screens is activity you switching between activities in android
in firefox and other browsers the background is much whiter and brighter than in google-chrome
note you can also use get but post is safer because the user can t change it in the url
keep in mind that a maven project is more than just the pom.xml file it also conforms to the maven standard directory layout and more but that should get you started
you may also want to consider exploring the stringi package which has a similar approach to stringr but has more flexible functions
there are two reasons for that performance aes is faster then rsa and resources aes is less resource hungry than rsa
i don t quite understand why you don t want to use mapply but do.call is probably better anyway
just for the record the tipc addressing scheme is several years older than distributed erlang
this kind of processing is most easily done with xslt which is more expressive than xquery
let s say you wanted a table border-radius of 50 on google-chrome and safari but firefox is adding more padding by default so you d like to tone it down for that browser alone to 45
imho activity is your controller or perhaps presenter a la mvp is the better architectural analogy layout xml and their constituent views are the view layer and your database is your model
the workspace limit is on non-free hosted workspaces any workspace that s private or larger than 1gb disk space and 512mb ram ssh workspaces are unlimited
safari comes in at just under 41ms performing better than google-chrome but still not great
given these last two complications i am leaning towards a browser plugin as the solution probably firefox since low-level http stuff seems to be better supported than in google-chrome but i am wondering if anyone has an idea for a more cross-browser-y solution and or if there is something out there that might provide a good api for this kind of thing
declarative sql is usually simpler and faster than imperative pl sql so it s usually best to do most of the work in sql and just glue it together with pl sql
if your database has a large innodb buffer pool and a small key buffer then innodb performance is going to be better than myisam performance especially for large tables
udp will almost always provide better performance than tcp at the cost of reliability
rendering without buffering on google-chrome is faster than firefox so i m actually not sure why google-chrome is having such a problem with drawimage
moreover i m using m2e the maven plugin for eclipse so it seems that the compatibility of any maven plugins that might work by themselves is even less likely with m2e
i am using qt 4.8.3 and unless this is definitely bug in the versioning i would prefer not upgrading as from my experience upgrade bears more trouble than benefits
it s popular it s actively developed it has many libraries offering the features of a modern programming environment and scheme is somewhat simpler not to say better just simpler than common lisp
myisam is often faster than innodb but isn t safe to use in a production environment for critical data
on my mac firefox has no issues whatsoever but google-chrome is worse than i think you ve noticedÃ¢ the text exceeds the bounds of the container after the resize
innodb is more strict in data integrity while myisam is loose
i d rather use fsunit or fstest to write tests in f# it feels more natural than oo xunit.net style tests
from the link which is mentioned in question my question is that microsoft says the c# type keywords and their aliases are interchangeable but why we need aliases from my point of view boolean is more meaningful then bool and int32 is more meaningful then int then why aliases
you can also try using innodb since it s said is better than myisam handling bulk inserts with data already on it
masonry was the first one and works very well and isotope is the newer version that expanded on the original thinking along with additional features like sorting
if you are looking to measure execution performance over time scales where it matters if your thread has been preempted then you would probably be better served with a profiler vtune for instance
you are using a method to bind click event in your case is live and this has been removed in the latest jquery libraries from 1.9+ onwards so make sure your versioning is less than 1.9 or better to upgrade the library and use the recommended method for it .on to delegate the event event delegation syntax is little different with .on
the robocopy command provides a more intelligent exclusion feature switches xd and xf than xcopy does which you could use for your task
the qtablewidget is slightly easier to implement than the qtableview which also needs a qtablemodel as backend but it has less capabilities
you could make your css mobile-first meaning that all properties are optimized for mobile then as the screens gets wider you apply tablet and desktop optimized css for elements
either postgresql more proven than mysql for such huge data
google-chrome provides more detailed information about the ajax errors even when firefox doesn t say anything
the better question to ask might be which one of passenger unicorn is a better fit for containerised rails apps
fossil is another one that s easy to use i would say easier than git to learn but it uses an sqlite file to store your code and i m not sure if it scales to really big projects
innodb is also being developed more than myisam
thanks to a suggestion in the comments i removed the passwd from the server declaration since i think getting sudo to work without a passwd is a cleaner solution anyway
any device in the path of communication between the sender and receiver whose mtu is smaller than the packet will drop such packets and reply the sender with icmp destination unreachable datagram too big message containing the device s mtu
i am talking specifically in a scenario where the getter setter does noting more that get set
using a-star instead of brute force pathfinding will be faster just like how bresenham circles are better than using sin cos
i m sure it can be accomplished with pure bokeh but i m looking to do a more advanced plot with bokeh which relies on matplotlib so i m looking to use show mpl.to_bokeh
i know sproutcore is backed by apple and looks like it is getting more popular by the day and it has a nice green website whereas javascriptmvc looks less professional with less of a following and less momentum behind it
also note that keydown is better for this methodology as keyup will fire multiple times though i guess this will too.
the documentation for deactivate method for nsapplication says that i shouldn t call this method directly since appkit knows better how to deactivate stuff
if you d like to see stack trace that spans over settimeout setinterval calls then more sophisticated would be the way to go
firefox is slower than google-chrome in javascript
get is a better method in this case than post
in that case some hash functions are somewhat faster than other md5 being one of the fast functions but md4 is faster and it is simple enough that its code can be included in any application without much hassle
developers community it might seem that laravel has a larger community of developers but during my career with yii i ve found no bottleneck of having a question without an answer
for example if you start with a table and trunk adds column a and the branch adds column b then you merge trunk to branch - you cannot realistically upgrade to the versioning with both unless the branch versioning number is always greater than the trunk s upgrade script and that doesn t work if you subsequently merge trunk to the branch
iis express is a web server albeit better than cassini iis express is not your problem
i found that postfix dovecot is much more robust and it seems imap is the best way to work with it from php please correct me if i m wrong
this is because quicksort is generally faster than heapsort unless the call depth becomes to deep
you can use setinterval instead but for most animations settimeout is easier to control and more importantly.
but if the plotline is set much higher than the min or max data series then the plotline doesn t show on the chart at all like this jsfiddle
of course you could do the same with octal but hex is even more compact than octal.
you can filtering by adding pagination conditions but sorting is more complicated seeing as photos can have multiple categories
i performed survey on torque slurm loadleveler slurm is better than torque in handling large nodes but in a single cluster
the safari controller bar is the quicktime bar which is smaller and dark so the movement is less noticeable than google-chrome which has a big blue progress bar
this works fine on my local and current hosted environment using mysql but postgresql is clearly more strict
perf standard tool dtrace supported only in some linuxes have license problems - cddl incompatible with gpl stap systemtap works better with red linuxes like centos
while iis does give us better performance than cassini we would still like to be able to hit f5 to run our application from within visual studio
moreover ogg vorbis is better then mp3 at all bitrates
since parentheses were used around the addition but not the multiplication we can infer that probably in this language addition has lower precedence than multiplication
i know the basics division and multiplication higher than addition and subtraction but i would have to look up something more esoteric
sinatra and padrino are not automatically faster than ruby-on-rails
you can use a while loops to achieve the desired results but a for-loop is much easier to implement in this situation
using an html parser like beautifulsoup or lxml.html is a better idea
the reason for using this vs .nets jpeg encoder decoder is vastly greater quality and speed is essential and other libraries such as bitmiracles .net jpeg library is tremendously slow even after i added some unsafe code to speed up sections of the library such as reading in the bitmap data
perhaps you will have a more pleasant experience with iis 7.5 express as a replacement for cassini
i use quadtree more than r-tree and find them super flexible
it used to be that multiplication was slower than addition and programers used several tricks to avoid multiplication but with haswell it seems that it s the other way around
note that the png format is much more complex than bmp since it allows compression etc
i used iperf on two linux machines to send data using both udp and tcp i found that tcp performs better than udp average 65 better
while on antiquated hardware myisam was a necessity on modern hardware innodb actually performs better
if the numbers are huge dividing x by b might be betterÃ¢ division is usually slower than multiplication but getting out of the huge-number domain early might help more than avoiding division
i m searching for the best method to get result with database contain more than 100000 post and more than 100000 cat
if you want to schedule basic workloads based on containers you might be better off with marathon or in the future maybe aurora
yes but if joomla is any example of how hard it is to implement a complex custom website with oop then wordpress is far easier and quicker and time is money
quicksort generally runs faster than mergesort but under some circumstances it can degrade to quadratic running time
and you can iterate through different bases which is super useful if you re doing hex or binary which preserves more of the numbery essence of them
at first i thought it had something to do with one being a for-loop and the other being a while loops but even when i reversed the order the second loops still executes slower
setinterval is much more suited for countdown timers and things you need to run continually since settimeout only runs once and you need to keep on calling it
if you want more control over launchd background processes from ruby including properly detaching ttys and a host of other things check out the daemons gem
first of all wouldn t that relate to it returning an object that is a superclass which contains less data than requested because a superclass is not a subclassing but a subclassing is a superclass
for some years now i ve just stuck to the thought that since directbytebuffer s are a direct memory mapping at os level that it would perform quicker with get put calls than heapbytebuffer s
one interesting experiment you can try is to try and malloc more memory after you free d that pointer
so i d rename xmlhttprequest to jqxhr which is more dogmatic jquery
but the slider won t work well it doesn t get activated is a better way to put it if i insert the code from slider.js into the chrome console hit enter - booom works perfectly i ve been looking for what the problem might be tried adding the type text javascript in the script tags added the document .ready in my jquery still nothing.
you always need to know the magic number here 0xaaaaaaab and the correct operations after the multiplication shifts and or additions in most cases and both is different depending on the number you want to divide by and both take too much cpu time to calculate them on the fly that would be slower than hardware division
i am trying to stop a textarea with autogrow.js from growing after 300px height and then destroying autogrow textarea so that it has scrollbar although the code i have used to do this is working fine i can stop the textarea from growing after 300px but when that happens the textarea becomes smaller than 300px suddenly
also i don t think it is so much that asp.net mvc is so much better than cakephp or codeigniter ruby on rails etc. the great thing about asp.net mvc and other asp.net-based technologies such as monorail is that developers who are using asp.net now have the option of following the mvc pattern using tools and languages they are familiar with
so for example if you send a 63k udp packet and it goes over ethernet it will get broken up into 47+ smaller fragment packets because ethernet s mtu is 1500 bytes but some of those are used for udp headers etc so the amount of user-data-space available in a udp packet is smaller than that
however my mobile site has an option that allow user to switching to desktop view if there are not fond of the mobile site but how should i do that since the javascript in my homepage will block any screens that s smaller than 1024
for longer-running applications like a web application rubinius or jruby will generally perform better than mri
i m fuzzy on a lot of the finer details between jruby and mri ruby but here s what i know based off of what i ve learned using jruby
need to issue more than just get and put commands
i have also considered using game center groups to make sure you are playing a player from the same app versioning but ultimately decided that getting users to upgrade is a better plan
for example you want to use abstract-class in such a case that each of the subclassing is a more specific type of its abstract superclass fruit apple orange banana grape strawberries etc. and you want to use non-abstract superclass in a relationship such as dad and son
however if you want to get more than one post rather use functions mentioned above i think the most important thing is to grab them in one db query and not in ineffective way one-by-one
if you have nested data in your model this will soon get tricky to handle though and in that case a post is the better option
nginx + gunicorn is likely to work better than apache + modwsgi at this point in time
instead you can use udp and implement your own scheme for verification of data that is less stringent than tcp
i have a search positioned absolutely beside my navigation but the top is 10px lower than firefox in google-chrome so basically if it is centered in firefox it hangs low on google-chrome
given that it is possible to vastly reduce the likelihood of the worst case of quicksort s time complexity via random selection of the pivot for example i think one could argue that mergesort is worse in all but the pathological case of quicksort
but another added benefit of this approach is that it could make your program run faster since fixed-point integer arithmetic is much faster than floating-point arithmetic
quicksort is implemented well it is typically 2-3 times faster than mergesort or
i dont recomend apache to do these nginx fits better with nodejs
3 updates if required will be more challenging with avro thrift
a getter without a setter is more like a public final member variable--but at that point why not just use a public final member variable they do no more harm.
if you can predict more than one cron job to be executed you can try or any other library like this where you can config jobs scheduler in php
this is perhaps a bit cleaner with a setinterval instead of a clearinterval
moreover when .preview div has in a way bigger width than height .page should take heiht as a standart to prevent overflow like youtube player does for example
finally after figuring out what i needed was a page access token i gave up trying to do this client-side realising server-side makes more sense at least security wise
sorted vector resizable array if getrandom is much more frequent than get put
for the second test you should favor mockito over easymock that is more easy effective flexible and powerful to use
if you are uncertain you can always put an if statement and check if the number you get back is highter then int.maxvalue
also nginx s configuration is much more flexible than apache and by having it on the front end it gives you a lot of flexibility
for public inheritance it means that all the accessible members of base class that is the public and protected members can not be at a level more permissive than public
that s why it s usually said that mysql is best for webapps while postgresql is more enterprisey
udp protocol is unreliable but much much faster than tcp which is most commonly used for communication
there s no point in using a for-loop a while loops is more readable
usually onkeydown is more preferable then onkeyup for such combo
having getter and setter methods gives you more power as a developer over the class
lift s ajax support is far less verbose than wicket s
on intel cpus before skylake packed-integer instructions can always run on more ports than their floating-point counterparts so prefer integer ops
if the layout is repetitive a uitableview uicollectionview is a better choice
what i would suggest is to make sure you are using visual studio 2010 sp1 then install iis express which is an upgrade to cassini and is much more like real iis and then switch your project to use iis express and see if you get the same exception
the same word in firefox look wider than in google-chrome
edit don t use this for html work use the lxml library it s python based and much faster than beautifulsoup
i did some benchmarking 3 years ago may be stale... which showed that on large datasets basically postgresql fulltext is 10-100x faster than mysql and xapian 10-100x faster than postgresql but not integrated
quicksort is also more complicated than mergesort especially if you want to write a really solid implementation and so if you re aiming for simplicity and maintainability merge sort becomes a promising alternative with very little performance loss
nltk is shy of stanford-nlp in terms of quality of output and for everything other than statistical collocation analysis as far as i can tell stanford-nlp has a broader range of practical algorithms
i added my own implementation not because yours didn t work but to show how you could delegate responsibilities to classes which reflect the problem domain making the code a bit more readable though considerably longer with boilerplate getter and setter
because the uiview is smaller it is going to crop out the larger subviews
i ve tried a bunch of other things as well one of them being hook elements with insertafter but stay in parent - jquery which worked perfectly but if the position was higher than the children inside the parent it didn t know what to do with it and causing a lot of unwanted behavior
with firefox google-chrome and safari it s less of an issue because those started auto-updating years ago and more than two years ago they stopped blocking methods other than get and post
m2e is also a platform that let others provide better integration with additional maven plugins android web development etc.
ok i am new to audio with unity but despite reading all the unity posts regarding audio adding 2 short .wav clips i heard wav was smaller than mp3 to my app has added over 200mb
for the most part i think the choice of snap vs yesod vs happstack is less an issue of features and more one of personal taste
here in your example col-md-4 class is been used that means if you will shrink your screens more than medium screens size ipad or tablet it will starts responsiveness
i noticed some time ago that a for-loop typically generates several more machine instructions than a while loops
yes joomla takes more time in cooking the resulting html when compared to wordpress
how could i turn this into an array easier than using explode substr explode
boost s io stream might be a better solution than stl s own stream
technically you can do it dynamically but that would require doing the registration unregistration somewhere more permanent than onresume onpause which i don t think is really what you want.
in example sendp method included in for-loop which is slower than making other loops to send packets
mapr has clearly cheaper tco and technologically superior platform cloudera is a bit more polished hortonworks for pure open source don t read this as free or cheap as most companies end up spending more money on hw to get any value
if your ruby versioning is older than 2.2.4 then please upgrade it
i know object pascal delphi lazarus more or less but absolutely zero in anything networking-related and these platforms seem absolutely inadequate for the server
can somebody explain how it can be that the same api call returns so much quicker with vb6 than with vb.net
or even easier rather than adding uilabel objects to a uiscrollview you could just use a uitextview
however because of additional checks that memmove performs when the buffers are small and surely does not overlap memcpy is better
obviously md5 is much more difficult to reverse even in this anything that will hash to the right value sense then a simplistic algorithm like take the last two digits
if we look at the speed of operations multiplication is not drastically slower than addition
it will wrap the original stream in a bufferedoutputstream which is more efficient which is then wrapped into a dataoutputstream which offers additional nice features like writeint writelong and so on
edit i found out that piston was proposing query throttling but everywhere people say that tastypie is better than piston
unfortunately this not possible using openldap because your filtering is returning more than 1 object multiple grouping each with a unique dn
however there s one thing we haven t considered yet - what if you never get more than 5 post
itext versioning is 5.5.x but i guess we can upgrade it if the task would be easier with newer versioning
the idea is that equal responses will have equal md5 hash and storing hash is a more lightweight process
lastly whenever you want to iterate x amount of times a for-loop is always more readable than a while loops that uses a counter variable
in my android app i have a background image which is longer than the screens width for all the three types of screens.this implies that i have got 3 drawables each for different screens type mdpi ldpi hdpi and hence i have included a horizontal scroll bar in my app
the third operation is made much faster is the client uses a rsa key pair rsa signature verification is very fast whereas dsa signature verification is expensive actually somewhat more expensive than dsa signature generation
it theano runs much faster than tensorflow
the hash cake generates are more complex than md5
compared with quicksort mergesort has less number of comparisons but larger number of moving elements
i think datatrigger instead of eventtrigger is more suitable and you need to use x type to specify the bound data to the item
this is a scenario where a traditional for-loop is more handy than just iterating over the arrays
the reason google-chrome is slower than firefox is that the devmode plugin runs in a sandbox so calls and data have to cross the sandbox boundaries
my understanding is the requestfactory is more efficient and recommended over gwt-rpc but it s more of a data entity persistence framework than a request-response framework like rpc
for division things are a little more complicated than multiplication see
i actually picked junit over testng for android testing i thought it was more lightweight than testng for on-device testing
i have tested that by modifying one image in hdpi folder and keep it as it is in the xhdpi folder the result was note 1 is loading from the xhdpi folder am i missing something here it suppose to load images from the hdpi folder because it s screens density is smaller than 320 dpi
multicore refers to a computer or processors that has more than one logical cpu core and that can physically execute multiple instructions at the same time
i used ppm pgm files as they are simpler to write and more portable than bmp
swing has more or less deprecated awt so you should extend jframe instead of frame
i am using bottle but i am going to want to use https and support for https under flask seems much more straight forward
in my opinion the second way to achieve this is better because using get is not thats ecure in my opinion.it s easier than using post
the ogv version of the video seems to run a little better than the webm which itself seems to run better than the mp4
google does this because their feed api can parse more than rss
my problem is i m more familiar with mysql and could probably figure this out but this is postgresql and i am still getting tripped up on syntax
but the problem is that i need to terminate a process if it lasts more than a timeout 3 seconds
most of the literature that says myisam is better faster whatever then innodb is old literature
although this is only for ios the main app portion will be built in react-native as i am more familiar with js swift objective-c are very new to me
check out sorcery it s more lightweight and less obscure than devise
i think that in short the second answer to that question covers it all the heap constraint which is that children are greater than their parent does not completely specify the heap so there is usually more than one possible arrangement
the floyd-warshall algorithm has a worst case performance of o |v|3 where as dijkstra s has a worse case performance of o |e| + |v|log |v|
right now oxygene is much better as it supports a broader set of language and platform features than delphi .net ever did
so that means that in practice an innodb write will take 3 times longer than a myisam write
i know you said you don t care about how secure it is but if you chose des you might as well take aes it is the more up-to-date encryption method
postgresql is already slower than mysql up to a certain point it is actually faster when you have a ridiculously large database
however cobertura looks more modern active last update from 2010 instead of 2005 and generates nicer reports so i would prefer it over emma
i have the impression that the implementantion has something to do with a for-loop and some kind of adaptive delay that gets bigger as loops count increases
the communication between the android app and the pc can rely on a simple tcp socket udp is also a valid option but if you begin in network programming tcp is probably easier to handle and more widely used
good advice but in the end i decided a bindable textblock was more useful and simpler than a richtextbox
similarly you might find using jacoco easier than cobertura
under cpython tests run 4 times faster than under pypy
arraylist - for-loop is about more than 2 times faster speed than foreach loops
glut is much more easier while many of people use sdl or sfml they re more flexible and feature-full than glut
the problem i have noticed is that sometimes the jquery post result is retrieved earlier than the load of the .js file has been completed so i get an error and of course the jquery plugin doesn t work
i feel like if the bitmap class makes data modifications to the stream then it would have to decompress the stream which should make the bitmap class take the same amount of memory working with bmp streams as when it works with png streams despite the fact that the png streams is smaller
if i don t use shiny every time i regenerate the plot on some kind of user-interaction the html file created by plotly dygraphs which is more than 1mb needs to be transferred to the client
i think that inventing something better than both ant and maven wouldn t be that difficult but that tool doesn t seem to exist yet
in a few more years there might be an architecture where 128bit math is faster than 64bit but i don t think any exists today
2 tcp needs more processing at network interface level where as in udp itÃ¢ s not
if you are using linux check out netdiscover this uses arp i think arp is lower level than tcp udp and with java you can only create apps from tcp udp and above
however i ve searched for a couple days and am not getting a definitive answer and i need a better understand of this so i know no better way to get more info than to post here
get is simpler and faster than post and can be used in most cases
i want to know if there is way in matlab so that i can find number of points in each grid so that i can classify it as a dense cell or sparse cell.if the number of points in a grid is more than a threshold it can be said to be dense .i need to find distance between each point in a sparse grid and centroid of each cluster to find which point is the outlier.if min distances between a test object o in a sparse grid and cenroid of each cluster threshold value it is outlier.can you suggest a method to implement this in matlab
what does rabbitmq do better or worse than activemq
they also tend to be smaller than their xlsx or xlsm counterparts
ienumerable is less specific than ilist ilist implements ienumerable so unless you want something specific from ilist such as .count as you suggest or perhaps add delete etc i d use ienumerable
personally i m using sublimetext right now which i find easier than vim for searching and navigating the code but everyone has their taste
unlike google-chrome which dies silently the latest firefox is more helpful
or more ideally you might want to change show hide to jquery fadein fadeout which is more appropriate for back to top indicators
i am creating an commerce website and i am stuck in a database problem i am storing customer orders please tell me which is better myisam or innodb i have to use transaction like feature in customer order table and i personally prefer myisam because it is much faster than innodb and it also supports full-text searching is there any way to use transaction like rollback feature in myisam so that if anything goes wrong table will be rollback to its previous state how to do that without any external library or any other server side access and i have to use mysql
in other words hardly anything slower than multiplying add subtract but not enough to really worry about
click is tapestry-like but much more easy than tapestry and wicket
early inlining is the compiler s ability to inline a function early on when it sees the call costs more than the inline
though from a design perspective it may be easier to simply add the extra 5px to the width designing for the worst case browser to prevent wrapping in google-chrome which is worse than extra space in firefox ie
i find that the swing library is easier to use than awt although you do still have to use awt for listeners
i d suggest having a look at openrasta which is much closer to http semantics than asp.net asp.net-mvc is
no java prevents a class from directly extends more than one super class
we thought of django but we think that is very big for our purpose and we decided that webpy or web2py is a better option
the result is okay but it is slow.is there any way that i can do this with loops instead of arrayfun because i check for-loop is faster than arrayfun
the logic could be a sql agent job that is fired every 24 hours that deletes any data that has a datetime less than dateadd d -1 getdate
each page would have 2 actions a get that takes simple ids and a post which takes more complex models
if you re interested there is another data structure called a dawg directed acyclic word graph that is similar to the trie but uses substantially less memory
maven uses the classifier construct for artefacts build from the same pom.xml but differing in there content for example one for jdk1.6 or jdk1.7
it is scaling the image to it s width but since it s height is greater it is showing the rest of the uiimageview as transparent what you would expect from uiviewcontentmodescaleaspectfit which is what the uiimageview s contentmode is set to
this is slow because your hard disk is significantly slower than ram and at 7gb there will be a lot of data being read from your hard disk put into ram then moved back to your page file the file on disk your operating system uses to store data that has been copied out of ram
this feature allows the processor to execute several arithmetic operations simultaneously often four 32-bit integer operations or four 32-bit floating-point operations sometimes more operations with narrower integers sometimes fewer operations with 64-bit floating-point
tcp is way better then udp for that
if you think your users technical users will be happier with directory use that but otherwise i would go with folder
my questions are am i right to want to use json and use a php file on the remote server that will accept it as get or is post better and what issues should i be aware of when submitting this for review through itunes
on simple low-cost processors typically bitwise operations are substantially faster than division several times faster than multiplication and sometimes significantly faster than addition
so i switched to qgraphicsscene qgraphicsview that seems much simpler to use with animations
however with this method image in firefox appears to be blurred at least if resized and in google-chrome it looks lighter sic
swing is far better than the obsolete awt library
first of all if your instagram client is in sandbox mode then you can t get more than 20 post more clearly last 20 post
if you re writing a mac app the opengl profiling tool profiling opengl code better than instrumentation
problems with corruption seem to be more frequent with mysql than with postgresql
finally if soappy just isn t working for you try suds it s better documented than soappy
postgresql is much more similar to oracle than mysql is
e.g. break with labels as in java or even a more generic goto. continue does not seem more special than other control-structure mechanisms except that it is present in more languages
it might be better than a for-loop in the terms of readability maintainability but keep in mind that linq usually slower than plain loops tl
my sense is that encode and decode are probably good solutions when you want the data to be recoverable but that unrecoverable hash using crypt md5 is a better approach for stored passwords
i would like to use more than one cpu to run ubuntu 14.04 32-bit in virtualbox but when i stop the machine and go in settings - system - processors the processors s slider is grayed out as you can see in the screenshot image
if you want to do more columns as a loops you need to increment this value in the same maner you are incrementing r in your for-loop
an ienumerable is less specific than an ilist
if you prefer tp delphi dialect free pascal is the better choice
pull subscriptions perform much better than push subscriptions in a wan scenario
because a tablet s screens is much larger than that of a handset there s more room to combine and interchange ui components
in my experiance with the two postgresql has shown to be faster on most write operations while mysql is slightly faster on the reads
having looked at the existing accesses listed i can see that it doesn t appear to be using the salt md5 hash that s stated in the apache docs the hash password that s stored is different to what i m thinking i should expect the salt is significantly more than 2 characters and for security reasons i m reluctant to embed a particular password hashing algorithm in my code
sometimes mri is faster but with the right parameters and warmup jruby was 3 to 3.5 times as fast on my system for this particular
more than that filtering and sorting by one or more of the attributes will send me to the world of hurt
my site displays just like in need in ie and opera but in firefox i can t get via css to have font sizes smaller than firefox default minimum-font-size
apple seems to claim that the optional type in swift is safer than nil in objective-c but i don t understand why this is so
note extends mouseadapter is easier since you only need to implements the methods you want to handle
you can check this article of mine if you want something more than simply hide show elements this is how to have simulated conditional fields in cf7 with jquery
in this area i think innodb s change buffer does a better job than myisam s do it now
common lisp is a weakly functional mixed-paradigm language and scheme is more strongly functional but still not pure
though it s unrelated to your actual question des is generally slower than aes at least in software so unless you really need to keep the key small aes is almost certainly a better choice
the result amazed me in the way that as loops goes over bigger range the performance of c# decreases as compared to c..for smaller range c# shown well performance over c....but as upper range of for-loop increases the c# performance degrades as compare to c..
the versions using diff are especially impacted ave_diff with int constants is about 2.5 times faster than the double contants version
codeigniter has the lower learning curve overall so i would recommend it over cakephp
now in .net for desktop controls you can use inherited which is much more powerful than the old tag properties anyway
or will every commit pull push takes a longer time as changetsets count increase
the keyboard is almost always faster than the mouse
root punto is a valid geojson point i checked it with the st_isvalid function and also if i use the function st_distance checking if the distance between the point and the polygons is greater than zero the data retrieved is correct but i don t know if this approach is correct
flask is more focused on simplicity instead of functionality while django has more functionality
in google-chrome the green div is bigger than in firefox i really don t know what is the problem i think in firefox it displays as it should but in google-chrome and ie9 it displays different
putting it in the jar file among the classes or adding its jar-relative path to the class-path entry of the jar s manifest.mf file is more than sufficient
coalesce does the same thing here as nvl but is more portable
turning comment to answer i suggest you add error checking to all your system and standard library calls except printing to stdout stderr that s more clutter than it s worth for almost any app something like
see this reply what happens when tcp udp server is publishing faster than client is consuming
the namespace is supported specifically to make cross-browser extensions with google-chrome in particular porting from google-chrome to firefox easier
as a general rule of thumb at least in security you should trust no user so i think it would be the wise choice to validate the data client-side it s also faster and then if the first validation passed validate it server-side to double-check or to have a safety net if the user has javascript turned off something you don t see that often
division is slower than multiplication is generally - and definitely using regular expression matching is going to be slower than multiplication is..
many say that svn was build to be a better cvs and in almost all aspects svn is better and is widely used
as others have pointed out ocaml s learning curve will be lower than haskell s
there are definitely some advantages using external editors however emacs is ten million times better than vim
after some time of using codeigniter i found that using yii is more convenient
bazaar seems much more like svn with branches just being separate directories so maybe not
the main method does little more than to get the program running here to create a jframe to put the main gui code s jpanel in and then display that jframe
now i am using a for-loop to iterate over these frames and add 10 frames in prior and after the erroneous frames in order to get a sequence so that in the end the arrays is more populated
note that while a trie works for the specific case of keys which are strings a binary search tree is much more general and only requires that the keys can be ordered
reason i once heard that protected is better for hibernate performance but all i can find on the web is hibernate can access public private and protected accessor methods as well as public private and protected fields directly
one often finds the argument that udp is faster then tcp
nginx seems to be the webserver getting the majority of the buzz lately it may be able to serve faster than lighttpd maybe not
udp should be much faster than tcp because there are no acknowledge and congestion detection
i find request + cheerio to be easier than jsdom for tasks like this
also if this controller is an hid the hidapi library might be a better fit than libusb
my team is more experienced with api.ai and only starting to learn luis
so i can use neither gprof which isn t available on android valgrind which requires an older version of the ndk than what i m using nor the android-ndk-profiler which is for dynamic libraries loaded by android activities either java or native not plain executables
if your system linux is older like debian wheezy for example your glibc version will be older than the required one
i had the same problem configuring apache until i gave up and change to hiawatha much more easy to configure and according some benchmark is faster than apache
png is a newer format and often better than either jpeg of gif - especially for screenshots
like npm bower is slower than component at installing has an unnecessary publish step does not support multiple versions of dependencies and does not cache installations
due to many improvements to couchdb and that cloudant has more features than vanilla couchdb my suggestion would be to use a c++ http library to communicate with cloudant
essentially there s no need for gcc any more llvm + clang is more than enough
the second table has children linked to their parent passport id i only take in account one parent -either father mother- per family
using the powerpivot excel 2010 addin i believe its possible to effectively create this kind of function using dax and mdx has more built-in functions such as median
one of the reasons to do so is that rsa is much slower than for example aes
but actually break has more resemblance to return both instructions jump out of a block of code which is pretty much structured in comparison to goto
in the experiments and discussion below i find that cufft is slower than fftw for batched 2d ffts
support exists in firefox and my test just confirmed thisÃ¢ but the handle is a little less noticeable than in google-chrome
change it to public to make it more accessible or perhaps better protected to make it less accessible than public but more than private read more about that here
as a result of this comparison i see that lasagne is performing so much worse than keras that i m starting to doubt about my code
ubuntu heavily relies on python scripting and generally consumes more resources than debian
swift will incur this penalty in fewer situations than objective-c will for instance method calls to swift-only protocol methods do not hit objc_msgsend but if the protocol is declared in objective-c or if the swift protocol is decorated with objective-c such that it can be adopted by objective-c objects as well then method calls to methods in that protocol adopted by swift objects appear to be dispatched via objc_msgsend
so we can use pbkdf2 with sha512 to gain a very significant advantage over the phpass algorithm mainly because sha512 is a harder algorithm with more computation than md5
it s not a question of is map reduce better than mergesort or quicksort because map reduce is just a tool for implementing a sorting algorithm like mergesort or quicksort in a parallel way
frameworks like firebase angular-fire lib have handy built in auto-sync functionality alternatively the rest post put request is a more traditional design pattern
most likely for the same reason that implements idisposable but ienumerator does not--the earlier version was written before the authors thought of circumstances where one an a implementation might need cleanup but a factory returning such an implementation might not know about such need
note that while you could use purrr for the job it s not particularly better suited than regular dplyr
i believe lodash is a better choice over underscore.js more details in this blog post
google-chrome handles these better than compared to firefox
the multiprocessed loops is slower than doing the for-loop
note that i do not want to bind a gridview directly to the view property from a resourcedictionary where the datatemplates x shared attribute is set to false as this leads to problems in the xaml designer view can t be shared by more than one listview
now if you re intending to use a remote filesystem with ofs which is the primary use-case you have to first install the relevant remote filesystem packages on the os you re using then use for example if we ve got cifs which is the newer name for smb samba
also even without using the shift key when typing quickly i often find i haven t quite released a key before typing the next letter so i get more than one keydown event in a row before the corresponding keyup events - this has no noticeable bad effect in normal circumstances but is noticeable when there s code responding to both the down and up events
is quicksort always better than mergesort
once you get more familiar with haskell you will be able to rewrite standard recursion scheme such as the one above in a more compact form exploiting a few higher order library functions
but tesseract based on leptonica uses older versions of these libraries which have incompatible parameters
one thing you could look into is using tablesorter - which is much simpler than datatables - with a drag and drop plugin like sortable for jquery ui or this
the reason to go with logarithm instead of repeated division is performance while log is slower than division it is slower by a small fixed multiple
in my experience i ve found that vmware seems to be faster than virtualbox although i don t have any hard data to back it up
ldpi assets will look bad on high density screens but are exponentially smaller than mdpi which is exponentially smaller than hdpi etc
because you can guess the top passwords and see if they have the same hash but the author points out that hmac is a more secure mechanism
instead you use other lifecycle methods that are more appropriate such as onstart which will be called both after oncreate when the activity is first created and when the activity is returning to the foreground from having been in the background
in my mind illegalargumentexception seems more specific than using a nullpointerexception since it s telling me that the problem was with an argument i passed to the method and not with a value that may have been generated while performing the method
in short - if all we care about are comparisons heapsort is a better choice than quicksort
thirdly use a better hash than md5 for passwords
perl uses nfa which is slower yet more powerful than the dfa engine sed has
python -m ensurepip --upgrade does indeed upgrade the pip versioning in the system if it is lower than the versioning in ensurepip
i have been toying with opengl for about 2 weeks creating hardcoded vbos and making rotating triangles but the question that has been lingering in my head is how the heck do i create more than one vbo vao in real-time so i can handle multiple objects
if you are using mysql or postgresql this is a better way
while alloca gives you automatic de-allocation on function exit the stack is usually a smaller resource than the malloc heap and if you exhaust the heap it gives you back null
from gwt 2.1 requestfactory is better counterpart than gwt rpc when you use db4o together
toupper is better to use than tolower but i forget why
i encourage you to upgrade jquery mobile to 1.3.x and take a look at jquery mobile 1.3 s pop-up widget which is different from the dialog and works more like what you want than dialog does
but you are stopping your singlton to have more than one instance during serializable and deserialization which is of more importance in the context of singleton
gwt requestfactory by design is slower than gwt rpc and gwt json etc
in a thread i came to know that myisam is faster for reads innodb is faster for writes
you can also use javascriptconverter when you need more control over the serializable and deserialization process
i am interested in this because the factor oracle is easy to construct with 30 lines of c++ suffix-array needs about 60 and suffix-tree needs 150 and it runs faster than suffix-array and suffix-tree
i am running an application on jboss 7 and weblogic 12 when i make a soap call on weblogic is more restrictive than jboss
i think you ll find that web2py is even easier to learn and use than rails and django
so a g1 will show mdpi bitmaps slightly smaller than a mdpi device with a true 160dpi screens but this is a very small difference so it s not a big deal
usually though post request are intended to be used for changing the state of the resource on the server so if the only thing you have to do is retrieving data a get is more appropriate
note that swift s arrays are much more sensible than objective-c s
so division is always a bit worse than multiplication
tldr tcp ip is more reliable than udp but not a 100 iron-clad guarantee that nothing will ever go wrong
like you heard asymmetric cryptography like rsa is much slower than symmetric cryptography aes but it does have it s advantages simpler key management a single private key to protect
i have a label with a single character that i wish to be bigger than the uiview that it s a subviews of
edit this is why autoresetevent does not have a slim version - basically it s because the wait times of autoresetevent are typically longer than manualresetevent so it isn t appropriate to use busy spinning
a more lightweight approach than pandas is to use the prettytable module
the trouble is the game runs fullscreen in 800x600 resolution and really doesn t like being minimized which makes it more or less impossible to actually use ida while the game is running
another thing to try is the excellent entity framework profiling - has saved us many headaches in debugging performance issues like these - gives you a lot more than sql profiling and you can see what queries objects are created per objectcontext and method source line etc -
he cried. will save the string on the static storage and you will not be able to do most of the function on them you better work with strdup in your function or malloc and calloc to be able to use all the function
you can also use coalesce which is the more general form of isnull and is actually part of the sql standard
the plugin dll itself also does not expose anything more than the minimum interface required by max for adding a few top level scripted classes
i know innodb tends to be a bit slower than myisam on counting but this is far too long
the bad we use a break that is little more than a tamed goto something like goto the end of the loop
a while loops is better thought of as a looping version of an if statement than akin to a for-loop
the device in question will have a arm cpu with 400 to 900 mhz clock a vga or wvga display and about 256 mb ram or more with standard debian linux minimalistic install
it seems that google-chrome internet explorer or safari are more strict than firefox on terms of security
i just checked the timings using mysql 5 and they are slightly worse than postgresql
it sounds like you need a treemap which has iteration which is not much slower than linkedhashmap and does what you really want
or is the do.call with by just typically much slower than tapply
if you spreadsheet file has to be downloaded from server you can use epplus on server to generate spread sheet it will be much faster than vsto than you can use wcf from add-in in excel app to upload the data
qtoolbutton has smaller default internal margins than qpushbutton
if you are using any js loops then for each loops is slower than normal for-loop you might wanna take a look at this
this blog post is more detailed but unfortunately does also not mention where to get the product key
it seems google-chrome applies some formatting to render better than firefox
check airflow webserver or scheduler logs for more details as stderr or stdout goes there
postorder is trickier because the stack has to store nodes to visit and nodes to process and they aren t always simply related like they are in the inorder case
that said it is a scheme which has fewer batteries included as compared to common lisp
not sure about the overhead of calling gethashcode a few million times but comparing two ints is probably going to be a lot quicker than the equals object method
use post its safer than get if you use rest
post has worse performance than get
on the side of using macros racket has always been more advanced than other scheme and lisp implementations
either way i intend to use smarty partly because i have lots of experience with it and partly because its much more well documented and has much more functionality than blade and to me the syntax is slightly cleaner than twig although the template engine is not the point of this question really
actionscript is quicker than mxml but for what you re going to do you re trading speed for convenience - mxml comes with all the different ui classes list scrollbars etc already there
it is also non-standard unsafe and non-portable basically worse than using malloc and free in c++
the ssd disks are from 4 to 8 times faster than a sata hdd depending on the model
to achieve the actual goal you maybe able to use plain for-loop which provides more flexibility in controlling loops instead of using while
tcl is more verbose than perl here
this performance difference issue when doing profiling is better than debugging also has troubled me for a few hours i even tried to move code from web api to console application to test and console application has similar performance as good as when profiling web api
so the difference between the two is that if you assign affinity at the thread level you can assign them to more than one processors and spread the load more than with all threads assigned to one processors
is post safer than get
i.e strncpy is actually better than the simpler strcpy if you are willing to improve the code
the whole purpose of using aes to secure the communication or any symmetric key encryption is that it s a lot faster than rsa or any public key encryption
if the versioning is older than 0.10 please upgrade
hfs+ supports much larger files than hfs block addresses are 32-bit length instead of 16-bit and uses unicode utf-16 encoding to name files folders and other filesystems objects
however they are not the same because the subclassing has more specific functions and data members that accomplish a more specific task that the superclass
when working in bash it is generally more efficient and better suited to use the tools that bash provides rather than spawning subshell calling 3rd party tools like grep and cut
nginx is faster and lighter but many people find it easier to work with apache because of .htaccess support nginx does not have an analog due to performance concern
when i draw a 3d cube in opengl es for android it seems to look fine as long as i m in portrait mode but when i switch to landscape it looks more like a diamond
in fact in some ways ntlm is better than kerberos
that way they are in a separate file that can be parsed a bit easier than a maven pom.xml
depending on where i look people say quicksort is faster than mergesort due to its locality of reference cache hits etc
for example tri-state checkbox aren t particularly intuitive and providing a drop-down or set of three radio button is more approchable for those less technically inclined
first get unitythread class from this post which makes it easier to call a function on the main thread from another thread
knuth writes that fibonacci search is preferable on some computers because it involves only addition and subtraction not division by 2. but almost all computers use binary arithmetic in which division by 2 is simpler than addition and subtraction
for the sake of completeness i d like to add that using getter setter consistently makes it easier to override a class
note that mongoose-auth is built on everyauth and they will work fine but i like the flexibility of the strategies concept from passport and the express integration is better
more useful with nvidia than ati for example
you may also consider using a listview which is easier to customize than the gridview
you could of course just wrap the function in a decltype to figure out the return but an auto is much cleaner to write
after reading some related articles i don t think swift is more effective than objective-c
since sql server doesn t support named constants chars is far more descriptive than int when used in stored procedure and views as constants
the use of one settimeout timer is more preferably than several setinterval timers
answering your question a chars is an integer-type of lower rank than int meaning potentially and in practice nearly guaranteed smaller size and value-range and thus pointers to either are different types too
homebrew is generally a bit nicer than macports as it doesn t require lots of sudo action
of course any hash algorithm is going to have some chance of collision but you have better options than md5 that would still satisfy the 1024-byte limit
since the parent #wr has more children #con_bottom does not fit
do you keep the parent if they are better than the children
if new member fields are declared in the subclassing then yes a subclassing presumably uses more memory since it has all the fields declared in the superclass plus all the fields declared in the subclassing
note you are using a post method but a get method seems more appropriate in your case getvotes
dbcontext is newer api which should polish developers experience when using most common tasks - simply the api is better designed but you still have to get objectcontext from dbcontext and use the older api if you want to use some more complex features
term hide is more appropriate for run-time dynamic show hide
among other things the apple template code will include creation of a glkbaseeffect which provides some shader functionality that seems to be required in order to be able to draw with opengl-es 2.0
for a one man shop teamcity is far easier to setup and configure than cruisecontrol
so as you can see the random binary search tree was rather a lot better than the skip-lists
that site does not claim pypy is 6.3 times faster than cpython
of course uiscrollview can have more than one content view just as any uiview can have more than one subviews and this case it will be more difficult to render its layer
in particular a font may be rendered quite differently between the various browsers and operating systems in current use - safari and macos use more anti-alisaing than firefox or ie but ie9 has a new feature called cleartype which also affects font rendering
as pointed out you cannot inline which is another speed trick but inlining on the if-then-else tree doesnt necessarily make it faster than without inlining and is generall not as fast as the function pointer
you can read all over the web that awt is old and deprecated and swing is old but newer than awt and should be preferred over awt whenever possible
i prefer using teamcity but jenkins is much more popular
the way you are using the kotlin for-loop is much closer to java s foreach loops for i indexes
google-chrome sends back and html collection that is longer really better imo than firefox ie or chromium
you can also try sklearn.linear_model.logisticregression and sklearn.svm.linearsvc both implemented using liblinear that is more scalable than libsvm albeit less memory efficients than other linear models in scikit-learn
from what i ve learned so far metaclass and inheritance from superclass in python serve a very similar purpose but superclass inheritance is more powerful
as the comments already mention if you are starting out with version control you would be well advised to choose a newer system than rcs git mercurial fossil subversion ...
you ll need to implement serializable to have java handle the serializable or externalizable if you need more control over the deserialization process
i have more experience with vhdl and verilog
myisam inserts are going to be faster than innodb so if you re logging data and retrieving it later that will be a win
edit just realized a while-loop may well be a lot cleaner than a for-loop for this
protected is more restrictive than public
i ve used it for convenience a for-loop is much more reliable for converting an htmlcollection to an arrays
use swing follow the threading rules which are hardly likely to be more onerous than awt and enjoy
now for sse is clearly faster and for the smaller values it s nearlly as fast as avx
i am more acquainted with debian than centos and i know the libraries i need are
by decoupling simulation from rendering you can render at a higher frequency than your simulation does for sampling
all hash functions have that problem but some are more robust than md5
i have used restsharp before but refit is alot easier to get running
you need here while loops better than for-loop
hash is newer and seems to support more hashing alogrithms than crypt
while it would be highly unfeasible to create a test that would exercise every possible code path in tpl you can certainly setup a test that would benefit from many available cores set the affinity mask to 1 cpu and observe through task manager that the affinity never changes and cpu utilization is never more than 1 n where n is the # of cores present
the later version of jmock makes things easier by integrating with the junit lifecycle as a runner
udp is significantly easier do you really need tcp btw
if your client jar is really thinner for example only the interfaces having the war s reference the client jar effectively disallows them to access to ejb implementations which is always a good idea
google-chrome is more forgiving or you could call it less compliant firefox less so
thanks mikushi for the comment another possibility that i haven t used much is the the xhprof extension it also helps with profiling can generate callgraphs -- but is lighter than xdebug which mean you should be able to install it on a production server
requests is one of the cleanest api s i ve ever seen way better than httplib + urllib + urllib2
in dependently-typed languages like idris it s probably more useful than in haskell
the micro-benchmark included ensures that this solution is not slower than default serializable deserialization
yes they are different but you can hardly say that the vb.net version is less capable than the vb6 version
the other advice i have is that a for-each loops is faster than a for-loop
some say mysql is much better for bigger projects while others think just go with postgresql
not really any more than safari having cookies and firefox having cookies are somehow tied
for-loop is more suitable for any countable loops
it s much much faster than beautifulsoup and it even handles broken html better than beautifulsoup their claim to fame - lxml just isn t as vocal about it
i get that pushing the code up is a matter of using git aws.push - but what do i need to do to push the data up the the ebs environment i m happy to use either postgresql or mysql on ebs - but i m guessing postgresql is the better choice given that s what the local app uses - if so how would i need to configure my database.yml for postgresql on ebs
udp is more popular in nat punching because provides much better results than tcp
it s not perfect but i guess that a protected method that does not check parameters is better than a public method that does not do it
i didn t try it because i m more familiar with kivy s internals and because my end goal was more of a kivy app containing vispy visualisations rather than the other way around
i can switching between these two screens easily.at the beginning first screens is fully displayed.when i click a button second screens will come from right and first screens goes to the left.but i want to keep the second screens and remember..second screens has less width a portion of the first screen.that means a half of the first screens disappear
you can serve it from for example nginx varnish which are usually faster than apache
and if somebody is running a 6-month old versioning with a known bug upgrade becomes a more acceptable answer if they are 12 versioning behind
sudo is better in most respects but still requires a passwd which asroot does not
for example if you have a text size of 15px well firefox makes a larger 15px than google-chrome does
edit2 you may have better results with mouseenter and mouseleave too i think
a straightforward solution is to iteratively create each of the arrays using a for-loop or list comprehension or use a higher dimensional arrays where each of these 1d arrays is a row in your 2d arrays which is generally faster
and it turns out maven really does a better job of managing dependencies for ant build.xml files than does ivy
fortunately the vbide for vb6 has more classes and methods for working with vb projects than the vba version of vbide
my problem is uitextview is more complicated than uilabel
sha-256 uses 64 characters in the database but with an index on the column that isn t a problem and it is a proven hash and more reliable than md5 and sha-1
one reason post is worse for security is that get is logged by default parameters and all data is almost universally logged by your webserver
now the speed of sql server interaction with r has affected because rjdbc is slower than rodbc but its not too bad
alternatively the stanford parser can do the same stuff and might be a bit quicker being java based or lingpipe but nltk is waaaaaay more user friendly
run the following to sort the data on disk this is slower than pulling it into ram sorting and then writing to disk
you d be doing this much easier with domdocument and domxpath instead which works as you d expect
innodb is more resistant to table corruption than myisam
i want to move to nginx since it s better than apache
template engines are rarely the cause of performance problems even if chameleon is slightly faster than jinja2 i doubt the effort of learning a new template language etc
so md5 + strong password + average salt is better than usual password + super-extra-cool_hash and quite enough
i am using franklin gothic font for website and font looks good on google-chrome and safari but on internet explorer and mozilla firefox it looks darker
my cygwin installation is now in two directory c cygwin64 and my windows user folder which makes backup more complicated and is tied to my username another user couldn t use it
i m trying to figure out how to better deal with json serializable deserialization of nested java objects in spring mvc
the reason why the vpn is slow is well because your vpn is likely 50 to 100 times slower than your lan local area network
richfaces looks more good option to work than icefaces bcoz it has inbuilt support its easy to learn its long time support guarantee for seam+richfaces combination
i am currently writing a server for a fast paced multiplayer game which should be run in udp i read tcp was inappropriate due to the way it handles packet drops in applications requiring timely delivered data please correct me if tcp is more useful the game is not mass multiplayer and should be hosted primarily by the players themselves probably on local dedicated servers
since perforce is less commonly used compared to cvs svn amongst bamboo users we generally get less feedback about it and hear less about existing issues
my personal preference is to call setcontentview immediately after super.oncreate so that i know the rest of the oncreate method is less likely to break
note my use of a foreach loops here which is much neater than your for-loop for this kind of thing
but in firefox the left-collumn gets a much bigger height than in google-chrome
does this affect postgresql harder than mysql
i wrote this function and it seemed okey but it fails if there are more than one folder in the current directory and no files
deserialization performance is similar with gson over 9x slower than jackson and fastjson about 0.5 faster than jackson
if your form is meant to create modify data you ll use post instead of get but get is easier to test
it s just a hunch but maybe it s only a matter of the size of your draggable being too big and being over more than one droppable item
the funny thing is that for abc_def property google-chrome is actually much faster than firefox and ie as i expected
it looks like the parent will become a zombie too if children aren t handled and a child runs longer than the parent
i simplified the 0-9 case in digit_to_char i think str is clearer than the chr ord construct
however since i know that the add-in is more or less working as is for all users some of whom use excel 2010 and some of whom use excel 2013 and some of whom may explicitly have vsto installed and some of whom may not i d like to be sure that i m not setting myself up for a bruising later on when some features of the add-in stop working for no apparent reason due to changing the setting
but the plugin gulp-ruby-sass slower than gulp-sass
django s admin is better and more customizable than web2py s appadmin
double md5 hashing is actually less secure than a single hash with some attack vectors
from a performance and design perspective using annotations on getter is a better idea than member variables because the getter setter are called using reflection if placed on the field than a method
but i think importing the text file into excel delimiter by spaces is quicker if this can be done
this was finally slightly faster than std ostringstream but it has few downsides
since it s an exported method clients should get an exception on their abstraction level so illegalargumentexception is better than nullpointerexception
you may also want to take a look at why git is better than x a site that attempts to convince you of the superiority of git over mercurial bazaar subversion and perforce
i know that in practice this would only happen with a great amount of connection given that processing time of an udp connection is faster than tcp but it could potentially happen
i do know though that quicksort has more compares but less swaps than mergesort which i learned from another stackoverflow discussion quicksort vs merge sort
i also changed the for-loop that you had there to foreach loops which makes more sense when working with arrays
if you want to cover a brownfield project with tests which was not written at all with testability in mind then you have to use one of typemock or moles in my opinion typemock is the better choice
however the method that returns iqueryable takes 15 seconds while the ienumerable takes less than a second
also the native for-loop is faster than any other jquery loops method
if the orb implements local object optimization sometimes collocated objects then it will not open any sockets but it will perform serializable deserialization which is typically faster than marshalling
however lately i ve been using tooltipster instead because its integration with jquery validate is somewhat cleaner
the post at has more information on how to get that access token
seam certainly is far better than using plain jsf refer the link posted by damo a couple of answers above
1 is comparison via gethashcode check if the hashcode of both objects are the same faster than equals
for anyone curious about the coalesce vs isnull discussion and why i changed my answer to use isnull kanav rightly pointed out that coalesce is more expensive
edit what particularly interrests me is if desktop safari is closer to ios safari than google-chrome is
good at serving static files it s slower than apache and nginx
use daemons mode and then simply touching the wsgi script file when an atomic set of changes have been completed isn t that hard and certainly safer than a systemd which restarts arbitrarily when it detects any single change
scanf is faster than cin printf is faster than cout etc
you can find more information by amazon here link an alexa user with a user in your system
any ideas what might be causing this how i could fix it or how i could get around it to use matshow or imshow on a specified subplot the end use case is to have more than 1 subplot in the figure
or is there any other better method than using wakeup interrupt to count seconds since power on
my understanding is webkit is pretty good smaller than gecko
because of the above replace strdup with strlen malloc memcpy memcpy is slightly faster than strcpy
if anyone has some information on this problem i d really appreciate it - either things you did to make tcpdf faster or just confirmation that it runs slower than fpdf so i can forget about it and just stick with fpdf
how can you get similar highlightings to zsh s less than bash s less in ubuntu
i have tested on mp3 files in different directory it takes less than one second with over 6000 files stored in different folder
however the while loops remains a little slower than the for-loop
i think whoever said post is better than get when using passwords meant that the passwords would be part of the url in the get request which would obviously be bad
i set up a maven multi module project one with packaging war two more with packaging jar
tortoise now has an option push new branch that may be safer than force pull or push
is memcpy usually faster than strcpy on most real platforms
3 mysqlhotcopy inly works on myisam tables and in most applications you are better off with innodb
the google-chrome apis are currently experimental hence these tools are likely to be better developed under firefox
this is pretty much the ifloop answer but isnull is slightly faster than coalesce
ubuntu is far less conservative than debian so you will get closer to the bleeding edge
on kde aptana ran perfectly quicker than on gnome at the best of times
foreach or for-loop is somewhat slower than an equivalent while loops or tail recursion the benchmark i linked to above shows a 15x performance difference with 1000+ iterations though it will likely depend on the version of scala and the version of the jre...
due to this i create a temporary directory and use createfromdirectory but i don t want copy the same folder to other location in the disk almost the zipped already folder is better
i m not saying that realloc is worse than implementing realloc using a malloc free
p is sometimes chosen to be 31 because not only is it prime but a compiler resolves it to a bitshift and a subtract which is much faster than a multiplying
for-loop is easier to read than a while loops
json jsonb fields support any json-encodable data type not just key value pairs but also tend to be faster and for jsonb more compact than hstore
i would say that probably yes as long as we have enough of ram which is faster that virtual memory in case we need to access something from the disk which is extremely slow... but also i know that some applications just require having paging
settimeout is more relevant than setinterval since the first method just waits for a delay and executes a logic whereas the second function is meant for repeating a logic on periodic intervals
here s something that should get you started - this is all based on the assumption that there are only 3 checkboxes on your whole page and that you re interested in all of them - you ll want to make a method like this respond to your checkbox elements onclick events - i ve found that to be more reliable than onchange
here i am retriving data from database and i am doing insert update and delete of data using checkbox.my problem is when i click more than two checkbox than also i am moving to update.php page but what i actually want is that when i click on update button first it will check that only one checkbox is selected from list if not than alert message should display like select only one checkbox
anyway http 405 is telling you that your backend does not support the put method and probably it s expecting a post method with the x-http-method-override put http header since post is more standard method in rest than put
i am stunned right now seeing a lodash performing 100-150 faster than underscore.js in even simple native functions such as array.every in chrome
once the set of projects has been validated maven now does some more parsing of those pom.xml files to construct the list of build extensions if any and the list of plugins
this answer covers the more difficult case with mouseenter and mouseleave
xml files have none - so sql databases are a lot more efficient with sorting and filtering
traditionally postgresql has had fewer security issues than mysql but they are both doing very well on that
quadtree indexes are created faster than r-tree
by highlighting the shape of the two elements you can see that in firefox left the button is 2px taller than in google-chrome right
why initial render time for component with both onblur and onfocus is much bigger than others
people typically find jax-rs easier to start with and the more modern approach although jax-ws has more build-in type-safety features which is also exactly where most of its complexity comes from
on contrary jscript is more c-like do not require explicit enabling of script running accepts relative paths case sensitive and loosely typed both are imho advantages for scripting language compared to vbscript
and as bonus on google-chrome firefox is better in this case user will never be able to type any accents on the current page in any inputs without reloading the window
it is nothing more than a getter setter for an object
the only browser where the while loops was slower than the for-loop was in opera
probably firefox just ignores it but google-chrome is more strict change code to
if the processors is loaded enough then my thread works fine but when the processors is more or less free i rich quickly my cpu limitation 50 and finally the pool terminates and needs to be recycled
caching and buffering are quite important since disk are just so much slower than ram and ram is much slower than the cpu
wpf .net represents more functionality than straight swing or swt but the eclipse netbeans spring rcp projects provide a much more comprehensive foundation for complex and modular gui applications
salu is used for-loop counter so when you nest them more salu pressure is done and becomes a bottleneck when there are more than 9-10 loops nested maybe some intelligent algorithm using same counter for all loops should do the trick so not doing only salu in loops body but adding some valu instructions is a plus
there is a very good linq video that i enjoy a lot- it hits more than just ienumerable v iqueryable but it really has some fantastic insight
i had read through hundreds of docs and forum posts regarding whether innodb or myisam is the better engine to use most sources giving vague evaluations or at best overly complicated benchmarking with vague settings claiming to increase or even decrease.
layout-sw320dp-land will pick up drawable from hdpi folder whereas layout-sw720dp-land is mdpi device so it will pick up drawables from mdpi folder which will be smaller than hdpi
swing has newer and better api s than awt
this will restart the site and when it runs for the first time after that it will see that the dll versioning is higher than the one in the config files and the db and will kick off the upgrade procedure
i am using google webfonts and have come accross an issue with jagged and choppy font rendering in firefox and google-chrome ie11 renders them better
mysql is probably more often offered by shared hosting providers postgresql is probably a little more powerful
still technically yes it appears that an all swift solution is roughly 2x slower than a swift + cocoa solution which should be roughly the same than objective-c + cocoa when compiled with equivalent options iirc
enumerate is more pythonic but xrange is fine here too
as far as i know you cannot configure more than one https virtual host for each ip that s it name based virtual hosting is limited to only one ssl virtual host
an entity-relationship diagram is more abstract
so i will start with commit 1 find all the parent ie commit 2 and try to check if there is an branch for this commit ie number of children is more than 1
gson is faster with smaller documents and jackson is faster with large documents
alarmmanager consumes lesser battery power than timertask or thread
postgresql is much more complete and solid and will much better support complex queries and their optimization while mysql may shine in terms of retrieval speed for extremely simple queries
maven usage is lower compared to ant but just how much lower is not really known
anything django does web2py does better
udp packets are easier structured than tcp packets but sacrifice security for their size
mycroft ai seems to have a nice stack of projects that offer functionality and programmer interface very similar to amazon alexa custom skills and you can host and modify it yourself to get more flexibility than alexa voice service but that s also a bit of a downside because you have to scale it yourself
i found a simple condition where using while loops is better than for-loop
the for-loop is slightly slower than the foreach loops
calculates the size of the first 5 folder in your home dir should work on all platforms fails with an arrayindexoutofboundexception if there are less than five folder in your home dir
svn is better than cvs because it was designed to be - it s roughly the same thing with some simplications and new features
isnull can only have one input however it s been shown to be slightly faster than coalesce
with perfect forwarding and decltype auto overloading becomes alot easier but still will take time to implement and would have to be modified if ever another function was added
i ve just timed this and it is about 25 faster than using sin and cos
the conclusion of the article is that using for-loop is generally better and faster than the foreach loops
the theory is that someone extending your class with protected access knows more about what they are doing than someone who is merely using it with public access
just like an mp3 or something wav is probably faster
the system will pick the closest match and mdpi is closer to hdpi than to xxhdpi
so what i want is if the list is less than 99 hide something else if the list is more than 100 then show something this is what i placed under ajax success handler
boost intrusive_ptr performs better than shared_ptr because it doesn t need a second allocator to hold the reference count
i created the exact same network with native and backend tensorflow but after many hours of testing using number of different parameters still couldn t figure out why keras outperforms the native tensorflow and produces better slightly but better results
i use google-chrome as my main browser but sometimes firefox has much more verbose errors warnings that can make debugging a complex issue easier
tensorflow has better computational graph visualizations than theano and torch
i ve built a rails application using mysql and now would like to move some models to a postgresql database for performance reasons the tables are quite big and postgresql is faster
thus your for-loop is probably better expressed as following while loops
essentially all rsa implementations for about 30 years do not simply do c up d mod n as shown in the first few paragraphs of wikipedia or billions of blogs copied from brief news clippings or exceprts from decades ago but instead use a more complicated private-key that supports the more efficient chinese remainder theorem computation as explained if you read all of the wikipedia article or look at a text by an author who actually knows about modern cryptography
in terms of pure speed it is not always the case that myisam is faster than innodb but in my experience it tends to be faster for pure read working environments by a factor of about 2.0-2.5 times
the issue is that the execution time of a benchmarking is much higher about 3 times in case i do not invoke the profiling along with it than the case when the benchmarking is executing with the profiling
the class uses scheme a dialect of lisp which is significantly cleaner and easier to use than common lisp yes this is an opinion deal with it
you can also use underscore.js but lodash is faster more complete and you can create custom build with only what you need
ini is really a much simpler format than xml if you have less than fifty config options and they are not nested
unless you re writing trivial apps or just like re-writing code i wouldn t start any new project in codeigniter because pyrocms is the more sensible starting point
i believe ubuntu is smaller debian wheezy smaller still or even alpine for tiny start point
there is a nice comparison of threads and processes here when is clone and fork better than pthreads
telnet is more general than ftp and is generally used for command and control
postgresql is stricter about conversions than mysql is and generally will throw an error rather than try to convert a string to an integer if it doesn t look like one
zend opcache appears to be more performant than apc more fully featured and more reliable
customization and variety of animations highcharts has more customizable animations when compared to fusioncharts javascript charts
i find lapply loops easier than a for-loop in your case as initializing the list and using the counter can be avoided
first step would be to investigate why a processors with hyperthreading simultaneous multithreading could lead to poorer performances than a processors without this technology
i think richfaces has a more mature ajax integration and their ajax components and events are more easy to use for me than trinidad ones
mergesort may use more space than quicksort i m not entirely sure and merge may be better for linkedlists
get method is used for illustration here you may find that post makes more sense for this operation
bad news is that the asmlib version of memmove is slower than the glibc version it is now running at the 300ms mark on par with the glibc version of memcpy
prestashop is much easier than zen cart oscommerce and magento
the reference c++ program with input 28 compiled with llvm 8.0.0 runs in 0.67s on my machine the same with clang 3.7 is marginally slower 0.68s
the nested loops version is the slower of the two due to the extra the interpreter overhead of the for-loop
but in mysql it is ok and in postgresql it is wrong and ask for the other fields besides site_id either in a group by clause or in a aggregation function i know that postgresql is stricter on sql than mysql so i must select the site_id in the query object of msg_published but in pure sqlalchemy i can do like this
the problem is that the canvas drawn by cairo is larger than the area of gtk s scrolled_window
a lot of answers comments are mentioning that the background-color rgba is faster and more efficient but that background-image is more compatibility friendly
right now google-chrome is faster than firefox sunspider tests so your statement it loads faster in firefox is not really correct
according to wikipedia the bmp of the ucs has 65536 characters the latest version of unicode contains more than 107000 characters and the ucs has more than one million code points
-in the same laptop but using the hpc cluster of my department with 30 workers the parfor loops is much much slower than the for-loop and than the parfor loops using the local cluster with 12 workers
i will add that i ve often heard that nginx is faster than apache for serving static files to the point that it s sometimes worth using nginx for static files and reverse proxying to apache for dynamic content

are client-side binding grids better than the server-side ones
it would be somewhat easier with imagemagick than graphicsmagick as anthony thyssen has put together some excellent examples - but they rely on imagemagick capabilities such as aside-processing in parentheses which graphicsmagick lacks
you re better off with domdocument s loadhtml and domxpath
for example if you tried that and it only installed newer files with higher versioning then your major upgrade logic is incorrect by definition because that will uninstall the older product before installing the newer one
because bellman-ford runs in time o mn the overall asymptotic runtime is still o mn + n 2 log n so if m o n 2 note that this is little-o of n this approach is asymptotically faster than using floyd-warshall

if you re using retrofit and okhttp to perform the network calls i suggest you use moshi as it s also from square and claimed to work faster and better than gson
i d have to say i d personally go for either prestashop or cscart as they do have a lot more features than opencart and at the same time also don t cost anywhere near magento to setup and run
the reason why this doesn t work specifically is because ilist is more specialized than ienumerable
i have recently read that nginx is faster than apache
the suffix tree is lighter and faster than the trie and is used to index dna or optimize some large web search engines
this avoids malloc free but is less extensible and more prone to buffer overflow issues so i rarely ever use it
fortunately model-glue has tight integration with coldspring a popular bean container for cfml and model-glue 3 makes it easier than ever to use coldspring beans in your controllers
automating sudo is slighly more complex if you need to pass the passwd but still can be done
i am more familiar with postgresql than mysql

mac os x llvm gcc based crypt fuction is borked junk hardwired to only use des a proven breakable hash worse than md5
iÃ¢ ve read a so questionÃ¢ s comment where inserting order# 68 as pictured wouldnÃ¢ t cause any trouble but if i wanted to query orders by certain tags a many-to-many is more appropriate convenient efficient since otherwise in a one-to-many every single order will have to be checked to know how its tags is this true
you can even shorten the for-loop by directly pushing the objects into the arrays which is a better way -
and my php versioning is lower than 5.3.0 i upgrade that fixed my problem
alternatively you can use lxml module which is lot faster than beautifulsoup
i know another plugin named jquery corner is available however it s file size being massively bigger than curvycorners i decided to with curvycorners
what i have understood is that declarative let you do whatever you want as long as the result passes and imperative is more verbose
we all know that the access to ram memory is faster than access to hard disk
if however in your app you can ensure that the tab is active while listening then settimeout or setinterval is better as it can fire as often as 100 times per second
apache airflow is a good option if you need something more full featured than cron jobs
udp is faster than tcp and the simple reason is because its nonexistent acknowledge packet ack that permits a continuous packet stream instead of tcp that acknowledges a set of packets calculated by using the tcp window size and round-trip time rtt
it seems that in firefox ie the line-through style is a bit lower than google-chrome i am not sure if this is because of the implementation of different browsers or something
i try to align my imageview and my textview but the imageview is higher than my textview
i used the addclass and removeclass is a more elegant way of doing this
get would obviously allow for a user to change the value a lot easier than post so suitable checks for existance and ownership of the record would be important
if this is not the case a standard comparison-based sort algorithm or even an integer sorting algorithm like radix sort is asymptotically better
installing from source is somewhat more time-consuming than using macports and fink but enables you to have a working environment that is optimized for your system
i don t know anything about except that it s more powerful than gedit but doesn t have the same feel as vim emacs
in arithmetic books and computer software and more-expensive calculators this means 12+ 34 56 not 12+34 56 because multiplication has higher precedence than addition
instead of using a while loops it is easier to use a for-loop
we have found that using servlets and those 3 different kinds of handlers instead one single type of modules the generic term for other servers like apache or nginx makes user-developments easier safer and faster
i m doing a comparison of erlang haskell elixir and es6 and i m less farmiliar with erlang and elixir but i want to represent all of these languages fairly so is this good erlang code
in simple words all operations on ienumerable causes simple iteratation over all elements well it s lazy ienumerable really slower than iqueryable
that s much easier with a libcurl wrapper like curb like the tin man suggested than dropping to the shell and using libcurl there

for browsers that don t support either event you can fall back to onkeydown with a 0ms timer for the check which is a little better than onkeyup
because copying text result from jtextfield is always easier than retyping it from jlabel note that jlabel is not focusable
you could do this in matplotlib probably using patch objects to build up a cube and colour the patches as needed however for 3d plotting mayavi is generally easier better

i ve used tcpdf in the past and found it a lot better than fpdf
for my understanding the superclass is always smaller less complex then the subclassing
memcpy is not really any slower than strcpy
newer versions of mysql 5.5+ have extended innodb to support all the features that were previously only available on myisam such as fulltext and geospatial indexing and innodb performance is usually considerably better than myisam when configured properly
however i ve noticed that running the vb6 tools is becoming more and more painful over time so i m looking at the possibility of migrating this code to vb.net 2008
using sha256 with a salt will be much more secure than md5
so only letting what are used for other classes and objects nothing more than that public for those where other classes would use too protected for those limit only for extending classes
the keyword inline is more about telling the compiler that the symbol will be present in more than one object file without violating the one definition rule than about actual inlining which the compiler can decide to do or not to do
although i myself have prior experience in implementing filesystems much simpler ones than ntfs xfs or ext2 i would not tackle this job
there are many options for you like visser suggested you could convert the date time into a long int which allows faster computation or you can keep them as strings or even convert them into chars like what you have done with chars array2
i have makefile .mke on windows and i need to count directory in a folder which start with install and then make if clause to throw an exception if there are more than one directory like this

and additionally the algorithm that google-chrome uses is better than the one in firefox at least for handling the resizing of text
i have use height 100vh for .container and pulled .footer up by minus margin
fgets of course does not process escape sequences any more than strcpy would
these locations will convert when they go to windows 7 perhaps or because the application they use internally is upgrade and needs the newer browser versioning
one more thing some guys would misunderstand that post is safer than get as user can not see the sent data
pc google-chrome and safari are fine ie shows the links like in the picture firefox shows more revealed urls
post is usually intended for creating content put is more modifications
that way of adding dependencies is better managed by maven with m2e
in most cases union all is slightly faster than union distinct
you could instead check say with if feof stream to see if you are at eof but i think just checking the return value of fgetc is nicer
in my personal benchmarks laravel is undeniably faster than codeigniter due to lazy loading
but a friend told me to begin with flask as it s simpler and will help me when i start learning django as django is more complicated than flask
if your table represents id_1 is a parent of id_2 then both a parent can have many children and children can have more than one parent this is known as a many-to-many relationship
note that the behavior of memcpy is undefined when the memory blocks overlap so memmove is more appropriate here
the issue that i encountered was that google-chrome was giving me height about 300px more than the firefox ie
instead of using a gridview i d use a repeater which has less overhead and lets you write more compact html for a smaller payload to the client bind the master idatareader to that repeater
i think glassfish is a better j2ee app server to start with than jboss
in fact because you are eliminating the redundancy of epsilon transitions many simple dfa s actually get smaller than the nfa they represent but there is simply no way to guarantee that

you can probs achieve this better by using strftime and setlocale
i want to implement a functionality on gmap api that if the zoom is more than 17 show all the markers otherwise just hide them

the standard html.parser option handles broken html less well than other options while the html5lib option is closest to how a modern browser would handle broken html albeit at a slower rate than lxml would handle html parsing
most pages for this exception i found with google talk about overloaded methods setter which is not the case with my dtos - they re simple objects with nothing more than properties setter and getter
looks like for the slice use-case on google-chrome using a literal is about 4 slower on my machine on firefox it s more lke 9 with no difference at all on ie10
i heard geda was faster than both dozer and orika but my only concern is i am not sure if it can be abstracted like dozer and orika as shown in the pseudocode above
pascal and also delphi is more centered on readability than the c syntax languages which are more centered on character power as much information per character as possible
in other words guard is more a generic framework for every process which needs to do something triggered by a file change autotest is restricted to running tests
ie8 has also some issues but to a lesser extent than google-chrome and opera
i also read somewhere that uicollectionview has much better performance in displaying variable-sized content would it be worthwhile possible to try configuring a uicollectionview to display the messages and somehow make it look like a uitableview
in addition to avoiding peculiar upgrade issues when moving to a new edition and a new versioning unless you don t really mean express is sql server 2008 you also have the added bonus that you still have your original databases intact which you won t have if the upgrade fails in worse ways than simply being blocked
an activity that uses fragments is often little more than oncreate calling setcontentview
specifically nsurl nsurlrequest and either nsurlconnection or nsurlsession nsurlsession is a newer api and is suggested for use by apple
i understand that strtol and strtof are preferred to atoi atof since the former detect errors and also strtol is much more flexible than atoi when it comes to non-base-10

i found the xsl-fo designer from ecrion to be good for both programmers familiar with xslt and xsl-fo and old ladies that need to make changes to the templates we are deploying a desktop solution based on xsl-fo that replaces an older proprietary solution and the ladies can make small changes to the document templates
i would recommend cocos2d-x as it is in my opinion equally or even better than corona and it is free
the binary-min-heap you have implemented only guarantees that the parent of two children is smaller than both children as chtz has commented

update graphicsmagick is faster than imagick doesn t means gmagick is better than imagick
call to instagram on success of which you call fotogram to initialize your slider but the problem is that since you re loading many images fotorama initialization gets run more than once on each success .after first initialization any further attempt would only mess up the slider.note that if you put it outside 2 foreach that wouldn t work either because at this point even the first request would be in pending state
as soon as you go beyond single processors it s much more effective to add another cpu or two to system than to struggle with gpu calculations

you can make your life easier by using fputcsv and fgetcsv
can someone if i should use the avfoundation or whether the audiotoolbox library is better
if a remains the same and b is changing say if your code is in a loop and it s clear that a does not change between two iterations for instance because it s a const variable then the original version can execute faster because multiplication is cheaper than division assuming the compiler moves the computation of 1 .
somewhat good news you could move to tcpdf which is much better at handling utf8 and is more modern in general than fpdf
i am using asp.net-mvc 2 and i see more than one html.actionlink method that takes an idictionary as a parameter for the html attributes

primefaces has more components but lack combobox available in richfaces
the g++ version is a little larger than the gcc version but not 100x larger
i would suggest something more modern than bugzilla such as trac or lighthouse although bugzilla may fit your bill
also note that quicksort is generally more optimal than mergesort see this as well which explains why it s taken advantage of when sorting primitives
strange bitshifting code implementing multiplication or division is far less expressive of what you were conceptually trying to achieve so other developers will be confused by that and a confused programmer s more likely to introduce bugs or remove something essential in an effort to restore seeming sanity
postgresql or mysql is better for production environment
edit2 okay i just see that if the angle is bigger than 180Ã¢ it s concave so i have to change the shape for be simple than a triangulation
in fact oracle is so sure that innodb is better that they removed myisam from 8.0

as i now joined the team so i am trying to change it to rspec-based integration testing using capybara but i have to convince the top management that rspec and capybara is better option for rails based application
and have lower precedence than addition and subtraction so it messes up your expressions
i think what s written within your for-loop while loops is of greater importance of what s affecting your running time
further the relative speed of profiled code may well differ hugely between them - pypy code is low-level and so introducing profiling is likely to slow it down relatively speaking more than cpython
unless there is specific reason to do it fopen fseek ftell is a better idea portable staying within the c standard library
i m curious about why bitwise operations were slightly faster than addition subtraction operations on older microprocessors
the book states the following if you want parameters to be optional use property getter setter which is a better way of defining optional parameters than adding different constructors to the class for each dependency.
so my question is how to move this database into ram where i can access it via sqlite3_open or if my idea is bullshit and leaving the database on disk is faster than moving it into ram via mapping
ps i m not set on swt if anybody thinks a different library technology such as swing awt is better
qmainwindow is basically same as qwidget when used as a guess what main window the noticeable difference is that qwidget expects you to have only 1 window in ur application while qmainwindow is more about serving as the most important window which will control all the rest like alert message boxes for example
now i want to convince it by using apt-pinning and not hold to keep the local package if the versioning is the same and try to upgrade only if the remote versioning is newer
myisam also tends to store data in less space than innodb
in other words instead of mis-using stderr like this - look into ways to gain more control over stdout
found that the issue stemmed from using the firefox webdriver which apparently has much higher security than its google-chrome counterpart
i don t know whether this port of cql3 to ruby support activerecord it acts more like a simple datamapper but it worths having a look
it s no more multiplication than addition so is misleading syntax.
they do this using a jquery plugin called isotope which is a more complete version of masonry you pay for
i ve used vim for 10+ years but never really into vim scripting always subjectively beliving that this was one area where vim was weaker than emacs
shifting bits left and right is apparently faster than multiplication and division operations on most maybe even all cpus if you happen to be using a power of 2
also if you notice i ve changed the keyup event to keydown which is better in my opinion cause when the user holds their finger down on a button the code wouldn t be fired if it is on the keyup event
sometimes this way is a better than stdout stderr but you have to use openlog closelog
in comparison to a previous implementation that was purely in python evaluating the c-code is so much faster than the splines interpolation that the evaluation of splines is the bottleneck in the ode function
mongodb supports no more than 100 levels of nesting for bson documents
what is the established way to pass some data Ã¢ more than int boolean string because those can be handled as marker attributes Ã¢ from the class that creates an imarker to an imarkerresolution so that the quick fix can be smart about what it displays does
the mouseenter event is usually a better choice than mouseover
another project you might want to look at is cassette which pretty much does everything squishit does and more
if you upgrade to pandas 0.12 you can use the new filtering method on grouping which makes this more succinct and straightforward
to get your code to run more than once put it in a while loop
koa doesn t provide this kind of thing out of the box - it s designed to be a little more low level than express
finding a package that can work with both new delete and malloc free obviously gives you more flexibility
in its basic form the three lines are way thinner than within safari or google-chrome
the downsides are that it is unreliable messages can be dropped or corrupted therefore you may want to add some safety and that some isp may restrict udp more than tcp test yourself to be sure but usually there is no problems
please someone tell me that there is an better way than creating setter and getter for every bit field in my project
quicksort is generally regarded as mutable and may therefore be less useful in a functional setting but mergesort is generally better suited for a functional setting
post get method doesn t have the same lenght limit you can use post to send more data than with get
vba add-in are a bit troublesome to deploy but vsto is even more so
i was always taught that division is slower than multiplication but i have no real proof of thisÃ¢ has anyone got an opinion on this before i start benchmarking and running test
for reading large csv files you should either use readr read_csv or data.table fread as both are much faster than base read.table
mongodb supports no more than 100 levels of nesting for bson document.
it is worth learning both because emacs is better than vim at editing certain languages and doing certain tasks and vice versa
codeigniter and kohana has more complex translators but basically are the same above..
you could also use sumifs with countif it s a more basic formula not as powerful as filter but just as funcitonal
rjdbc may also be a more stable option in the linux environment especially now that the fetch code has been re-written in java as of development release 0.2-0 on r-forge its performance is on par with if not better than rodbc
the compiler is free to choose a method that is more efficient than memmove
swift won t allow you to do absolutely everything that objective-c does but it will allow you to do almost everything and the code will be probably more robust considering that swift is more modern language with stronger typing than objective-c
a cstring is more like a visual basic string or a bstr
arabic default font in google-chrome is larger than it is in firefox
short answer dijkstra s is your best bet if you want just a few shortest paths and the floyd-warshall algorithm is better if you want to find the shortest paths between every pair of nodes
as you can see in the image google-chrome is running a lot longer than opera
instead methods like .live or .on since the former is deprecated are more useful with mouse and keyboard events generally speaking
but honestly cron is fairly lightweight and unless it needs to be real-time or whatever that means to you writing php into a daemon is more work than it s work
btw a case-sensitive search done with removing i is much faster than a case-insensitive search
it was specifically developed with containerised systems in mind to make it easier and can be a better choice than uwsgi and gunicorn
using des assuming it s a little faster than aes and requires a smaller key and
if your server versioning is older it is highly recommended to upgrade postgres anyway to use jsonb efficiently
the screens is much smaller so you can not present your app the same way as you can on a tablet
restructuring of the database to just add an salt field is better option or the only one really if your going to do it properly but you could use your currant hash field to store the salt as other person posted
i don t know how it works but it s much more complex than addition subtraction or even multiplication
for small buffers hot in l1d cache avx can copy significantly faster than sse on cpus like haswell where 256b loads stores really do use a 256b data path to l1d cache instead of splitting into two 128b operations
svn is better than cvs
i chose to rely only on pycrypto and pyopenssl since m2crypto is less popular and not well-maintained which is a hazard from both compatibility pypy and security perspectives
splinter makes it easier to use selenium plus
depending on context floating-point code may be as fast as or faster than integer code or it may be four times slower
gson is not particularly fast but the jackson library can almost compete with most binary serializers jackson is 2-4x faster than gson in most situations and 10-20x faster on utf-8 because it has special code for utf-8
i suggest you starting with memset instead though since memcpy is much more complicated than you might think
but modifying the arrays is more work than a simple for-loop again
.net makes this better by separating nullreferenceexception you dereferenced a null value from argumentnullexception you shouldn t have passed in null as an argument - and it was for this parameter
ati might be a better between nvidia and ati since it was reportedly faster in 2009 but i m not sure if those stats are still correct
database performance of the innodb is not necessary faster than the myisam engine
fastcgi++ is everything i could hope for for the ajax demands but it doesn t have websockets and i chose websocket++ over libwebsockets since websocket++ is more or less a simple #include so i assumed that i could incorporate it into fastcgi++
udp is faster and requires less bandwidth than tcp
on a better machine 8 x intel r xeon r cpu e5-4610 v2 2.30ghz 256 gb ram much to my surprise i obtained an average 3 milions increments despite the fact that processors is much better

1 reading other questions about the rest method for this proposes i think that i should use get better than post
gmagick is newer version of imagick with more set of features it is less resource intensive and fast but the problem is there is very few discussion about this wonderful tool on web i recently came across this on
from the performance side float multiplication is faster than division but i don t think that in the gui code it can create significant difference
also i advise you to take a look at javascript s setinterval since it is more appropriate than settimeout for what you want to do
for example if i click the smaller tabitem the tabcontrol becomes smaller and if i select the bigger one it becomes bigger
i m currently considering which is a better choice for my php application - mysql which i m more familiar with or postgresql which has less php support no object-oriented wrapper but seems tried and tested
is embedded jar better than embedded war file
tuning innodb which is the better engine requires adjusting different values than myisam which is often the fast-but-unsafe default
i donÃ¢ t like using git itself though itÃ¢ s far better than svn or cvs but github is such an awesome site that iÃ¢ ve considered switching just to use it
while this works if you are using fasm or nasm it is much easier to use a far jmp if you are still in 32-bit mode
swift is clearer on versions releases and i keep asking myself if i am missing something related to objective-c since i can t find this information
if so this should work and it should also be a lot quicker than using modulo and division
although madprogrammers comment to use a gridbaglayout is an easier solution but knowing about glue and struts can be helpful for customizing the layout of a boxlayout
in the code below i use block multiplication to speed up your code for a 1024x1204 matrix by more than a factors of ten 7.1 s with old code and 0.6s with new using only a single thread without using sse avx
on today s machines that s a non-issue but if you ever find yourself dealing with older gear it s my experience that vim is far more likely to work on a wonky terminal than emacs is
you can do it with qtkit but works better in 32bit quicktime framework
paradoxally it does not mean that apache is faster than nginx it just means that on 1 2 3 .
also you might want to use mouseenter and mouseleave which are sanitized by jquery and are a little more reliable than mouseover and mouseout
also don t forget to upgrade the gradle plugin to 1.5.0 or newer as older versioning are not supported
i thought i could somehow i am totally fresh iterate trough the folder which exists in one folder will all this other folder and check if the dir contains more than one file if not rmdir foldername
the more randomness and more characters your salt has the better for the hash but anything that s several characters long and random works
by looking at the google groups for qjplot and flot the support for jqplot is better lot s of unanswered questions at the flot group
however a ram disk is easier to work with
i ve used both robospice is more robust but ion is easier on the eyes
even though this is supported by c# via ienumerator ienumerable there is a better idiom foreach
i see ones i merge master to feature branch i can not squash he commits any more using interactive rebase
how do i make apps smaller with qmake and macdeployqt
using an extra variable to avoid the costly division and the resulting time was 18.9s so significantly better than the modulo with a statically known constant
if there are many modifications of the data it s said that innodb works faster because it uses row locking instead of table locking like myisam
further to this i m still opting for scoreloop and i can confirm this behaves the same regarding one score per user but it offers a lot more functionality and does seem to respond much quicker than openfeint did for me
one more example with gem fog and heroku configuration for carrierwave with amazon s3 hosted on heroku
valid choices for hashing include sha1 or md5 although sha1 is preferable because it produces a larger hash and is considered cryptographically stronger than md5
its what s used for keyboard input in wpf way more than the keydown and keyup events
additional options are to show this via a timeout so it s only shown when the post takes more than a short time and to use some form of fadein not sure if possible with a dialog then you don t get the annoying flash on the times it s very quick
the difference between self and a smalltalk-80 such as squeak or visualworks is less than the differences between smalltalk-80 and smalltalk-72
xslt is significantly more appropriate to use than xquery for such kind of tasks
the origin server would get the images from s3 process them using graphicsmagick since it s much faster than imagemagick then serve them
svn works much better when disconnected from the network - with perforce you have to tell the server when you ve done a checkout
i ve heard that noexcept keyword is more like it should never throw an exception rather than it doesn t
nowadays however the rationale behind the sealed modifiers is far more about design choices controlling how client code interacts with your library
since developing in ironruby ironpython is faster you can use it to write pocs and later implement the real application in c# or whatever you re using
is there any way of better dealing with large rss feed
con you can encounter issues related to library versions and dependencies macports has more software than homebrew
nowadays with xquery there is no reason to use xslt anymore xquery is much nicer
this conclusion would follow from a logic if an unrolled loops is faster than a for-loop executing a lot of unrolled loops should be faster than executing a lot of for loops
gson is very easy to use while jackson has better performance
this salt is nothing more than a random arbitrary string that you concatenate to the passwords and it will make your hash password unique
disk io - even ssd - is many orders of magnitude slower than the ram that the hashing is going though
in this case mouseenter mouseleave has better behaviour and prevents bubbling compared to mouseover mouseout
maven is better for managing dependencies but ant is ok with them too if you use ant+ivy and build artefacts
memcpy is rarely slower than strcpy or strncpy and often significantly faster
if i do it with a simple for-loop i will get an error because loops is done faster then the sensors are changed
it is a great tool if you want to use git as frontend for an existing svn server but for one-time conversions you should not use git-svn but svn2git which is much more suited for this use-case and also makes proper git tags from the svn tags
i m developing with canvas too and have found that webkit based browsers in general handle canvas operations quicker than gecko in most cases
as disk is 1000s of times slower than ram this problem can grind the machine down to a practical halt
if you need more than a simple method call you could just as well create a more elaborate clicklistener implementation that has more than the buttonclick method
get is always faster than post
http put isn t inherently any more secure than http post if you re allowing the uploaded files to be exceuted on your server
you see there are many reasons why git-svn is worse and the kde svn2git is superior
in the code we calculate 1.0 sum .. because a division usually is more expensive than a multiplication and thus can gain some efficiency with that
the pattern-based version installed by default on red hat-based linux distros fedora centos etc is simpler
now this works fine in google-chrome and safari and i have had to use assitional css settings for firefox but ie and opera both display my ribbon div about 25px higher than in google-chrome or safari
i have been using asihttprequest but it seems to be deprecated and i read that restkit is the newer library
while you could use -cp to javac to add the required dependencies to this compilation you d be far better served by learning ant or maven
a little more pull than push style that s because there is no duplicate item.
i m sure you could do something with auto-layout but when you have a view that has subviews that need to be positioned within it subclassing uiview is a better way to go in my opinion
glassfish seems to be slower than resin
why in firefox text smaller left than in google-chrome and opera right
at any rate disk speeds are orders of magnitude lower than the ram speed and i wouldn t be too much concerned about the mode here unless of course it turns out that caching is different in the two modes
running with azure batch is also an option as the .net will work well and azure batch is cheaper if the custom activity is the only reason for having a hdinsight cluster
you should be generating a random string longer than an md5 hash not shorter
most likely it ll still be tightly linked with implementations generally a bad thing or if not bad it s not especially good but i think a structure like this is better than a superclass figuring out what all of its subclassing are
if they are connected over the internet you could try to use the examples for tcp but tcp has more overhead than udp
the events seem to not follow strict sequential rules second keydown comes earlier than first keyup so the timer gets initialized multiple times
using default no protected private public is even worse as it allows classes in the same package or subclasses to access the logger
that s hard to say.the worst of mergesort is n log2n -n+1 which is accurate if n equals 2 k i have already proved this .and for any n it s between n lg n - n + 1 and n lg n + n + o lg n .but for quicksort its best is nlog2n also n equals 2 k .if you divide mergesort by quicksort it equals one when n is infinite.so it s as if the worst case of mergesort is better than the best case of quicksort why do we use quicksort
since bootstrap-datetimepicker use momentjs it is better to use localized formats from the official documentation
is there a more straightforward solution with scalaz maybe with an existing combinators
on my computer firefox performs much better than google-chrome on these tests using jsperf
another camera that i am thinking to use is the asus movement sensor but i dont know if this is better than kinect more options i know that both uses openni or if both are the same
for these ultra simple queries postgresql can be slower than mysql - postgresql has richer planner that works better on more complex queries but on trivial queries is slower
in maven you can define a.k.a testing.staging live etc which allow you to configure settings for different environments.all you need to specify maven about the environment for which you want the things to move and maven is capable enough to take care of this.though this can be done with ant also but i believe that maven provides more flexibility
the fact that udp s header size is less than tcp s is because is a simpler protocol that needs less header space that s all there is to it
i would advice to switch to server-side processing of table data instead of using client-side it is more preferable if your application works with a lot of rows more than several hundreds
in most cases usage of addclass removeclass brings much more flexibility
but i believe sending data using curl with post method is better than get method
if i need to display one 1 friends post i can do this simply but when there are couple of friends with more than 1 post i can t get the name and picurl of the user and it displays null in json response
i ve taken the example of two linefeed here but the same is true for any character string i could subvert the problem by maybe taking a longer string as the delimiter but that would have two undersirable effects
i am getting better with google-chrome and firefox debugging tools but i still have not found a way to easily examine the local entity cache managed by breeze
it would appear from your question that the period of the tcp message is shorter than the arp refresh time
imho - if breaking up my components to parent children means less testability - then something is wrong with this framework
servers like lighthttp and nginx can handle large amounts of traffic in much less memory than apache if you can sacrifice apache s power and flexibility or if you just don t need those things which often you don t
in ie8 and google-chrome it runs even faster than firefox in general and this slow down never happens
haskell has more momentum these days but there are plenty of good parsing libraries for ocaml as well including the peg parser generator aurochs menhir and the glr parser generator dypgen
the difference between socket and tcplistener tcpclient is that tcplistener tcpclient is easier to use than socket
ie firefox higher than baseline google-chrome on baseline
because this is a salt hash it s even more difficult
owing to the fact that the screens density on the tablet is smaller android therefore uses the images in the mdpi folder for the tablet and the slightly bigger ones in the hdpi folder for the phone
is the code more readable with getter and setter that emphasize the fact we are reading writing a property or with properties that at first sight can be confused with parameterless methods
we recently have migrated redmine from a server which was running under centos 5.5 with the same ror environment the same load the performance was a way better than on debian 7
i have been searching on the net and i made a couple of examples of both of them but i m even more confused because in some sample web pages mvp uses more than 2 interfaces to communicate the presenter with the view layer some ones even have completely blank interfaces only declarated but in other ones it only takes two interfaces to transport data from presenter to view
on post and put it is always better to return the modified resource including its id
unlike the ng-view it s possible that there are more than one ng-controller in the same page
2 as mentioned by mike brent get is wide open to easy and simple abuses but while his recommendation of post is better it s still open to abuse unless appropriate measures are taken see 3 below
is there a situation when decltype auto would be a better choice than auto possibly with or cv qualifiers when using range-based for loops
taking java s operator-precedence notably that + has higher precedence than and associativity rules into account the expression is equivalent to
same effect but this approach is less verbose unlike in case of gridbaglayout and i personally think that miglayout is easier to use
in contrast to jenkins teamcity produces much more detailed reports and provides the ability to track the history of a test- how often does it get broken etc. suspend tests .
you can actually switch to strtod always a much better idea than atof and ask it to give you the character position that caused it to stop parsing
check out the quartz scheduler it does what cron does and more is easily integrated in a web app and allows you to call jobs written in java without any complicated plumbing
in their respective worst cases heapsort is faster than quicksort
i think using a gridview is better for your case than a listview
besides the dbcontext api is easier to use than objectcontext
here i don t like that the body of the post request contains more different fields then the body returned from the get request - but maybe this is not a problem
the os heap uses the cpu s virtual memory hardware and is free from fragmentation issues and can even effectively use the disk s swap space allowing you to allocate more memory than available ram
xcopy will not be better than robocopy at this
is there any easy php testing framework and may be simpler than simpletest and not command line based like phpunit
the key question was related to what kind of situations would udp be the better choice over tcp
you could get them to do a udp multicast within a lan environment to identify the programs using protocol messages then have a stored cache of each other s identity and then use tcp to connect and do main exchanging of messages which is more reliable than udp
the jni sincos is better than computing sin and cos but the sqrt approach is still faster
udp is faster than tcp because packets are sent without guarantee of delivery nor order
or indeed if your system has strdup or you re willing to write an implementation then strdup is much cleaner than malloc + strcpy
it was the first framework in python i ever used but it was really simple to use really no more than flask or bottle
and modern broswers like firefox or google-chrome requires more bytes to start browser display
zim s advice is excellent and searching on int will always be faster than chars
myisam for reads may well be faster than innodb
freemarker provides much better native whitespace handling recent velocity releases provide more interesting content controls #define #evaluate # literal block #
numbers less than zero however you might use the more descriptive negative-number tag
you can use get or post both but in my opinion post is better way here
although this problem sort of yells delegate it s much easier with subclassing since you intend to inherited almost all the same functionality
browser google-chrome firefox firefox requires more resizing to get the same effect
jasmine is clearly more bdd focused than qunit although i could see doing bdd with qunit by describing the tests in a behavior-oriented way
also please suggest me an open source json binder better than gson could be jackson json genson or if any other which could help me to develop fully fledged application in which application continuously hit to restful services and receives the response from the same
the function isnull is kind of equivalent but coalesce allows more arguments and is standard sql.
using malloc free directly is safer
escaping the quotes with back-slashes works hi there you but embedding apostrophes single-quotes within double-quotes is often easier
biggest of all is that adding new features to your vb6 application is more expensive than it would be if the application was in a better language like c# or vb.net
junit is more direct and simpel to use if you start to learn java testng has more features but maybe is more complex
edit 31 march 2014 for what it s worth i have found that pdfbox is much better at text extraction than itextsharp notwithstanding a bespoke strategy implementation and pdflib tet is slightly better than pdfbox but it s quite expensive
posting qevents to qobject is faster than using signal-slot invocations because there are no copy constructors called and there s no marshalling done except directly by you upon construction of a qevent
i m using keep-alive so i think the ssl handshake is more or less totally out but i hope to move to spdy soon so i don t really know how that helps after the initial handshake
although jackson s nexttoken will work like skipvalue gson seems more flexible to me
more modern processors handle hyperthreading better than older processors
if you want to bridge guice and hk2 it s little more complicated
they are functionally identical however it can be argued that the for-loop is less error prone because all of loops functionality is right there together
in my opinion calling getter and setter is slower than direct access to a field
as stated by other answers neither push nor pull is better but rather you should pick the one that best fits your design needs
what baffles me is that my mergesort seems to be slower than heapsort in both of the languages
in git you can do the same with playing around in the index staging area but bazaar has a better ui for it
if you want to be more secure you can send the sms s more often however there is a way to understand sim-card change this is for t-mobile and europe use i guess from within the app so that the user cant fool you by enetering sms for a different msisdn and then change to his her real msisdn sim card
bottom line i would personally hesitate to draw any simple conclusions of swift is faster than objective-c or vice versa
datamapper is newer than activerecord
the downside is that you are losing the big part of the flyway s appeal in its simplicity and technically could be better off by using liquibase s dsl
also javassist is recognized to be slower than cglib
koa middleware is much simpler and less hacky than express middleware due to the way middleware flows in a stack-like manner
i would suggest furthering your knowledge of python it s an amazing language so it s gonna be fun and then go back to django or maybe start with a smaller framework like flask which does less magic
the silverstripe cms is a great php framework better than laravel the most popular at the moment but its documenation lacking
jqplot is free in my opinion has better chart than flot it doesnÃ¢ t have events
note first there is no combobox item in awt there is jcombobox in swing which is better to use than choice of awt
you don t need regular expressions at all you could use explode substr is probably better but i want to show another alternative
in my experience normal execution on iphone is much faster than profiling with instrumentation
uiview animation is generally easier and more intuitive to use than caanimation
it is not better than md5 plus salt
it seems possible to have adfs as the ip-sts send an assertion to more than 1 acs url based upon the acs url or acs index in the authnrequest as long as they are listed in the relaying party trust endpoints list
this means calloc can potentially be faster than calling malloc followed by memset since it can skip the memset if it knows it will already by zeroed
headers copied from google-chrome only since safari is harder to copy paste from
i think that instead of a for-loop is better a while because when you find your item can break loops
are there some solutions available to extends asp.net identity better than implements a custom solution as suggested in the links
on a side note i d recommend using tcpdf instead - it s a fork of fpdf that has better supports for utf8 among some other improvements
it can be hard to get the layuots exact the way you want in swt it s usually easier in swing
in my experience firefox is sometimes more lenient than google-chrome but i would definitely test in both
but conversely malloc free typically makes better use of memory than a modern copying gc .
using settimeout is considered better than setinterval because of the screwy ways that js s event loop works
i ve tried using more than 1 for-loop and to zip the files using an arrays but to no avail
use hashmap that it has o 1 speed also iterate the arrays of integers in enhanced for-loop because it is slightly faster than ordinary for-loop
one more thing as in maven we can update or if we save the pom.xml file maven downloads all those dependency automatically
think about project management bug reports and it all adds up to something more than just cruisecontrol svn and nant
in portrait mode your phone screens is smaller than that so screen_is_narrow is true whereas in landscape mode and on tablet it is wider and thus screen_is_narrow becomes false
we started experimenting with hapijs on smaller services and kind of like it more than express
has no keyboard or mouse there is much less entropy generated
gitosis which is no longer in active development and you should be using gitolite but this answer applies to both of them stores each user s public keys in in your case gitosis .ssh authorized_keys
i know this does not answer your core question why avx is slower but since your ultimate goal is fast popcount the avx - sse comparison is irrelevant as both are inferior to the builtin popcount
it is written in tcl which is a language somewhat simpler than perl but broadly in the same family and not difficult to learn
buy as much memory as you can afford ram is alway faster than io from disk
i ve read time and time again that tdd test first is more difficult with mstest than it is with other testing frameworks such as nunit mbunit etc.
do you have any situation where stateful is more appropriate than stateless
nfs with the right setup version and tuning is just a tad slower than smb cifs
it s possible though that software could mess things up by making subtraction slower than addition - but that s unlikely
i tried this code with my the big arrays it is around 10 to 20 times faster than a for-loop solution and around 200 times fast than the old code
it s usually better to use quicksort instead of heapsort even though heapsort is better in theory consumes o 1 extra memory and o n log n time in worst case
but we can assume that generics in objective-c were introduced for transitioning to swift and in that regard using swift directly is even better
is using onclicklistener in arrayadapter worse than onitemclicklistener
firefox and ie9 require a proper domain to run from presumably because they are more strict than google-chrome in the way they associate the localstorate object to a domain in google-chrome it doesn t need to be a domain as such
i have 2 more uiview as subviews in scrollcontainer view
as wuliwong said sinatra and padrino are way less complex than ruby-on-rails
how is spi better than i2c at these temperatures
objectdatasource also allows for more efficient paging than a simple sqldatasource i m assuming that s what you re using
that means firefox is more than 7x faster than google-chrome here
if there s any heavy application logic as opposed to all of the work being networking files database ironpython is much faster than cpython at a few things and much slower at a few others so you probably need to profile and perf-test before you go too far down either path
get method is not safer than post data never trust datas coming from the client side
the simultaneous use of more than one cpu or processors core to programmatically execute a program or multiple computational threads
of course you can only debugging the code to see the generated sql but it s easier with a profiling tool and you ll see how long time the query takes
you have mentioned that we can t use actions more than get post put delete which is not true
i think architecture with sockets was chosen for better portability between different lisp btw slime also supports clojure and mit scheme and os-es slime works on windows too
g++ compiler is more strict then gcc compiler
but on the comparatively rare occasions where it happens it ll be a lot easier with the getter setter in place
is it possible to use the same vbo with more than one vao like this
put a group of controls for which you would later call findsize ... under the same parent a panel for example or a groupbox whichever makes more sense to you
testng has more capabilities and can be helpful with integration tests junit is more focused on unit tests
iterating pair-wise you d normally do something like but iterating over an arrays is faster than using a c-style for-loop
in my experience btrace overhead is far less noticeable than any profiler depending on activity of course - if you want to trace execution of all methods this will be expensive no matter what
from what i have read the dbcontext is a simplified version of the objectcontext and makes it easier to work with
an arrays usually offers more information for alias analysis and after some optimizations the same code will be generated anyway search for-loop strength reduction if curious
most likely your post value has one or more characters in it that are breaking the html of the page and ie firefox are being a bit more forgiving than google-chrome is
svn is much better then cvs and git or mercurial are even better again
in terms of your speed query i d propose that your pseudomedian filtering is faster because it doesn t involve sorting
subclassing collections is dangerous because for example you don t know whether or not addall delegates to add inside the superclass this is explained further in effective java p.71
while the differences may seem insignificant at first the correct usage of radio button and checkbox creates a better user experience because the site behaves in a way they expect
myisam is faster when the query is simple but it s much slower in a high concurrent environment as its table level lock comparing to innodb s row level lock
what s weirder after mouseleave and mouseenter again the second time it scales up by only a total of 0.81
maybe one of you guys already sees a problem in the code snippets or have any other suggestion or hint for me why my udp transmission is slower than tcp
i don t want to use the get request since it says in the guidelines of a restful api that it should use post for this purpose plus i might want to send more data than get can handle
we can either extends thread which will implicitly implements runnable but then we can t extends any other class so implements runnable is better approch
on linux it would be easier for you to link to shared library and use symlinks to correct version - imo it s much easier than using dlopen + dlsym
on a system with more than one processors or processors cores you can normally assuming you do have a smp-enabled system cpu affinity doesn t prevent it expect those two processes to use both processors but you do not strictly have a guarantee
the first calloc subsequently malloc has a longer execution time then
side note if you are attempting to create a new customer you may want to use post instead as it may be considered more restful as put s are generally for updating an existing resource but this is up to you
rebuild a new png format in-memory data which is much more smaller than current bmp data and send the new png format data by socket to remote server
edit i guess release is much faster than debugging but why is this profiling so time consuming
what i know is using iqueryable is better than ienumerable if another query is going to be performed
personally i prefer objective-c because you can use c very easily as anything that is legal in c is also legal in objective-c added to which swift is a more procedural in style where objective-c is quite clearly object orientated
the browser does not matter though safari gets way more consistently working results than google-chrome
since a war folder necessarily precedes the creation of a .war archive since a .war archive is simply a zipped up war directory obtaining the war directory is provably easier than obtaining a .war file
once you md5 hash it you have to map that to the token that is less than that hash
b use indexes - postgresql has bigger repertoar of indexes then mysql so use it - there are gist gin indexes
at this point there is nothing i can do since the switching is no longer there... the external screens is just a blank screens for the sake of the exercise
appearing disappearing on mouseover mouseout is a more common practice
you can do it using rhino 1.6r6 or higher with javascript getter and setter
i sure would like to use uwsgi as it is an ambitious project but at the end of the day i am a developer and not a sys admin and gunicorn is much easier to just get working in the common use cases
a larger cache reduces the number of reads but up to a certain limit also increases the amount of unsaved data that rethinkdb can accumulate in ram to make disk writes more efficient
on almost any platform memcpy is going to be faster than strcpy when copying the same number of bytes
even though vmware has been faster for me i still use virtualbox because it s good enough and is free and im cheap
sortedlist is faster than sorteddictionary
using signalr is not a good idea because signalr using push mechanism to notify but it seems in your case some pull method is more suitable and also signalr doesn t support really permanent queue to keep messages in queue while consumers being ready
here is how gcc does it it sign extends if the integer type is larger than the pointer type this ll happen regardless of the integer being signed or unsigned just because that s how gcc decided to implements it
which protocol tcp udp is more common to use in a p2p design
postgresql has more established support for this but mysql has played catch up in the last year or so and has a working method of this in the latest versions
google-chrome has a bigger time difference yet firefox is the one with the gap in the animation
should i just look for more than one cpu core and how do i detect that or maybe the processors speed or total system memory
i ve seen questions like this come up before and the general consensus is that jackson is much faster than gson
i have a uitabbarcontroller with more than 5 uitabbaritem so the morenavigationcontroller is available
memcached is in-memory too and a bit slower than apc
you could also use a for each loops to handle this though that type of loops is slower than a standard for-loop depending on application
the range-based for-loop syntax is cleaner and more universal but you can t execute the code in loops for a specified range different than from begin to end
however there are many others ts xts which is generally faster than zoo .
as a general rule division is slow and multiplication is faster and bit shifting is faster yet
while relational-model can express any finite set of facts since it s equivalent to first-order logic the entity-relationship-model is more limited
if your output is going to be similar to your input with small changes then the xslt solution is often a lot simpler than the xquery solution
the famous line is nginx is not apache in other words nginx has better ways to handle urls than rewriting
really a while loops would probably have been clearer than a for-loop on reflection
the immutable dictionary implementation is faster but no less pure in usage than the map implementation
sqlite is a more simpler database than postgresql or mysql and if you are testing very small applications you can easily use it instead of postgresql
i don t know why this works i can only assume that httplib is slightly better behaved than urllib
that s one reason why omitting distinct and replacing union by union all is much faster
i didn t work with these applications yet but afaik typo3 and ezpublish both php are considered much more professional than joomla
mysql is easier than postgresql but it doesn t really matter either way
in practice however quicksort is usually faster then heapsort
t is not very important as long as alpha is small otherwise you will run into some rather weird nyquist issues aliasing etc. and if you are working on a processor where multiplication is cheaper than division or fixed-point issues are important precalculate omega
not show from start is better than show and then hide
if you intend manual config it s probably better to choose something else for example ini
i don t see any reason why filechannel could be any faster than fileoutputstream in this case
if the amount of ram is less you ll have a lot of swapping to disk which is a lot more time consuming
trust me i did this before for another job where the system architect decided that maven was better than ant and all of our projects must be converted from ant to maven
but i read in this post that group by on union are not possible yet it mean that cypher is less powerful than gremlin
kerberos is complex to set up and even though it generally is considered faster than ntlm this is only true when you reach a certain limit of simultanious users on your site
for this the best option is gitolite better than gitosis
inverse is for bidirectional associations and most often it s on the same side with cascade but that s because the many-to-one side is much more efficient to control the association than the one-to-many one
first of all qglwidget does everything glut does plus more
first of them works quite good on cpu intel i7 and on fermi gpu gf 540m cpu time is near to openblas and fermi gpu time is near to cublas about 18ms but this implementation works 10x slower than cublas on maxwell gpu titanx - 5 ms vs 0.4 ms
edit as willeke has pointed out accessing a properties directly is technically faster than doing so via an accessor via self
public static field access would cost you less resources than setter getter methods
inherited is more of an is-a relationship for example a usermodel is-a model thus all properties and methods of a model will be part of a usermodel
with inherited this is less likely to happen due the contractual nature of subclassing abstract classes
how could i make the imageview have more priority than textview
but if you simply want to feed some content that will be displayed through its parent render method then using the children is more appropriate
i need to find out that how much division operation is faster than addition operation in a gpu
the first option is easy with one directory but becomes much more tedious with multiple folder not to mention that windows will likely create an object in the target directory before it has finished copying and i am compressing files potentially over 10 gb so that solution won t work
instead doing it with lxml which i found to be the fastest somehow even faster than celementtree
if i is rather little just iterate and keep i minimum datas insert every new data in a binary tree of the i most little datas if it is less than the max of these datas
what happen when icmp is disabled in an router and when packet size greater than mtu how the router fragments that packet
much better than pdfminer and pypdf in terms of text extraction
since using ram is faster than using disk zram allows linux to make more use of ram when swapping paging is required especially on older computers with less ram installed
note that in case your words are separated with more than whitespace punctuation for example use w+
setinterval would be the better way than settimeout
i know that rails jruby handles concurrency better than mri but i don t know how to do it
web.py has a templating language of it s own it looks easier than django s
it has support for tokenizing lemmatizing n-gram ideas that span more than one words
as already mentioned by others better to use swing over awt since swing is more advanced
using throw new runtimeexception e is simpler to comprehend than throwables.propagate in the scenario where you want to throw an unchecked-exception wrapping a checked exception
my view is that if in some cases objective-c is faster than swift it doesn t mean that all over performance of swift is slower
compared to sleep 3 and usleep 3 nanosleep has the advantage of not affecting any signals it is standardized by pthreads it provides higher timing resolution and it allows to continue a sleep that has been interrupted by a signal more easily
injecting code in a swift application is harder than it was for an objective-c application but it s still possible
with regard to implementation it also takes advantage of a bit of a non-obvious property of r precedence rules actually this is true of other languages as well such as c c++ and java namely that unary negative is higher than modulo which is higher than binary subtraction thus the calculation for is equivalent to
for starters beautifulsoup is no longer actively maintained and the author even recommends alternatives such as lxml
but with setinterval combined with clearinterval it is more straightforward
when the result of math.pow i j a double is larger than integer.max_value and you cast to an int then the result is integer.max_value
i prefer web2py because there are more conveniences built into the environment than offered by django but web2py is much newer than django and hindsight always makes it easier make new implementations better
also with this method you could use different container for different dimensions like if you need one dimension to be sorted use qmap which is sorted by key for that and qhash which is more efficient for the dimension which doesn t need sorting
i have encounter a problem with google-chrome that is similar to an older issue with firefox at this url scrolling blocks javascript execution in firefox
get is more vulnerable than post as it can be transmitted and stored
interpreted-language tend to be but not always are significantly slower than compiled-language
it recommends using ctr cmd + 1 to use the keyboard this is much better than having to use the mouse but i m still looking for a just do the right thing most of the time automatic solution
namedtuple should perform better less overhead than dictionary if the lists are long
you can enable the root account and set a passwd but jumping to it with sudo is the better method
python versions you install using pyenv go into its directory by default pyenv root is .pyenv so are more global than virtualenv
firefox is clearly less secured it deliberately allows something that google-chrome locks down
for security md5 is not the best method hash is much better
using post data is more secure than get because with get the details would be in the query string portion of the url
i got a draggable object done with jquery ui and when i drag it it s way slower than i move my mouse
note that this usually happens under the release profiling which is more strict by default about errors than say debugging
this is ancedotal but the postgresql servers i ve managed have always been much less troublesome than mysql which likes to randomly crash once in a while occasionally corrupting a table on the way down
the next text is an overlay between firefox und google-chrome - firefox is broader
i don t see why sbcl should be so fast - scheme is a far simpler language than common lisp
is that casting from long to int plus sparsearray optimizations are going to be cheaper than autoboxing long to long for my hashmap operations
putting the salt at the beginning is better than putting it at the end as more randomness at the beginning of hash is better than randomness at the end
webclient is simpler to use than webrequest
what about using more than one encoder to encode my code because if we take a look at ioncube you will see some people can decoder it
pyglet is more strict the pyopengl so i m now learning it
nginx is still faster and i might choose it but apache isn t asleep
dynamic memory management on an small embedded system is tricky to begin with but realloc is no more complicated than a free and malloc of course that s not what it does
both works but division is generally slower than multiplication
as an aside my c c++ is rusty but is not memcpy more efficient than memmove if you know you don t have overlapping memory
httpwebresponse and httpwebrequest are a little bit lower level than webclient
i have created a window application in c#.now i want to set the cpu affinity for this application.i may have 2 processors 4 processors 8 processors or may be more than 8 processors
first you could try to convert the second do while loops to a for-loop which is more appropriate for the situation but i did not use for simplicity s sake
more than a qmap of qstring to
i completely failed to check that assertion and just jumped into the analysis of how the enhanced for-loop is faster on arrays than lists
coalesce is more efficient than nvl as it only evaluates the second argument if the first is null whereas nvl evaluates both arguments every time
the problem is that if i have more than one checkbox checked and i want to uncheck one the button disables
found a dirty solution the preferences list .globalpreferences.plist located in library preferences folder of the user home directory contains preferred languages of the user default home directory is users user and if the user is root the path is var root but this path can be configured here method form nsstring can be used to get home directory
google-chrome also uses an earlier version of webkit than the current safari so pages should be checked in both browsers
in practice i ve never had resource management issues with wxhaskell although i agree that it s possible and is an area handled better by gtk2hs which uses reference counting in the underlying library
a while loops makes more sense in this situation or a for-loop without initialization
the javascript addeventlistener domcontentloaded is more watching tags and their good closures to start his job instead of the real full data load
checkbox onchange should be more meaningful than onclick
you can use eventqueue.invokelater to switch to the swing thread and back greenfoot isn t designed to support this but it should work anyway -- invokelater is a better bet than invokeandwait
you probably already remember that multiplication is higher precedence than addition
that said i found icefaces to be a useful product and much better than richfaces especially in terms of the quality of the documentation
if you can do everything with udp it is lighter than tcp
note that while serializable is now optimized deserialization is doubly slower because i deserialize to object to then reserialize to string
here is a recent benchmark of jython 2.5.2 running on jvm 7 where jython is slower than pypy but faster than cpython
i m working for a company and we have a working paypal express-checkout that works more or less flawlsessly but from time to time we have requests that fail with express checkout payerid is missing
presumably the mac malloc aligns to bigger boundaries and so it s spotting the pointer you re passing to free can t be correct since it has the wrong alignment
i hear postgresql is more robust and doesn t crash like mysql does in these situations
my experience is that designers can use whichever they prefer usually and most agree that verilog is easier to use and the code is shorter fact than equivalent vhdl
des is the least secure 3des is better but i d go for the aes
that being said a compiled-language like c will almost always be faster than an interpreted-language like javascript
there are relatively simple solutions if the parent always have an index greater than the children but that is not the case here
nvl versus coalesce oracle is much pickier about reserved words
snappy is also significantly faster than lzo for decompression
although 4m isn t that many rows with contention and depending on your structure and database engine it may take a while i think myisam alters take longer than innodb because myisam requires whole table locks and handles concurrency less well
i think greenfoot is better than bluej for 8-years old
i also tried to do spacing from imageview to textview but then if the textview is smaller than the imageview the spacing will be wrong again
that being said your comprehension option is almost certainly going to be faster than the for-loop option because implicit loops are generally faster than explicit ones
in general it seems as though the concensus is to primarily use innodb but there are still some areas in which myisam is much faster than innodb
on the other hand show hide is more reliable
i m working on an app to load an amount of images from sd card using asynctask + for-loop i ve test the app on my galaxy nexus the app working perfectly but it will crash if i use more than 33 loops
xna is more popular and has more tutorials then libgdx
a 64bit capable x86 cpu is no worse at running 32-bit code
instead use stronger passwords with salt hash which are harder to break using brute force and are not susceptible to rainbow table attacks if the choice is between pin and password
you can have a look at this speed performance benchmark from fftw which suggests that gsl is about 3-4 times slower than fftw 3
while this is much less convenient than stateful wicket i still find much better than say stateless jsf or struts
not using the same named is a more common practice to avoid confusion and shadowing
jackson is faster but the api is 37x more complex than the gson api
does an eclipse installation perform slower after the upgrade
having said i am really not sure why you are getting unexpected behavior i ran your code both in eclipse and intellij ide and i always got for-loop approach as faster than while loops
someone just told me that innodb is much better than myisam
and i tend to think that after a moderate amount of customisation of either one vim will still start up faster than emacs
also it seems this is only the problem when there are a lot of duplicates the heap doesn t seem completely capable of staying in order the parent is smaller than the children
the advantage that you have is that unlike upgrading an operating system upgrading from ie7 to google-chrome 8 or firefox 3.6 is a more reachable goal for the average user of your app especially if you provide a link and upgrade instructions
give swt a go the api is a lot simpler than swing
i know the last paragraph might not be a correct question so maybe more generally as the vsto add-in is working with the office application process what can i do here so that a call to setforegroundwindow will work
that s one reason why going from hex to binary is much easier than from decimal to binary
also consider doing a web search for responsive bookmarklet tools for results that can help a-bit more than google-chrome s inspector or firefox s firebug
also as stated by martijn pieters using super super .__str__ is better than doing it the way i did deck.__str__ self
you might be able to avoid asking this sort of question in the future if you start using a google-chrome s inspect element context menu command or b firebug for firefox which is more or less the same thing
most modern filesystems are also considerably more complex than fat which would add further difficulty to the implementation
when hibernate s entitymanager is tracking 100 000 entities it is 100x slower than when it is tracking only a few see results below
i think this is better done with a post redirect get so the url can be bookmarked
get would obviously allow for a user to change the value a lot easier than post
also you will find that using strcpy strncpy is much faster than a simple loop to copy each char
i m about to try apache but most write ups suggest that this is worse than nginx at this job
is this even possible for starters because this is about adding protocols to setter and a getter is much more easy like
but i just get more confused with how strncpy or printf are not good
with regard to using send versus sendto i have found that sendto is used more commonly with udp and send with tcp sockets
any better way than to explode and implode the string
i am new to laravel it s good for coding but it is not much faster than codeigniter
freemarker is more powerful than velocity
for the record jmock as of today supports more complex scenarios than mockito that s why the initial learning curve is steeper
btw multitasking is really more fast switching than backgrounding in ios.
that means that without caching a hit against disk will be 200 times slower than accessing ram
this is a weak point that iirc postgresql can handle better but with mysql you have to work around that by reverting the changes yourself in case of rollbacks
irrlicht is no way better than ogre 3d or am not trying to prove that
if new is greater than old malloc additional pointers on the end of the array instead of trying to realloc them
i stumbled upon the above where someone answered a question regarding implementing a tree that has 2 nodes and i just wanted to get someone s thoughts on how best to implement a family tree with parent nodes which have more than two children nodes
and since you asked for a work-around if you have access to visual studio you could whip up a little com-visible class library that exposes a .net-flavored regex much more similar to java s than vbscript s api that you could reference and use in your vba code
velocity is worse than freemarker and stringtemplate has got its own issues
both s3 and cloudfront allow domain aliases however cloudfront allows multiple aliases so that d1.mystatics.com d2.mystatics.com and d3.mystatics.com could all point to the same location increasing the capacity for parallel downloads this used to be recommended by google but with the introduction of spdy and http 2 is of lesser importance
it is needed for a lookup of repetitions in disk files much larger than available ram
in my opinion glassfish is more user friendly than jboss so i decided use glassfish for my project
web.py is more low-level comparing with django
i find swt to be an uglier api than swing in general though but not really a deal breaker
perhaps someone more familiar with bash zsh osx can make more sense of this
myisam is faster but does not support the use of transactions like innodb does
isnull performs better than the generic coalesce and better than having another and
that s pretty broad though depending on what you re doing you may be better off with removeclass and addclass
but if the collection isnÃ¢ t sorted a simple linear search is more efficient than sorting just for a single use of binary search not to speak of the fact that binary search works with list s only while filtering findany works with any stream supporting every kind of source collection
get is more performant as it is idempotent and does not contain a message body where as post does
and people do install on their ubuntu system some external libraries so you need to search a lot more than what ubuntu contains and i won t be surprised if ubuntu or debian are large enough to already have conflicting libraries
fortunately vb.net finally ended all that and is completely pixel based you can still alter you viewport scaling but .net seems to handle that much better than vb6
it is much more specific than viewdidappear or viewwillappear
nginx uses an event based non blocking single thread and the memory usage is relatively much lower than apache
i assumend that the transmission using udp have to be much faster than using tcp but in fact my tests proved that the udp transmission is about 7 to 8 times slower than using tcp
i don t know react so can you make any parent element with reactid not accept more than certain children
upgrading a language or service can often have disastrous or unexpected consequences thus sandboxing alternate versioning seems the better approach plus it makes projects immune from os upgrade
but tripledes is older and weaker than aes
i m not sure if this is the answer but states that if you expect a rapid increase in the request rate for a bucket to more than 300 put list delete requests per second or more than 800 get requests per second we recommend that you open a support case to prepare for the workload and avoid any temporary limits on your request rate
pyquery is based on lxml so it s also much faster than beautifulsoup
you might want to investigate more than creating ram disk
the inclusion of jscript code into a batch file is simpler than vbscript and the translation of a small code segment from vbs to jscript is not problematic
in general you need a lot more than atomic getter setter for most kinds of thread synchronization
this shows that the timings are sensitive to buffering and that aes is faster than des
in choosing heroku is more full-service whereas engineyard is a more traditional service giving you access to boxes but needing sysadmin skills
instead using css you have a lot more control with background-image background-size and background-position
sure there is a learning curve with maven but reading a pom.xml is far easier than reading a build.xml
i want to encrypt decrypt a long file with rsa i know aes is better but this is just for a comparison in openssl libcrypto
if you were planning on doing this for more than one properties i d recommend making car inherited from dependencyobject or implementing it from inotifypropertychanged instead of creating events for each
if you really need to enter the sub-directory however you can create recursive calls and in the call you can check if the directory has further deeper folder by using directoryinfo.getdirectories
cassini is not actually iis it is more of an emulation
attributes are used in a more meaningful manner than mstest or nunit
the reason i wanted to investigate this was because both c and ocaml were significantly faster than haskell for this program
i ve read that nginx is faster for static pages but there are questions about its performance with php compared to apache s performance with php
what you ll need to do than is to complete the javadoc comments for the classes and methods that are more sophisticated than getter setter or default constructors
i would recommend against taking this decision lightly it s a good deal more complex than tcp udp amqp etc
i agree some mechanisms in elixir are slightly more verbose than erlang function definitions being my personal pet peeve and vice-versa
if you are dealing with docx document docx4j is more convenient than apache-poi
the idea is to get the library and application loaded from ram into ram which is much faster than loading from disk
qtreeview is known for being slower than a qtableview and consume a lot of memory and you are using a plain table model anyways so try with a qtableview
p.s this will only work if the draggable is smaller than droppable which is true in this case
also you can use phantomjs is webkit browser without user interface so it is really faster than firefox or google-chrome
android plot and other free chart solutions mentioned here doesn t support annotations the only one is afreechart which is a port of jfreechart for android i am currently using it and it is awesome and has much more features than achartengine
compareto defines whether your base student is greater than less than or equals to your studenttocompare and you can define these with any criteria you please
installing a real database server is fairly easy so i d recommend sql server express as others have or even mysql or postgresql whatever is easier to set up
as sven marnach wrote in the comments your problem is most likely i o bound since disk access is orders of magnitude slower than ram access
i prefer yourkit as i find it easier than visualvm
the docs for ionic 2 are clear user-friendly and much less intimidating than angular 2 docs
why does division take so much longer than multiplication
after some additional thought here s how i solved the problem but i d like to know if there s a better way than toggling show hide w different status messages at certain points in my code
since i m against get and pro post which is safer method here s an example with post
even lighttpd or nginx with natively pre-compiled c++ is slower than g-wan s c scripts
tail -f that is capital -f as opposed to lowercase -f is a non-standard flag available on linux cygwin macos x freebsd and netbsd that works better for watching log files which may be rotated occasionally
and don t use divide where multiplying will do multiplication is typically faster though not always
but if your shared file system is a raid 5 or 6 array exported to the nodes via nfs over gige ethernet that will be slower than ram to ram transfer via gige using rpc or mpi because you have to write and read the disk over gige anyway
as a side note the children can t have a higher z-index than their parent so everything inside .codbg is -1 behind the page then you need to fix the tab images the problem is not that they re behind the background it s that they re transparent and look darker on top of a darker background
or is there any specific scenario where udp is better than tcp
liferay is responsible for storing passwords with encryption or better as salt hash in the database
plus the performance was much faster than on qwidget because of qgraphicsview optimizations
as you noticed yoou cannot create an rss campaign feeded by more than oone feed
i saw a coalesce statement version but isnull is more efficient
imho mouseenter and mouseleave are much more reliable than mouseover and mouseout which tend to flicker
because unlike cat more is an interactive program that requires more than stdin stdout and stderr -- it requires a terminal which your system call cannot provide
a compiled-language will generally run faster than an interpreted-language so i think ruby and php start behind the eight ball but it really comes down to how you use the language and how you structure the code
with gcc and clang your sse code is better whereas icc is a looser
a mouse-down followed by a mouse-move is a drag if the move is greater than some threshold to allow for human motion while clicking
here is a solution in scheme because i know that better than common lisp and have an interpreter for checking my work
i think select elements are even harder than radio button and checkbox i don t think there is a reliable html css only for this
various people told me to go with nunit since it s better than mstest apparently i have no idea and it also has very good support in resharper which i m using
the only issue with applying that technique for the single source shortest path problem is that reweighting with bellman-ford takes o mn time which is slower than dijkstra s o m log n
this is a good question but should be formulated a little different in my opinion for example why are interpreted-language slower than compiled-language
well if _ uses native .foreach then that s easily order of magnitude slower than for-loop but still your problem is 4 nested loops right now so you might not even need the additional 10x after fixing that
i think using getter setter is simpler but here s an example of what i did to make it work
what i want to do is to search for all parent who has more then n children in other words i would want to get all user records that had an activity more then n times within given period of time eventtimestamp
install firebug firefox version is better then a google-chrome one
i have just spent a lot of time working with tlistview in view style mode vsreport and i find it is even more limited than tstringgrid for example it provides no in-place edit support
the second form is recommended for newer code as atof is deprecated in favor of strtod .
senderid and sequencenumber are both int and will take up more than sizeof chars bytes on most architectures
this is trickier to work around and you should file a google-chrome bug describing the situation and where it s slower than firefox but you could potentially reduce the amount of buffer uploads by looking into instancing or using uniform arrays instead of updating vertexes for positions textures
returning boolean or an int is more of a c mindset than a java in java you would just handle the exception one
passive loadbalancing if a physical cpu is running more than one task the scheduler will attempt to run any new tasks on a second physical processors
all that said postgresql is much more acid compliant than mysql it handles fks just as you re needing and i would generally recommend it based on what you ve expressed in your post
the dialog pop-up is bigger than the browser window when opened
first you probably need to do more than just salt and hash your password
we chose to not do cascade since it is easy enough to traverse your own model and do deletes and when the other use case pops up where you just want to delete the parent entity but not children it is easier to code and not have to undo the cascade logic
but i heard that xlsb loads way faster than xlsm so i would not like to change the fileformat
this is because in ie and firefox the footer link text is larger than in google-chrome and safari therefore the margins that i ve set up for the icons do not work
like laravel i see has lot of classes while codeigniter has much less classes and looks simpler to read follow extend
google-chrome is a bit more strict than firefox here
postgresql gets much better performance and this is coming from a former mysql partisan

on the server off jsfiddle the submit button sits inline with the checkbox and tick text and the checkbox sits higher than the tick text rather than inline
it s not too hard for the fat filesystems as it s quite simple and well documented but it s more difficult for ntfs as the filesystems is much more complicated and not-so-well documented
in certain respects systemc deliberately mimics the hardware description languages vhdl and verilog but is more aptly described as a system-level modeling language
and as you hopefully knows multiplication have higher precedence than addition so the expression is equivalent to probably not what was intended by the macro writer
this would make things considerably easier as the android library has native support for json serialization and making http get requests to restful urls is much simpler than http post requests it s not a huge deal but just less stuff you have to worry about
i think i understand the purpose of using sha1 as it s supposed to require more cycles than md5 to hash unhash and the salt is supposed to prevent the use of rainbow tables
i have done some research about them and it seems to be that spi is faster than i2c but the last one ensures more control and error detection over the first one
is that better than just get the .js already compiled and put it on vendor folder
it is a variant of heapsort which is particularly suitable for the sorting of very large amounts of data if a relatively high cost per compare operation is needed and on average better than quicksort
this android-emulator works better than bluestacks

postgresql is more sql compliant than mysql
the pattern in scanner is supposed to be a regular expression that describes all the characters you don t want included in a token repeated one or more times this last part is because the words may be delimiter by more than one spaces punctuation etc.
better than hide and show
actionlink helpers is more often used to generate url properly based on the actioncontroller route values etc and anchor tag based on htmlattributes etc
i have solved it in the past very successfully using robocopy it s much more robust than xcopy
are you expecting some devilishly complex scheme that hold locks for smaller granularity than put or get
also pyquery is significantly faster than beautifulsoup in many cases for processing results
we plan to use gson extensively in the application as it seems safer and better than jackson
also from your requirements autocompletetextview is more suitable than spinner
perforce is soooo much faster than svn because all the check-outs are stored on the server so it doesn t have to check every file on an update
post is more secure than get because you aren t showing information anywhere
png gif works much better
if you really want to go more secure than ntlm your may want to configure kerberos
sometimes a property getter setter does more work then just hold a value
a trie is better suited to this kind of thing because it lets you store your symbols as a tree and quickly parse it to match values or reject them
greenplum and other similar solutions should work a bit better than postgresql depending on your data sets and use cases
nginx is better at handling requests since it does not spawn a new process for every request unlike apache
instead i m using post which isn t exactly bullet proof but still a better choice than get in this case
using fgets strtol offers better error handling than sscanf
istanbul has more complete coverage stats not just lines - branches etc and can export to lcov for tools like code climate
not too easy extending redcarpet this way maybe kramdown is easier
a quad core intel cpu s with hyperthreading enabled has 4 physical cores yet 8 logical processors hyperthreading creates 4 more logical processors
i have written a memory allocator that is supposedly faster than using malloc free
an argumentnullexception would be misleading so argumentexception is a better fit
also what happens when common msi c s versioning is higher in product b and b upgrade c on install
there are many reasons why the dbcontext api is better than the older objectcontext api but in your case it may initially feel like a downgrade
i recently switched from unity to unreal and the first thing i wanted to do is create a skybox but the only thing it seems to support is a skydome which has far more polygons than a cube and the generated .dds cubemap files are far too huge to be used in webgl projects
for example if the string is going to store a decimal-formatted 32-bit int you know that you do not need more than 11 chars to do so
in storing hash passwords is a common practice to add a nonce or a salt and is marginally true that this salt is better kept secret
the upgrade sequence is much simpler i have a hard link in the app that points to the latest versioning of the apk the donwload starts and automatically laucnhes the install
freemarker is more advanced but a little complex as compared to apache velocity
in case it s helpful since you seem perhaps more familiar with objective-c than swift here s what your swift method would look like if we translated it back into objective-c
this was surprising for me as i expected udp to perform better than tcp
since you want to map some fields to others using a dictionary is a better choice than using a list
though flot may be simpler d3.js is definitely more powerful
it should also be noted that mouseenter and mouseleave work somewhat differently and usually much better than mouseover and mouseout
the xdm model used by xslt xpath xquery is much stricter it allows a free-standing zero-length text node but as soon as you try and add such a node to a tree it disappears
i have heard division takes more time then multiplication but beyond that i could not determine whether writing this in one line or multiple assignment lines was more efficient
now started porting game from cocos2d-x to sprite-kit as cocos2d-x not offers box2d physics and new version of cocos2d-x 3.0 has less features
but really feel this can be done much cleaner with underscore.js or lodash functional programming
its better than java.util.date java.util.date and java.util.calendar combined
i had a similar problem using ggmap geocode for a batch of locations where roughly 20 of locations gave the over query limit error even though geocodequerycheck would show more than enough geocoding queries remaining and the errors were sporadically spread throughout the locations not just the last 20
using svn2git might produce better results than git-svn if you have tags or branches.
instead i want those scripts to look in a custom directory let s say dependencies folder in the main project first so that i can directly put those externals in that folder which is much easier than putting them into the vc folder or manually setting the paths
i ve written my own protocol since i need it to be lightweight and i m sending files that may be bigger than the ram available on the device Ã¢ Ã¢ therefore the files are being streamed straight from the network to disk
namedtuple instances are just as memory efficient as regular tuples as they do not have per-instance dictionary making them faster than dictionary
.net library support is way better and cleaner than stl mfc and boost
if you want to break this convention then perhaps changing it to a do-while loop is more appropriate
for-loop is widly used and has more advantages over while loops but ther are some cases when while loops is perferable
in jacoco 0.7.9 there are jacoco ant tasks and in 0.8.0 there will be jacoco command line interface - both provide more freedom than jacoco maven plugin in specification of what should be included into report in particular can be used for arbitrary third-party jar files
and of course use post method instead of get because get is more limited
however due to it lack of android portability i have to replace all of my glfw code with sdl since sdl is more portable
it seems openmpi has better support for assigning ranks than mpich but setting up slurm and mpich wasn t trivial due to the cluster setup so i m hesitant to start over with openmpi
i would recommend placing the common files in the same directory as the solution file or no more than 1 folder deep
a similar argument can be made for inlining functions inline is generally faster but will remain in the same big-o complexity class although there is an additional size tradeoff inlining makes your compiled program larger if the code was being used in many places
i am just starting to learn about the streams and parallel in java and i was wondering why a normal for-loop takes less time than intstream paralleled at adding items to an arrays
i m more familiar with swing but the article painting in awt and swing distinguishes between system- and application-triggered painting
when everything seems easier with getter and setter
i use google-chrome for development as i find it runs faster than firefox and ie so it is a bore to guess where the icons are

this class leverages audiorecord which is a lower level approach to using mediarecorder
homebrew has less of a stranglehold on your machine doesn t require as much reading as macports
memcached has more overhead since you have to use a tcp connection to access it versus just a function call for apc xcache shared objects
google-chrome has no issues in this code.the default zoom level of firefox is higher than it was in the earlier version
to me it s fairly intuitive that comparing double is slower when taken into consideration that double are more complex and take up double the memory of int but why is it so much slower
if you want longer hash lets call more secure you should use something like sha512 whirlpool etc
i think it s related to the specific router implementation because on one hand if a udp packet disappears then both sides probably know it might happen and can afford to lose a packet or two but on the other hand if a tcp packet disappears then by it s fail-safe mechanism it will send another and the problem is solved and tcp packet is much heavier
edit going into why vim or emacs is far more powerful in many respects than your typical ide could get quite lengthy and there are already several questions on so which cover that
in a benchmark test the 128bit intrinsic function performs faster than the 64bit intrinsic
ienumerable is less specific than an ilist that is ilist has functions that ienumerable does not
google-chrome is reporting the missing key with a higher severity than firefox is so i want to eliminate that as a possible cause

but i found if i do not set their cpu affinity that is they run on same core 0 the time performance get better than setting cpu affinity 8.76s vs 14.66s
so i suggest you build a p2 repository can be done in ant but seems simpler in maven tycho and split the projects to several repositories
firefox text is 1px lower than in google-chrome and ie
note that just as you wrote this version is significantly slower than the inline one under cpython which of course does no jit inlining
i have found that pull is more scalable than push
but doing that kind of things with apache is rather painfull and is easier with nginx
also consider using the swift version of afnetworking alamofire which has an easier imho way to set the encoding format
the first problem is obviously the lack of a salt value which means if 2 users have the same password they will have the same hash which makes it easier to compromise multiple accounts
2 you probably want a namedtuple - i m pretty sure they re lighter than dictionary and you can access properties using dot notation for which i have an aesthetic preference anyway
you can get even fancier with fadeout and fadein too
if you need something that works out of the box choose flume once you decide whether push or pull makes more sense
not only do png files have natural support for transparency they are also smaller than bmp files
if you d like broader support over the serializable deserialization you can always use jackson to do so
in other words a future cffi release should give an alternative way to do embedding simpler than both cpython s and pypy s custom solutions respectively using the cpython c api and following

i have read a superscalar cpu architecture implements a form of parallelism called instruction level parallelism within a single processors superscalar cant use more than one processors
according to the mdn operator-precedence logical-and has a higher precidence over logical-or suggesting that the condition is evaluated as if were a single statement which then moves on to determine the boolean condition of false || true which is then true
of course calculating a md5 or sha hash is much slower than calculating a crc32
now it is just a matter of defining whether get or post makes more sense for you and implementing the corresponding methods doget or dopost or both at your servlets
google-chrome is worse than safari
once you re past the basics with c++ learning how to use parts of stl and then how it works will be better than tackling boost
a while loops is more readable than a for-loop
rodbc takes longer than rjdbc
has nicer behavior than either strcpy or strncpy
pax s aslr implementation for 64bit x86 machines is much stronger than linux s default 64bit aslr implementation
as you can see the neo4j result is way longer then the one from orientdb
either the strcpy or the printf function is more appropriate
in vim it s much more difficult to run a subprocess than it is in emacs so in vim you need to have a separate running idris repl
i built a simple app for reading rss feed using rails and postgresql but am running into performance issues when i try to query my feed_entries table for posts from more than one feed
in swift as objective-c there is far less emphasis on subclassing than other languages
a co-worker says there s fewer issues with an ati card at home than with nvidia but i ve been updating my video drivers pretty much monthly for the past few months and it s still not resolved so we can t just release our product and just tell our customers that some day the driver manufacturers may get around to fixing this
in google-chrome it seems more or less ok but in firefox when i first tried it it should give me not logged in my console
my problem is this i don t want the jlabel or the jscrollpane to stretch to the size of the jinternalframe if the jlabel is smaller than the jinternalframe
according to the above posts and my own experience lxml is definitely faster than beautifulsoup
but if your key space is vastly larger than the number of targets you ll have a sizable number of hash-collision where you ll have to check if the target stored there is really the key you re looking
even if a foreach loops were faster than a for-loop there are still operations being carried out that wouldn t be in your manual example
a for-loop is more suitable to iterate through the arrays
i ve not tried them but common opinion is they re less mature than cucumber jbehave concordion rspec etc
i used to think heaps have this property but it just seems that the only requirement is for the children to be less than the parent
but mine is large and spans across a maze of folder directory and grows even larger as the development team adds to it
apache mod_php is much more stable and cleaner while nginx will often deliver http bad gateway error coded in 502
x86 allows easier debugging - edit and continue is not supported when running in 64bit mode
since apple has decided that qtkit is no more and avfoundation appears to only support prores 4444 and 422 flavors how are developers supposed to write modern software that can handle 4444xq 422lt and 422 proxy
5 a war file can be runnable executable though this is more common with jar files

in my app i have a rootpageviewcontroller which contains the uipageviewcontroller and one or more detailpageviewcontroller with a uitableview as a childview
ps llvm clang is easier to port.
in the netrw plugin it would be easy but this one is not used any more as nerdtree just replaced it
since qqmlapplicationengine is newer than qquickview one would naturally assume that it is more powerful
when i select one or more nodes by grouping and try to filtering by one or more scenario_id property of the edge i would like to see all the dependent nodes of a certain depth ..n that depend on my selection and edge filtering
looks like it is about a half a second firefox google-chrome is less than that when selecting on two elements over 100 000 iterations
problem is that although both datagridview filling and updating a progressbar goes from same loop in steps by 100 filling of datagridview ends much faster than progressbar show a progress and hide it on about 50
what i m going to do after either creating or finding a library like this is to then change the way it produces the output to make it more biased to produce certain examples more than others so in the previous example i can make it more biased to produce more expressions with addition in them rather than multiplication
in your scenario addclass and removeclass is more suitable
ienumerable is more generic than iqueryable though all
so you do have to be careful not to lose track of what code is client-side and what is server-side which is slightly more difficult when both types of code use the same language but is still not very hard
in case of primitives memory comes into play.if you are going to store double into int as in your example double takes more memory as compare to integer.so there is chance of data lose.so compiler throw error.if you cast yourself then you know what you are doing so compiler let that do
it s generally accepted that lxml is faster than beautifulsoup ref
from the article it sounds like fossil isn t a database any more than git is a database
bionic the android version of libc is more slightly more limited not by much
like i describe in the first paragraph use of accessor methods getter and setter is a more idiomatic approach and easier to understand for someone else using your code
i can think of two relatively straightforward things you can do without ditching php though i have to mention that php doesn t have much to recommend it and you would likely be better off with python django python flask or ruby rails
in other words m2e is more friendly to the maven way
by looking at various blogs i understand glassfish versioning 4.1 has older jackson library 2.4 which does not have this method and need to upgrade jakcson versioning 2.8
writing to a local database or handling a data structure larger than ram will impact the disk making network calls will impact the network hardware cpu bound calculations will impact there
i thought graphicsmagick was supposed to be leaner meaner than imagemagick
section 4.13 of better builds with maven describes using cargo to deploy a war specified using maven coordinates
the inline keyword makes it easier for the compiler to apply this optimization by allowing the function definition to be visible in multiple translation units but using the keyword doesn t mean the compiler has to inline the function and not using the keyword doesn t forbid the compiler from inlining the function
the proper way to copy strings is using strcpy or strcpy_s on windows the difference is memcpy is faster and used in other situations such as pointers buffer management
maven can t be compared with ant as in maven vs ant maven is more than a build script than ant is
anyone knows how to bypass this problem and get more than 100 post
putting the whole thing in a for-loop makes it neater and ensures that the iterating isread is called each loops
you may want to consider using jquery timers instead which abstracts away many of the ugly details of settimeout setinterval and makes them easier to use in your code for things like what you are describing
since these are typically orders of magnitude slower than the processors from the cpu s perspective this takes forever
sriwantha mstest is a simpler framework than nunit
at least they are much easier to intall even pyqt is hard to code for me and wxpython is less attractive when it comes to looks
in fact icmp especially the ttl excceeding message has even less limitations than udp on nats for the error message can be sent from every corner of the internet and routers with nat cannot be aware that these messages are not the true ones
but in low traffic sites mysql postgresql is better
when maven is going deeper it falls back to normal pom.xml
override both methods but make gethashcode more tolerant than equals that means make unequal objects have the same hash code and not the opposite
it can handle parent with more than two children and with a more complex input data set we could leverage the graph approach to do even more cool stuff
so i guess fseek should be much faster than fread
the ssd is still slower than ram by orders of magnitude but it s quite reasonable to have a 50gb hash table on disk but not in ram unless you pay big money for big iron
and it s rarely faster than innodb since innodb uses row locks and mvcc as opposed to myisam s full-table locks
if your working data set is larger than available ram your server may spend a lot of time shuffling files from disk to memory
i know that memory blocks and reallocation are implementation so specific but when there are contiguous free blocks of memory realloc works better than a new buffer allocation and memory copy
i m not familiar with the particular problem you describe and i don t know whether there is some specific fix for it but one workaround is using background-image background-position which is easier to fine-tune
using firefox even it s slower than google-chrome it s still more respectful of privacy
cpu affinity it s better for the cpu to have a load average of 1.0 and processes to have affinity to a single core
if that processors has more than one cpu can the interrupts run on different cpu cores at the same time
so i thought of using hbase but i googled up and known that hypertable is faster
we have the following stackoverflow answer for reference which describes the case where chars can be larger than int which backs up the assertion in the discussion above
this can be a major clock-cycle saver since multiplication is often much faster than a division operation
however multiplying is faster than adding even though less clock cycles are used to add verses multiplying according to what my particular cpu s datasheet says about the instructions being used
when animating on a browser always use resquestanimationframe it gives far better results than setinterval and settimeout by only moving new pixel data to the display in sync with the refresh time
in case if you have flexibility to choose another testing framework you can try with testng which has bigger feature set than junit
-security concerns if this is a web application which i think it is as you mentioned lightweight you re better off with a ssl certificate which encrypts all traffic to from your server by using https
if you will be classifying multi-paragraph text all in one language a functional words list which your bag of words with pruning of hapaxes will quickly approximate might well serve you perfectly and could work better than n-gram
it could be done via division which is much slower than addition or it could be translated into a bitwise and operation as well and end up being just as fast as the version
rdiscount seems to be much faster and more reliable than bluecloth
here having a superclass makes more sense or at least having a realnumber subclassing of number
error response from daemons cannot start container d13b8aa28d383a3ca54b39ce74f5a81d80030a2ad0dde52966293ced9ef26663 8 systemd error exec mesos-master executable file not found in path
key strengthening techniques such as bcrypt or pbkdf2 are generally considered better than plain hash since cracking them requires more resources
i think it isn t good idea put your list directly to actioncontext you can use session for that or better list with getter setter in you action class
in the equals method only if you re certain the ensuing equals implementation is much more expensive than gethashcode which is not vast majority of cases
des is usually substantially slower than aes on modern hardware and has keys that are far too short for modern use
firefox is even slower that google-chrome
i switched from apache to nginx to save memory especially to serve static file i seem to be using about 75 less memory with nginx
sometimes it s preferable because onload event takes longer to fire then domcontentloaded
so when trying to make things more reliable as atoi and easier to use as strtol solutions like kirilenko s would be used
i recommend not to use jpg as mask because of its lossy format i recommend bmp or png bmp is better
bcrypt is weaker than scrypt although still three orders of magnitude stronger than pbkdf2 because it only requires 4 kb of memory
i found that postgresql 9.3 has better capabilities for json than the mysql versions i am using
the reason i ask is that it seems like nvidia has way better tools and ati seems to have cancelled rendermonkey
as it s widely known that an asynchronous post request is better since the user won t get a perception that the app has crashed while it s loading the long process
maven 2 has a steeper learning curve but provides a much richer set of functionality for building your projects and eclipse integration through m2e or iam
you cannot have a subclassing with less methods than a superclass
i would have used getter and setter but from the books that i ve read and the forums that i frequent i know that the general consensus is that having getter and setter is even worse than public fields
it seems a little bit more straight forward than kerberos but provides good ntlm sso capabilities
pbkdf2 is arguably a better option than bcrypt scrypt having been much more thoroughly studied and tested
i am wondering what happens when i release a upgrade that has a higher target sdk versioning then the previous versioning of my app
from the central authority point of view ecdsa also allows better performance on my pc using a single core openssl crunches out more than 6500 ecdsa signatures per second in the p-192 nist curve and only 1145 rsa signatures per second with a 1024-bit key
the difference is that union all is faster than union due to the fact that union eliminates duplicates from the resultset by using select distinct
it s conceivable that calloc could return address of memory location that is already pre-initialized with zeros thus it may be faster than malloc + memset combo
in order to avoid matching empty strings by including spaces as delimiter it makes more sense to me to allow them and use a call to trim to get rid of them
use a swing gui not an awt gui since swing is much more powerful and flexible than awt
for mvvm scenarios a relaycommand or delegatecommand is a better fit than the routedcommand which is provided with wpf
i didn t dig on why scikit-learn gives such unprecise result but it seems scipy gives better precision
the issue is that once the alpha of the uiview is less than 1.0 i can see all the subviews sides and the one that gets me the most is the outline of an uiimageview can be seen that would otherwise not as it is the same colour as the uiview
the second hashing function is hash which supports many more algorithms and variants than crypt but does not support some algorithms that crypt does
in effect post is no more secure than get
disk io will be slower than ram
i wanted to ask if there is a better solution than using stringbuilder to cut some part of a string which is parsed from a method through bufferedwriter to a file
however i wish to use a custom calayer that uses an internal cggradient for drawing instead as this should produce smoother results than cagradientlayer see here
thing is i believe that cin and cout is faster than scanf anf printf.c++
on that base a get is more appropriate then a post
you ll need to convert binary to another base here i use decimal when writing this code because c doesn t have binary constants which would be ten times more useful than octal constants
problem being i have more than one subclassing to my superclass and many instances of each subclassing
perforce does have support for many other oses but our non-windows devs feel more comfortable with svn too
if the multiplication is truly faster than the addition then i expect somebody well-versed in byte code could explain why the load_fast for num is faster than the five operations for line 12
is nsorderedset faster than nsset
in most cases it has reviled indexes that needed to be add and in most cases the indexes improved the queries the most but after thet have been added the isnull and dynamic still perform better than the coalesce
the downside is that you cannot use it for browsers older than ie11 firefox 31 esr safari 7.1 ios 7 konqueror all versions and opera all versions
repeater has fewer templates then gridview
and would the answer be different in a case where screens switching is more frequent like between an overworld screens and a battle screens in a game like final fantasy or pokemon
i always thought a multiplication is computationally cheaper than a division
please you a job queue that is more efficient than cron jobs
a dawg is ideal but a trie is simpler and a decent starting point
couchbase btw also uses binary replication mechanism which will be more efficient than couchdb as long as the couchdb protocol is not utilized for bidirectional data exchange and conflict resolution
before i am using codeigniter but i found out that laravel is much better than codeigniter and it has a lot of features
we provide a number of support resources which may get faster response than post on third party sites including the virtuoso users mailing list public support forums and confidential support cases
i am trying to understand what would happen if the max node is somehow smaller than some of the min nodes.
this is another reason why i d prefer rhinomocks and moq over nmock nmock uses the older expectation style whereas rhinomocks and moq both support the arrange act assert approach where you specify you expected interactions as assertions at the end of the test like this
both have the effect of the order by not being executed at all -- and so not executed after the grouping by in the first case the effect is to remove sorting from the grouping by and in the second the effect is to do nothing more than the grouping by already does
more over it is better to track buttons on event itself see this question for more details as mouseup mousedown event might be triggered outside of the page effectively getting you cached state out of sync
if that is so you might find that timsort runs faster than quicksort
google-chrome is stricter than firefox when it comes to loading data from your local filesystem
use strtol it does better error reporting than atoi
your intial hypothesis of toupper being faster than tolower has a logical fallacy
i unload and reload data upon each onpause onresume it is safer
i ve tried using pypy because i ve heard its faster than the cpython interpreter but still no good
so i tried to make it simpler with a for-loop but have been unable to work out how to add labels to each plot inside loops
i can make this happen with the minimal project where oncreate does nothing more than call super and setcontentview
jackson xml module faster than xstream
the awt approach seems closer to bare metal but since jdk 6 brought a lot of improvements in swing rendering pipeline i would go the swing java2d approach
the javadoc of javassist is way better than that of cglib
how to make textures appears above each other as the shapes in color switching game when i touch screens there s one more shape is appear such as circles sticks and other shapes so how can i do that in libgdx
that no longer works with jboss wildfly
but then the user of my cms has to include multiple folder into multiple directory which makes everything more complicated.
i think in terms of performance using a single for-loop is faster am i right 3 linqs will be eventually converted to 3 loops
interfacing with usb is more difficult than it sounds it would be harder to build something which would interface with that and measure millivolts than with bluetooth because the pic processor you use for analog to digital sampling and usb client would in fact have to either act as usb host or usb otg on a phone which is far more complicated than being a usb peripheral
openssl is more similar to peter gutmann s cryptlib and gnu s gnutls
you could also test every time in the for-loop and include a break statement but because you don t know when it will stop i think a while loops is better in this case
update under linux gentoo amd64 it s the same - opera reneders slightly larger fonts than firefox but nothing that looks odd
i feel like emacs is so much better than textmate
imo startapp is better than admob especially when using their interstitial ads
in my general programming experience compiled c c++ programs generally run faster than most other compiled-language like java or even compiled python and almost always run faster than interpreted-language like uncompiled python or javascript
then run all upgrade scripts but scripts should be written in such way that they do not execute if current versioning is higher than versioning expected by the script
ps i think that writing script is easier than hacking valgrind plugin callgrind with adding several counters for every instruction type
since postgresql is a lot more sane than mysql there are not that many tricks to report on
and it sounds strange but jruby scales very well and it s faster than mri with java 7
division is faster for unint8 than multiplication in your case
i suspect this will submit the right form data but may not be acceptable if your button is calling js and is doing more than submission form data
owl provides more mechanisms for asserting shapes of rdf graphs as does new work on rdf shapes
little bit cleaner than ng-hide ng-show which sets display none to the extra header every time
note that onclick is better supported with checkbox and radio button than is onchange
apple s safari applies almost no cross domain restrictions to files opened locally but firefox is much more strict about what it permits with google-chrome somewhere in the middle
you can use a bezier path either in a custom uiview w drawrect or easier with a cashapelayer whose curvature can be controlled via its control points
i try it and i get all the categories and not just the ones with more than 1 post in them
mysql i am told can be optimized to do faster reads than postgresql but both are pretty ridiculously fast in terms of # transactions sec they support and it doesn t sound like that s your problem
can anyone explain why the while loops is taking more time than the for-loop even though the looping of i and j is almost same
what i would like to do is use css media queries to have the title be above the tabs when the screens gets smaller or on a tablet or iphone
in other words i think post with x-http-method-override get header is better solution
there is more than one rss in hugo one for the root and then one for each section and taxonomy tags etc but it is not possible to create multiple rss feed for say the home page
a topic can be a sub-topic of more than one parent topic and itself have one or more specialized topics as children
when your working set exceeds the amount of ram then it will carry on working but with noticeably degraded performance as things will then be constantly having to go to disk which is far less performant
if that will solved later than wordpress menu is better than joomla
i suppose it sort of makes sense to do things this way except for the fact that metal appears to play better with objective-c even though it looks like swift
a typical lamp application like wordpress or phpbb runs more than 10 queries per pageview without problems
the only reason i can think of is the objective-c designers micro-optimising storage because the chars will use less memory than the int
you can also see that for smaller collections quicksort is faster but then mergesort takes the lead but all of this is case specific so take your time to study all 4 algorithms
this also might be fixed solved in the git add mechanism in more up to date versioning i vaguely remember them adding their own .gitignore files to empty directories so i d really recommend trying to upgrade to the highest git versioning you can for that and other benefites your distro may provide by default an older versioning as ubuntu and debian do
further as a for-loop it is easier to read as everything initialization loops condition expression to be executed after each iteration are all on one line
google-chrome has more of the market than safari not and invitation for flame wars just a personal opinion without any weight -
sounds like you want to use some of the inherited uicontrol methods such as sendaction to forevent this offers even finer control than with uibutton
as a concrete example this boxlayout example is better done using grouplayout illustrated here and here
i mostly work with esri software though i ve had a little bit of work with mapguide mostly for clients whose engineering departments are using cad more than arcmap
i saw that pypy is generally faster than cpython
the ssl handshake overhead associated with https is more than 50 of the bandwidth currently
start with pdfbox as it s text extraction abilities are better than itext s
if you re using typedef you no longer need to write struct all over the place by useing typedef code is more cleaner since it provides a smidgen more abstraction
the error you are getting happens everytime you have more than one qapplication or qcoreapplication
malloc is far more common in c code than calloc
you can also apply almost arbitrary transformations using .apply and .transform methods although in-built methods like mean std min max is much more efficient as they are optimised
i ve tried to load the page on google-chrome not blazingly fast but acceptable less than 1 second then tried on firefox takes more time between 2 and 3 seconds
a concurrent run of a code-execution happens simultaneously just by coincidence using more than one cpu or processors core and other shared resources to execute a program or multiple but mutually independent computational units tasks threads et al
dotnetzip offers native support and has a quite friendly api and is my opinion more flexible than sharpziplib
update i made some changes to my code but was already suspecting what others here have already pointed out sure the enhanced for-loop is slower but outside of very trivial tight loops the cost should be a miniscule fraction of the cost of the logic of loops
faster than inplace_add after compilation with gcc -ofast and directly writing a c function taking a int double double is more or less as fast as addlocal with or without #openmp simd
in scheme or prolog it s often less than a page of code
in swing has more features than the awt components
at least if the php versioning is newer and not including the deprecated functions like the extension in the error message i recommend to upgrade to a newer typo3 versioning and find a way to replace the extension ph_nextgenmenu with a newer one or edit it manually to use the typo3 sql api or the newer php functions directly
a negative verticalaccuracy signifies that altitude is invalid whereas normally a smaller but positive value of verticalaccuracy actually means that altitude is more precise since it s the vertical distance that it may be off by - i ll leave the discussion as to why this measure is called verticalaccuracy and not verticalinaccuracy for some other time
alternatively can i use something far way better and way more secure by using ucma or ucwa or any other api.
it doesn t show at all if hide is called less than 0.5s after show and it show for at least 0.5s this prevents very fast flickering stuff that you might see with naive implementations
the remote server is set up to allow very few maximum concurrent clients generally nginx handles many concurrent clients better than apache since it doesn t need to fork a new process for every request so if it becomes an issue you might want to look into switching web servers
i m trying to force the qlabel qpushbutton and qtableview marked by trailing underscores in their names be two times higher than qtextbrowser having below
i am not an expert in deployment but in my experience nginx is much faster and more friendly to django compared to apache
from my own experience mtl4 is much faster than ublas and it is also faster than eigen
mozila firefox and opera works smoother
i have heard that configobj is easier to use than configparser even though it is not a built-in library
is there any way to handle the numbers and or the sin cos arccos functions more accurate to make the outcome get better
i m testing some simple benchmarking calculations on win7 and linux ubuntu 16 to compare the timings and being wonder win appears to be much faster than linux
there can be a .txt file on hard disk or a qlist or qstring whichever is a better soluion
kdtree needs less memory than octree and sometimes is even faster
my second question is how come this very simple loop is slower than sqrt atan2 and the many hundred lines of computations that come before
size qlist performs better than qvector because it doesn t store the
alternate build tools ant lots of configuration gradle conventions again less verbose than maven
use picasso glide or fresco to load images inside those cards picasso and glide are easier to use compared to fresco but fresco is better with memory
in addition there are third-party libraries for xml manipulation which you may find more convenient such as dom4j suggested by duffymo or jdom
one of the nice side effects of this structural change does happen to be performance but not because of anything inherent to java by focusing on classes and getter setter it makes it easier to really pay attention to expensive operations and caching
im specifically looking to increase speed of a python script just not sure if dpkt or pyshark is better coupled with cython
instead initiate all the settimeout s you need for the entire animation at the same time with increasing delays in a loop and let them run their course or better yet use setinterval which is the better way of doing animations and how for instance jquery s animations work
you can give clients a type-safe interface in the form of fold but they have to be willing to write all their code in a higher-order style and since fold is a catamorphism it becomes harder to look at more than one layer at a time
it breaks srp principles and makes code more complicated
i seem to be getting the impression that wordpress is more popular than joomla nowadays
faster than on x86 32bits but slower than x64 64bit
i think this method of manipulating the dom from the client-side is easier than using regex from a server-side language
note that javassist is significantly slower then for example cglib because it reads in class files directly instead of using reflective access in order to avoid class loading
what s odd is that usually this doesn t happen - so far i ve only encountered this error when the original image has height greater than width and it has been filtered by another app called camera+...the exact same photo before filtering causes no problems and a filtered landscape photo also seems to be fine
in some cases irq constitutes more than 8 of cpu for a process
i found out that with any opacity not text color alpha less than 1.0 google-chrome gave me good results but safari was still bad.
swing or javafx would be better than awt
or there should also be a method settoolbaritems animated on the uiviewcontroller not the uinavigationcontroller which is perhaps better
the best solution is to write a custom version of strncpy that is less weird or if you know the length of the input just use strcpy
there are obviously situations where in c++ scanf is preferable to cin i was wondering if there are any situations where printf is more practical than cout
checkall and uncheckall on single button is worked if there is more than one checkbox present.but it will not worked for single checkbox
if you re looking for something less heavy than django perhaps try flask or bottle
elementtree is included in the standard library but lxml is faster
insertion sort for example has an average time-complexity of o n 2 worse than quicksort or mergesort but as an online algorithm it can efficiently sort a list of values as they are received as user input where most other algorithms can only efficiently operate on a complete list of values
i d like to use mediacodec to encode the data coming from the camera reason it s more low-level so hopefully faster than using mediarecorder
for floating point operations addition and subtraction are harder than multiplication and division so they may be slower or not again it depends on how much transistor real estate there is dedicated to the fpu
if your in the market for a templating engine twig a new templating engine used by symfony is much better than smarty imho
for efficiency secondary name node periodically does a checkpoint to update the fsimage so that the namenode recovery is faster
either will do the trick but bottle or in my preference flask will be faster as it is much more lightweight than django
prepare execution is faster than direct execution for statements execute more than three or four times because the statement is compiled only once while statements execute directly are compiled each time they are execute
2 i used link1 and link2 to filtering out duplicate users existing in more than one grouping
this does not work because the uiview you are subclassing i assume it is a uiview already is the delegate of its own calayer it cannot be the delegate of more than one calayer at once
it looks like it shows for firefox more-so than google-chrome but it might help
postgresql is also a lot better imo than mysql and is the recommended database to use with django according to a lot of the people close to django
admittedly mrbob doesn t yet have the number of plugins that zopeskel does but since archetypes has been overtaken by dexterity there is less heavy boilerplate code to generate
lxml is also much much faster than beautifulsoup
note i m currently learning udp and how effective a voip system would be in comparison with a tcp system i ve already done tcp so please no one comment tcp is better etc
in some circumstances isnull is faster than case or coalesce
i m more familiar with ocaml than haskell so type constructor may not be the right term
that is one area i really think mongodb fits for but mysql postgresql is more recommended in general
when i use vertex array model looks perfect but when i switch to vbo model looks worse because of vertex normals
i have used both apache-poi and docx4j extensively and having said that docx4j is more robust as it offers more support out of the box for not only the document itself but for tables and images
firefox is probably easier than google-chrome these days
also if you re setting these on mouseover and mouseout it is arguably clearer to simply use the hover event instead
a lot of people use iphones ipads and safari is literally the only option even google-chrome is more like safari in disguise... so it s quite a portion of users who are suffering from this issue
i ve reworked it slightly so that the deserialization code looks more like its serializable counterpart
the trope about myisam being faster than innodb is a holdover from code that was current in the mid-2000 s
years ago before i got more familiar with the awt swing model and the edt i used to write code that violates many many java standards code that ll make any reasonable programmer recoil in horror
but my direct2d code is much slower than my gdi code
apt-get upgrade actually installs the newer versioning
to expand on the udo s answer there is the program rpm which manipulates specifically the packages it is asked to manipulate and there is yum which is a more intelligent management system that can find dependencies and download .rpm files even if they re not in the system
considering the lack of windows 8 love that xna is getting support being dropped apps won t be sellable on the app store -- i d go with slimdx -- it s better than xna anyway -- the only down side is that you can t make xbox apps with it
firstly i am not sure how to properly use multi-thread with junit last time i tried i had no success anyway i have had better results with testng
in this case superclass is bigger than subclassing that s why the second statement is correct
here s one idea which uses one multiplication and one shift so it ll be faster than a division on most systems
like this i may have more than two get post insert or update methods i have to acces this methods from my console application how can i map the methods i want cana any one help me here how will i define the routes for this
so if you want to use django or something like that it s probably not smart to use ironpython because it isn t really cross-platform doesn t work with some frameworks and it performs worse than cpython
first of all never send int s and other types larger than chars like that - you will ignore endianness and the recipient might be unable to interpret the data properly
by simple i mean setting up some compiler flags -wall doesn t show any errors or using such tools as valgrind used it with memcheck that didn t help much
writing swift 2.0 in my professional work my personal opinion is that it s indeed ready for enterprise applications -- maybe even more than objective-c ever were
also ram bandwidth is much higher than disk or ssd or network bandwidth and the ram latency is much lower too
if you would like a unified front-end for elasticsearch and opentsdb you could consider grafana which has support for both elasticsearch and opentsdb but less functionality than kibana in regard to elasticsearch
it makes minimal change to the text in particular it never splits a word doesn t change wc -w and for text with no more than single spaces in a row and no cr it doesn t change wc -c because it replaces spaces with linefeed rather than inserting linefeed
or how is it better than post redirect get if the functions can in fact be used in solving my particular problem
i find grouplayout to be fine to code by hand certainly no harder than gridbaglayout though i can certainly see why it would be a favorite for tools to use
this would generally be the wrong inheritence structure if your saying what i think you are the reason being that children should not be less restrictive than parent
maven is more or less an update concept of ant
i m able to query my database below to get the result that i want but i don t want to have to iterate through all of the author objects just the ones that have more than one post
in safari it renders significantly brighter than in firefox or google-chrome
this is sometimes easier than yacc bison and usually more intuitive
you forgot to open the so no more css after this line is considered in firefox and ie google-chrome is more cool on the error
here is what i am thinking tcp is supposed to be reliable transmission but slow whereas udp is does not provide a guarantee of packet transmission like tcp but is faster than tcp
it will be presumably more efficient than malloc + memset for large allocations
as a coder sql is my weakest link since i am far more comfortable with imperative languages than declarative ones - but i want to change that
when attempting to access the admin side of wordpress if the db versioning is lower than your wordpress versioning expects it will redirect you to a database upgrade page
then you can use the itemcheckedchanged event which will get triggered when an item is checked and here you can see how many items are currently checked and if more than one show the element with the text and hide the tokens
i dont think combining jbehave and testng is a better idea
in the non open-source world choices are wider such as qnx neutrino and vxworks
also your csv looks more like a tsv tab separated instead of comma separated
nodevalue is a little more confusing to use but faster than innerhtml
in regard to vao and vbo performance i disagree that vbo is faster i suggest to see this link
if i have a for-loop for example and and i want to use something like math.round to round the number but i only need to round the number one time i.e the number doesn t change throughout loops is it better to store it into a variable and then use the variable to in the condition or does it not matter
what is that key feature in tcp that makes it have much much higher throughput than udp
i generally don t write unit tests for bean classes with little more than getter and setter
the problem is that with the code below the jlayeredpane always expands to fit the size of the jscrollpane and in the event that the jscrollpane is smaller than the jlayeredpane it does not provide the scrolling ability
this blog post explains more on how to get an access token on android
native javascript sort performing slower than implemented mergesort and quicksort
memcpy can be more efficient than strcpy since rep movs is highly optimized on intel cpus esp
ie7 is strict enough and used to give me javascript errors on them maybe google-chrome does it too firefox is more relaxed d
of course you could do fancier interpolation with a splines being the next step
mysql is not less complicated that postgresql -- they re the same thing
you are seeing a noticeable jump in interface response because subviews do in fact consume quite a bit of memory uiview are very expensive compared to their underlying calayers and as such calling -removesubview not only unloads stress from the gpu but also frees up more memory as the subviews is usually released afterwards
the next example does more or less the same except from an oop perspective
the system still in use today from what i hear is responsible for ingesting more than 3000 rss feed probably a lot more than that now into a cms
moreover because read is built into bash and this usage requires no subshell it s significantly more efficient than approaches involving subprocesses such as head or awk
innodb doesnt read number of rows from stored cached value like myisam does if column is not null cause innodb is more optimized for writing than reading opposing to myisam
or if you ve got tcl 8.6 dictionary map is perhaps better
in firefox it runs extremely slow 3-4 seconds in google-chrome it runs much faster
this is why a regular for-loop is better to use for this scenario rather than a foreach loops
hence the alarmmanager which runs much better than a java timertask thingy
i need to do the same condition but for less than google-chrome version 46 and for less than firefox version 44
adding setter and getter is better
in this context free store is different and incompatible with heap because the new delete free store library is simpler and quicker than the malloc free realloc calloc heap library and thus provides huge memory usage gains to the c++ embedded programmer in a context where you have only 512 bytes of ram
in practice each payloaded buffer will represent 1 udp packet unless your network mtu is smaller then what you have configured on the payload see mtu property
package-private is stricter than protected and public scopes but more permissive than private scope
when typing in the text box the autocomplete pop-up but is bigger than the remaining space in the modal dialog
the xcb library is alternative to xlib which is much better all around and supports a non-blocking interface but it doesn t play well with opengl
union distinct is slower than union all but you may need it for de-dupping.
by default psycopg2 uses its own versioning of libssl and it seemed to keep a dependency on an old versioning of the library which no longer existed after my upgrade
be aware that the bourne shell in freebsd is more capable than on linux
if we are creating an object of a subclassing and invoking the method of superclass and if subclassing extends more than one class which superclass method should be called
the fact that mac users tend to be less unix-savvy than linux or freebsd users probably doesn t help but even without that this is a perfect way to end up with thousands of people who have a pip and a python that doesn t match and no idea why
if you use insert and update high performance uses innodb over myisam is better
if you are okay with lower resolution of the pdf you can try using html2canvas library along with jspdf which is quiet easier approach
i ve been using uwsgi in production on heroku for over a year and it seems to handle everything a lot better than gunicorn
because representation of a given problem with a nfa is far easier than the equivalent dfa
all good jasmine angularjs tests running now and much faster than with google-chrome or firefox as the test browser
but although atom-editor looks so nice and powerful compared to simple editors with realy huuuge number of available packages plugins lighttable is more elegant
apc have less feature than memcached and is easly to use and optimize but this depends on your needs
if you really want to use selenium inside an android app you might have better luck with appium
also note that while maven is no slower than ant for multi-module projects of this sort importing your maven project into an ide will generally result in far faster builds than maven can perform itself
a lot of the solutions i ve seen are client-side - i think a server-side solution makes more sense for my needs since i can give feedback to the user if the javascript is invalid and only save it on the server once it s clean
switch from using strcpy to strncpy or strncat which i think is better than strncpy
this is much easier with war or uberjar which include all dependencies within because otherwise you need to add all dependencies on the classpath as well which will take additional effort
i can understand windows 10 performing faster than linux on vm but why is the baremetal ubuntu so slow
generally ienumerable and iqueryable are even better than ilist as they re more generic unless you want to limit this with good reason of course
to release it even though what it actually does is little more than malloc and free but by having you call these functions they provide a well-defined and clear api which assumes responsibility for knowing such things
- similar to piston but i ve had better luck with tastypie
you can either prepend a dot to your image address which means go to parent directory meaning get out of css and then look for images or you can move your images folder to your css folder whichever is more comfortable for you
use json.net it allows for far greater control over serializable and deserialization
in fact the heapsort algorithm works this way first arrange a random order into heap order and then obtain a sorted order somewhat less efficient than quicksort on average
more detail set the amount of time the animation will take for fadeout and use a delay for the fadein animation that is longer than the fadeout animation time
firefox which is more standards-compliant than google-chrome doesn t allow this
getting much more information is needed in the packet header for connection less like udp but why the header size of udp is less than tcp
you only need to specify a private access modifier for your set accessor when the properties is more accessible
gradle support is much newer and somewhat less mature than ant or maven but it works
tcp mounts are more reliable and you know you have a network problem much faster than with udp
update turns out that zsh implementation based on builtin compctl is much simpler than the bash implementation based on builtin complete
if your goal is education and not ease of implementation you would probably be better served by extends the uicomponent class and using the treeitemrenderer code as a reference to create a class that implements the same interfaces
i was taught from him that using get requests was better than post but after reading up i would like to switch to post my only problems is i am a little unsure how to modify my code to switch over from get
if your hide show logic becomes more complicated you can move it into a method on your controller
if you want to display your file as plain text the widget qplaintextedit is better then qtextedit
both give you the ability to implement things in a variety of ways which can be confusing but ember.js provides more of the code that you would have to write yourself in backbone.js as standard which for me personally is more important for rapid prototyping than the wealth of backbone.js examples available
maven definitely has better integration with flex than ant
in high-level programming languages the choice between a boolean and an int is really more of code readability supportability than one of efficiency
the framework has also improved majorly not to mention it supports pdo mysqli more secure than mysql and postgresql
jboss is a big and quite complex application and glassfish is smaller and i find it easier to understand
why is memcpy so much slower than memmove or hand rolled copy on the server
orika is way faster than dozer and quite close to manual mapping
but then normal for-loop is far better for arrays than using for-in which is actually for object
this query lists all parent sharing the same children where there are more than one parent
so i guess it s the md5 in the dump output cause the conflicts and the hash value is longer than md5 outputs
looking briefly at the list-like combinators for uu-parsinglib i m more familiar with parsec i think you can solve this by folding over the result of the psome combinator
regarding frequency of polling when no connection is maintained google-chrome appears to be 3 seconds where as firefox s is much larger
while ruby and rails don t change as often as they did a few years ago the dev ecosystem still evolves faster than linux distributions like ubuntu can keep up with
hash ids are usually shorter than typical hash created by cryptographic hashing algorithms such as md5 or sha-256 and unlike these hash ids are usually reversible meaning we can decode the original value
int is better because with chars n you ll be comparing one chars at a time and unless you collate latin1_general_bin then you ll also be doing a transformation when comparing chars
the wrapper uses these in such a way that even the md5 implementation is significantly more secure than a simple hash
however ambari-metrics is better than nagios ganglia
creating the views with code only i think one is better off with subclassing if it comes to more than one level of inherited or many ancestor classes for just one base view
the youtube approach seems much more efficient as far as amount of code and simplicity of understanding which makes me wonder why vimeo would use promises in this simple fast case
a note on the runtimeexception re if you catch a nullpointerexception nullpointerexception and throw a re you are actually losing information since nullpointerexception is a more specific error rather than re
if end up using the memory anyway calloc is still faster than malloc and memset but the difference is not quite so ridiculous
if the uilabel is larger it will then wrap around the uibutton to the next line
this is pretty simple for types sizeof int but unsigned chars short is more complicated and requires compiler specific packing
multiplication is nearly always a lot slower than addition
in ios regardless of whether the app is being written in objective-c or swift afnetworking makes life easier when writing requests
i m aware that uitextview is much more suitable for this as it implements uitextinput protocol which has all the methods i need but due to a bug in ios i m limited to uilabel
probably more popular than xquery is xpath which is the basis of xslt transform
tastypie is more tightly coupled to the orm than piston but there are methods that you can define in a tastypie resource to specify how to handle create read update delete
in instant articles configuration i only see one input box for submitting rss feed url can we have more than one feed for facebook instant articles
regarding beautifulsoup lxml is more efficient and in my experience can handle broken html better than beautifulsoup
i had been taught that quicksort is almost always quicker than mergesort and i understand that there is some debate on this topic but i at least expected it to be closer than this
also note that using keyup or input makes far more sense than keydown otherwise the previous value will only be evaluated on the next event occurrence
if it stores it as pointers on the heap won t qlist be much worse off than qvector
textmate is a better emacs for macs though that won t help you with solaris
i can t help with the coding side of your question but if you re passing in a non-url input then the post method would be more appropriate than get
edit but as bali182 said just casting the chars to an int is more readable
this is way more efficient than sorting and filtering in php
short answer floyd-warshall is more efficient in this case than naive application of dijkstra s
using varchar is less efficient than using tinyint like aju john suggested in his comment but unless i m dealing with a really performance-critical or a huge table - i find it easier to deal with
for students in computer science major learning programming on linux freebsd is much better than doing these on windows
implementing the equals and the compareto methods sounds easier than it sometimes really is
for your purpose you would probably be better off with a sorteddictionary class or perhaps sortedlist
namedtuple is faster and significantly more memory efficient than a dictionary
i would give you more info except a ip aliasing on centos 7 is more involved than i like much easier on solaris and b i m not familiar at all with configuring nginx very easy on apache
i like the monodevelop ide even better than sharpdevelop but i m not sold on installing and using mono s compiler just yet nor do i know if it can even handle the latest vb.net c# language features
also your examples about why int would be better than boolean are kinda flawed
did maven has achieved more then ant or ant is still alive
because of how google-chrome s plugin system works development mode in google-chrome is much slower than in firefox or safari see here for more details
you don t usually get such errors because there is a defaulting mechanism for polymorphic numbers that in ambiguous cases picks whichever of int or double is more appropriate see the haskell report for details
while i won t start a war of ant vs maven maven is much more than just a build tool and that may help you in future
you should use strcpy or strncpy safer than strcpy to copy the string stored in the array between arrays
the myfile can have one parent and parent can have more than one children
this was surprising for me as it is well known fact that udp performs better than tcp
shouldn t a subclassing interfaced be able to take in more than the superclass interfacec and use the same method
the problem with this approach is it works mostly in google-chrome but not in firefox which is slower
in firefox this might be handled a little nicer than google-chrome but rather than completely redraw an element you should try to append only what you need
this makes interpreted-language generally slower than compiled-language due to the overhead of running the vm or interpreter
between cruisecontrol and teamcity teamcity is faster and easier to set up but you may need to check on licensing for it
this is sporadic and i see it happening most of the time with firefox 4.0.1 and 5.0 and to a lesser extent with google-chrome
if that s true then you might not need all the transactional safety provided by the innodb storage engine and you might be able to get away with switching to myisam which is considerably more efficient on aggregate queries
strncpy is safer than strcpy
because addition is faster than multiplication and can be faster than shift
for more understanding with folder directory
beautifulsoup is more suitable for html parsing than lxml
service to build drools knowledge and get session i prepared a stateless engine lighter than the stateful one
i also found a post that suggests a less brute force method to get the urlroutingmodule to catch the combres.axd route
multiple inherited makes it easier to compose classes from small mixin base classes that implement functionality and have properties to remember state
to recap i want to know why a javac compilation utilizes so much more cpu than ecj
if there is lot of data exchange then a binary format like protobuf or thrift or avro is better
for example if i declare and only use it in a way that it could have and should have been declared since chars uses less memory than int will gcc optimize that or does it not even matter since it will be converted to assembly
someone else in this thread makes a somewhat convincing argument that modulus a primes is better for detecting bit-swapping
i haven t read the paper on edison but if it s nothing more than the haskell implementation of purely functional data structures doesn t it make more sense to port the sml code that s in the book thesis
xapian is slightly more difficult to setup but is much faster than whoosh
you may find that hyperthreading helps more on code that is using large amounts of memory so that the processors is regularly blocked on fetching from memory
the id specific hotspots show an area #id-ed textarea at mouseover and then hide the textareas at mouseout note the css display hidden was remarkably faster than hide
does tinyint in mysql take up more space than boolean
vb.net seems to think lots of things are objects one way or another but vb6 has stronger typing in this case
with tcp its slightly slower than udp and has more features
if you want to a little bit further you can imagine use more powerfull scm clearcase perforce ... but maven integration is fewer not well documented and community provide less examples than svn or git
you can take a look at timsort which for non completely random data performs better than quicksort they have the same asymptotic complexity but timsort has lower constants
innodb is slower than myisam for most uses but can perform faster in certain conditions due to a better locking mechanism
you can safely upgrade to trunk its better than last versioning anyway
i personally would just skip using awt and move to swing which provides better built in functionality for this type of thing
nginx makes apache better
innodb is more scalable and myisam doesn t support any of the properties of acid
on the other hand the wikipedia article on r-tree seems more specifically targeted towards mapping than the k-d tree or quadtree
if you wish to make a more complicated property with getter and setter that do more than merely set the property without polluting the namespace you may hold the underlying value in a closure
i ran a simple test out of curiosity and there don t seem to be any differences in performance between float+calc vs flex other than ie rendering both much slower than firefox and google-chrome
in your code on line in the for-loop does no more point to an arrays --the compiler has no information about the length of the variable that it s pointing at whether it is an arrays a single chars or an int or something else-- but it is just a plain pointer presumably a pointer pointing to a default int
apart from that tcp packets by themselves are not slower than udp packets and data transfer with a simple tcp connection can be faster than with a simple udp connection because flow control and reliable transfer is already integrated and you don t have to reinvent everything again and often worse
why does a mongodb query via spring-data mongotemplate is slower when my entity contains an empty array
tcp is faster for when using a few connections the important difference is that modern nics perform significant amounts of acceleration on tcp and not really that much for udp
time i upgrade to this versioning is much later time of above topic so i don t think because compose versioning issue
so we can see that an optimised while loops is faster than a for-loop by 2 operations however it uses more stack space
it s clearly visible in firefox and is far more subtle yet also distinguishable in google-chrome
double metaphone - this algo will give you a better match than soundex at the cost of speed it is really good for spelling correction though
it seems gson is more faster than jackson the average time of gson is about 2ms while jackson is about 16ms does i make mistake when using jackson
how are push notification better than pull notification on iphones
if you think back to grade school you ll recall that multiplication was harder than addition and division was harder than multiplication
the issue here is that an automatic translation from sql to linq will often have to perform more transliteration than translation - generating examples of how not to write linq queries
in my case apc is 59 times faster than memcached
i should also mention that crypt has this built-in and may be a better solution than md5
else if you have more than one listview or gridview in the scrollview you need to create a customlistview
the problem was the same on both versioning though perhaps a bit worse after the upgrade
keeping a list of children in the parent makes more sense from this aspect
floating-point calculations are more expensive time-wise than fixed-point which is why fixed-point remains popular in microcontrollers and embedded systems
windows installer rollback will work as you request if you use 1 a minor upgrade or 2 a properly sequenced major upgrade that uninstalls the older versioning after successfully updating all files
first of all ant is older than maven and therefore does not include core support for dependency management
flask has a really great albeit smaller than django community and there are a lot of extensions available for common web-app extensions in the extensions directory
this folder has way more than 1 directory and has a bunch of files so apparently it snot reading something correctly
the reason for the second case much slower on sorted data is that a while-loop is cheaper than the equivalent for-loop when there are zero iterations
geddy is not better than connect express the big thing that differs is the structure of it
however when i switch to swift 4.0 the methods declared in swift is no longer visible in objective-c
however dsa verification expect verification calls to be 100x issue is about 10x slower than rsa verification
for this kind of task reading the document into a domdocument and using domxpath is probably more suitable
ram is much faster than disk
so my question is beyond instrumentation and the profiling using memory leaks which tells you the location of creation of the leaky object but not the root cause are there any other tools i could run that could give me any more info than instrumentation re tracking down the root cause point
i suggest using hover this instead of binding to mouseenter and mouseleave looks cleaner to me
notice that besides using the filter method or not even with a plain for-loop is much better for performance create a new arrays from scratch instead of mutate the current one multiple times
or is it just that scapy is slower than dpkt
in many cases at least 2-3 times faster than mysql postgresql
i think a.__init__ self x is better then super .__init__ x because it supports multiple inheritance and i didn t find a way to do it with super
but that post is currently put on hold as my post question is more technically-oriented rather than just a general-purpose question
use one of the image loading libraries glide square picasso universal-image-loader or ion ion is actually more of a general purpose async loading tool to do the dirty work for you
you lose two benefits of data base consistency data persists after a crash and you need more ram which is more expensive and scarce than disk flash
it is just an example that shows a scenario in which get is more secure than post but i don t think it would be a good idea to choose get over post from this attack reason
the transmission size is bigger using datacontractserializer but during serializable and deserialization it is faster to use datacontractserializer
edit keydown is a little better than keyup for the element bind now enter key fails silently-ish
after recent upgrade to latest wordpress versioning media uploads no longer work
the hide show variant is much faster
i am trying to compare the myisam and innodb write read performance but i am suprised that the myisam s read is much more slower than innodb while its write is much more faster this is totally opposite compared to what i have learned
once you have this you should be able to have more than one sqldatareader shared on the same sqlconnection in your code and use them independently of one another
when i compile with clang -emit-llvm -s -o3 test.c gcc would also work but the llvm ir is more readable in my opinion i get
as google-chrome s v8 is dramatically faster than firefox s spidermonkey at the moment these things are constantly in flux pick the forward loop as it s faster on the slower engine
dfa is a better choice over nfa because it has only one transition for an input while nfa can have many
but i am lost a bit here because i am not sure how to set up the form get or post is better for this need
no for-loops or math.pow which is amazingly slow way slower than sin cos etc
i d like to have the view tehnology be jsps i find them much easier than freemarker or velocity
at that point either get or post will work post is usually better
so far the only legitimate reason i ve found to use datamapper over activerecord is that datamapper is better in terms of the single responsibility principle -- because the database rows are not the actual objects being persisted but with propel that doesn t really concern me because it s generated code anyway
i would just use ocaml but haskell s syntax is so much better than ocaml s and haskell is pure and has cool features such as type classes
there are other optimizations available but general rule is that innodb will be quicker than myisam is even with table growth
generally swing is more efficient and advanced than awt
does corona have anything that allows us to compare versioning codes and the upgrade happens only if current db versioning is higher than the previous db versioning
the problem with dbcontext api is even worse because dbcontext api doesn t offer methods to change state of independent association so you must revert back to objectcontext api and use objectstatemanager.changerelationshipstate
i wonder why postgresql s single insert statement is completely faster than mysql s when autocommit is turned on
btw why do you want to use fakeiteasy it looks to me less powerful than moq
mostly innodb is better choice than a myisam
now a routine to initiate once per second - settimeout is usually more useful than setinterval
in computer 1 the eigen3 performance is worse because the number of total processors virtual + physical - Ã¢ due to hyperthreading is greater than the number of physical processors
however firefox takes significantly longer to run this code about 180 milliseconds on firefox compared to roughly 30 on ie and google-chrome and does not see that same reduction in run time that ie and google-chrome does
the first thought is that you could build a uiview showing image and text then attach a uitapgesturerecognizer to it which would be more flexible than uibutton
it fills the gap between scalatra and lift more powerful than scalatra and easier to use than lift
my knowledge of firefox is better than google-chrome so my apologies if i missed something
innodb is more concurrent than myisam since it provides row-level locking
between lxml and beautifulsoup lxml is more equivalent to nokogiri
afaik jboss is much more adopted in production deployments than glassfish but this doesn t necessarily mean it s better
i am a bit suspicious of the performance because modulo tends to use division which is slower than your subtraction operations
but my code only works if the parent element is always higher on the list than the children and i want to make that work universally
i was originally using nsscanner because it was easier than nsnumberformatter to use but i ran into the same problem it doesn t parse the entire string just the first number in the string
the uiview class methods are convenience methods for common animations but are more limited than catransition
and wikipedia says that snmp can be run over tcp ip but udp is more common
another even simpler option than canopy and anaconda is just to download spyder s dmg which comes with the latest versions of numpy scipy matplotlib pandas sympy and the sci-kits
still you must increase max also if your minimum is anything less than 15 the adk is now building an extra folder new stuff in truth the new version of the adt is annoying i am just starting and now you will see they have enforced the use of fragments
i don t think that as of today you can run these tests and determine with any certainty whether swift 1.0 is faster or slower than objective-c
lxml is faster than beautifulsoup i think and has much better functionality while remaining relatively easy to use
for a simple image toggle you might have an easier time with a hide show style instead
i see that the paid version of wunderground has some higher tiers with more features but openweathermap s free tier allows a huge number of uses
when post is better than get
and in the future i think you will get better help by posting ubuntu related questions to unix and linux stack or to dedicated to ubuntu
i think you can do exactly what you want with dill which provides better serialization than pickle
tcp is far better at transferring large quantities of data but when the network fails it s more likely that udp will get through
by comparison des see section 3.2 and other block ciphers are much faster than the rsa algorithm
also is jxtable better than jtable for such an application
why everybody here is saying post is more secure than get when used over https
i m trying to add a ribbon to a page using css3 linear-gradients but the rendering in google-chrome looks a lot less pleasant than its firefox or ie alternative
what is nice about cast is that it works exactly the same on most sql engines sql server postgresql mysql and is much easier to remember how to use it
from experience i can tell you udp is about 10-15 faster than tcp on dedicated and udp-tuned networks
i just want to learn why fast inversion algorithm is slower than math.h sqrt function
first you make post request although get request is more suitable for search pupposes
the problem is that tcp creates bigger packages of data while udp uses 8 kb of data blocks
using a non-reversible hash such as md5 is much more secure and you can store the hash value as clear text
the fact that checking with isinstance the membership in a concrete type is not so good while checking the membership in an abc is more often useful lies in a principle that the gang of 4 expressed clearly and intensely in the first part of their wonderful book design patterns in a mostly c++ context but it really applies much more widely than that
for more day-to-day end users having canned reports that might be modified by the end user via a simple user interface that allows them to modify restrictions grouping sorting is more useful
nginx uses less memory than apache given the size of your setup i would definitely recommend that
if you can t or won t upgrade apache you can downgrade the pcre package to the first versioning that contains libpcre.so.0 which is 7.8 i think
innodb -- more effecient than myisam because of the way the primary key is clustered with the data in innodb
the jpopupmenu has this behavior but i need more than just jmenuitem
ironically ancient x86 instruction rep stosq performs much better than sse and avx in terms of memory copy
you may encounter noclassdeffounderror if the version of spring-data-commons is older then required by spring-data-jpa
therefore i conclude that division is faster than multiplication
this is a good example of a time to know the basics - i think understanding the ins and outs of struct is more helpful than typedef since you can do so much more with it
because sml is eagerly evaluated the execution model is far easier to comprehend and debugging via printf works a lot better than in haskell
puremvc is generally much faster than robotlegs in terms of performance
in my opinion swing is easier to learn and to use but the results of swt are often nicer - you can often feel that a swing application behaves not completely right
available on almost every platform true of vi vim too of course - whether gui- or text-based java ides are available on most platforms too but only in gui mode and are significantly larger and need to be installed separately whereas emacs is generally more widely available - bsd nix linux mac systems
pandas is far more flexible for working with data so i often bring parts of dask dataframes into memory manipulate columns and create new ones
the service is still in beta trial and firefox conversion is working better than safari one
because there is no confirmation on udp packets it s slightly faster than tcp
i ve never done any network programming lower than using libpcap winpcap so i would be happy for any suggestions.
innodb has more overhead but uses row-level locking so that reads and writes can happen concurrently without the problems that myisam s table locking incurs
if you want to learn lisp paip is a better choice to start with because it will teach you a lot about common lisp and a smallish chunk of scheme
virtualbox free but less powerfull than vmware
i definitely wouldn t try introducing a new general-purpose type for use in python based on std map which has worse algorithmic complexity in time for many important operations andÃ¢ in at least some implementationsÃ¢ leaves some optimisations to the user that dictionary already has
any ideas why google-chrome is apply more spacing than firefox ie
for example i ve read that opera and ie will fix framerates slower than firefox
websphere development studio v7 wdsc is older than ibm i 6.1 your build date is 2007 the article you re referencing came out in 2008
purely in terms of the number of comparisons performed is mergesort always more efficient than quicksort
note that imagemagick is the most powerful exactimage is the fastest and graphicsmagick is a folk of imagemagick which is faster but a little less powerful and has some bugs
i was expecting the parent widget to have a little larger sizehint than the children layout
ever since i did sockets programming on a pdp 11 it s been the case that ip fragmentation will take care of the case where an ip datagram such as a udp datagram is larger than the mtu for the segment allows
but if you want to get the username of the user who makes the post is easier than that you only need to access the request.user
rsa is much slower than aes
however heapsort is somewhat slower in practice on most machines than a well-implemented quicksort
can you explain me why in this case the parfor loops is slower than the for-loop
i recently moved from autotest to guard for a reason it works better than autotest and it has a lot of available guard
this means that while the two underlying sorts it uses mergesort and insertion sort are both worse than quicksort for many kinds of data timsort only uses them when it is advantageous to do so
i m writing a c# class to perform 2d separable convolution using int to obtain better performance than double counterpart
search to each tabs in more than one toolbar
take into account that lazy mappings will be disabled so it may be useful to evaluate what will be need to be set to fetchtype.eager with fetchmode.subselect if more than 1 bag is needed to be initialized with it
swing is a lightweight framework provided by java while awt relies more on native libraries and is considered heavyweight
for my webapp the integrated visual studio server cassini ist much slower than iis
am i right that innodb is better for frequent concurrent updates and inserts than myisam
are writers and readers faster than outputstream and inputstream
also sending receiving data over udp is much simpler than over tcp and it does not require any connections
i d say that firefox is correct in being stricter than google-chrome here even though i m not entirely sure the base uri has changed and this new uri should be used for the relative uri #symboltype1 too
we have a legacy application that uses hibernate 3.0.5 and we re trying to upgrade it to hibernate 3.3.2 the versioning that has less impact on the current code
in some cases on embedded platforms where a fast hash function may not be available these may be more efficient than hmac
then c which is one those languages closer to the processor level is very performant and generally speaking compiled-language because they turn your code into assembly language are more performant than interpreted-language
innodb shouldn t be much slower than myisam
that said client-side javascript is much more common and if you were using server-side javascript you would probably know the answer to your question
surely there is some situation in which the bellman-ford approach is better than the dijkstra approach
so here the unchecked exception-handling is better to use in order not to copy and paste all that ugly try-catch block rethrowing an exception-handling and add the throws clause to the method
works on some rubies better than others jruby is recommended efficiency on mri is decreased due to gvl global vm lock
so it looks like the simd implementations give a 2x or more improvement over 64bit scalar code although 256 bit simd doesn t seem to give any improvement over 128bit simd and that typical throughput should be a lot faster than 5 gb s
speaking of get request types you should also know that get requests tend to perform better than post
nsstring has a higher level it also inherited form nsobject const on it should have no effect in fact not the same meaning about the no effect on immutable object
while it is possible to explore non-imperative computer concepts it doesn t seem to be worth the effort at the current time - building a declarative machine as an interpreter on top of an imperative machine is much cheaper and faster than a true declarative machine
because there can be more than one pop-up dialog active
this post is more to get advises and ideas rather than solving a problem
multiplication is much faster than division
as the versioning of the ase in the dumped database will likely be older than the versioning of ase you are installing to do the restore you will technically be doing a database upgrade so you will want to review the installation documentation regarding upgrading databases
it seems that the idea of uu-parsinglib it to be more declarative than parsec so you just have pure
for example emacs s macro shortcut f3 and f4 is easier than vim s qq and q
since i am using double nested loops i think for-loop is more suitable than while in this case
decltype is significantly more versatile that auto and can always be used in place of it
i understand from searching on so that setinterval is a better way to approach this that settimeout which i was using initially but i haven t figured out how to specify that the function needs to repeat
std ostringstream is much better for that kind of thing
also removing the m from a parent directory is trickier than it might seem so we need to make sure we move from the bottom of the tree the files first and not rename the directories till we re done with all the children
the manage link used to come up fine if there are more than one versioning for a document but since i ve upgrade to angular 1.2.0 whenever i create a new document which automatically creates one versioning for it and do subsequent edits on the same document creating more than one versioning the manage link fails to appear
if you don t want to write anything on autocompletetextview and select items you have to implement the spinner is more great
however std ostringstream is probably faster for appending if you absolutely have no idea about the size you have to reserve
i am confused why tcp throughput is bigger than udp
so if we have a vector and want to calculate a component-wise function over it say sin and cos it is faster to use vvsincos from accelerate because it will pipeline the calculations of sin and cos for all the entries in the vector which is faster than using a for-loop over the vector
whether splines or linear trapezodial interpolation is a better fit will depend heavily on your problem
your while loops would be better written as a for-loop
however i do not know if webstorm has a comparable option like that as it has less functionality than phpstorm or even intellij
bower is more focused on browser libraries and css while npm is more for server-sided stuff using node.js
instead of maven-antrun-plugin it is better to use upload goal of maven-wagon-plugin
shiny has upgrade datatables from 1.9.x to 1.10.x since shiny 0.10.2 and you can use the options listed at if your shiny versioning is higher than 0.10.2
testng strives to be much more configurable than junit but in the end they both work equally well
if you are curious though rather than just trusting a book or a blog post it is better to make a simple example and take it apart - you get it straight from the horse s mouth and you learn a whole lot more
the calculation language is dax which is an improvement on the horrible mdx - dax reads more like excel functions
for formatting a single numeric value tostring is marginally more efficient than string.format because string.format has a bunch of overhead to parse the format string out of the curly braces and then pass it to tostring
is post more compact than get since get requests have to be url-encoded
phusion passenger 4 enterprise bring many advantages over has more features than puma and rainbows for example it has out of band garbage collection can dynamically adjust the number of processes based on traffic completely automates rolling restarts so you don t need scripting etc
first of udp s datagram is simpler than tcp s one
my service having more than 50 get post methods
because spring s xml config is slightly more powerful than shiro s ini spring users are encouraged to use full spring config instead of shiro ini
i like ubuntu linux which has more than 27 000 packages in its universe repository. now you can run linux and windows at the same time
vb.net appears much more complex then vb6 and the learning curve is tough
to get a more reliable timing of the query you d need to use profiling or some other way of benchmarking that works more directly with the query
i ve read that painting to a qwidget is sometimes faster than qgraphicsview but it would by a lot of extra work for the mouse handling i think
or if you know any better debugger than google-chrome or firefox please let me know becuase i can r figure out google-chrome and firefox
you can have only one httphandler but can plug in more than one httpmodule to examine and handle the requests
usually you use strsplit to break a string in parts but with substr there s an easier solution for your problem
if i d directly say that udp is faster comparatively than tcp that it is used for such applications
i think that the accessors getter and setter is far better at least in your example
my question is why do both integer and floating-point multiplication execute faster than their addition counterparts
instead of working around the 1 label and image you get in a uibutton it s cleaner to start from scratch with a uicontrol and create your tiles
the solutions using a public constructor are fine too but as the constructor cannot be called directly on thr interface i think protected is better
es2015 module is more efficient than the other formats and can facilitate the creation of smaller bundle size through tree-shaking technique importing just the bits you need instead of importing the whole thing
if you send a udp datagram larger than the mtu it will be fragmented
this option is better than simply copying the file as it allows you to overwrite an existing file but you still don t get direct access to the file s properties
it s a more involved process with namenode assuring that at least dfs.replication.min copies are written to hdfs
personally i really like reactiveui which is fairly unusual but does make getting things right an awful lot easier than caliburn
in google-chrome the font appears to be 1px smaller than firefox and ie and i cannot see why
if you are familiar of using junit it is easier to switch into testng
strcpy is notoriously unsafe as are it s cousins strcpy_s and strncpy although they are mildly safer than strcpy
you might be more comfortable with suds pysimplesoap or flask-enterprise to consume the soap data
note line value may be inaccurate in adobe coldfusion though railo is much better with this
if you have setter and getter it s no better than public field
as far as the syntax goes i guess it s a bit different from the more classic syntax of the algol family languages but it s no more and possibly less weird than apl
i am more familiar with apache php combo rather than say nginx and fastcgi with php setup so focusing on this area
if the dominant memory usage is program data structures then i wouldn t be at all surprised to find pypy using significantly less memory than cpython whether or not the jit was enabled
i want to get all the users that has more than one post but
also firefox 4 has hardware accelerated canvas that is marginally faster than ie9 and a lot faster than google-chrome
compilers but it compiles faster than the mxmlc and compc
at the beginning the insert performance of innodb is almost 50 times slower than myisam and tokudb is 40 times slower than myisam
the swift designers went through a lot of trouble to make sure that it s more than just objective-c without the constraints of c in fact i almost wish they hadn t said that since it s so often misquoted
multiplication is a relatively complex operation and is likely to be slower than say addition or comparison
generaly qgraphicsscene better using with connection qgraphicsview
tried cakephp but yii seems much clearer
the mathematical reason for this is that once the solution 906609 is found it will no longer be possible to find a larger palindrome where the larger factor is less than the square-root of 906609 which is 952.160.
zsh is more extensible and has a much greater focus on searching and completion than bash
1 in mysql engines myisam is better or innodb
their conclusion innodb has 30 higher performance than myisam on average
choice is not easy sometimes we use rule of thumb impala is good for queries without joins if all your data stored in hdfs hive spark has bigger latency but joins are reliable it supports more data sources and has rich non-sql processing capabilities like mllib and graphx
when taking input we can use either get or post.the input is shown in the url when using get but not when post is used.is there a situation where get is more useful than post
my website in developing process looking in mozilla firefox with same font-size declaration margin padding and different font-families always a few smaller than in google-chrome or internet explorer
according to w3counter ie6 is used by more people than opera safari and any version of google-chrome
g++ seems to work better than gcc in my experience
xilinx tools suck but their raw silicon is better than altera
i have implemented it using process library and my own java code however i m wondering can it be done in simpler way with activiti jbpm and drools
serving static files with nginx is much more efficient than with apache
i think the performance depends a lot on the data provider paging and sorting and filtering the data are easily the most expensive tasks when dealing with databases - so picking a renderer gridview listview repeater is more dependent on your comfort with that particular control
as shown in sample below for sqlcommand which is more or less same as oledbcommand
scheme has fewer libraries than common lisp
i usually use google-chrome s developer mode which imho already gives even more details than firefox
alter your command path so that jruby s version of the ruby command has a higher priority than the mri one
lemmatization should lead to better results than stemming source
for example jruby is faster than mri jruby 1.7 is faster than jruby 1.6 jruby 1.7 running on hotspot is faster than jruby 1.7 running on j9 jruby 1.7 running on hotspot 1.7 is faster than jruby 1.7 running on hotspot 1.6 jruby 1.7 running on hotspot 1.7 with the c2 compiler is faster than jruby 1.7 running on hotspot 1.7 with the c1 compiler and so on
use having clause to filtering the grouping which is having more than fkey
in the case of autotools it is slightly more complicated because not everybody who compiles the software would need automake and autoconf installed only those that need to change the build system adding new files counts as changing the build system
wifi and bluetooth aren t fast enough for a smooth framerate but the data transfer speed across the usb connector is more than enough up to 480 megabytes second
that s better than using system.in system.out
