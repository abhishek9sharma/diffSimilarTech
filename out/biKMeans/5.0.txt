and the height is smaller than the width physically
i would when the height is bigger than the width the width 100 height auto
ps the image source width and height is always bigger than the width and height parameters and the width and height ratio is being preserved
and opposite if height is greater than width then resize height to 500 pixels and scale width accordingly
texture width or height is larger than the device supports
i have appbar whose height is greater than device width
if image width is larger than height landscape then scale the height to 1024 pixels and scale the width to appropriate value to maintain aspect ratio
i m calculating the width based on the div height if the height is greater than the screen width
if set true then it might increase the width or height if the given width and height are bigger than original width and height
the canvas height is slightly larger than the width
if width is greater than height return the proportional height otherwise return the target
for example if width is greater than height then resize width to 500 pixels and scale height accordingly so that original aspect ratio is preserved
when width of the image is greater than height set height to a fixed value and auto stretch width
in landscape the height is smaller than the width
if width goes bigger height will goes bigger
in between 768 1024 and only when width is longer than height
use a rectangular element having width greater than the width of the vertical line and a height of 1
my goal scale an image width if the height is greater than the device height
the length of getdata is more than width height
check that panel width is bigger than oval width and the same with height
the width and height attributes should be two pixels less than the width and height of your badge
if width or height is greater than 1000px image should be valid
that is why width is bigger than height
1 check if width is greater than height
then i crop it if height is less then crop it to height size or width size
if the height is greater than the width
and when the width is bigger than the height the height 100 width auto
this often affects width more than height
first if the height is greater than 1000 simply scale both height and width by 1000 height
if the current height width is greater than inital height width ignore the swipe
if width is greater than height it is landscape
when viewport height is less than width of square
basically i have about 30 images with varying height and length not greater than 750px width and 500 px height
in between 768 1024 and only when height is longer than width
if width is greater than height return the target otherwise return the proportional width
width return a larger dimension than height which is not correct
then since width of your image is greater than height multiply the original width and height by 250 498
if image height is larger than width portrait then scale the width to 1024 pixels and scale the height to appropriate value to maintain aspect ratio
if the width is greater than the height then scale the image to 200px height
in this one the width height ratio is smaller
in other way if width is larger than height it should be width 100 height auto
and the height 100 if the image height is bigger than width
but i can see if i give width as wrap_content then height is less than fixed height because keeping aspect ratio height corresponding to wrap_content width is less fixed height
next means that the ratio of width to height in devices greater than 960px width should be 1 1
meaning if width is greater than screen width image will cover the imageview frame width and takes a corresponding height for that width
these matrixes can be horizontal height of matrix is lower than its width or vertical height of matrix is higher than its width
if browser size is less than 400 width or 300 height scrollbars are used
if your video s height width is more than height width of the device set width to be 100 else set height to be 100
but width and height is fewer properties
its height and width is more than the mobile screen size
one where height is bigger than width and one where width is bigger than height
button height is higher than it s width
if the width is greater then height 3 4 screen.width then
the specified width and height cannot be less than the width and
where the width is wider and the height is shorter than 44
the element s explicit height or width is less than the height or
if width is smaller than height store width in one variable called value else store height
parent s height is higher than its width
if the height is greater than the width just reverse the width and height variables
if the height is greater than the width then scale the image to 200px width
the width of the picture is greater than the height
if the width is greater than the height
same for width being greater than height
i ve discovered that using the height width constraint instead of frame width height is more reliable
switch the values of the width and height so that the width is longer than the height
the width should be larger than the height
add a new column until width is greater than height
if the width is larger than the height then width and height are swapped and the angle is corrected
for a cross-browser experience its either scroll width height or offset width height whichever is greater
see picture above height 1280 width 720 when the actual splashscreen have a width bigger than the height
parent s height is lower than its width
assuming the width is greater than the height
verify width is not more than 2x the height and height is not more than 2x the width
