i experienced this same issue -- dock was powered but keyboard and mouse were not

815591

815714
pop-up	dialog
a dialog window will pop-up and here you can click new...

815719
installation	upgrade
not only is the command shorter and contained in one keyword instead of remembering all of them the display in the terminal is also better. the apt install and apt search syntax has colors turned on by default and installation upgrade sequences have a colored total progress bar at the bottom

815719
ubuntu	debian
the word i get from my friends who use debian is that it s probably just an ubuntu thing

815727
vmware	virtualbox
inside windows 7 i download virtualbox vmware etc

it turns out that there appears to have been a software conflict with synergy remote keyboard and mouse

815853

i m attempting to convert the following vlc command line which is streaming an mpeg video over udp no rtp

815875

815881
arp	icmp
the problem i am having is trying to get the two servers to communicate to each other if i ping os-net via vmhost3 ping -c 4 10.0.0.2 it sends the arp request and gets a response but when it sends the icmp echo request it gets no reply

815897
x86	64bit
c program files x86 - as the above but on 64bit systems 32-bit programs go here can give a hint to determine whether particular app is 32-bit or 64bit

815913
put	get
since not all processes can run on one core comfortably at that speed they get put on other cores why you see the others rise in cpu and basically balance out on battery

815933
rar	zip
there are probably dozens of different archive formats zip rar tar etc.

815933
folder	directory
zip has been sort of the standard for windows and some systems can handle zip files as if they were directory folder without having to even extract the files

815941

you made need to port forward or port trigger port triggering is better the ports used for sip signalling and audio rtp

816026
debian	linux
debian is one of the forms of this operating system released in the early 1990s as is one of the most popular of the many versions of linux available today

816026
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu is another operating system which was released in 2004 and is based on the debian operating system

816026
ubuntu	debian
debian early operating system to ubuntu still in active development

816026
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu newer operating system based on debian still in active development

816040
ubuntu	debian
debian and ubuntu are flavors of distributions

816040
ubuntu	debian
now why do so much people use ubuntu instead of debian

816074
debian	linux
debian is a distribution of linux

816074
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu was based on debian this way

816077
led	electronics
for example 36 or 40 bit words wasn t entirely uncommon in early electronics computers these led to convenient 18- or 20-bit half words which were sufficient for many purposes while the full-length words allowed larger quantities or more precision where that was needed

816100
ubuntu	linux
do these tools not work on ubuntu linux or linux in general

816100
ubuntu	linux
and wouldn t mind any other ubuntu linux program that can do that

816134
rss	feed
when i subscribe to an rss feed in thunderbird 24.6 on windows 7 i find the link to the rss feed i want click subscribe and add the link

816136
udp	tcp
select protocol to be tcp or choose udp

816152
filesystems	ntfs
is is safe to just delete the volume in windows disk manager and create a new ntfs filesystems using quick format

816198
kde	gnome
you also nowadays add one or more of several competing subsystems gnome or kde desktop manager

816198
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu is a downstream distribution of debian

816198
ubuntu	centos
one in which ubuntu add a lot of value compared to some other such relationships such as centos and redhat perhaps

816199
wan	lan
it is not possible because the four lan ports and the wireless port are connected on layer 2 and this group is in turn connected to the wan port on layer 3

816199
wan	lan
with an internet connection in this case the router will have a wan network your internet connection and a lan network

816199
wan	lan
it will then use nat to make the two networks lan and wan pass traffic to each other using address translation from private to public and vice versa

816200
debian	linux
debian is a linux distribution

816200
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu is a fork of debian

816200
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu is more bleeding-edge than debian - it was created to be more friendly and useful from a non-technical or non-unix-expert standpoint

816200
ubuntu	debian
most software that works on debian will work on ubuntu

816200
ubuntu	debian
you might run into some base components that need updating to run ubuntu stuff but can t be updated because there s no newer version in the debian repos

816216
switching	screens
however by hitting command tab you did switching the application look at the top of your screens

816235
folder	directory
so i ultimately want a window showing the path that the count was taken from the number of files and folder and the overall size of the directory

816300
vmware	virtualbox
i ve successfully run os x in emulators such as virtualbox was bloody slow though and vmware workstation so i d say yes however there are many problems that you need to take care such as finding and installing kexts equivalent of device drivers to make the virtual hardware work correctly so it s hard but not impossible

816300
vmware	virtualbox
however it seems that running os x in virtualbox or vmware is more popular so you ll get much more help and how-to guides for those platforms so why not run it in one of these virtual machines instead

816317
google-chrome	firefox
just use ctrl + shift +k in firefox or ctrl + shift +i in google-chrome

816317
google-chrome	firefox
then at the topleft there is an arrow firefox or magnifier google-chrome

816318
jobs	cron
cron is taking only hours and minutes as starting times but will start the jobs at hh mm 00 so from my point of view you are save with your solution

816332
centos	linux
i have un-installed seamonkey on centos according to the directions for linux

816349
client-side	server-side
so i m not sure if this is a server-side issue or a client-side issue or a little of both

tunnel	vpn
tun vpn tunnel 172.x.x.x

816355

816410
debian	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	linux
debian and ubuntu are distributions of linux

816410
debian	linux
technically the name linux refers specifically to the kernel and it d be a little weird to call an operating system linux if you didn t use that kernel but there are people keeping everything else and swapping out the kernel debian kfreebsd .

816465
debian	linux
debian is a general distribution of linux

816465
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu is based on debian

816465
gentoo	debian
most are either based on debian or based on redhat although there are also slackware and gentoo based systems

816465
debian	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	linux
for example i m running elementary os right now which is based on ubuntu which is based on debian which is a version of linux which is a flavor of unix

816490
spaces	delimiter
for each line found spaces and commas as considered as field delimiter and the second token in the line is requested that is the time after the duration label

816496
x86	64bit
i have a windows 7 64bit and i recently install chrome 64bit to test some java applets surprisingly the 64bit version is installed in the 32 bits folder c program files x86 overriding the 32 bit version

816589
unix	bsd	bsd	minix
partly in response to the battles over system v and bsd two new projects began minix by andrew tanenbaum which replicated the key features of existing unix-family kernels with a micro-kernel design and the gnu project which replicated most of the important non-kernel parts of existing unix both with entirely new code that avoided the legal troubles between system v and bsd

816589
minix	linux
in 1991 â inspired by minix older unix branches and the absence of progress on a gnu kernel â linus torvalds created linux

816589
debian	linux
debian was one distribution of linux and it has branched into a family of distributions

816589
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu is a distribution that is part of the debian family and it has in turn branched into a family of distributions

816589
filesystems	fat
cp m inspired 86-dos written for 8086-family machines by tim paterson using microsoft s standalone disk basic-86 8-bit fat filesystems because cp m-86 the 8086-family sequel to cp m was delayed

816590
robocopy	xcopy
i m aware of copy xcopy and robocopy commands but i m specifically looking to spawn the copy dialog

816610
addition	multiplication
this means that a shorter latency operation such as an integer addition coming after a longer latency operation such as a floating point multiplication can write its result to a register before the longer latency operation completes

816620
cpu	hyperthreading
so modern cpus still work sequentially - i guess the official workaround to this has been to introduce logical cpus - intel s hyperthreading technology allowed many operations to overlap and occur at once and the interface it presented to the instruction stream was a second logical cpu

816622
bash	zsh
does the shellshock bash bug affect zsh

816625
udp	tcp
tip use a security group that permits both tcp and udp connections on port 3389

816627
lvm	xfs
i have a server setup of an xfs partition on lvm on a ubuntu 14.04.1 lts

816631
ffmpeg	handbrake
handbrake is a frontend for ffmpeg

816631
ffmpeg	handbrake
if the video audio is not correctly transcoded with handbrake you will most likely get the same results with ffmpeg

816642
wan	lan
i ve tried running the lan cable from bthub to the wan port on the netgear

816657
opera	google-chrome
google-chrome and opera certificate information

816657
google-chrome	safari
cause the same time it works now in google-chrome but doesn t work in safari

816661
google-chrome	firefox
visual studio sublime text google-chrome firefox you name it

816664
wordpress	joomla
this kind of code exists in many frameworks and cms s for example wordpress and joomla etc

816664
wordpress	joomla
now this difference may seem trivial at first but if you were to use a framework like wordpress or one of the cms s like joomla for example this can and does cause problems when you move your site to a live server

816664
folder	directory
this may seem a little confusing as once we create a virtual host definition for the sub directory of the wamp www folder some items will appear on both of the my projects menu and the my virtual hosts menu s

816681
wan	lan	wan	subnet
depending on which option you choose set the lan wan ip address on the netgear to an ip address within the same subnet as the bt router but outside the bt router s dhcp range you may need to adjust the bt router s dhcp range

816706
children	parent
you have to take into account that deleting renaming a file is actually a write operation on the parent folder which is a special file that contains the list of children files or subfolders

816759
disk	ram
i won t delve further into this topic at this point except for one point it s only used related to synchronous data transfers write transactions are acknowledged as soon as data has actually been written to stable storage disk in sort meaning i m finished as opposed to asynchronous transfers write transactions are acknowledged as soon as data has been received but part or all of the data may still be residing in cache ram waiting to be written to stable storage meaning i shall do it asap

816787
versioning	upgrade
for various reasons mainly that i m really leery about trying to do a distribution upgrade from so far away i can t upgrade it to a more recent versioning

816800
wan	lan
once i go to the network tab in my new router s configuration webpage it shows me a wan ip and a lan ip the lan ip is defaulted to 192.168.0.1 and the wan ip is set to dynamic ip once i plug an ethernet cable from the primary router to the new one s wan port it obtains a wan ip automatically is this supposed to happen

816816
ubuntu	linux
i m curious if this is some reserved url and linux ubuntu at least i ve seen android have acknowledged the url and in the os intentionally point back to the localhost

any shell including zsh can be used to spawn a compromised bash shell

817122
debian	linux

817133

there are many similaritys between bash and zsh but they werer implemented independent from each other

817133

817354
wan	lan
in order to allow computers in the 192.168.0.x lan to ping computers in the 192.168.1.x lan routerb must be configured to forward icmp traffic between its wan and lan

817354
wan	lan
every router has at least two networks its inside lan and its outside wan

817354
wan	lan
from routera s perspective its wan is your isps network and the internet at large and its lan is everything in the 192.168.0.x 24 network

817354
wan	lan
routerb s lan is the 192.168.1.x 24 network and its wan is routera s lan the isp netowrk and everything else outside its lan

817354
wan	lan
so computers in routera s lan are in routerb s wan

817354
wan	lan
nat and spi generally allow all hosts inside the lan to connect to computers on the outside and receive responses to those connections but it prevents a computer on the wan from initiating a connection to a computer on the lan

817354
wan	lan
this is why you can ping from 192.168.1.x routerb s lan outward to 192.168.0.x routera s lan and routerb s wan

817354
wan	lan
it is also why a computer in the routerb s wan cannot connect inbound to a computer in routerb s lan

817357
winpcap	libpcap	winpcap	wireshark	libpcap	wireshark
although what wireshark and tshark do is run dumpcap part of wireshark with the interface s on which to capture and the filter to use as command-line arguments and dumpcap asks libpcap to ask the os or on windows the winpcap driver to copy all packets that match the filter to its local buffer

817357
libpcap	wireshark	solaris	irix
on some operating systems for example solaris prior to solaris 11 hp-ux and irix the os can t do the filtering in the kernel so libpcap asks the os to provide all packets to it and it libpcap runs the filter itself and only supplies packets that match the filter to its caller - dumpcap in the case of wireshark and tshark

some laptops have a protection so that you can use the mouse while using the keyboard this can be disabled in the driver configurations for the mouse

825056
width	margin
as pointed out by johnkiller in many cases it won t do the job because of the width margin issues that he mentioned

825097
apache	lighttpd
i don t personally run apache and my servers are relatively low use so i don t really log lighttpd but according to this u l post var log apache2 access.log is the place to look

825103
google-chrome	firefox
this happens in google-chrome 39.0.2171.13 beta-m and firefox 32.0.3 it works fine in ie but then again i get big video controls over the top of the gifv on imgur so i don t know if that s causing the scene to refresh and avoid the black glitches

825191
folder	directory
the only way i see for it to work assuming that the physical server that hold the information does not have any problem accessing the same folder is to map a drive letter to the folder where the process of directory traversal starts removing the computer address and share name from the path length

825205
short	base
base what you put in the short title field on the specifications in the required style manual

825222

i recently have this notebook and make a fresh install of windows 8.1 only one partitiã³n of the complete disk now i d like to install ubuntu or other linux distro do i have to format the hard drive and make the partitiã³ns for the oses then install both or can i install ubuntu without reinstaling w8.1 because i m have a lot of programs installed and a lot of work in it

825272
mouse	keyboard
i was in a similar situation i just got a system76 gazelle professional and my usb mouse keyboard were not working on windows 7

this happens in google-chrome 39.0.2171.13 beta-m and firefox 32.0.3

825316
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
meaning modern browsers such as google-chrome safari and firefox have hardware acceleration of page content set as a default

825598
put	get
now put it into a variable so that when echoed you get the exact same result

825632
sudo	passwd
it will ask you for your passwd due sudo

825646
wan	subnet
the openwrt solution doesn t bridge the interfaces but reuses the same subnet prefix as the wan thus also breaking the ipv6 spec

825648
udp	tcp
see tcp udp socket 9339

825656
debian	linux
i am running a kali linux virtual machine it s based on debian

825671
mouse	keyboard
in desktop pcs with atx power supply some bioses allow you to wake up or start the computer from off state by pressing a key or key combination on the mouse keyboard but i ve never seen a laptop with that feature and no bios allows you to press both a key on keyboard and power key too

825673
wan	subnet
i just run a scan ping scan of course of 2032 ip addresses on my wan subnet and half of them were online are these addresses of the routers of the subscribers of my isp in the neighborhood

825692
range	max
i am trying to add in vertical lines to my line charts to represent an important data event and the way i went about doing so was adding in the max value of the y range for the specific date as seen below and making it into a bar chart

825700
mouse	keyboard
it might be that the computer isn t frozen at all but the input commands mouse keyboard etc are jammed in some way leading to the impression that the computer is frozen

825712
vlan	packets
to transfer different vlans over the same physical network link they have to be marked somehow or you wouldnâ t know which packets belongs to which vlan

825712
vlan	packets
this is what vlan tagging 802.11q does it extends the header of ip packets to include the vlan id

825712
vlan	packets
if a device is not vlan aware or not configured itâ ll most likely drop the packets because of bogus content

825758
mouse	keyboard
when ibm introduced the ps 2 line of computers they wanted to imitate the macintosh se and macintosh ii which used the same style of connector for keyboard and mouse

825758
mouse	keyboard
unlike the macintosh where the keyboard and mouse share the wires used for signalling ibm introduced a six-pin connector which used power ground two wires for keyboard signalling and two independent wires for mouse signalling

825763
min	max
it s a bit tricky for choosing a p-state because you can t pick one you have to alter the min max c.p.u

opera	firefox
i m trying to switch from firefox to opera just to see if i like it

825917
sudo	passwd
and you don t have ability to enter user passwd to sudo in a php script so you have to disable authentication too

825925
ubuntu	debian
however i do not wish to use the jvm that is packaged with ubuntu or debian

825925
dpkg	apt
the problem is that if i force-install these packages without dependencies dpkg --force-all -i it breaks my apt package repository such that any new package installation will prompt me to resolve those dependencies apt-get -f install

825952
submit	submission
and finally a submit button to complete the submission obviously

825973
unix	bsd
the ps command historically had wildly different syntax in bsd and system v unix

825973
sunos	bsd
as another very common example bsd e means show environment while sunos -e means show everyone s processes .

825973
sunos	bsd
if the username is missing it ll assume you gave it a bsd option but used sunos syntax

825985

i ve tried chmod and chown

826146
stdout	stderr
reredirect readme also explains how to redirect to another command or to redirect only stdout or stderr

826159
mouse	keyboard
i can confirm that the 4.99 at time of writing touchme engine with its gesture-editing windows store app touchme gesture studio allows you to map new gestures to the mouse scroll wheel so for example i ve been using three-finger swipe up and down to drive the mouse wheel up and down and another gesture to make the on-screen keyboard appear or disappear

826214
rsa	dsa
the remote host logs the origin of each rsa or dsa key

826215

it s just the upgrade versioning

826251
mouse	keyboard
i want to control the pc by laptop s mouse and keyboard

826251
mouse	keyboard
no monitor no mouse and keyboard for the pc

826257
next	except
this mostly works well except in cases where there are pairs of duplicates like in the example below we would want fo-1694 to be highlighted because they aren t all next to each other

826269
post	get
rather than get command post is used

826278
tunnel	vpn
i ve set up an ipsec vpn tunnel and connected it

826293

i m under windows 7 and i d like to know if it s possible to create a virtual folder that points to many other folder effectively listing all their contents as if being in a single directory

826318
filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	fat
testdisk is compatable with all kinds of filesystems including ext2 3 4 ntfs fat and others

826318
folder	directory
using this last approach i was successfully able to recover the entire partition save the top-level directory names so i had to rename about 6 top-level folder but everything below them was preserved

826342
stdout	stderr
unless redirected to a log-file log-messages should probably be sent to stderr rather than stdout

826375
fish	bash
unlike bash the fish path is an array of directories

826406
google-chrome	firefox
the solution to this was to install lastpass on google-chrome and firefox import to lastpass from firefox then just use the lastpass extension on google-chrome

826416
filesystems	ntfs
i formatted the flash drive as ntfs filesystems and then i was able to copy the file

826421
parallels	bootcamp
i have a very computationally intensive program which i wrote in python and starting two days ago i ran 6 copies of it in parallels using 6 cygwin terminals on a mac book pro running windows7 in bootcamp

826429
wan	lan
this will allow wired lan and wireless wan devices to work on your network

826437
filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	fat
ntfs provides things beyond fat such as metadata on files file name creation date access permissions and sometimes contents security access control lists and filesystems journaling

826438
put	get
one easy way to get a device to see two is to put two access points far apart and the device in the middle

826441
bluetooth	usb
i have a usb bluetooth dongle mounted

826465
kde	gnome
another option if you re using gnome or kde on modern debian debian wheezy or testing or unstable is to let the file manager list the drives for you

826469
range	minimum
what i ve done is start word and found out that style guidelines suggest minimum margins of 12.7mm and up to 2.54mm or 1 inch for standard documents so if you follow these you should be within print range

826511
rmdir	mkdir
you rmdir and mkdir the directory again performance should be better

826536
debian	mint
the process works perfectly in mint so it must be related to the configuration in debian

826538
spaces	delimiter
then select tab or spaces 1 as the delimiter and hit finish

826542
folder	directory
find locate all the .txz files within all the sub directory then move them all to a specific folder

826587
ubuntu	linux
i ve got a laptop with linux ubuntu and i attach it to an external monitor or to a projector

826644
filesystems	ntfs
in all ntfs cases there is no direct evidence of vbox but the filesystems filter manager is active

826654
mouse	keyboard
i have a logitech mk710 keyboard mouse setup together with setpoint driver 5.80.4 control center v6.65.62

826656
mouse	keyboard
i have an industrial computer read no keyboard mouse monitor except during maintenance which will control some machinery

opensuse	linux
the operating system will be linux i would prefer opensuse but it s not a strict requirement

826668
put	get
session put get

826750
umask	mount
the mount command includes a umask parameter that is missing from the fstab entry

826750
umask	mount
so it isn t clear whether the defaults used by the ntfs-3g entry are the same as the umask value in the mount command or they might be different but the ntfs-3g defaults are good enough

826756
wan	lan
after which i created a firewall vm with 2 nics - 1 serving as the wan and another serving as the lan

826756
wan	lan
assigned the wan nic to the wan switch and assigned the lan nic to the lan switch

826756
wan	lan
now the ideal thing to do was to have a second public ip and assign it to the wan interface of the firewall after which desktop vms connected to the lan would have internet access

826756
wan	lan
then from this desktop manage the esxi host and since my wan interface is configured with a public ip vms on the lan would have access to the internet

826758
children	parent
if so is it possible the these parental controls could be private so that only the parent can read his children s logs

826794
putty	winscp
in that file i have two separate public keys one created using putty that i am using with winscp and one created from secure shell client

826797
sudo	passwd
you are willing to tolerate the resource-usage of ssh-ing into localhost network buffers tty-allocations useless encryption and decryption etc. instead of configuring your sudo to simply not ask for passwd

826805
centos	linux
all my servers are running aws linux centos

826832

so how come it is working on ubuntu but not on gentoo

826955
windows	wow64
i have been reading quite a bit about how windows 7 handles 32-bit versus 64-bit applications including details of system32 and wow64 and am surprised by the amount of contradictory information available

826955
folder	directory
does the directory folder in which an application is stored make any difference to windows 7 regarding how the application behaves or sees the registry or file system

826959
google-chrome	firefox	opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome
it is available for firefox google-chrome and opera

826992
wan	lan
however check for the bridge function on your router it will forward all wan traffic to lan port so you could use public ip on your device at lan port directly

827006
google-chrome	firefox
i followed daniel beck s instructions with a few modifications and got this to work for url files which i wanted to open in google-chrome firefox would also work on a mac

827008
windows	wow64
sure windows determines that it is a 32bit version and uses the wow64 subsystem to run 32bit application on a 64bit windows

827014
chown	sudo
i tried sudo chown michael etc vsftpd.conf as when i run sudo chown michael etc vsftpd vsftpd.conf i get the no such file error

centos	linux
using tramp dired-mode to access a remote shared centos linux server -- find-file ssh lawlist 12.34.56.789 home lawlist -- i have not been able to subsequently copy files directories recursively from the remote server to the local machine with dired-do-copy

827340
folder	directory
what happens is that the directory selected gets copied from the remote to the local but nothing inside the directory gets copied over -- an empty folder is created on the local machine which has the name of the folder that was copied but nothing else happens

827404
x86	64bit
the sole reason for the default separation into two folders program files and program files x86 is that if you have two versions of the same program a 32-bit and 64bit version it provides a simple way to keep overlapping files separate

827424
post	get
this codeproject post may help get you started and help you wrap your head around modifying the explorer elements start button in this case from a programming point of view hiding the taskbar and startmenu start orb in windows vista and windows 7

if the laptop only provides sata ii with 3gb s the values you see in as ssd benchmark are fine

827566

i have enough ram and enough hard disk drive space for it

827599
ethernet	wireless
i m joining them to domain via ethernet cable not wireless as i know wireless has issues

827623
udp	tcp
could we establish a tcp connection via udp hole punching technique

827651

h.265	hevc	h.264	hevc	h.264	h.265
considering superiority of the modern h.264 avc and h.265 hevc compression algorithms over the dvd-standard mpeg2 i hope to save hard drive space by compressing the video while saving 99 of the dvd original quality

827735
h.265	hevc
for hevc i d as well prefer using parameters that would ensure smooth hardware-accelerated playback on devices that support it but i don t mean to focus on this constraint as i haven t seen any devices offering hardware-accelerated h.265 decoding at all yet

827737
vpn	lan
i would like though for the hosts in the private subnet to reach the vpn clients not the lan behind the clients

827759
h.264	h.265
also the data rate savings will be quite drastic if you re going from a 10 mbit s dvd to around 1â 2 mbit s for h.264 video and 0.5â 1 mbit s for h.265 video

827759
h.264	hevc
research suggests that using hevc will lead to up to 74 bitrate saving compared to h.264

827759
h.264	h.265
this is irrespective of the actual bitrate if the h.264 version takes 1.5 mbit s then h.265 will use around 750 kbit s but it s 750 kbit s vs

827759
h.264	h.265
ffmpeg wiki on h.264 encoding and h.265 encoding

827766
exif	jfif
the newer exchangeable image file format exif is comparable to jfif but the two standards are mutually incompatible

827766
exif	jfif
this is because both standards specify that their particular application segment app0 for jfif app1 for exif must be the first in the image file

827766
exif	jfif
this will not affect the image decoding for most decoders but poorly designed jfif or exif parsers may not recognise the file properly

827766
exif	jfif
based on the above you can convert a jfif to a exif by simply removing the app0 segment marker with your hex editor and adding an app1 segment marker using another tool that manipulates exif data

827830
filesystems	hfs+
reformat your external hard drive to use another filesystems that os x can write to which in your case would be exfat or hfs+

827867
postfix	dovecot
my problem is that i can t seem to get it all quite working right and i think the issue is dns since from my windows 7 client vm i can connect to the mailuser ipaddress but can t do mailuser test.lab my spoofed domain. i m using thunderbird within windows to connect to the ubuntu server and am using postfix with dovecot for the mail server with a typical lamp stack

827883

828831

but as a vpn is a tunnel it allows your computer to connect to a remote network and obtain another internal ip much like the one your router gives your laptop

828831
tunnel	vpn
vpn servers are open to the internet through open ports and routes through firewalls they have to be too enable you to connect in but if the servers are managed correctly and the tunnel data is encrypted well enough then whatever data is sent over the vpn will be unobtainable

disk	ram
beyond things like running memtest86+ for one or two passes to check that the ram sticks are still ok after installation no static discharge during installation for example one smart conveyance test on the hard disk to verify that nothing slammed against it during shipping causing damage and so on with new hardware as shipped by a reasonable manufacturer is there some likely early-life failure mode which is likely to be detected by stress testing but not be detectable by normal use

folder	directory	children	parent
indicates the current directory - the folder you re in and is a directory separator separates a parent directory name from it s children files or another subdirectories for instance bin bash - here is the root directory bin is it s subdirectory and bash is a file as you see there are no separator in file names as they can not have children nodes

wan	lan
cascading a second router from my main router via an ethernet cable lan port on main router to wan on secondary router with dhcp on

829757
ethernet	wireless
the downside to option 1 is that because the secondary network will be for a different part of my house cannot run ethernet cable there devices in that area would have to be run off of wireless instead of having the option to be hardwired

829782
ubuntu	linux
so recently a friend of mine got me interested in trying out linux long story but suffice it to say it was time for a change so i downloaded a ubuntu distro

tunnel	vpn
if you have access to a vpn service private internet access purevpn etc. try connecting to youtube or netflix through the vpn tunnel

829846
throttling	throttle
the traffic between your machine and the vpn server will be encrypted and will look like noise to your isp so if they are throttling based on packet type the vpn traffic should avoid the throttle

829846
tunnel	vpn
once you have established the vpn tunnel try out the youtube video again

829846
tunnel	vpn
if it is going faster than it had been without the vpn tunnel then your isp may indeed be throttling your traffic

wan	lan
well he other day i came accross a setup wherein two routers could be wired together either on a lan to lan basis or lan to wan basis where the latter would separate networks between the primary secondary routers

829901
wan	lan
now as per the lan to wan setup the secondary router would have its wan port connected with a ethernet cable originating from any one lan port of the primary router

829901
wan	lan
getting this right a question flashed in my mind as to can this setup lan to wan be made wireless rather than a wired connection

829921
ubuntu	linux
i am trying to use linux dialog to prepare simple installer for ubuntu

udp	tcp
i have tried all the possible options tcp udp changing the remote ip and changing the local ip too nothing works

829929
tunnel	vpn	tunnel	packets
edit it seems that there is another option that can make you use vpn in case of extreme censorship which is using stunnel ssl tunnel this will wrap the packets and make them look like pure ssl

when i arrive at work and connect the docking station my wireless disconnects and the ethernet connects

829979
google-chrome	firefox
solutions using google-chrome or firefox login in webmin in webmin configuration - ssl encryption- self-signed certificate

you can adjust this recipe to use a different rss feed generated by different search results

830359
put	get
note you may need to run apt-get update before doing this especially if you get an error like e you must put some source uris in your sources.list which appears at least in my case to be a bit of a red-herring error message. this can be done with apt-get source .

830383
disk	ram
if you insist on not removing the hdd you can try booting from a live disk with persistent memory to transfer your data but if you suspect the cpu or ram is at fault it won t matter the boot device

830388
ssd	sata
upon further contact i was told that the reason is that my motherboard is equipped with a sata 2 port and an ssd would require a sata 3

830388
ssd	sata
however i found out there are actually plenty sata 2 ssd drives being offered

830388
ssd	sata
and these guys here have run some tests and concluded that connecting an ssd to a sata 2 port is totally worth it

830388
ssd	sata
actually another thing that is confusing me is that the abovementioned people seem to be plugging a samsung 840 pro ssd into a sata 2 port although everywhere i ve looked it is being sold as an sata 3 drive

830393
filesystems	ntfs
a special hidden file that the ntfs filesystems uses to store filesystems information

830393

the ntfs filesystems is the one that windows xp vista 7 uses. for those of you who might be interested in the technical details it is found in position 24 or 25 of the boot hard disk drive s master file table and contains an index to the unique object identifier numbers that ntfs allocates to every file on the computer

osx	yosemite
is it possible to restrict launch services on mac osx i m on yosemite but i guess the same applies to older versions from registering certain app bundles

830712
folder	directory
the way i see it is that when the user writes a file you can either write to the folder but when reading from the folder it merges with the parent folder or the user can have a virtual folder of some sort that combines a read-only and read-write directory with writes automatically going to the read-write directory i suppose somewhat similar to windows 7 style libraries

830719
filesystems	btrfs
create a readonly filesystems that acts as a template to seed other btrfs filesystems

830725
put	get
because the driver is already digitally signed and because there is a system service ready to install device drivers microsoft has a secure path through which they can guarantee that only known good software can get put on a machine

830796
macports	homebrew
therefore and with little personal experience i theorize that always using the -t flag for macports installs should prevent most problems of having macports and homebrew coexist on the same system

it should not be too hard to use the steps from the book with apache instead of nginx if you do not want to run two webservers in parallel

831374
rbenv	homebrew
just follow the excellent installation instructions on the github page if you have homebrew installed it s basically just a brew install rbenv ruby-build

831377
passenger	webrick
in all puppet lab documentation and in different forums it is mentioned puppet uses webrick and one need to install apache passenger or something similar to scale up

so in this case it makes sense recognizing mouse while not recognizing keyboard

831558
mouse	keyboard
i ve recently got win 8.1 pro and a new keyboard and mouse slimstar c110

831623
switching	screens
also for some reason his account name does not show up on the login screens - it just shows the local admin user name - no option to switching users

831643
peer	p2p
it seams that the standard way of doing p2p over the internet is to port forward the router to accept external connections via tcp or to use an external hosted server to relay peer1 -- server -- peer2 the data but how exactly using what methods does the torrent protocol achive a direct connection to another peer after obtaining the information it needs to do so ip address port etc.. from the tracker

831669
ethernet	wireless
my setup is as following my main isp router dual band d-link on 10.0.0.x is serving wireless clients around the house and also connected via ethernet to a linksys e300 second router on 192.168.1.x that is connected via ethernet to my roku and also has wireless turned on

831673
udp	tcp
the client can use two protocols to share information with peers tcp or utp over udp

831679
ethernet	wireless
the mba connects the tc wireless while the pc connects to the mba with ethernet cable

831748
google-chrome	firefox
after you open developer tools in firefox and google-chrome the network tab will list all the elements of the web page

831764
ethernet	wireless
the way to bridge ethernet frames across an 802.11 link is to use a relatively obscure optional provision of 802.11 known as wds wireless distribution system

831773
ssl	https
as for 107.161.13.237 alone - this would be access by http and not https so no ssl tls is involved and no certificates are available and can be checked

831774
cpu	processors
resource monitor also shows high cpu on each processors but nothing in the process list

831811
gentoo	linux

831821
joystick	keyboard	mouse	joystick	mouse	keyboard
there is no wlan or any other network connection only keyboard cable mouse bluetooth but turned off overnight monitor and joystick

831824
ssd	sata
and then you still would have to rewire a few things in order to get both sata connector and power to your ssd

831824
ssd	sata
this makes replacing the internal sata drive with a ssd probably the best choice because it requires no modifications allows relative cheap ssds about eur 100 for 240gb at the moment of writing and gives best performance no ancient pata modes just ahci sata2

831855
bluestacks	android-emulator

dreamhost servers run debian linux which uses the gnu version of date

832169
stdout	stderr
what you have pasted is not command standard output stdout but error output of the command stderr

832169
stdout	stderr
when you add output_file to command you are only redirecting stdout to that file not stderr

832169
stdout	stderr
it will output stdout to log.log and stderr to second file called error.log if you want to separate them

832175
versioning	upgrade
if windows was upgrade from a previous versioning you should have windows.old folder it sometimes gets removed if you run disk cleanup

832175

disk	ram
i m currently reading about how the computer works specifically how the cpu ram hard disk drive work together simultaneously

832199
disk	ram
how does the hard disk drive transfer data or load the data to ram

832200
disk	ram
the cpu or more correctly the software running on the cpu initiates a transfer from the hard disk by issuing for example a sata read dma command to a specified location in ram and is asynchronously later signalled when the transfer is complete

832200
disk	ram
how does the hard disk drive transfer data or load the data to ram

832200
disk	ram
as said above by issuing a request to the hard disk to transfer a specific sector or range of sectors from the hard disk into ram virtually always these days using dma

832209

832717
snmp	mib
however when i try to set the community string in etc snmp snmpd.conf it doesn t walk the mib tree

832739
stdout	stderr
this is the most simple way to redirect stdout and stderr into one variable

832739
stdout	stderr
it s getting more complicated if you want to catch stdout and stderr separately

832739
stdout	stderr
i think the only straight-forward way is to redirect stdout stderr to separate files

832757
firefox	safari
i dropped xmarks as it is unreliable in firefox and safari

832763
opensuse	linux
i ve had some corruption so bad that mac os x itself can t recover anything off the hard drive and in that case i use a linux distribution in my case opensuse to yank the data

stdout	stderr	jobs	cron
if you would like to not receive messages from individual cron jobs you can redirect output at the end of each line in your crontab-- for just stdout you ll still get stderr messages in the mailbox or to redirect everything to the bit bucket

mouse	keyboard
i currently have it plugged into the front usb ports there are some back ones but i mostly use those for keyboard mouse and just sort of hanging there it s an ipod shuffle and the charger cord is really short to do anything else with so i just let the ipod shuffle hang from it since it seems light enough and the cord seems strong enough for it

833047

with 16gb of ram you probably have a lot of it free for disk caching

the other ms-office suite programs onenote powerpoint and excel are not affect by this problem and open right away and without complaint

833144
filtering	grouping
on the home tab in the find grouping click filtering e-mail and then click flagged

833158
folder	directory
browsing the web can cause can cause disk access for loading fonts but most likely the disk activity is related to recording the browsing history authenticating and updating cookies certificates and writing a copy of downloaded web content firefox maintains a directory named cache and internet explorer also has a folder for saving webpages images and media content named temporary internet files

the name appears correctly in cmd when i type dir but when i look for the folder in windows explorer i always see the name public desktop instead of the actual folder name

833251
post	get
to get access to tmp created in your pre you need to use --nochroot option in the post section

833271
filesystems	ntfs
you can t share a normal ntfs volume with two windows computers - you need a cluster aware filesystems to do that

833272
folder	directory
i have 1 folder as a main directory 12 folder subs and then a ton of folder in each of the 12 folder

833292
spaces	delimiter

a video game may tax your ram gpu and cpu but once it has loaded they generally don t do hardly any disk io

833467
ubuntu	linux
i have read so many horror stories that i am poised to hit the install button on my live usb version of ubuntu - all partitioned up and ready to roll data backups - but if after the dual boot install i am unable to boot my computer or boot to linux would i find the following safety precaution worthwhile

833494
disk	ram
the modern disk controller that is embedded in a sata disk drive has its own cpu aka microcontroller ram and flash and executes its own firmware to perform its functions

833520
spaces	delimiter
but in google sheets you can use the split function to split a string of tags delimiter by spaces commas or whatever you want into several other cells and i m sure even excel has a function that can search a cell for a tag

833544
udp	tcp
note that with tcp and udp sessions there are two ports

833548

so for every item in list a i require excel to run through the whole list b and the output could range from no output to max 3 output

833667
folder	directory
now their need is when user login to sftp server either via winscp or some other client they should be able to see only their own folder in home directory the other folder should not be visible to them

833667

since you said you re using apache and nginx web cache varnish does not support ssl i found these pages talking about the same matter although they are directed at beast

833816
disk	ram
i ve ruled out ram and hard disk problems so i figure it s either the cpu or gpu

833824
3des	aes	rsa	3des	rsa	aes
tl-dr if your ssl3-only clients don t negotiate ecc ciphers and most very old clients probably don t although nobbled newer ones may and all your tls1+ clients do which is much less certain and assuming the common case of an rsa cert privatekey you could enable ecdhe-rsa- 3des or aes -cbc but disable dhe-rsa-anything-cbc and rsa-anything-cbc

833829
cpu	processors
if still hot then finally take apart the laptop and remove the heat-sink for the cpu then re-do the heat-paste on the processors

opera	google-chrome
i tried using google-chrome opera and internet explorer and i can t get online and there is no connection problem being detected

833952
integer	fractions
date time fields are stored as an integer day number + fractions of day ie days_since_31dec1899 + seconds_since_ midnight 86400 so you don t need to split the date and time in order to perform time-shifting

833958
hide	show
it has a lot of features including save directly to folder hotkeys to start stop recording hide show mouse etc

833960
sudoers	passwd
use shellshock to send an echo to etc passwd or sudoers but i don t know how difficult it would be to remove a comment

sorting	grouping
if you are sorting by name for example and you see that the file and folder names are sorted by name but in reverse order descending and all the folders are grouping together and displayed at the bottom of the list then just click on the name column header to restore sorting to ascending

834055
sorting	grouping
open windows explorer and navigate to the folder you want to change the sorting grouping of files and folders

sudo	passwd
another option is to configure sudo to allow this action either with or without asking for the executing user s passwd

it can convert from to mp3 mp3 mono mp4 fs ws ogg wav aac and many others

wan	lan
the reason you can t reach the modem is because the ip address of the modem is on the same network as your lan but isn t connected to the lan its connected to the wan

834872
wan	lan
however if they are different networks they packet will always get sent to the default gateway the router which will then send it out the wan port since it not destined for any of the devices on the lan

835085

i could just change the folder name back to git what it was before but it is an issue i want to solve because other people downloading my repository may not want to rework their entire filesystem so that they have no spaces in their directory

daytime protocol rfc 867 tcp or udp port 13 is legacy at this point and rarely seen in the wild

835090
udp	tcp
the same can be said for time protocol rfc 868 tcp or udp port 37

835090
daemons	systemd
the ntp daemons process avoids time discontinuities by skewing slowing down or speeding up the systemd s clock until it is correct this can be important for systemd that runs processes on a schedule so events don t repeat and are not missed

mouse	keyboard
here are my findings for pure touch navigation - no keyboard no mouse

835123
mp4	h.264
you upload a gif the site converts it to mp4 h.264 and then uses html5 to loop the video like a gif

835123
mp4	h.264
if your goal is create gifv equivalent files on your home computer for your usage just use a video converter like handbrake to convert to mp4 with h.264 encoding

835145
mouse	keyboard
if there are too many videos i would recommend using some type of automation software to perform the mouse and keyboard actions for you

ubuntu	debian
i m installing debian 7 from an ubuntu server

mouse	keyboard
also the mouse and keyboard are wired usb

835299
bluetooth	usb
i remember on my old pc i had a usb bluetooth adapter that i could plug in to my pc s usb port and the pc was then able to do bluetooth magics with other bluetooth-enabled devices

835299
bluetooth	usb
however that adapter no longer works broken and i ve been to dick smith jb harvey norman coles k-mart etc and nobody sells anything useful anymore so now i m wondering if i can plug my phone into the pc s usb port and use the phone as an adapter for bluetooth thus enabling the pc to have above said bluetooth magics

835303

stdout	stderr
both stdout and stderr

835400
stdout	stderr
if your process support to be placed in the background and particularly doesn t hang when stdout and stderr are unwritable closed you can put it in the background before logging out with control z and bg then detach it from your shell with the disown builtin

835401
switching	screens
other benefits of screens are window management so you can switching to other shells while your command is running without needing a new ssh connection and it allows your command to remain in the foreground whether in the current session or a later one

835474
stdout	stderr
but the command will redirect the output stdout stderr afaik of the program into a file nohup.out making it somehow annoying sometimes like generating a huge log file so you may want to make your own redirection or redirect it to dev null if you want

835476
bmp	png
ms paint cannot save file in png or jpg format but can save bmp

ubuntu	debian
after losing a day i thought if it would be possible to preload the debian installer onto the hard disk from an another computer that has windows on it or through an old ubuntu livecd but the guides i found only contemplate a drive that has already a bootloader on it or through partitioning

835590
subnet	vlan
assuming these computers are on the same subnet as the others i would create a vlan for these

835873
mouse	keyboard
one problem is x normally expects the server to also be where the user is sitting operating from so it expects the keyboard and mouse to also connected to the server

mouse	keyboard
the evdev linux or possibly xinput2 input drivers might might offer a means to utilize a remote keyboard and mouse i m not sure

835873
xfce	gnome	xfce	kde	kde	gnome
consult your distributions documentation for the window manager you are using kde gnome xfce etc.

then make sure you connect a lan cable from any lan port on the first router to any lan port on the 2nd if you used the wan on the 2nd then you will get double nat d and need to specify any port forwards for any clients on the 2nd router on both the first and 2nd router before they would work

838320
mouse	keyboard
i would try again with ubuntu text mode sometimes works better and if the keyboard and mouse are not working then use an external keyboard and mouse plugged into the usb port

838320

usually if you cannot boot an ubuntu live cd with standard hardware keyboard and mouse then you may have developed a hardware problem along the way

838331

838526
pop-up	dialog
go to file menu click return data to ms office excel an import data dialog will pop-up

838543

838560
sudo	passwd	sudoers	passwd

838628
folder	directory
the local user wcsadmin has default umask and can create files and what s more important directory in a shared folder ftp

838698
disk	ram
what is in ram is not like what is stored in the file system on your hard disk all nicely arranged in self-contained files and directories

838738
cpu	processors
i noticed that the clock speed of the cpu to be higher than most of the i7 haswell processors which are about 2ghz

838749
disk	ram
however the reference above instructs on how to mount clonezilla on the empty new large disk boot from it thanks to clonezilla then load all of clonezilla into ram so that disk space on the new medium can be freed and used to clone the smaller disk onto the larger one in the meantime enlarging the partitions as you wish

838750

is there a difference in transmitting ssl supported requests via the native gateway or thru a socks proxy

838887
disk	ram
that way if system ram gets crushed with lots of processes begging for ram and being swapping out the load is distributed across all disk devices

838887
disk	ram
i assume the linux kernel is smart about swapout freeing some ram by taking pages out and putting them on disc and does it in batches to optimize for a more sequential writes to disk

838887
disk	ram
linux loves more ram for caching i o and virtualisation hates disk i o

838887
disk	ram
swapping should leave some room in ram to cache disk i o but too much swapping will cause processes to be swapped out too soon and hurt general multitasking

838887
disk	ram
linux and windows can improve i o performance by using the ram to cache i o operations while the ssd or hdd disk devices are still busy catching up

838887
ubuntu	centos
ubuntu 14.04 or centos 7 should offer more recent kernels

840162
portrait	landscape
portrait - printer most printers do their actual printing in portrait wide format printers allow you to actually feed the paper in landscape

840162
portrait	landscape
on a regular printer a landscape page is just mapped sideways onto a portrait page for printing purposes

840162
portrait	landscape
landscape vs portrait - excel in excel the margin settings are not linked to the orientation setting at least in the 2007 version

840162
portrait	landscape
if you set the margins or use default margins for a portrait layout and then select landscape the margins don t automatically reverse orientation

essentially an intel processors core is functionally similar to a amd module - it runs two threads and has a single fpu and a single core which does hyperthreading

840678
nehalem	hyperthreading	processors	hyperthreading
in addition most modern intel processors since nehalem and up to and including haswell have a feature called hyperthreading ht which further increases the amount of work each core can do by presenting two logical cores to the operating system per physical core to further increase performance with heavily threaded workloads

exif	xmp
therefore it seems to me that the best way of keeping my comments when i upload the pictures to flickr is to somehow mirror the exif comments to the xmp description tag

840895
exif	xmp
could someone perhaps give me a hint on how to use the exiftool to copy the exif comments to xmp description

840898

wav	ogg
i have encountered the same problem with only difference that i needed to process large number of ogg vorbis wav files

841102
wav	ogg
audacity could not open many of them currently audacity lacks support for ogg vorbis wav files with codec id 6771 not to mention it cannot batch process files recursively its apply chain feature limited to files in single directory

841102
wav	ogg
i ended up writing ogg_wav script to convert ogg vorbis wav to more usable format

841102
wav	ogg
it can convert ogg vorbis wav to uncompressed wav -c option or extract primary ogg stream -e option the default if no options provided among other things

841102
wav	ogg
to convert ogg vorbis wav to ogg it is possible to specify more than 1 file or use shell globbing like

841102
wav	ogg
this is the command to convert ogg vorbis wav to uncomressed wav recursively remove -d option if you would like to keep backup of original wav files by changing .wav extension to .bak

841102
wav	ogg
the script will skip wav files with no ogg stream inside so it can be used even you have uncompressed wav and ogg vorbis wav in the same folder

packets	pcap
i am trying to use pcap to modify the packets before sending it out

841545
packets	pcap
before it sends out syn-ack for incoming syn packets i am trying to modify the syn-ack using pcap

841545
packets	pcap
but there are two packets sent out 1 original syn-ack packets generated by os 2 pcap modified packets

841545
packets	pcap
i know this is not surprising as os sends a copy of the packets to pcap for processing and original packets is sent out separately

841545
packets	pcap
when i dropped the outgoing syn-ack packets generated by os using iptables i could not even receive the syn-ack in the pcap

841545
packets	pcap
my question is is it possible to drop the original syn-ack packets and only send out the pcap modified packets

udp	tcp
it doesn t use tcp or udp protocols that have a port so there s no port

841705
icmp	tcp
icmp is a kind of layer 3.5 and there is no layer 4 because there is no tcp

841705
udp	tcp
when in networking people say port they mean tcp port or udp port

841705
udp	tcp
no tcp or udp then no port

841705

843612
cpu	processors
one of the reasons i want to do this is that windows usually distributes the cpu load evenly over all processors but when you run a cpu-heavy single-thread process it often runs significantly slower than it could simply because 20 of the core it runs on is already occupied by other processes and windows seems incapable of moving those processes to other cores at runtime effectively

843612

if it is possible to sync files between an imanage folder and a windows directory it would be helpful as then i could just work from the windows folder when dealing with downloading or uploading documents

843712

if i am mistaken and there is actually a way to download upload directly to from an imanage document folder perhaps with a browser extension plug-in that interfaces upload browse buttons on websites with imanage instead of or in addition to windows directory

843751
sudo	passwd
you should also make sure that php scripts are owned by a user that cannot get administrative rights can t sudo without passwd and that several different sites hosted on one server have their script files be owned by different users so in case one gets compromised the others are still somewhat safe

this can be done see for instance a conversion from ext3 ext4 to btrfs but since it s complex and rarely done most storage devices are formatted once with one filesystems and keep using it for the rest of its life there s not much incentive to implement it and test it which is somewhat important when dealing with your user s data

subnet	packets
in fact on a router you cannot put multiple routed interfaces on the same subnet - because a routers function is to move packets between layer-3 subnet

844839
subnet	packets
it knows that if an ip is not on my subnet i need to send the packets to this gateway address to get out thus since all devices process top-down through the osi-model the computer will do an internal routing lookup first layer-3 to decide wither a device is within its subnet

it would also need to be written specifically for each codec while altering a decompressed frame allows existing encoder and decoder libraries to be used as well as recompressing in a different format

846007
h.264	h.265
it might also work tto recompress using a better codec likely dirac h.264 or h.265 depending on input format to attempt to limit the loss of quality without a huge increase in file size

essentially a well-implemented e-mail client configured to use starttls should simply fail if it doesn t manage to use starttls and establish this ssl tls connection in the same way as it should fail if it doesn t manage to establish the ssl tls connection first for smtps

846286

846334
wan	lan
also - you have to realize that routers are devices with at least two ip addresses - one for wan side one for lan side

846334
wan	lan
notice how i matched router 2 and 3 wan and lan addresses - it is for better readability

846337
temp	corrupt
it needs to be through temp file and then using rm mv otherwise the file and filename get corrupt

846346
ubuntu	linux
i am using lxc linux containers to host an http server within a virtualbox setup but the simple lxc specific bridge i created does not have an ip address so it cannot be reached even in the ubuntu os running on virtualbox

846354
truecrypt	umount
i noticed dropbox only syncs when i umount the volume s file so i think truecrypt only updates the file when it s umount as well

subnet	vlan
setup acl on each vlan to deny access to all other 4 vlans ip subnet and allow others

846443
gif	png
a primary motivation for the png format was to create a replacement for gif that was not only free but also an improvement over it in essentially all respects

846443
tiff	png	gif	png
as a result png compression is completely lossless - that is the original image data can be reconstructed exactly bit for bit - just as in gif and most forms of tiff

846447

the tool restored my data in firefox but opera lose all data forever

846484

at first i had the tv closer because the wired keyboard would only extend to the length of the keyboard wire but eventually i bought an all-in-one wireless keyboard with a laptop style mouse build into the keyboard

846602
switching	screens
you have to hook it up to another screens and hopefully you have a screens that is capable to read the setting - where the display appears again in order to switching the settings back to default

846602
mouse	keyboard
there is also an on-screen keyboard within the ease of access thus you only need your mouse for small tasks

to ensure that was the case i replaced the final line of the inner script with gnome-terminal -c sudo . nwn and sure enough it runs flawlessly

846641
stdout	stderr
fetch in the background and discard both the stdout and stderr

846641
stdout	stderr
the first part redirects the stdout that is curl s output to dev null more on this ahead and redirects the stderr to the stdout which was just redirected to dev null so everything will be sent to dev null

846641
stdout	stderr
the is used on the right side to distinguish stdout 1 or stderr 2 from files named 1 or 2

846641

when to use stderr instead of stdout

846902
hash	md5
it seems likely that the actual disk identifier taking the place of the name in the specification is just 64 bits converted into a 128 bits uuid according to the specification by prepending the uuid of whatever namespace apple is using for volume identifiers and then applying an md5 hash

846908
post	get
can you also use the dvi out on the mainboard to connect the monitor without the pcie graphics card installed and confirm that you don t get post while using dvi

847287
subnet	packets
subnet b hosts can send packets to any host that has an ip address of 192.168.2.0 through 192.168.2.255 assuming our 24 bit mask

847287
subnet	packets
when the host 192.168.2.3 tries to talk to host 192.168.1.3 it would send the traffic to the router which would route the packets between the two subnet

847313
ssd	sata

847344
box	skydrive
notable error events are a whole bunch of registry database corruption some with usrclass.dat we can see where skydrive took a pitch with its kernelbase.dll event 1000 and also the this app does not support the contract specified or is not installed. i got with certain windows 8 apps when they did not start and gave me a dialog box with an error event 5973

847352
vpn	lan
the games we re playing are using broadcast packets to locate the servers the problem is that even though the broadcasts are sent to the vpn the router isn t getting them from the clients to the hosts inside the lan on the remote site

847352
vpn	lan
the inverse is also true broadcasts from the remote lan are not reaching the vpn clients

847352

847361
put	get
it s likely i ll just put up with this if it meant completely reformatting and re-installing everything-- i can get around heavily threaded accesses for the time being

847367
mouse	keyboard
i suppose if you wanted to measure absolute time from input to display you could also make sure your mouse or keyboard is visible next to your monitors and take a video and measure the time between your physical action and its effect on the screens

847383
versioning	upgrade
since i don t see a way to upgrade the bios i m stuck with this a08 versioning latest is a12 but i don t know if they fixed such issues in-between

the guests i ve tried were ubuntu 14.04 and debian 7 using bridged and nat networking

847502
udp	tcp	icmp	udp	icmp	tcp
ping still works because it uses icmp not tcp - and dns lookups should still work because they largely use udp instead of tcp

847590
google-chrome	firefox
please don t suggest extensions like google-chrome s smoothscroll as they do not work when javascripts are disabled on a web page i use this for security reasons like the noscrpit extension in firefox

847606
filesystems	ntfs
in ntfs as in unix filesystems the same file can be in two directories - this is called a hardlink

847672
versioning	upgrade
i cannot confirm whether the versioning upgrade was the key step or whether the macports screen is somehow configured differently

847688
google-chrome	firefox	opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome
the easiest way to create one is to open your favorite webbrowser i know opera and internet explorer both support this but firefox and google-chrome should too and drag and drop the url to your desktop or other place on your harddrive

847857
wav	aiff	wav	flac	flac	wma	flac	aiff
i understand that when converting between audio formats where no stream encoding is involved like when converting between wav pcm aiff flac alac wma lossless and etc the process is usually lossless because the pcm audio stream is just being copied to the new container

847857
wav	flac
i understand that when converting between formats like the previously listed wav pcm alac flac and etc to a format that doesn t support the audio stream s encoding the conversion should involve re-encoding

847857
mp3	ogg
for example when converting to formats like mp3 mp4 aac ogg vorbis wma lossy and etc the source audio stream is being re-encoded and as such data is being discarded

847857
wav	flac	mp3	wav	mp3	flac
what i can t wrap my head around is why converting from mp3 to wav pcm is lossless or alac flac etc

847860
mp3	wav
so you are saying that if you transcode an mp3 to wav that it s lossless

847860
mp3	wav
wav is an uncrompressed loseless format mp3 is a lossy format

filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	fat
ntfs fat and other filesystems reside above truecrypt in the i o stack

848306
pull	push
if you can get in via something like rsync you can backup the current version of the files first by doing an rsync pull then push an empty file back up to overwrite it

848306
profiling	debugging
once you are back in and running with an empty profiling do the following to debugging

848310

you would then need to move that folder into the program files folder giving the mysql root directory a full path of c program files mysql-5.6.22-win32

let me also reemphasize that this problem only happens on this one computer running osx yosemite

848491
robocopy	xcopy
xcopy is actually deprecated now in favour of robocopy which is not the scope of this answer but basically you need a recursive copy command that can copy the entire content robocopy also offers resumption and retrying partially copied files which would help you

i have certain keys and keystrokes used to change the volume control and switch desktops in the host os debian linux and it is annoying to loose those functions when i am using a guest os windows 7 in this case

848772
folder	directory
to delete entire files of the folder after you entered the directory using the command mentioned in step 1 - use the following command

848780
temp	junction
for example i created a junction point d temp for c users user appdata local google chrome user data but after checking i see that files are being written to both directories instead of the expected d temp

848783
put	get
you want to get both the description and the device id at the same time comma is reserved so you have to esacpe it with a caret and since the output has spaces in it you have to include multiple outputs in the if and put it in quotes

848793
macbook	bootcamp
a user has the most recent macbook pro we ve installed mac os x and then bootcamp and windows 8.1 professional and enabled bitlocker which obviously re-arranged the windows partitions

848805
cpu	processors
according to task manager on ubuntu 14.04 uploading file using firefox 34.0 to google drive takes more than 6 times more cpu power that uploading it to adrive 12 baseline 50 for goggle 18 for adrive 38 vs 6 - it is probably even worse as google drive as my processors is dual-core and google is using one entirely and wants more what results in laggy firefox

848821
versioning	upgrade
i recently upgrade firefox to versioning 34 expecting to see the new hello webrtc feature that i read about on omg

848844

i have problems understanding the relationship between ldap and kerberos conceptually

848940
kerberos	ldap
i understand ldap as a directory service and kerberos as an authentication service

848940
kerberos	ldap
if yes does it mean the ldap server through an interface like phpldapadmin will set groups and users accordingly in kerberos server

848940
kerberos	ldap
i m particularly confused cause i see the connection between ldap and kerberos in both documentations

848940
kerberos	ldap
ldap talks about delegating authentication to kerberos here and kerberos talks about having ldap as a backend here

848943

dns	spf
the dns servers in charge of domain.com need an spf record added to them to allow verify the smtp server s your client is using to send as an email user on that domain

849014
dns	spf
for example using as the spf record would allow any smtp server that has a valid mx record for the domain in the dns server and deny all others

849024
move	drag
even for just relative references formulas that were once able to be drag filled would now break dragging down a column should move a reference left a column but that s not what happens

kerberos	ldap
yes it can definitely be confusing because you can use kerberos to authenticate for ldap and you can also have kerberos use ldap as a backend

849183
kerberos	ldap
i can only talk about ldap using kerberos for its authentication since i have no experience with it the other way around

849183
kerberos	ldap
as i understand it the client requests a tgt from the kerberos server for the ldap server using the service principal name of ldap hostname domain.name or similar

849183
kerberos	ldap
this is if you are using ldap as a backend for kerberos i imagine

849183
kerberos	ldap
you of course do not have to use ldap as a back-end for kerberos

849183
kerberos	ldap
as an aside it is possible to use a simple bind with ldap send the password to the ldap server which then passes the password along to another authentication source like kerberos

the dongle will do the bluetooth pairing for you to the keyboard mouse as soon as the dongle is powered up

thus the keyboard and mouse can be linked either using this default pairing or you can use those bluetooth devices on the same or other computers pairing directly with bluetooth

hash	md5
and it operates on a similar philosophy as my ad-hoc processâ store the checksums in a databaseâ but it takes it a step further but creating an md5 checksum of md5 checksums which is known as a hash tree or merkle tree

849853
hash	md5
those 5 files in ace audit manager would then get anotherâ letâ s call it â œparentâ â checksum that is a hash generated from the 5 md5 checksums of each file

in general the way you need to look at md5 checksums and related integrity hash is unless they are not connected to some non-direct storage for the md5 hash themselves they can be corrupted

hash	md5
as currently noted at the collision attack wikipedia article you link to in 2007 a chosen-prefix collision attack was found against md5 and the attacker can choose two arbitrarily different documents and then append different calculated values that result in the whole documents having an equal hash value. thus even if the md5 is provided securely and an attacker can t modify it an attacker still can use a chosen-prefix collision attack with a chosen-prefix containing malware which means md5 is not secure for crypto purposes

there is apparently a bug in the tg585 series handling of igmp that manifests itself as upnp not working between devices on the ethernet side of its bridge and the wireless side

852173
osx	yosemite
this turned out to be an unnecessary kernel lock in osx that was addressed sometime in the os x yosemite time frame

852203
filesystems	hfs
it loops through the entries in etc locate.rc filesystems on 10.6 at least this defaults to just hfs if unset

852215
sunos	aix
i ve last seen implementations of pure vi on proprietary unixes like sunos hp-ux aix

852220
bash	subshell
and bash -c does essentially the same thing just with a subshell thrown in to make it even weirder

852242
folder	directory
if you want to have shared gnupg home directory the windows partition is always mounted an easy convenient and general solution would be to symlink the windows gnupg folder into your home directory

852242

852269
apache	nginx
i just switched from apache to nginx and so far i ve been pretty happy

subtract	add
it looks like for each response scenario you need to model exactly when each activity happens relative to the workweek workday and lunch and add and subtract relevant times

852282
ubuntu	linux
say i were to install ubuntu linux onto a virtual machine or the other way around installing it to dual boot and keep it s files on it s own partition

852287
google-chrome	firefox
this message started coming up again and without really thinking or taking any time to investigate i would just restart google-chrome consider switching back to firefox and carry on

mp3	wav
i have to often listen to some wav sound effects files to check that they sound good but in between i like listening to music mp3 files

852337
kerberos	ldap
for a system administrator the relationship between ldap and kerberos could be as simple as a machine using both of them

852337
kerberos	ldap
for instance if it is a remote machine only requiring access via ssh ldap still provides the same info as everywhere else but kerberos only needs a few lines in the ssh configuration files

852450
freebsd	linux
lxc is similar to other os-level virtualization technologies on linux such as openvz and linux-vserver as well as those on other operating systems such as freebsd jails

852525
gentoo	ubuntu
i m trying to install gentoo and instead of using one of the bootable minimal install cds provided by gentoo i m using a chroot in ubuntu

852525

even though i ve figured out how to compile my own kernel in ubuntu i m still a major linux newbie

where do i get it for mint and debian

852580
nehalem	hyperthreading	processors	hyperthreading
nehalem processors were manufactured on a 45nm process and reintroduced the hyperthreading feature first seen on the pentium 4 but dropped in the core 2 series which enables each processors core to concurrently run multiple threads increasing performance with heavily-threaded tasks

852584
ubuntu	debian
however as you noticed the proprietary oracle jre is not available in the debian or ubuntu repositories

852584
debian	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	linux
oracle revoked the ability for linux distributions to redistribute java packages in 2011 see ubuntu s and debian s notifications

852584
ubuntu	debian
these both can be installed from the debian and ubuntu repositories

852584
debian	mint
for debian and mint you would want the non-rpm packages

852584
ubuntu	debian
if you want to stick to using packages from the debian ubuntu repositories i would recommend checking that you have the latest openjdk-7-jre package installed

852584
ubuntu	debian
debian and ubuntu both show the latest version of this package as 7u71 which is on par with the current latest release of the oracle runtime

filesystems	ntfs
an open-source fuse implementation of the ntfs filesystems commonly used to access ntfs volumes on linux systems

852619
subnet	packets
the way dhcp works is it sends a udp packets to the broadcast address for the subnet so as long as the server and clients are on the same subnet it should just work.

852627
tunnel	vpn
i believe this setting causes all incoming traffic all ports to be excluded from vpn tunnel while still ensuring that my outgoing is through the vpn

852628
disk	ram
i think the problem is with the transfer of archives from ram to the disk because it asks me to send memory.dmp to microsoft

852628
ubuntu	linux
the problem started after i configured dual-boot with ubuntu 14.04 and turned off windows hybrid-shutdown to access ntfs archives from linux

852686
xfce	cinnamon
you might be able to install gnome-shell and then your method may work and i d suggest using a solution for a different desktop environment or at least window manager like cinnamon or xfce after installing their linked answers still look good

852743
udp	tcp
it will ne truncated at firts using udp the it willbe over tcp

852769
single-quotes	double-quotes
one thing to point out is that powershell treats strings with variables included differently based on whether it is wrapped in single-quotes or double-quotes

852787
folder	directory
double click on this device choose to install drivers from a local directory and point it to your windows 7 backup driverstore folder as mentioned earlier

852802

a warning will pop-up confirm the change by clicking remove then click on ok to close the dialog box

852809

the problem is that xorg-x11-drv-r128 doesn t have a new versioning in fedora 21 but its dependency xorg-x11-server-xorg is going to be upgrade to an incompatible versioning

852817

repo	egit
now egit in eclipse recognizes mydomain.me git as a git repo but says it contains no projects although i added all files from srv http to it

852915
filesystems	ntfs
the type of filesystems is ntfs can not lock current drive

852919
base	fractions
using the powerful equation tools poorly documented but see my e-book writing mathematical expressions you can construct an expression with a base character and a diacritic placed above it much like you can use exponents fractions integrals etc

853002
ubuntu	debian
after 1 year working on ubuntu and problems with ubuntu on virtualbox i decide to moved to debian i know that ubuntu is son of debian but debian don t make a problem with installation

853022
nginx	lighttpd
you can use winsw a free as in both freedom and beer utility to run lighttpd or any other program nginx php-cgi etc as a service

853063
vmware	virtualbox
another alternative assuming you have the appropriate legal license key is to run this under vmware workstation or try it on virtualbox if you dare

853063
ubuntu	linux
although it has been awhile since i used it wine under linux ubuntu might also be an alternative to run your older applications

853094
screens	tablet
the instruction in the link explain how to map the whole tablet to the screens with distortion

853113
versioning	upgrade
to resolve the case you can try to install another package of mysql built on lower versioning of rpm or upgrade the rpm package to higher versioning in your machine

853172
mouse	keyboard
however not all was for naught during all that digging into the rdp protocol i looked at the remotefx usb redirection - and that looked like a dead-end since basic input devices such as mouse keyboard printer are explicitly blocked from the usb redirection mechanism

853192

try a repair shop or something see if they have any old machines that can run xp for you or buy an upgrade versioning of windows 7 to run xp mode

853216
pop-up	dialog
when i click on it from there it tries to read it and then pop-up a dialog box insert a disc

853247
ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	linux
another guess was that in the manual it only lists ubuntu 12.04 as being supported while my operating system linux mint 17 xfce is based off of ubuntu 14.04

853290
hotmail	outlook.com
it would seem that i forgot to logout of my hotmail account on outlook.com aka login.live.com on a comptuer at school

i found that i needed to move the lan connection ahead of the junos vpn connection from control panel network and internet network connections

853408
wan	lan
i always connect the secondary router s wan port into one of the main router s lan ports or use the secondary router s wifi in client mode and connect to the main router via wifi like any other client device

853429
folder	directory
you didn t say how you were mounting this directory but since you mentioned virtualbox i m assuming that this is a shared folder between the host system and the virtual machine

853439
ubuntu	linux
solutions for os x are preferred but linux ubuntu is ok too

853466
folder	dir
type dir x to list all folder including the alternative path

i can not get to the internet using internet explorer google-chrome or firefox

853559
folder	directory
i have shared a folder in my user directory called shared

853560
chown	chmod
a lot of people just tell me to use chmod or chown but that is not what i want to do because it screws up the existing permissions on the drive

853561
mouse	keyboard
doing it with a keyboard would be longer than doing it with the mouse

853586
post	get
a hard drive failure wouldn t cause these kinds of boot-up issues as the system should be able to get through post just not load the os

853605

filesystems	ntfs
you can use linux to create an ntfs filesystems on it if you want but windows will never be able to see it

853735
folder	directory
initially i just need a list of old folder directory to be reviewed by others to ok deletion

853749
folder	directory
the following code assumes that you have one file in each folder in layer3 and your history does not contain anything other than directory

853757

i am able to connect and the keyboard works just fine but the mouse is not visible or usable in the remote system

853766
concave	convex
an inflection point is where a curves changes curvature sign it goes from concave to convex or viceversa

853771
stdout	stderr
linux no afaik apps not started from a terminal will not necessarily have their stdout and stderr directed anywhere useful

853771
stdout	stderr
not all apps write debugging logging to stdout or stderr

853792
filesystems	ntfs
i have tried both ntfs and fat32 filesystems but neither succeed

853807
sudo	passwd
obviously i do not want to include the sudo passwd in the script

853808
sudo	passwd
this file controls who is allowed to run what commands using sudo and whether they need to enter a passwd

853849

if i plug an ethernet cable in it works fine but its not giving me any options for connecting wireless

he said the post is locked but i m so fresh to stack exchange that i don t get why it s locked but i can still post this as an answer

853861
vlan	packets	subnet	packets	subnet	vlan
this kind of packets as it requires to be sent to the ethernet address of the machine when it is off so not being able to query it over arp or more commonly to the broadcast address could only be sent from the same subnet vlan as the machine to wake except if the router uses a static mac address for the ip associated to the machine

853861
debian	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	linux
from a linux shell you can use the wakeonlan command on debian ubuntu you can install with apt-get install wakeonlan specifying the mac address of the machine to wake as parameter

853937

right click image and select size and position. select new height and width percentages to get the aspect and size you want

853939
ubuntu	linux
is there a way to have a kali linux for mac ubuntu for windows and the rest of the empty space for personal use

853951
udp	tcp
first realize that pptp is a trickier case than run-of-the-mill port forwarding because it doesn t just use a port number of well-known transport-layer protocols tcp or udp it also uses a whole other transport layer protocol called gre ip protocol number 47

853951
wan	lan
so when testing port mapping it s a good idea to test from a machine that s on the wan side of your nat gateway not something on the lan side

853978
disk	ram
my problem is that even with that mechanism in place sometimes my .net application or the ffmpeg subprocess still get killed when windows 8.1 freaks out about low ram because obviously my application is using the most ram when it has a huge backlog of video data to write to disk

853983
ftp	smb
ftp smb ssh and everything else keeps running normally except that loginwindow is pegged at 100 cpu usage

853987
disk	ram
i would say my cpu is slightly busier but if all else is equal ram cache can this decrease of speed all because the disk is full

853999
disk	ram
virtual memory is pretty much the foundation of how modern operating systems allocate resources so it s all about having things in ram that are in use and moving stuff in and out from disk

853999
disk	ram
re-enable the pagefile and increase the ram on your computer to reduce disk thrashing

854008

i am on a linux mint setup so i have access to the debian and ubuntu repos

i tried using bootrepair in a livecd but when i did it made mint bootable but crippled gentoo and arch

854008
gentoo	mint	gentoo	linux
gentoo and linux mint don t show up on the list

854008

edit 2 using the 1-2 punch of os-prober and grub-mkconfig from inside arch i have restored funtionality to linux mint and added gentoo onto the list

854008
gentoo	mint
i now how a full grub menu that boots into arch and mint but not gentoo

854011
disk	ram
paging or lack thereof really only an issue if you are paging a lot so you re low on ram anyway and you are using this specific disk to page

854018
versioning	upgrade
this process is essentially an in-place upgrade to the same versioning of the operating system and preserves installed apps and personal files while replacing system files with fresh copies

854069
google-chrome	firefox
i am running windows 7 and after an unknown amount of uptime firefox google-chrome and other apps are not able to access the filesystem anymore until i restart the apps

854115

at the sudo passwd prompt you should enter the passwd of the current user

854271
ssd	sata
i am currently looking forward to buy a sata multiplier so that i can have multiply ssd drives using a single sata port

854273
ubuntu	debian
if you re on debian or ubuntu calling a2enmod cgi or a2enmod cgid plus a service apache2 restart may already suffice to solve your issue

854299
wan	lan
on the upstairs router disable nat and dhcp service so that it just bridges between wan and lan

854299
wan	lan
if it doesn t have an option for this then take the ethernet cable that s in its wan port the cable that goes downstairs and move it to one of its lan ports all of the lan ports are on the same bridge switch

854369
vagrantfile	hosts	vmware	virtualbox
on os x 10.10 if i start a vagrant based virtualbox vm that is configured with a hosts only network adapter and then destroy that vm and attempt to re-create it with the vmware provider the vboxnet# adapter i used previously is still holding onto the static ip i have declared in the vagrantfile

854375
x86	64bit
i know that on a 64bit version of windows the 64bit programs are stored in program files and 32bit programs are stored in program files x86 to organize the different programs

854375
x86	64bit
however not really a big issue more just curious i have noticed that even when i download a 64bit version of a program like itunes they still by default install to program files x86

854375
x86	64bit
is it because the 64bit programs being stored in program files x86 are not true 64bit programs .

854379
x86	64bit
64bit programs can be installed into and work just fine in either program files or program files x86

854404
ssd	sata
the problem is that the internal connector is ide and you will be unlikely to find an ssd drive that is ide as modern drives are sata

854445
google-chrome	firefox
turn off tabbed browsing google-chrome firefox - is it possible

854451
google-chrome	firefox
the problem computer is a win 7 machine and the error happens with every win 7 user and every browser or at least ie10 google-chrome and firefox

854468
ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	linux
or if your hd really isn t detected at all by the bios it doesn t show up when booting a live linux like ubuntu mint then it could have failed or been unplugged

854490
folder	dir
when i m doing a dir of a folder in cmd and i look at the filesize it difference from the filesize that windows explorer is giving me in the detailed view

854495

i recently switched from cygwin to cmder mostly due to it s awesome interface and all that cool pre-configured stuff

854552
folder	directory
you can also try the following method first specify the location parent directory that you want to see and interact with the dropbox folder desktop for instance

854552
folder	directory
then after linking dropbox with your account click move dropbox location and select the parent directory you want to have the dropbox folder desktop in our particular example

854567
udp	tcp	icmp	udp	icmp	tcp
so i ve noted all details result from the options beginning with -p are used to check the availability about the target host using various protocols such as icmp tcp udp

854569
udp	tcp
the idea is that you want to scan some probably big list of tcp and or udp ports on machines in a set of ip addresses a large subnet say but you don t know in advance which ip addresses in that subnet are even up and running

854569
udp	tcp	icmp	udp	icmp	tcp
there are no ports to send an icmp echo request to because the icmp protocol unlike it s siblings tcp and udp does not have the notion of ports only different types of requests

854585
disk	ram
was able to search through ram find the unwritten data still waiting there copy it and vow to always save to disk often in the future

854593
vmware	virtualbox

854593
vmware	virtualbox
problem i want convert a vm win7-32 in vmware to virtualbox how do it

854598
vmware	virtualbox
create a new vm use tell it to existing an existing and tell virtualbox to the vmdk from the vmware vm

854612
vmware	virtualbox
the problem is you have to uninstall any guest additions in the vmware or virtual pc virtual disk before you try to use it with virtualbox or virtualbox will have various problems

854624
vmware	virtualbox
is it possible to use the same virtual machine in virtualbox and also in vmware without losing any data

854626
ssd	sata
i just bought an intel 520 series ssd and i have 4 sata ports on my dell optiplex 990

854626
ssd	sata
on the datasheet of dell optiplex 990 i can not see which of those 4 ports are sata 2 and which are sata 3 for my ssd

854647
jobs	cron
when i reboot the machine and look into var log syslog i see the jobs being run then cron saying cron info no mta installed discarding output

854653
google-chrome	firefox
and then configure firefox yes firefox because google-chrome is lazy and just relies on os x settings yes i m on os x to use a socks5 proxy to that port and pretty much have all the internet i want

854657
google-chrome	firefox
i don t know about firefox but on google-chrome i use the extension proxy switchysharp take a look on the third screen on that site where i can create rules

854684
debian	linux	debian	mint	ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	linux
to fix this dropbox error in ubuntu linux mint debian open a terminal and run the following commands

854689
ubuntu	linux
the problem is the same in all os i tried windows 7 ubuntu linux 14.04

854690
mouse	keyboard
this seems to be possible because both are supposed to act as ps 2 active multiplexing devices â needed because normal ps 2 only allows one keyboard and one mouse

854728
ethernet	wireless
one thing to note though is a lot of entry level and home networking kit still use 100mbps ethernet connections so devices wired to the router such as a home server nas box etc are a bigger limiting factor than the wireless itself

854755
put	get
you should be able to do the same of course the ath9k-phy0 name may vary and if that works just put the command somewhere where it ll get executed on each boot

854772
putty	winscp
i have tried using aptana winscp putty and filezilla

854785
ffmpeg	handbrake
i couldn t install ffmpeg on ubuntu server 14.10 utopic unicorn so i used handbrake

854791
mouse	keyboard
as you say the root of your problem is not the trackpoint but to avoid frequent arm movements when switching between keyboard and mouse

854794
concave	convex
there are two types the standard flat or slightly convex caps and concave caps which are available as original accessory

854797
mouse	keyboard
i m positive i m holding ctrl down fully and that there is no faultiness with keyboard or mouse

cpu	hyperthreading
i have an intel core i5-2410m cpu with 2 physical cores and enabled hyperthreading and virtualization

855084
cpu	hyperthreading
also your real cpu may be one of the funny intel ones that only has 2 real cores but pretends to have 4 fake cores via hyperthreading

855084
cpu	hyperthreading
an old hyperthreading cpu i used to have would only ever max out at 100 on one fake core since there was only one real cpu core it could never reach 100 on 2 fake cores

856969
tunnel	vpn
after some research i found that it might be worthwhile just to try vpn instead of ssh tunnel

cpu intelâ coreâ i5 quad core processors i5-3470 3.2ghz 6mb cache

857465
disk	ram
i was reading about cpu fetch time where i found that cpu take very less time to access data from ram as compared to accessing hard disk and that ram is present for storing the information and data of executing program

857465
disk	ram
then i wondered about what will happen when we use only hard disk but no ram

857475
disk	ram
the reason all real-world computers use ram is first historical core memory the prototype for ram only semi-volatile greatly predates mass storage like magnetic drum or disk though it did come after punch cards and paper tape -- the former of which dates back in its primitive form to 1801 yes the start of the 19th century

857492
disk	ram
ram exists solely because it s cheaper than on-chip memory and much faster than disk

857492
x86	64bit	cpu	processors
registers - very fast can be operated on by cpu instructions directly generally with no additional latency but usually very small 64bit x86 processors cores have only 16 general-purposes registers for instance with each being able to store a single 64bit number. register sizes are generally small because registers are very expensive per byte

857509
cpu	processors
am3 motherboards don t support am3+ processors but reverse is generally true i have motherboard with am3+ socket running am3 cpu

857517
ubuntu	debian
note this procedure has been tested and developed with ubuntu debian

traceroute	packets
traceroute sends a packets datagram actually several to each router in the path from the source to the destination

859896
traceroute	packets
any or all of those routers may be configured to discard or give low priority to those packets datagrams directed to themselves because a routers job is to forward real traffic not reply to ping and traceroute

859896

to wrap this up traceroute is a path determination tool not a packets loss analysis tool

firefox	safari
i only came across this question today and i hope this is not too late an answer but the short answers are yes to your first question i have found both safari and firefox use a very high amount of cpu during downloads cpu usage can anyone explain as to why this happens

860243
cpu	hyperthreading	cpu	processors	processors	hyperthreading
the short explanation is that your mac contains a multi-core processors - i m guessing a minimum of 2 given that you are running os x 10.8 - which supports hyperthreading and this means that each physical core a physical cpu in itself presents multiple logical cores to os x which it treats as independent logical cpus

860243
cpu	processors
the cpu usage for a process on a multi-core processors multi-threaded os system is an aggregate of the cpu usages for all the threads running inside that process

if you secondary router doesn t give you an option to disable these features you can set the dhcp ip address lease pool to zero length and then be sure to connect a lan port not the wan port of the secondary router to a lan port of the primary router

860548
wan	lan
i bet your secondary router is applying nat-translation between wan 192.168.1.2 and lan 192.168.0.1 24 as this is really common and needed when the wan side of the router is connected to the internet aka its wan ip address is assigned by your isp - that it is not your case

866119
cpu	processors

openvpn now allows you to use a couple of ssl librarries openssl since libressl is said to be api compatible with openssl it may work but i haven t tried it myself and polarssl

stdout	stderr
if the pipeline is initially invoked in a context where stdout and stderr file descriptors are both pointing to the same file struct then there is a simple way to fix both problems

866376
stdout	stderr
this will cause stdout of command1.1 to point to stderr which was not redirected by the pipeline

866376
stdout	stderr
if initially stdout and stderr might be two different file descriptors the above approach can be used by temporarily stashing away the initial stdout in another file descriptor number

866376
stdout	stderr
so unless you absolutely need to keep stdout and stderr from command1.1 separate i would not take that approach

866384
udp	tcp
i discovered that i had mistakenly opened udp port 8100 instead of tcp

when i cut and paste a link with the mouse and paste it into google-chrome s url bar i would like to be able to click somewhere in the google-chrome user interface to send the browser to the site corresponding to the pasted url but unlike firefox google-chrome doesn t seem to have such a button thus requiring me to take my left hand off the mouse and hit enter on the keyboard thus somewhat slowing computer usage besides the fact that such movement is not very ergonomically friendly as it also involves bending the wrist a little bit

my request is to add a column option to process explorer to display cpu affinity

867139
affinity	processors
if you manually set the affinity for a process then all threads for the process should stick to a single processors

867139
affinity	processors
using this will allow you to make estimations about processors usage by your threads as you can never be sure where the threads will be one cycle to the next again unless you set the affinity on purpose

867196

i did that since my host is an old pentium 4 pc running windows xp with only 1gb ram so i think microsoft virtual pc is the lightest among oracle virtualbox and vmware

next many applications don t see space used in hidden and or system folder and many programs antivirus for example store stuff in those folder so you may need to run dir ash to get a list of system and hidden folder followed by to find out how much space the folder using you may need to drill down into it to find the offending files

868654
disk	ram
can i maybe use buffers or even ram disk 14 mb of memory isnt a problem at all

868654
disk	ram
if i would do ram disk - i need to make sure that info in files are saved to actual disk

868654
disk	ram
so question is how can i speed it up and what is better to do buffer cache or maybe ram disk

868654
disk	ram
and just so you know one of the biggest problems with it there is more files in root folder - so it should be only that one folder if i would use ram disk

868660
mouse	keyboard
i use synergy to use one keyboard and mouse

868686
put	get
i want to get everything from a folder and all of its subfolders and then be able to put them in date order

is there a way for me to set up a second access point that connects to the router wireless instead of through an ethernet cable

868758

868762
put	get
is there anything i can do to rectify this is there any open source firmware i can install to the cisco dpc3939 to make this happen am i missing something or do i just need to get a new router and put the bookend on bridge mode

868769
norton	mcafee	antivirus	mcafee	antivirus	norton
you could also install a free antivirus like avg or avast not norton mcafee that will stop most malwares

868786
ethernet	wireless
this can happen if you end up on the guest wireless network or are plugged in to an ethernet port which is on a separate vlan from your production network

868799
mouse	keyboard
if your goal is to share a keyboard and mouse between different systems you should look into synergy

868854
ubuntu	linux
if all he needs is a web-browser and minecraft i d consider installing ubuntu or some other linux distribution

868857
filesystems	ntfs
i have just reformatted a 2t external to use the ext4 filesystems with gpt partitioning from ntfs using ms-dos

868913
versioning	upgrade
i recently upgrade my excel 2003 to the latest versioning office 2013

before upgrading to mac osx yosemite i always used cmd+enter to open links that the arrow is pointing at but this stopped working right after i upgraded to yosemite - nothing happens when i press the key combination

868954
switching	screens
the problem when you press the power button a few leds light up the one around the power switching itself the ones on the caps lock and mute keys the bluetooth indicator and the light on the top of the screens for lighting up the keyboard

868957
sudo	passwd
after this system ask me the sudo passwd but it s no work i get

there s a menu option to switching view- show hide alternate screens

869010
google-chrome	firefox	opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome
this would force download in the browsers which support it google-chrome firefox and opera

869013
vmware	virtualbox
the resulting iso hfs+ formatted can be easily mounted to vmware virtualbox machine if it s running os x

869014

869045
debian	linux
my os is debian linux

869081
ubuntu	linux
you could install ubuntu 10.10 netbook it s a free linux based os designed specifically for netbooks it s also very similar to a windows os not at all like the older command based linux systems

869098
stdout	stderr
28 to stdout 15 to stderr

869098
stdout	stderr
you are seeing the ones that report to stderr because the pipe only handles stdout

869099
ethernet	wireless
mr3020 only have one ethernet port and wireless interface

869103
wan	subnet	subnet	packets
i know that this is pretty ambiguous because many factors contribute to how traffic is routed but is it expected behavior that when clients on a nated network try to send a packets to an address outside of their subnet but on the router s wan subnet the router will try to communicate directly with that address

869106
versioning	upgrade
that usually gets installed when someone upgrade to the avg paid versioning via upgrade instead of update on the free versioning

869133
ati	nvidia
check your video card as this issue is common with faulty video card especially integrated video cards like nvidia or ati

869144
sudoers	visudo
files in the directory should have similar functions to etc sudoers meaning the scripts above are still problematic even in etc sudoers.d and however one article said we should not use the directory because we cannot use visudo to edit files in it

869145
versioning	upgrade
if you have made changes to that file and the package manager wants to upgrade it you will have to manually inspect the changes and approve how they are merged into the new versioning

869163
rtp	sip
sip rtp ports range

869185
sudoers	visudo
the visudo command only defaults to etc sudoers

869205
filesystems	ntfs
secondly you need to tell us what filesystems it is for ntfs leave a small amount of freespace near the files to deal with expansion but often it doesnt work well enough

869218
disk	ram
in such a case ignoring caching for a moment the data would be read from disk slow into ram possibly copied within ram fast followed by being written out to disk again slow

869219
wan	lan
i have a logitech wifi router with just one lan and one wan input

869286
wan	lan
the router is connected to the modem presumably via a cable running from its the router s wan port to the modem s lan port and also presumably the router contains the access point ap that broadcasts the wifi radio signal for the wireless network that you and your roommates connect to when online this signal is actually picked up by an embedded device in your laptop s motherboard called a network interface card nic or wireless adapter - it acts as a wireless receiver of the radio signals

869286
ethernet	wireless
presumably you are not connected to the router by an ethernet cable if you were connected by ethernet then i don t think this could happen at least not in the way you are describing but only wireless

869288
disk	ram
some how i can not imagine that windows would get sluggish if it was just reading data from ram while no new programs get loaded from disk

869289
led	electronics
electronics download the service manual for your chromebook find out which pins power the led or cold-cathode fluorescent on older machines illumination cut the very fine trace on the plastic flex cable remove the surface insulation over the copper traces and solder in a resistor

ubuntu	linux
i am a new to linux ubuntu operating systems

869321
ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	linux
linux mint is based on ubuntu so choose the orange circular ubuntu icon

869321
debian	linux	debian	mint	ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	linux
it s true that ubuntu is itself based on debian but since linux mint 17.1 is based on ubuntu 14.04 directly choose the ubuntu icon not the red spiral-shaped debian icon

869321
ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	linux
as you can see at the official linux mint releases webpage all of the linux mint releases after the first unstable release are based on the ubuntu package base

vim	textmate
one of the first very famous and still widely used vim plugins is snipmate inspired by the textmate editor

869528
ftp	smb
the system is only reachable via ssh but not with ftp and not with smb

869560
vim	emacs
in particular the two venerable masters of the text-editing world - vi or vim and emacs ought to cope well with files larger than the one you are editing

869562
width	height
when you click the picture icon in this placeholder powerpoint fills the height or width of the placeholder with the entire picture

869579
ssd	sata
in my case i m carrying around a virtualbox ubuntu guest on a usb ssd and want to rsync to a sata hdd once per week

869615
mouse	keyboard
i m really annoyed with my dell laptop as when i type the cursor sometimes jumps because the trackpoint mouse pointer on the keyboard the nubby mouse control between the g h and b apparently can be used to click

869638
wan	lan
if you would remove all cache on an exchange account it would mean to remove all local data and you only would have access to you mailbox when you are connected to the mail server via lan or wan

869641
ubuntu	linux
i ve found that linux supports bcm4331 devices and i ve tested it under ubuntu 14.04

869650
google-chrome	firefox
in my case that isn t the problem and strangely it only affects google-chrome but not firefox

869652
umask	mount
uid gid and umask were set for compatibility with owncloud v7.0.4 to use the mount point as data folder

869672
google-chrome	firefox
i want to be able to open google-chrome chromium and firefox at the same time but have each be seen from different ip addresses

869672
google-chrome	firefox
if i were to do a google search for what is my ip in google-chrome it should give me ip.ip.ip.1 and then firefox could give me ip.ip.ip.2

869690
google-chrome	firefox
as frank thomas mentioned in his comment google-chrome and firefox probably don t support this scenario natively however it shouldn t be too hard to get it to work

869811
filesystems	ntfs
it is an ntfs filesystems that is currently on the drive...and i am away from my computer so i can not verify which linux distro i have running.

869832
width	height
what i am trying to do is set up one script that will check the ratio of height over width and then determine which dimension to scale to fit hd 1920x1080

869832
width	height
i also need to crop either height or width if the resulting dimension is larger than 1080 or 1920 respectively

869839
width	height
i would use ffprobe to read the width height of the existing video and do the math in bash to figure out which is the limiting factor

869926
subnet	vlan
a far better option for you to play with is to have the router inside the pix and set up multiple subnet there and do all kinds of fancy routing protocols and vlan scenarios between the pix and the router and the switch if you have one that supports vlans

869989
folder	dir
i am logging in to the server with that user creating a .ssh folder in my dir and then creating an authorized_keys file can copying in my key

870045
ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	linux
if you had installed ubuntus grub to its own root partition during installation dev sda4 mints grub which resides in the hard drive itself would be intact and you would be able to boot into linux mint and do sudo update-grub and mints grub would pick up ubuntu installation allowing you to boot it up using mints bootloader

870060
debian	linux
i am using a kali linux debian derived 1.0.9 on usb drive with encrypted partition

870092

870203
ubuntu	linux
you connect a usb device to a machine say ubuntu or any kind of linux

870209
freebsd	linux

stdout	stderr
redirecting error messages from command prompt stderr stdout

870361
arp	dhcp
as dhcp server vpn server static arp cache entries etc

870361
wan	lan	wan	subnet
i figured since i want two different subnet i should connect the modem router to the dd-wrt router lan to wan

870373
wan	lan
you have them connected correctly with dd-wrt wan port connected to modem lan port

870384
mtu	icmp
after you receive the icmp mtu exceeded message the kernel should adjust your route cache to reflect the path limitations

870405
osx	yosemite
i installed apache 2.2 using homebrew on osx 10.9 and it was working fine until i upgraded to yosemite this weekend

870442
versioning	upgrade
after an upgrade my windows server 2008 r2 spent facing problems with iis versioning 7

870443
google-chrome	firefox
bug report 782563 on bugzilla is about firefox catching up with google-chrome for search engine integration

870444
udp	tcp
even if you re not using windows xp these instructions will likely be close enough that they may help you with newer operating systems. namely it points out that tcp port 10011 and tcp port 30033 and udp port 9987 may be useful

870449
wan	lan
most often it will work when both devices are physically on the same switch chip but lan to wlan often doesn t work and lan to wan almost never works and in most cases it shouldn t

870450
vlan	packets
so i have to pass plain ethernet packets and vlan packets with wi-fi if i don t want another more device which mixes them at the tv box

870450

you can use the free version of vmware or virtualbox

870551
folder	directory
edit i have just noticed if i try to create a directory in an affected folder using explorer the window hangs and becomes unresponsive

870611
disk	ram
-- as long as your computer knows what the intended sample rate is it could collect all the data points at any speed it pleases and then store them on disk or in ram or anywhere else to be reproduced with 100 fidelity later

870611
disk	ram
from there applications can do whatever they want with them including writing them to disk encoding them in mp3 sending them over the network just letting them stack up in ram etc

the proxy can accept a plain https connection as a transparent proxy and it also supports a non-encrypted http connection inside which the client can do http connect and then negotiate ssl

870662
google-chrome	firefox
this is a new behavior in google-chrome but in mozilla firefox the rendering works perfectly

870668
put	get
you should be able to get around this problem if you put the path in quotes

870681
min	max
actually the screen alternates between what seems to be max and min brightness

870682
vmware	virtualbox
i have installed vmware after working with virtualbox so vmware network cards is not causing this problems

870687
mouse	keyboard
installed it mouse and keyboard work fine

870687
switching	screens
at the post screens and the windows load screens the switching works

870710
ethernet	wireless
for now when i am connected to wireless network and it disconnects at the moment i plug a ethernet cable

870753
ethernet	wireless
if you re using wireless then your ethernet port on host will appear as disconnected and the bridge won t work

870850
vlan	packets
the packets is sent to the right controller virtual function according to mac address and vlan tag

870887
flac	speex
i ve got a speex audio file snd.spx and i ve found foobar2000 is the only software i can easily convert it to the more-widely-usable format flac snd.flac so i can edit it before encoding again to a lossy format

870925
stdout	stderr
the answer is apparently to have the script that i called to do the double background trick combined with a nohup to make it ignore hangup signals sighup and combined with disconnecting the stdout and stderr streams

870966
google-chrome	safari
i am trying to get this web audio api example to run on ios 7.x 8.x safari google-chrome

by adding these functions to your vb6 vba projects you can quickly and easily incorporate regexp functionality into your applications

870994
versioning	upgrade
now i upgrade my linux versioning to 3.10 and now ethernet port is not working

871062
google-chrome	firefox
and it doesn-t seem to work in google-chrome and firefox either

871086
folder	directory
unfortunately there doesn t seem to be any good directory structure which would allow me to do that dockerfiles can t refer to the parent folder and i can t put them both in the top folder because i m not allowed to change the name of the dockerfile

871100
google-chrome	firefox
in addition firefox and google-chrome even hardcode the certificate information for some websites google and facebook included so even if your os trusted the fake certificate you still couldn t visit google because the browser knows that only authorities x and y and nobody else may issue certificates for google.com

871110
filesystems	ntfs
checking filesystems on e the type of the filesystems is ntfs

871116
sudo	passwd

871162
logmein	hamachi
but red alert 3 will not work over hamachi logmein even when i choose hamachi s ip from the game s options

871162
vpn	lan
but on the hamachi s vpn all other services work except for the game s lan feature

871162
tunnel	vpn
my understanding and i could be mistaken is that i don t even need port forwarding if i m tunnel via a vpn

871178
mouse	keyboard
it makes me use my mouse when i only want to use the keyboard

871187
min	max
how do i find the min and max value people have voted on on a given day the column header

871198
x86	64bit
make sure you install x86 and x64 versions side by side - note you only can install x64 on a 64bit windows os so if it fails to install x64 then just skip that no harm done

871200
wan	lan
i have one file server in the lan and a client server outside the wan

switching	screens
with another they can switching back to the original screens buffer

871353
google-chrome	firefox
switched between firefox google-chrome and ie with no change in results

871378
disk	ram
one method that terracopy uses to speed stuff up is to use its own memory allocation to buffer the data being transferred this is especially useful when copying data from the same hardware item disk back to the same hardware item to send more of it to the ram first

871448
put	get
as we fill up a mid-tower case with more drives the sata cables get rather tricky to get in a position so that they enter the connection near perfectly aligned so as to not put any stress on the sata connection points

871491
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari

it may be worth knowing what the advance usb options are for this virtual machine settings - usb bluetooth - advanced usb options

871631
post	get
you can just download a clean iso corresponding to that license either on msdn if you have a subscription on forum post like these which list direct legal download links to a microsoft distributor or on some shady pirate sites make sure to check the hash against the official hashes published on msdn to make sure you didn t get a compromised image

sudo	passwd
for that reason i ve changed my sudo config to allow my user to run the specific mount commands for my network shares without a passwd

872118
cpu	hyperthreading	cpu	processors	processors	hyperthreading
this on i7 processors denotes the cpu s ability to do hyperthreading however since i own a i5-4690k it is my understanding this shouldn t happen

872119
ssl	https
http port 4444 traffic would be visible but https port 4445 would be encrypted by ssl

872149

this specification doesn t require the cpu to actually support hyperthreading so long as it supports the specification s mechanism for reporting the inability to support actual hyperthreading

sometimes however i want to run scripts which are written for bash from my fish shell

875621
fish	bash
this is necessary because fish isn t syntactically compatible with bash

875621
fish	bash
when typing bash in my fish the bash i open automatically opens another fish on top of itself because of my .profile .bashrc

875621

in other words is it ever possible for tee to overwrite the file before cat has finished with it

i wanted this on a server where permissions are a bit more complex so here s the full command line for getting a physical ram disk setup with imdisk creating a directory so you can assign more complex permissions - there are limitations on full drive access and assigning modify permissions to a group by its name

876941
folder	dir
it switches to r makes the dir r and then icacls grants permissions to the group web if you wanted a user just use their name here instead no syntax difference oi ci every file and folder inside should inherit this permission m modify which is read list write create delete modify

our house has 1 wireless router set up with all 5 ethernet ports full

878099
ethernet	wireless
i kind of have my own mini-setup and i only connect to the wireless router via wifi for internet purposes i can t use ethernet because of the distance between router and pc. i am also setting up a web server and ftp server and need to forward ports 21 and 80

assuming your brew installation is in usr local and your shell is bash or zsh do the following step by step strip the comments if you haven t turned on interactive comments

878187
tunnel	vpn
i ve seen guides telling users to use a vpn or ssh tunnel to avoid isp throttling of bittorent traffic but if you use a socks 5 proxy wouldn t it be just as effective

878262
udp	tcp
the main difference is whether you want a tcp or udp connection

878262
udp	tcp
udp is faster it wraps tcp in udp tcp is more compatible but more overhead

878301

some chargers calculate the state of charge of a battery rather than measuring it and retain that information in flash ram or on disk

878316
freebsd	linux
gnome linux freebsd is a bit better but still not as night as hardware switching

878381
folder	directory
if you can t change the temporary directory of those specific programs and you re sure that that s the cause of your problems a complicated but efficient solution to do what you want would be to automatically generate symbolic links from the folder of those programs in the ramdisk temp directory to a permanent folder on your hd

878403
ethernet	wireless
i should specify that you appear to want is a wireless bridge which will in laymen s terms convert a remote wifi source to ethernet ports

h.264	h.265
i heard that converting from xavc s or h.264 codec into h.265 will decrease the file size maximum double not more than half of the original size

878531
h.264	h.265
i heard that converting from xavc s or h.264 codec into h.265 will decrease the file size maximum double not more than half of the original size

878531
h.264	h.265
h.265 improves on h.264 in terms of efficiency

878531
h.264	h.265
that means if you take one video with perfect quality and encode it once with h.265 and once with h.264 in such a way that they both have the same subjective quality then the h.265 one will be about 50 of the size of the h.264 counterpart

878531
h.264	h.265
it does not mean that you can convert an existing h.264 file using h.265 and expect to have exactly 50 file size reduction

878531
h.264	h.265
chances are it s better to keep the file in h.264 and not re-compress it unless you choose a very high bitrate or quality factor for the h.265 encode

since none of my other linux machines have systemd yet and angstrom does i figured i d get familiar with systemd before its shoved down my throat on debian

878633
mouse	keyboard
whereas hibernate copies the contents of memory to disk and restores them to disk once a keyboard key or mouse button has been clicked

878647
put	get
you can just put the system in hibernate mode and then power it back on later to get back to the same state it was in when you hibernated it with all the applications and files you had open previously open again

878718
stdout	stderr
since you re already outputting to stdout you have to redirect stderr to a file for example

878725
disk	ram
but having swap ram is needed when you are going to use suspend to disk

878798
hash	md5
i want to write a batch script that has the ability to generate and verify md5 hash of an entire directory tree

878805
hash	md5
an md5 hash is a hash of a a stream of bytes but a directory tree is not a stream of bytes

878805
hash	md5
so your script could create the single file and then get the md5 hash of that

878809
dropbox	skydrive
the app can be linked to dropbox google drive microsoft skydrive or webdav itunes file sharing or you can open pdfs directly from email or the web

tunnel	vpn
i m trying to follow these instructions to use split tunnel with my cisco anyconnect vpn client connection

879178
tunnel	vpn
the vpn server is configured to not allow split tunnel and we cannot change that on the server s end so we have to do it on the client s end

879396
ubuntu	mint
hot swapping is apparently working again for ubuntu 16.04 mint 18 should work too

879436
mouse	keyboard
it baffles me as to why an os does not give scheduling priority to allow the user to use the mouse keyboard and kill things

879532
folder	directory
since the second operation form is only valid if the last one is a directory the concatenation of the last operand a slash and the final pathname component of the named file means mv just concatenates joins the targetdirectory which is the last argument + +the filename of the corresponding argument so without the folder structure link

879585
mouse	keyboard
although this can be done solely with the keyboard it is more easily done by using the keyboard and the mouse

879614

ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	linux
failing that i have the newest version of libvte .39 and xfce terminal .63 source code and have been trying to figure out how to compile it without borking my ststem but libvte wants a newer gnutls which requires an older libnettle then ubuntu linux mint has which requires uninstalling libnettle4 which removes cmake and a bunch of other programs and this seems like a horrible way to go and that s not even the end of it

879747
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome unsure about firefox i doubt ie does this has a blacklist of reported malware and phishing sites and automatically blocks you from browsing to said pages

879757
put	get
it is also really fast definitely quicker than ubuntu only bad point is that some packages are put together on ubuntu so they take a bit of tweaking to get working

879762
google-chrome	firefox
ie firefox google-chrome all didnâ t work

filesystems	btrfs
what would be the correct mount options for the btrfs filesystems

880913
daemons	systemd
which is to be expected since sshd is the ssh daemons â note the d after ssh â that would run as a ssh server on the systemd listening and waiting for remote ssh login requests

880913
daemons	systemd
so this is not an â œerrorâ but rather expected behavior when attempting to run a systemd daemons like sshd as a non-privileged user

880924
vmware	virtualbox
this will fix your problem and leave the virtualbox adapters functional in windows so that you can use both vb and vmware on the same system without having to constantly switch settings

disk	ram
once your computer runs out of physical ram it must start using storage hard disk which is several orders of magnitude slower than ram

881460
disk	ram
this is why the ram usage is unstable during thrashing as processes are being shuffled in out of ram to from the disk

881462
disk	ram
this could be used to merely mark a disk for detection later or maybe copy some data from memory like truecrypt keys in ram to it

i ve not tried it - indeed i don t own a mac but i ve bumped into this type of problem before over a wan and the solution could work for you - set up a vpn between your mac and your server - in this way the vpn can reconnect and give you the same vpn address - provided you manage to route your ssh session through the vpn tunnel the keep-alives built in to ssh will allow the session to work regardless of whether you are using wifi or lan or switching between the 2

filesystems	ntfs
there is no way to make windows the os case sensitive even though ntfs the filesystems used by windows os s these days can support in order to comply with posix

881806
filesystems	ntfs
according to microsoft you could have example.jpg and example.jpg in the same directory on ntfs click here but the os all versions of windows does not support it which makes the fact the filesystems can pointless

881813
filesystems	ntfs
as part of the requirements for posix compliance the windows nt filesystems ntfs provides a case-sensitive file and directory naming convention

881829
sudo	passwd
i input the sudo passwd and all is good

folder	directory
so i am planning to create a backups directory in the lvm0 and use rsync to sync those 3 folder on a daily basis to the backups dir.

881855
lvm	mdadm
lvm s mirroring isn t the nicest around iirc you need a third drive to store some sort of log ime it s better to use mdadm to manage mirroring and other raid patterns

881855
lvm	mdadm
i m currently using raid10 mdadm on six drives on one machine and lvm instead of partitions or in addition to partitions on others

881856
disk	ram
unless the cpu is very slow and not enough ram db performance bottleneck is usually disk bound especially if you have a large db and queries are more or less random that invoke lots of seek time on the disk

881856
disk	ram
which is why people went on to solid state storage or ram disk

881856
disk	ram
i had a db server essentially ran off a ram disk just need a good ups and make regular every minute incremental disk backups

881856
disk	ram
even without going to the drastic measures of making a ram disk the os caching will give you the bulk of the performance boost if you have sufficient ram

881856
multiplying	add
so add up the physical cores multiplying by the clock then adjust for its generation will get you the ball pack performance expectation

881856
disk	ram
check the disk throughput cpu load cpu interrupt ram usage cashing swap

881856
disk	ram
in case you didn t know cpu load will always appear high even when it is waiting for the ram or disk

881862
ethernet	wireless
if you are plugged in via ethernet directly make sure your wireless is not also turned and connected to the network or any other network

881887
switching	screens
the problem with useing a 4 pole switching to change usb is that mechanical switches have contact bounce when switched this results in device not found or similar error info coming up on your screens

lvm	btrfs
exception zfs and btrfs have built-in multi-disk functionality similar to raid or lvm

882086
hash	md5
if you are concerned about the safety of the file you re downloading you can use the md5 hash to verify that the file was not somehow altered

882086
hash	md5
you download a file and if the md5 hash doesn t match it means the file on the server is different than the md5 hash and somehow something is wrong

882086
hash	md5
but if their site got hacked and you did check the md5 hash then you got the little bonus

882090
hash	md5
checking md5 sha1 hash is a good first step and you should do it when you have time

882106

however i m not able to put together these answer to get it to work across different systems even if i enable x11 forwarding

882224
post	get
if the http site has you post the data to an http address and then you get redirected to https then you probably are quite vulnerable at having your passwords sniffed at this point

882224
tunnel	vpn
however your web traffic both http and https should be rather immune to network sniffing by the isp as it goes from your house to the other end of the vpn tunnel

882234

if there s an error it should get caught by the portion of the redirection stdout and stderr

mouse	keyboard
i just got a sculpt keyboard and mouse ergonomic to replace my 5000 series

882528
mouse	keyboard
it should have been another mouse button which would have been configured to send a keyboard command if desired

882528
mouse	keyboard
i am not sure why it was logical for a mouse device to send keyboard events and i found out they both are just generic human input devices

882528
mouse	keyboard
this means their class is neither mouse or keyboard and the usb receiver essentially translates the events it receives and dispatched interrupts for keyboard or mouse events on a virtual device

882670
ssl	tls1.2
since these ciphers suites are also used with later ssl versions tls1.0+ and new cipher suites were mostly introduced with tls1.2 this setting makes tls1.0 and tls1.1 unavailable because of no shared ciphers

882679
sudo	passwd
so in my attempt to prevent the default ubuntu user from logging in and to prevent the default sudo user me from logging in with a passwd and thus enforcing to use the private key i managed to lock me out unable to perform any sudo commands

882679

and now even though i can still login as me with the private key i can t execute any sudo because it prompts for a passwd and the previous passwd no longer works

882729
ffmpeg	handbrake
you need to transcode the audio using a program such as handbrake gui or ffmpeg command line to a codec supported by the xbox one

882731
folder	dir
also note you are nesting one my docs dir inside another by leaving a trailing slash off the source parameter and specifying the folder name in the destination so your files will end up in h -backup-260215 my documents my documents

882735
xcopy	icacls
also check icacls h to be sure you have rights also you might want to use iso dates 2015-02-25 so you can sort properly or for backups you can use tools more advanced than xcopy

the large majority of linux is fedora or debian like and a non-gui install will use negligible memory 1mb cpu 10hz and disk 3gb

i would not think keyboard and mouse would be an issue but if a higher capacity power supply is available to you try it but i suspect something is up with that dock

can i have vim put its swapfiles in some other folder so at least they won t clutter up my working dir

883149
vmware	virtualbox
now i haven t tried this myself so i can t really give a good advice on that but apparently vmware works well enough with this sort of thing and from what i ve read virtualbox cannot or couldn t handle existing operating system very well or at least it wasn t easy to get to work

883153

photoshop	coreldraw
that is why it is recommended that you only keep the main fonts in windows listed in this link and keep also fonts you are using in special editing software like photoshop or coreldraw or installed software or games on your system that require special fonts

883694
folder	directory
go to b folder using cd - change directory

883749
folder	dir
given that your dir mask has an extension and since folder names do not typically have extensions my guess is you simply want to rename files and not folder

883749
folder	dir
if this is the case then all you need do is add the dir s option to recurse into the child folder and the a-d option to exclude folder

883749
children	parent
but less obvious is you must sort the result of the dir command descending to make sure that children are processed before parent otherwise a child rename will fail because the listed path will no longer be valid

883757

i want to be able to do that without touching the keyboard so i want to map the left super key to mouse button 11 that way i can hold mouse button 11 and click+drag windows

883782

i have tried this using both cinnamon and awesome wm and absolutely none of the super_l keyboard combinations work while mouse button 10 or 11 is being held down

883782
mouse	keyboard
it seems the super_l key is being held down because as soon as i release button 10 it remains held down for ever until i press the super_l key again on the keyboard but the mouse button is still being registered because i can t click drag windows

f without a usb keyboard or mouse connected the only way to shutdown windows 8.1 and do a restart is to press the power button

883867
mouse	keyboard
with a usb keyboard and mouse connected configured device manager to also show non-present devices by making this change to the registry which requires administrator privilege and a reboot for the change to take effect

883867

vlan	packets
you are creating a vlan which means in this case that any packets emitted from the eth0.22 packets are prefixed with an 802.1q header a tag saying that the packets is destined for vlan 22

884305
vlan	packets
the switch accepts this packets on a trunked interface and forwards the packets out of any ports that are defined as allowing vlan 22 or defined as allowing any vlans

884316
cpu	processors
processors intel r core tm i7-4700hq cpu 2.40ghz

884393
ubuntu	linux
the easy solution in your case is probably to set the rtc to local time tell your linux system that the rtc is set to local time the exact mechanics of doing this varies by distribution and release version but apparently in ubuntu you set in etc default rcs and then configure the operating systems such that only one of them preferably the one you use the most since the time displayed in all others will be incorrect twice a year until it has been booted and had a chance to correct it handles daylight saving time changes

884404
filesystems	fat
live media is not the same as a properly installed operating system and sure you ll need a variant of the ext filesystems for installing your linux distribution but on your hard drive many live media does not have this requirement and they will work fine from a fat 32 drive

884404
filesystems	fat
you can use any tool suggested here to format your drive many support different filesystems but if you need a live media you ll most likely just need fat 32 and the good old windows format dialog will be enough for this task

884404
filesystems	fat
as far as i can tell you just want to boot a live image of said distribution to do whatever you need to do on it without installing it or making your computer dual boot so you most certainly want to stick with the fat 32 filesystems and you would just have to use a proper tool like unetbootin as somebody has already suggested since it will do all the work of creating a live usb for you

versioning	upgrade
as this versioning is the core versioning it can be upgrade to 8.1 which means that windows 8 pro and windows 8 enterprise can also be upgrade to 8.1 they become 8.1 pro and 8.1 enterprise

884458
versioning	upgrade
windows rt cannot be upgrade to higher versioning such as pro or enterprise

885281
wan	lan
nat loopback just simplifies the way a lan connection might access services you expose to the world on your wan

885281
wan	lan
the main benefit of nat loopback is that it allows one to treat the routerâ s wan address as if it were in a lan

885281
wan	lan
this is beneficial if you have a hostname connected to the ip address of your wan or just if you want to be able to access services via your wan address instead of dealing with the internal lan address

885287
google-chrome	firefox
actually the comment by forrestoff about google-chrome applies to all browsers firefox included

885312
wan	lan	wan	subnet
you might not be able to have multiple subnet on the lan side of these routers they may only take two subnet the wan and one for the lan

885442
ssd	sata
i think even with the fastest ssd drives it would be almost impossible to achieve 3gb s read and write as the sata 6gb s interface will limit the speed

885657
google-chrome	firefox

885672
tunnel	vpn
if you are concerned about this you might consider a vpn tunnel for all traffic or be aware of your sensitive traffic and ensure it uses secure and encrypted protocols

885680
google-chrome	firefox
this happens with any browser â google-chrome internet explorer or firefox â when i press some keys tried remote and worked smoothly

885707
ubuntu	linux
something like what desktop machine called dual-boot so can linux os ubuntu or mozillux can be installed in a windows 8.1 tablet and co-exist with it and allow me to dual-boot either one of the os

885721

note you will need a usb keyboard for selecting the os in the boot screens if you manage to dual boot windows with linux on a tablet

this can be combined with sort so you ll see the top-20 biggest directory in the current folder

886014
post	get
what s more the form will accept this value as either a get or a post

886026

if the avg rescue doesn t work then make a boo table usb cd of ubuntu linux and boot your computer using usb cd and select try ubuntu linux without installing

886085
google-chrome	firefox
see if you get the same thing with firefox as well as google-chrome

886122
filesystems	btrfs
there are two filesystems i m familiar with that will give you compression on linux btrfs and zfs

886122
freebsd	solaris
zfs has a big following in the sun solaris freebsd and freenas communities

886125
udp	tcp
at the moment i can do this for tcp by port scanning portquiz.net which is a server with all tcp ports open from inside however this wonâ t work for udp

886128
post	get
the referer header could also be used but it would make it harder to handle cases where the initial request was a post instead of a get request.

mouse	keyboard
i created a system repair disc to logon my computer but my problem now is how to run it since my keyboard nor mouse works

886183
kde	gnome
there is no good automated way of doing this unfortunately this is due to the fact that there are many people out there like me who use some programs from both gnome and kde personally i pick my desktop environment based off which one suites my needs best then use each program based off there merit regardless of if they are kde gnome or other

886183
kde	gnome
to answer your question though there is a way to do this manually when you install kde or install gnome what you really do is install a pattern all this pattern is is a list of other programs to install

886183
kde	gnome
you should note though there are programs such as firefox that are neither kde or gnome programs and are probably present in both the kde and gnome patterns

886234
putty	winscp
on windows winscp 5.9 and newer registers itself to handle the ssh url and opens the session specified by the url in putty

if you place a pdf file in indesign it will export the full contents of that pdf file whether you crop or clip in indesign or change settings in the export to acrobat screens

886395
pop-up	dialog
the language dialog box pop-up

886434
google-chrome	firefox
but the reason google-chrome has more than one item in that list is it uses separate processes instead of just separate threads like firefox

886436
folder	directory
i would like to redirect this network directory to my local hard drive so that every time windows tries to open that directory it will be redirected to a local folder c localdir

886450

886568
tunnel	vpn
i have a vpn server that i am connecting to on windows 10 pretend it is win8 via a split tunnel

886568
tunnel	vpn
there are some domains let s call them a.vpndomain.com and b.vpndomain.com that i want to connect through the vpn server not my local internet the vpn does not have working outbound internet so that is why i am doing split tunnel

886570
folder	directory
often i want to do something in cmd or python with files in a particular folder so i open the folder click on the location bar and type cmd or python then hit enter and respectively cmd or the python terminal opens with that folder as there current working directory

886576
mouse	keyboard
recently i have a problem with usb keyboard and mouse or maybe the usb port itself

886576
mouse	keyboard
suddenly the keyboard and or mouse stop working then i need to unplug and plug

connect your machine directly into one of the netgear lan ports unplug everything other network cable from the netgear including from the wan port

886601
pop-up	dialog
many repeated times per day a microsoft exchange dialog box pop-up screenshot showing the exchange server and the mailbox with the textboxes disabled and check name button greyed out

886604
mouse	keyboard
if it s happening on all your usb ports it could be either your motherboard as multiple ports likely share the same usb controller hub chip or your keyboard and or mouse

886604
mouse	keyboard
the solution is to try a different keyboard and or mouse

886604
mouse	keyboard
if all the ports behave the same replacing the keyboard mouse doesn t help and it s a pc with an open pci slot you can get an inexpensive usb board to add reliable usb ports

886649
filesystems	ntfs
different filesystems do too - the windows vbr for a fat32 partition is different from the one for an ntfs partition because the code in the vbr has to understand enough of the filesystems structure to read that first os boot file

886755
logmein	hamachi
but also free version is restricted to run in app mode only in contrast to service mode meaning you have to launch hamachi client and log in to logmein account manually after each system reboot

886788
post	get
get event-debounce-patch either by copy pasting from the original author post or from my mirror

886806

post	get
when i try to connect to my ssh server running arch linux at home from my school on my windows 8 laptop i sometimes get write failed connection reset by peer and other times read from socket failed connection reset by peer. i can t post the error right now because i m not at school and it only happens while at school but i believe the last line before either of the above is ssh2_msg_service_request sent. this only happens at school - i am able to connect over my mobile hotspot

886848
ubuntu	debian
i installed upstart on a debian 7.8 system but last i checked this didn t work on an ubuntu 11 system either

886870
ssd	sata
offtopic you should install your ssd on the hdd place because of sata 3 whereas optical drive has only sata 2 connection - this affects the speed

886876
cpu	processors
processors intel core i3-4010u cpu 1.70 ghz

886881
spaces	delimiter
the way rm works is it will delete any items in the spaces delimiter list that it was provided with

886885
factors	mean
the reality is not all ram is created the same and just because a stick of ram is ddr3 or has the same form factors does not mean you can just stick it into something and hope it works

886923
bash	tcsh
thisâ is available in most shells definitely bash csh and tcsh . â

886965
debian	linux	freebsd	debian	freebsd	linux
the most important of these servers is our main mail server and most of the others in question which are very old version 3 i think of debian linux which there is no longer support or active repositories for i have since set up secondaries running in parallel running on freebsd which are for most intents and purposes to be considered secure but due to the rather complex setup my colleague had implemented have not been able to completely replace

886965
gentoo	freebsd	gentoo	debian	gentoo	linux	debian	linux	freebsd	debian	freebsd	linux
i am mostly a gentoo and freebsd user myself so haven t really kept up to date properly on debian knowledge but am a very experienced linux unix user in general with a good bit of programming experience but want to be sure i don t overlook anything before potentially bricking our main mail server and several of our internal use servers

886972
debian	linux	debian	mint
i am variously using linux mint 17 or debian testing

887001
google-chrome	firefox
it appears to me on firefox google-chrome ie and itâ s just slightly worrying

887009
hide	show
and yes this is not just the show hide icon problem

887009
hide	show
when i go to properties where i can show hide system icons power icon dropdown is disabled there

887010
ubuntu	linux
this last should completely solve the problem for you as long as you take reasonable precautions to prevent a recurrence -- require a password for login use a non-privileged account for everyday use and a strong password for the admin account install and run a live malware scanner or my preference do most of the above and switch to a linux distro such as some flavor of ubuntu as your primary operating system

887034
folder	directory
this will produce nicely formatted file with all junctions in current directory and subdirectories organized by folder

887041
udp	tcp
i have also configured my lan to route all traffic for that game s tcp udp port numbers to my internal ipv4 address

887045
afp	smb
in system preferences i have turned on filesharing shared a folder called music turned on smb and afp and set the workgroup name to swamp

887045
cifs	smb
i am also unable to connect to shared folders on the windows pc from my imac using either cifs or smb

887082
hide	show
i have gotten as far as inserting the checkbox assigning it to a column to show true false that i will hide later and trying to use a vlookup

887091
ssd	sata
if i were to set up my internal ssd and an external ssd connected via sata to firewire as a raid 1 set they would be mirrors of each other independently bootable

887132
google-chrome	firefox
i switched from firefox to google-chrome in linux because google-chrome is faster

887136
temp	tmp
i have 24gb s of ram and have created a ramdisk of 5gb s to store pale moon s memory usage page file tmp and temp files

selecting that show a white rectangle on the screen covering part of the desktop it can t be moved but win-d will hide it

887189
trojan	virus
is this a strange virus trojan something else

887234
cydia	tweak
as many of you know you cannot use flex to distribute your tweak so you must create a debian package for cydia

887306
ssd	sata
when i set sata mode to ahci and set irst to enabled in bios ssd is detected in bios but this is the only change - freezes during post still present and no boot device

887315

when i have an bluetooth or usb mouse attached to the device i can send events to dev input event7 to move the mouse and send button events but when i disconnect the mouse dev input event7 disappears and i can t send events anymore

887384
mouse	keyboard
you only need one physical monitor and keyboard mouse

887457
disk	ram
this is probably because ram has much quicker input output speeds than the hard disk so the the ram can output the stuff in it as quick as the hard disk can read in

887465
disk	ram
with a disk that has a sustained write in the order of 100 mb s you would be able to write out uncompressed 4 gb of ram in under one minute

887465
disk	ram
this is one thing your simple benchmark will not have and copying from disk to disk will potentially be slower than simply writing ram out to disk

887494
int	chars
do i see these chars instead of int because the jpg format is compressed and i am not reading bits per pixel when i look at a jpg

887497
rss	feed
javascript remains active for remote content of rss feed

887542

automatically get the width and height of the training video train.mp4 without first having to probe it parse it and fill the variables w and h it s okay if i have to do this in a separate step but i d prefer not to

887618
mouse	trackpad
use your mouse or trackpad or left and right arrow keys to select the volume you want to use

887642
vmware	virtualbox	virtualbox	parallels
iâ m a fan of vmware fusion but you can just as easily use parallels or virtualbox

887650
mp3	flac
but if you output the cropped file using a lossless codec such as flac the quality should be no worse than the imported mp3

887666
debian	linux	debian	mint	ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	linux

887730
mouse	keyboard
i had to make xorg see the mouse as a slave keyboard

887735
mouse	keyboard
if you want multiple users to remotely use the same computer each have their own screen keyboard mouse control and they don t need to see what each other is doing then x2go and nx are much better tools for the job

887737
disk	ram
it will already have a large portion of the ram already duplicated on the disk

887738
disk	ram
second contrary to you copying a file dumping the set of ram pages that need to be saved disk is a single sequential contiguous write from the point of view of the drive

887739

you can sync your srt file with subtitle edit

887745
tunnel	vpn
i m trying configure my router so that the subnet 192.168.2.0 24 is routed over the vpn tunnel tun0 on the gateway router

887758
arp	tcp
note that arp and various other tools were originally imported from bsd along with the entire tcp ip stack

887771
filesystems	ntfs
the good thing about fog is then when it is capturing an image such as an ntfs - i don t know the other filesystems but there are more it can resize the partition to the smallest it can be the used data which allows you to restore to different size disks without any individual machine configuration

887824
folder	directory
this question is highly relevant too many folder in the path variable and one of the answers suggests using directory junctions as workaround

887958

i hope this post will help solve the problem for people who cant return their ssd anymore but also let people know this problem exists so they can prevent it by not trying to combine this ssd with a laptop that uses sata power management at least all chromebooks and some windows laptops

892561
ssd	sata
perhaps not exactly what you had in mind but there does exist such a device - the wd dual 2.5 drive - it s a 2.5 hdd + a reasonably sized ssd inside a single 2.5 chassis - the main issue i see with alternatives is that even if you managed to get two small drives in there say two msata or similar the laptop won t have more than one sata connection there so you would also need an adapter raid device right there which would make it more complicate but guess what - those also exist- look for 2.5 to dual msata adapters they will have raid support built-in

892576
ubuntu	linux
i use linux ubuntu 14.04 and ivms-4200

892587
onenote	ms-office
recently onenote 2013 was made free on a new development machine i had installed onenote however a few months later i realized that i needed the rest of the ms-office suite on this machine

892587

i wish to use the ntfs filesystems and have a large allocation unit size since this will hold large media files more so than small temporary text files

892651
mouse	keyboard
then thereâ s the more obvious problem a laptop in sleep mode is probably likely to get kicked out of sleep mode during the spill since the water might be â œinterpretedâ as a mouse movement or a keyboard key pressed

892686
osx	yosemite
so i upgraded my mac osx 10.10 yosemite to gnupg 2

in my mac osx yosemite whenever a window is maximized to full screen the yellow minimize button becomes disabled along with top menu s window minimize option and the associated cmd+m shortcut

892773

the recommendation here and if you find yourself missing any of the removed features is to downgrade back to the last versioning 0.9.x and simply ignore the banner prompt to upgrade

892922
g++	gcc
however i m running into an error saying that a c compiler can not be configured. i am 100 certain i have gcc and g++ installed and on the path since i can type gcc --version and it gives me version info

892942
folder	directory
assuming i want to target a specific file extension in the target directory and all sub directory what might be an effective way to recursively count the number of line breaks within a folder and sub folder from the windows command line

892961
google-chrome	firefox
using a tool like firebug firefox or google-chrome developer tools you can manually edit the css but you ll need to do this for every site

i do not think that av programs such as mse mcafee norton kaspersky etc

893131
wan	lan
some routers allow their wan port to act as a lan port when they re in bridge mode not doing nat and dhcp server but others don t

893131
wan	lan
if you have one where the wan port does not act as a lan port and you accidentally connected to that one you d have a problem

893148
google-chrome	firefox
im using google-chrome and firefox and windows 8.1

893154
wan	lan	wan	multicast
if so i would guess that the default security policy is preventing either upnp or multicast traffic or both between the wan and lan network segments

893174
wan	lan
i connected the lan wire form the cpe the first router to the wan port of the d-link

893183
wan	lan
you can connect a device like the wimax cpeâ s lan port to the wan port of the d-link dir 803

893202
macbook	bootcamp
also i should mention that on my laptop macbook pro running windows 8.1 on bootcamp this problem was not encountered

switching	screens	mouse	keyboard
my microservers are sat on the top of the first table with a switching next to it and then a kvm switching mouse keyboard and screens on the top of the second table

893398
folder	directory
however i noticed that whatever script they are using to traverse the directory tree and delete the files preserves folder structure regardless of who created the folder

893398
folder	directory
my thinking is if i can make a file appear to the system like a folder i can take any directory tree zip it convert it into a file and preserve all the data from being deleted

893419
filesystems	ntfs
had something similar before where a ntfs filesystems would show up normally under linux but corrupt under windows

893445
x86	64bit
no virtual machine hypervisors support 64bit virtual machines in an x86 cpu without virtualization because isolation of the virtual machine would be impossible without it

893462
move	drag
it happens when i manually drag an email from the inbox to a folder and when i have read messages on one workstation and then move to another one

893535
tunnel	vpn
it sounds like your traffic is probably going through your vpn tunnel when that is active

893535
tunnel	vpn
since your vpn client is offloaded to an external device vpn router you will have no software options for split tunnel

893551
bluetooth	usb
i do however have a bunch of usb bluetooth dongles from wireless mice and keyboards i understand that these are pre-paired with the corresponding devices and only need to be connected to the usb port

893551
mouse	keyboard
when i connect one of these dongles to my pc it will detect the dongle as a usb receiver and then when the dongle finds the mice keyboard a regular device will also be detected mouse or keyboard

893551
bluetooth	usb
perhaps if i uninstalled the usb receiver driver and tried to use a generic bluetooth driver it d work

893571
centos	linux
i am a beginning linux user centos currently

893581
folder	directory
your c compilers tcc tcc.exe is not a valid folder directory name

893589
google-chrome	firefox
you will need greasemonkey firefox or tampermonkey google-chrome if you decide to pursue this route

893589
playlists	autoplay
it also has options like enabling or disabling autoplay and does not load additional videos unless you are browsing a playlists

893592

iâ m paying brighthouse 90 month for a 25 2 connection while my phone gets almost 100 30 and i can put it on a mobile hotspot and get comparable speeds

893593
disk	ram
what you can do though is use a usb drive to cache some data from the hard disk that will be heading to ram

893593
disk	ram
for some operations the usb stick will be faster than a spinning hard disk especially on systems that are memory starved less than 1gb of ram on windows 7 but on systems with plenty of ram the speed boost will be negligible

893602
kerberos	ldap
windows is rather picky about the combination of ldap kerberos and file services on the domain controller and all of them are a tiny bit different then what was standardized

893608
opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari
i currently use three or four browsers ie firefox opera and safari on occasion

893682
google-chrome	firefox
i cannot open a website using internet explorer 8 but can using either firefox or google-chrome

893687
openbsd	linux
so my next logical conclusion would be to create a chroot install openbsd in it and chroot into it for that openbsd experience but with linux kernelspace and so reboot

893736
pop-up	dialog
this is useful if with an update a new option is added and you wonder why the config dialog pop-up again

893788
ethernet	wireless
my expectation is that an access point is a black box with an ethernet connector that after given the ssid password simply forwards what comes in on the ethernet cable onto the wireless network and vice versa and doesn t need a windows computer with a fitting driver or such

893794
hide	show
gantt charts in visio are a relatively simple diagram to be able to show hide detail like that you would need a more complex product like microsoft project but then project doesn t have this option either

893846
bash	zsh
also note that it is usually unnecessary to export ps1 in zsh - or bash for that matter

893874
move	drag
to drag the formula move the cursor over the little black box at the lower right of the cell a1

893927
folder	directory

894084
subtract	add
so add up all the value of each column that is 0 then subtract 2 to find the number of hosts

894130
google-chrome	firefox
the slowness that people are experiencing with firefox and google-chrome is due to the various isp along with microsoft using your cpu and ram to calculate and transmit commercial data using bandwidth while you browse the internet

894134
vmware	virtualbox
if you run arch inside vmware or virtualbox check your firewall and antivirus settings of main system

894140

voip	sip
you will need a sip server lookup to authenticate and manage users and then voip clients on the phone and laptop for the users to place call

894243
mouse	keyboard
uninstall microsoft mouse and keyboard center

894243
mouse	keyboard
this is some sort of bonus program that windows update may install if you have a microsoft branded mouse or keyboard possibly on your behalf that as far as i can tell offers little meaningful functionality over standard windows mouse options especially if your mouse keyboard is a basic one

894247
filesystems	ntfs
this function is only supported on the ntfs filesystems

894261

plink	prompt
when i run the command - plink user host -pw password command to execute in a command prompt in b it connects executes the command and returns the output to the screen

894318
plink	prompt
then from the command prompt run your plink commands to connect and then later disconnect from c s ssh service

894318
plink	prompt
the only draw back is that you need to keep the remote command prompt on a open unless you want to run the command to launch plink in the background as described here

894321

after installing recent windows updates the windows upgrade assistant fails to detect my windows 8.1 versioning previously it was able to get past this point

computers behind a router are on the router s lan local area network side and the modem is on the router s wan wide area network side so they are separate networks and the modem would not have a 192.168.x.x ip address since it s not local

894408
mouse	keyboard
whenever i do that an auto-installation routine commences with a window declaring that the microsoft mouse and keyboard center is downloading and eventually will be installed

894408

nb in some cases but not always the aborted installation leaves a trace in form of a install microsoft mouse and keyboard center.lnk on the desktop

ubuntu	linux
both computers are linux ubuntu 3.13 kali 3.14 airlive router

894468

895366
ssd	sata
yes the ssd is connected via sata

895375
ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	linux
as already answered in comments your ubuntu 14.04 will be inaccessible lost as linux mint will format the partition and install its own files

895375
ubuntu	mint
that said it would be premature to say that the current issue with your ubuntu 14.04 would be reproduced in mint ubuntu variant as soon as after install since nothing substantial other than its not starting up somehow or even a hint regarding the inaccessibility of ubuntu is mentioned in question

895379
ubuntu	linux
you could try use boot-repair its an repair tool that solve problems like yours when you can t boot ubuntu after installing windows or another linux distribution or when you can t boot windows after installing ubuntu or when grub is not displayed anymore some upgrade breaks grub etc

895384
macbook	bootcamp	vmware	bootcamp
we have been unable to install windows update kb3033929 on a macbook pro with bootcamp either directly booted to windows or running windows as a vm with vmware fusion

i have read in various places that you might need to connect a lan port from the new router to a lan port from the old router but when i do this the status in the old router says in red letters the wan port is disconnected and it does not have a default gateway when i tried that

895576
bluetooth	usb
the host may also know nothing about bluetooth usb support is enough

895576

896550
packets	multicast
i am not good in networking but it seems to me that usually multicast packets don t go through router

896550
packets	multicast
there might be some key in some network protocol that forces router to retranslate multicast packets to other network

896667
filesystems	ntfs
if you select a windows installation iso set the partition scheme to gpt partition scheme for uefi computers and also set the filesystems to ntfs rufus will add everything required to allow booting ntfs partition from an uefi system

896726
tunnel	vpn
in dd-wrt go to services -- vpn -- openvpn client -- policy based routing add one line for each client whose traffic you want to route through the vpn tunnel

896726
tunnel	wan
as a result the openvpn client no longer routes all traffic through the tunnel and hence also opens up the wan again

896743
filesystems	btrfs
so since i started using btrfs when my computer crashes mainly because battery ran out but on any crashe i had up until now it does not boot anymore the issue seems that the kernel cannot mount the filesystems

what subnet s does each vlan 10-50 use

896792
subnet	vlan
didn t you just write yourself that each vlan has a 24 subnet

896792
subnet	vlan
so vlan 40 would use the 10.0.40.0 24 aka 10.0.40.0 255.255.255.0 subnet just like you wrote in the question and so on

896792
wan	vlan

the current version of linux mint as of this question s date is rebecca 17.1 based on ubuntu trusty tahr 14.04 which is close to be one year old

debian	centos
but i am confident this has 100 nothing to do with one system being centos and another being debian

897470
debian	centos
there is 100 no difference between apache2 and httpd name-wise between debian apache2 and centos httpd

897470
redhat	fedora
those are simply system binary names and the centos redhat fedora core development team seems to prefer the more generic httpd moniker for apache rather than the brand-specific apache2

lastly the vms will be on 1 networks that won t be connected to the host via a bridged nic with the nic disabled on the host and 2 using a vpn without any split tunnel

897564

regardless this solution will not work for the reasons also described in #3 above the vms in question will be on 1 networks that won t be connected to the host via a bridged nic with the nic disabled on the host and 2 using a vpn without any split tunnel

for example if you wanted to work on a webpage that you were building but for some reason your computer didn t have any ethernet or wireless nics then you would still be able to get to the website by using a browser to connect to

wan	lan
as for the rest of the world outside of your lanâ also known as the wan connectionâ the 192.168.1.36 cannot be connected to remotely outside of your lan unless you explicitly set your router to do so via port forwarding or something similar

i m not sure that will be an issue eventhough firefox and google-chrome may use ie settings to connect to internet

897780
wan	lan
currently i can ping my router s lan and wan address from within the local address

897836
ubuntu	linux
since this appears to be a bug with windows 7 for which there does not seem to be a fix i ended up working around the problem by fixing my linux disk by converting the partition table from mbr to gpt using gdisk and then un-borking my grub2 install via an ubuntu live cd and boot-repair

897866
google-chrome	firefox
both google-chrome and firefox will do fine

897869
folder	directory
you double-click the .exe it extracts all files 600 mb to a working folder in the current directory and then automatically executes the program

897869
executable	sfx	folder	directory
so my question is it possible to extract only the main program s executable and its most-used files 13 mb to a working folder in the current directory then point that executable to whatever files it need which are still within the sfx archive

897925
lan	intranet
if you only want to use teamviewer for intranet lan support then you can set it to accept lan connections exclusively and it should not generate or show a 9-digit uid whilst showing the lan ip of the host it is running on instead

move	drag
from there it was a simple drag and drop operation to move my video directory back to the top level

898164
udp	tcp
as far as i understand applications that need to transfer data across network address translators in a peer to peer fashion like bittorrent usually rely on the upnp igd protocol to ask the router to temporarily map an external udp or tcp port to an internal port so that incoming connections can be accepted

898324
vpn	lan
at home i use a vpn and to share it with other devices i use the computer which connects to the vpn as access point for a second lan but i don t want all the traffic be routed through the vpn i want to be able to choose whether to use plain internet or the vpn so i have the following setting

898324

lan and a smarttv which connects to the vpn

898329

prefacing any command you want to run as root with sudo and supplying the user s passwd should do the trick as long as you re logged in as the original user you created

when i want to open a project folder i just type proj project_name and the shell opens the directory and my prompt looks like this

centos	linux
i m on centos 5 linux and using gnu grep v2.5.1 and looking at a 36gb log file

if you absolutely must use gimp for this see if you can get the author of the psd file to export it into some standard non-proprietary format like png or tiff mdash

898560
folder	directory
if it only happens with directory with a lot of files it might be your antivirus scanning the folder

898585
switching	screens
tmux and screens a terminal multiplexers that spawn multiple screens that you can easily switching between in a single terminal

898594
profiling	benchmarking
if you pick a set of benchmarking fix the gpu and profiling them you get a fixed answer

898595
wan	lan
heck if running at 802.11g protocol works better then maybe you should stick to that since the max speed of 802.11g is 54mbps which would only be slow between devices on your lan but more than 5x adequate for your wan connection which seems to max out at around 10mbps anyway

898662
ubuntu	linux
i m new to linux and using ubuntu 14.0

898674
disk	ram
all the tables involved are disk data tables the tablespace is large enough to contain the entire data-set and the system has sufficient ram to hold the indexes and indexed columns

898688
mouse	keyboard
usb ports are backwards compatible so it will detect if the keyboard mouse is usb 1.1 or 2.0 and slow itself down to match the device s usb speed

898712

898855
installation	upgrade
the data from your previous installation will need to be upgrade to be compatible with postgres 9.4+

898855
installation	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
seems like you need two installation of postgres in order to upgrade your database and i didn t care to bother with that so i just recreated the database with the new versioning

898896
wan	lan
the config page claims that it only allows traffic through to the internet so i assume it physically blocks traffic from the guest network to any lan port and only allows it to flow through the wan port

898914
unix	bsd
when you are using the terminal application you are interfacing with a bsd subsystem that follows all the patterns you would expect from a unix or linux operating system

898941
icmp	dhcp
any firewall or antivirus installed should have a configuration that allows for icmp dns dhcp and http https

898991

google-chrome	firefox
this is apparently enough to cause large cpu spikes using the latest versions of ie google-chrome or firefox

899185

this could be a result of hyperthreading where there are multiple virtual cores per each physical cpu core

899190

folder	directory
i am trying to use mklink to create a directory junction but both the target and the fake has a folder name that includes spaces

899259
udp	tcp
why did the designers of ip and udp and tcp choose to use the ip checksum to detect errors rather than a more robust error detection code such as crc-32

899260
hash	md5
also nice is that quickhash works on all platforms and computes compares hash from md5 thru sha512 used on live updated isos

899273
google-chrome	firefox
my conundrum is this while watching a stream video the flash player on firefox plays the sound on the laptop while on google-chrome it plays the sound on the tv

899309
folder	directory
though renaming a shared folder itself does not affect the name of that shared folder in the dropbox of other members you can create rename or delete subfolders within the main shared folder and this will immediately update in the shared directory tree of other members

899312
post	get
i saw an answer to this question in a post already but i am wanting to know if there is a way to do multiple files at one time versus clicking on each shortcut file individually to get the url

899335
put	get
if i put call it from within crontab does not seem to get incremented i check it with

899337
mtu	pppoe
if your internet connection uses pppoe your mtu probably needs to be no larger than 1492

899337
mtu	icmp
most other sites use the typical ethernet mtu of 1500 so if you ve got a hop on your route that can t handle that mtu and doesn t handle fragmentation and icmp fragmentation notifications properly most sites will hang or only partially load but google sites will work fine

899363

to be totally honest most of my linux experience is with ubuntu mint and fedora and i ve never had any real driver problems so this is all pretty new to me

i want to be able to switch easily between using my laptop and using my desktop with the same mouse monitor keyboard without having to plug unplug anything from my desktop each time i switch devices

899697
mouse	keyboard
i suppose there is a device that lets you plugin a keyboard mouse and monitor and connect that device to both the laptop and desktop

899697
mouse	keyboard
the device then decides which computer will be connected to the mouse keyboard monitor

900362
xfs	btrfs
if the main use case is storing vm images or databases and you are not interested in accepting the potential performance issues in order to get the data integrity advantages of btrfs then i can t think of any reason why you would want to choose btrfs over xfs or ext4

900362
filesystems	btrfs
then it can be very convenient to just disable copy-on-write for that single directory yet still retaining all of the advantages of btrfs for the rest of the filesystems

900376
vmware	virtualbox
virtual machine software like vmware virtualbox virtualpc also allow you to take snapshots of the whole operating system image including your 500gb and roll them back

as long as the cpu is at least a dual core hopefully with intel hyperthreading and the cpu can keep up with the amount of data you need to process you will have no noticeable impact on performance even when running three code editors flash cs5 a couple of browsers and xampp

my fried has an android tablet with an option in wireless networks for ethernet he would like to connect the tab to the router to use internet in the tab because the router doesn t have wireless and connecting an android phone tab which has reverse teathering enabled by default to a pc with internet doesn t works for which i have asked here for a solution but no luck

if you used the rsync option that preserves extended attributes that is the -e option on the apple supplied version of rsync then the files will be joined automatically on the hfs+ filesystems

900708
disk	ram
the key reason why you can not use an ssd as ram is because it is connected to the computer as if it were a disk drive rather than ram

900708
ssd	sata
that is to say that the processor can not directly address the memory in the ssd but instead has to hand a block of ram to the sata controller and ask it to transfer data between that ram and an area in the drive

even if you change the filesystems from ntfs to ext4 the default filesystems used by linux to access it from both linux and windows with fastboot enabled or in hibernation the danger is still the same

to make this change you will need to use ubuntu or any other linux distribution

stdout	stderr
if editing the_command is an option you could make sure that the question is output to stderr instead that should dump it to screen regardless of any redirects and then have it echo whatever the user types back to screen via stdout

there are usually 2 important output pipes stdout for regular output and stderr for error messages

it could be that your centos environment was being lax like this but your ubuntu box is being more careful about which interface is which

902922
ubuntu	centos
or it may be that you ve enabled ip forwarding the simplest version of being an ip router on the centos box but not on your ubuntu box

for pppoe your max mtu should be no more than 1492 to allow space for the 8 byte pppoe wrapperâ

903048
mtu	pppoe
for pppoe the stakes are high if you get your mtu wrong you may not just be sub-optimal things like uploading files or the loading of web pages may stall or not work at all

903048
mtu	icmp
add 28 to the largest packet size that does not result in fragmenting the packets since the ping command specifies the ping packet size not including the ip icmp header of 28 bytes and this is your max mtu setting

903048
mtu	pppoe
add 28 to the highest number pinged with no error for both pppoe and non-pppoe and that sum is your max mtu setting

affinity	processors
there are no processors affinity tools at the user level

903143
affinity	processors
all you would need to do is fork a call to your app because according to this api doc all forked children of the shell app will share its affinity namespace so if you are using processors 1 then any app called from the shell is going to be run on processors 1

903148
ethernet	wireless
i have 2 wireless routers and the isp modem which has an integrated router with 4 ethernet ports

so upgrade to a newer build 10041 or 10049 because build 9841 will no longer boot after 2015-04-30 if you haven t applied the patch or use the 32bit versioning

903249
disk	ram
all usual distributions of linux are preconfigured to aggressivly use ram as a disk cache if - and only if - it is not needed elsewhere the head of the output of top will look something like

903291
sudo	passwd
if you have physical access to the box you can fix it as root without - probably not unless you have another user account on the box that isn t in enforced passwd change and that can sudo or su to root

i have just upgrade my versioning of lamp environment

903367

post publishing owa rule on a tmg server clients get error â œyou could

903406
vmware	esx
given that you added the number 11 to it i assume that you are looking for vmware workstation 11 and not for esx or player

903487
redhat	fedora	centos	linux
the latter prompt that you have seen is the default on red hat-based systems such as redhat enterprise linux centos and fedora

903487

versioning	upgrade
by default windows 7 creates a separate system partition when it s installed from scratch as opposed to upgrade from a previous versioning of windows on an unpartitioned hard drive

903640
filesystems	ntfs
you can shrink primary partitions and logical drives on raw partitions those without a filesystems or partitions using the ntfs

903643

on google-chrome and safari i get the message loading the player... while nothing happens

903654

h.264	webm
ensure mse media source extensions required for mpeg-dash adaptive streaming and h.264 webm are supported by your browser â see below for more

903715
mp4	webm
actually even if either mp4 or webm is enabled that should suffice but if one doesn t work try enabling the other.

903725
sudoers	passwd
now i m trying to find the differences between the two user accounts and the only differences are their username passwd and user2 is in the sudoers group

903726

for example fat32 old dos and windows pcs ntfs later windows hfs+ mac ext4 some linuxes and many others

903731
filesystems	fat
for example the the fat family of filesystems indicate a file has been deleted by over-writing the first byte of the filename in a directory entry with the byte value 0x3f

903731
filesystems	fat
other filesystems are similar though generally less information is available -- the fat family are especially easy to recover files from

903760
osx	yosemite
this occurs only after i upgraded to osx 10.10 yosemite

903766
vpn	lan
the vpn is using the subnet 10.3.15.0 24 and has 192.168.1.14 on the lan

903766
gentoo	linux
the server runs alpine linux while the client runs gentoo

903783
filesystems	ntfs
apparently this is not uncommon when copying to remote filesystems especially when they re not ntfs

903794
folder	directory
how can i create a new terminal command that copies a folder this will always be the same folder and it s contents to either the current directory if no path is supplied or to the path supplied

when i right click properties details the frame height and width doesn t exist

903878
width	height
i finally ended up finding a player that could play 4k but i m curious why the files don t have height width

903878
width	height
i m kinda curious about all these problems but mostly about why the file details don t include frame width height

903881
filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	fat
since windows already has a convert command which converts fat to ntfs all they managed to do was convert their filesystems

903881
filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	fat
they got lucky and it still worked since their computer didn t care if the filesystems was fat or ntfs

903914
ubuntu	yosemite
last week i installed the os x yosemite hackintosh to triple boot with windows and ubuntu and all was working well until yesterday

903929
stdout	stderr
gui s don t have stdin stdout and stderr

903929
stdout	stderr
it s run expecting there to be no console output since it s non-interactive it cannot just interrupt any logged in user to show the output anyhow and if there is output stdin is the bitbucket null stdout and stderr get logged to the system logging facility

903953
ubuntu	linux
one usually does not win time by not reinstalling linux oftentimes one ends up losing time due to troubleshooting and fixing the mess left after windows blasts through the neighborhood and tips over every garbage can. so backup your ubuntu files and clean your disk

903953
ubuntu	linux
then start by restoring windows 8 and then install latest ubuntu or other linux distro of your choice

903971
switching	screens
this is happening because the switching is physically switching the power to the hdmi output away from the computer making the pc think you have unplugged the screens

903987
osx	yosemite
when i created a filevault encrypted partition to install osx yosemite i don t think i created a recovery key

903998
folder	directory
which will copy the contents of path to source folder into the newly created directory foo

903999
bluetooth	usb
you can see i have disabled the bluetooth usb and virtualbox adapters that i m not using but if you are still having issues you can try uninstalling the wan drivers and then use the action - scan for hardware changes option to try and reinstalls them

904004
disk	ram
i know for sure there were not any hardware changes and understand that ram or hard disk can causing the problems

904028
ubuntu	debian
i m using debian and ubuntu

904070
google-chrome	firefox
in windows 8 you can use ctrl + l shortcut to select address bar in google-chrome and firefox

904086
folder	directory
if you don t simply want to use mkdir -p and then a cp then you may as well create a fairly robust function to copy it wall always be the same folder to the directory name given by dirnm as the first argument in the current working directory if no second argument given or to destpath dirnm if a path representing destpath is given in argument as the second argument

904088
google-chrome	firefox
i m planning on running a openvpn service on my raspberry pi to encrypt only browser data from google-chrome or firefox and therefore i ll be setting up the rpi as a openvpn server

904167
cpu	processors
wmic cpu will give you a complete list of information regarding your processors

904320
tunnel	vpn
you can do this externally by creating a vpn tunnel into the router

904373
filesystems	xfs
xfs chooses inode numbers based on where on disk they re allocated not contiguously from 0 so large xfs filesystems can have 32bit inode numbers even if they don t have billions of files

904378
google-chrome	safari
linux x86_64 applewebkit 537.36 khtml like gecko google-chrome 42.0.2311.90 safari 537.36 firephp 4chrome

904382
sorting	grouping
ideally i d like for the original email the mechanic sends to the grouping address to automatically be flagged - this would make sorting through claimed emails much easier.

904394
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
however i cannot browse reliably on any browser google-chrome safari firefox or perform some other http tasks like curl on the command line

904398
wmv	flv	mp3	wmv	mp3	flv
if i reboot the computer most multimedia files play fine mp3 mp4 flv avi wmv etc

904403
google-chrome	firefox
there is a google-chrome extension that will allow you to imitate different user agents including firefox 27

904419
ubuntu	debian
i took baldoz s http idea and generalized it for ubuntu and debian added a little sed and wrapped it in a bash function one-liner

904419
ubuntu	debian
lsb_release -si returns ubuntu or debian replace that with the base url or

904419
ubuntu	debian
note it doesn t search ppas alternate apt sources repos and only queries official packages available for the release of debian ubuntu you are running

904457
ubuntu	debian
whenever i setup a user on ubuntu debian i use adduser which works fine

904478
traceroute	packets
further running ping and traceroute tests from the cisco device to public servers never indicate any amount of packets loss

904500
arp	dhcp
however only dhcp offers were made static but the router s ipâ mac neighbour cache aka the arp cache is still filled in dynamically using arp

904500
arp	dhcp
arp binding won t necessarily affect dhcp but it does add a fixed ipâ mac entry to the router s neighbour cache

904500
subnet	packets
note though when two hosts within the same subnet communicate they don t go through the router but send packets directly to each other

904500
arp	dhcp
so far arp binding primarily sounds like a security feature â it partially avoids arp spoofing attacks and works even if dhcp is turned off entirely

904527
mouse	keyboard
avoided the mouse and keyboard

904529
ubuntu	linux
i am trying to run some script on linux ubuntu precise pangolin 12.04 x86_64 machine and it complains that the file

traceroute to 172.16.111.99 172.16.111.99 30 hops max 60 byte packets

904920
switching	screens
so far you should disable the shortcuts as mentioned above and without running tmux switching to the alternate screens and test if the keys indeed emit something

904927
versioning	upgrade
if you upgrade everything to the newest versioning it should work from xterm and gnome-terminal

904936
postgresql	mysql
lists oracle db2 mysql postgresql sybase teradata exchange

904951
dnf	yum
you have no repo data on the usb use createrepo pkg or run sudo yum dnf install mnt usb teamviewer_linux.rpm after removing the local repo which is pointing at thin air according to that paste

vim	emacs
i can read file containing japanese characters in unicode just fine whether i m using less emacs or vim and connecting from putty or a remote xterm with cygwin

904998
pem	pkcs#12
i m using openssl to convert the pkcs#12 file to a pair of pem files one for a private key the other for a public key

905058
switching	screens
i often use alt+tab to switching between windows but the app switcher dialog always appears on the main screens which may be a different screens from the one iâ m currently working on

905111
wan	lan
i mean the windows server itself should not be exposed directly to wan instead it should be accesible through lan only and from wan only using port forwarding in the router

905121
macports	homebrew
if you want to get rid of those attackers have a look at fail2ban even if it is 3rd party - its available via homebrew and macports and can also be applied to vnc

905125
folder	directory
when i run this it works down the sheet creating a directory named after column 1 and then a sub folder in that named after column 2

905131

and when executing this it will create a new directory at the destination and copy current folder contents

905173
folder	directory
on mac os x terminal how can we remove all files and folder including hidden ones recursively except one directory

chown	sudo
sudo chown nobody folder changes both the owner and the group of the file

905207
ubuntu	linux
disclaimer i am not an experienced linux user and i am trying to diagnose a case where my ubuntu goes away and doesn t come back

905207
mouse	keyboard
the pc is a headless pc without keyboard and mouse plugged in that is usually controlled via ssh wlan but with the option to plug in peripherals

905212
folder	directory
currently when i browse to attrave.com it takes me to the var www directory when it should really take me to the actual attrave.com folder

905219
hide	show
i d much rather have the icons always show by default but with the ability to manually hide individual ones just as the op has requested

905219
post	get
if at some point i get around to writing that utility i ll post it back here

905248

why does telnet protocol use only 1 port while the ftp protocol uses 2 ports on the server

905279
width	height
firstly you need to know the height and width of the original pdf in points there are 72 points in an inch

905281
ubuntu	linux
the linux distribution is sans sift which i believe runs on top of ubuntu 14

905284
ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	linux
not tested but believed to be safe. this is the case on linux mint which is based on ubuntu anyway

905307
bash	zsh
you can try recursively either with using globstar bash zsh set by shopt -s globstar

905320
versioning	upgrade
the problem is that i ve upgrade chrome on an offline vm using the same versioning as the client 42.0.2311.90 m with the standalone setup and i can t see this behavior tried the same website as well as other internal sites with sha1 expiring after 2017 certificates

905410
sudoers	visudo
from single user mode after remounting the root filesystem in read write mode run visudo to safely edit your etc sudoers file

google-chrome	firefox
i am using google-chrome but keyboard shortcut being disabled seems to be enforced by all browsers i tried firefox too

905460
button	checkbox
but the defaults don t include the don t add space checkbox so you can t change that with the set as default button

for dhe cipher suites it contains the modulus p generator g and server dh public key y in that order each expressed as a big integer in the format described above 16-bit header that contains the length in bytes then the integer value in unsigned big-endian encoding

905581
ubuntu	linux
if you were to switch to a linux based system such as ubuntu you won t need an antivirus program as most viruses target windows and mac based systems

905763
width	height
that s achieves the outcome but to make it look nice you ll want to center the cells and adjust cell width and height

905765
swift	objective-c
are there any alternatives out there like some kind of wysiwyg drag and drop editor where i can create my own ui and then have it exported to objective-c swift code that i can just drop into xcode

905805
width	height
x264 requires that the width and height be divisible by 2 when outputting yuv420p so the -2 will deal with that assuming your declared value is acceptable

905813
folder	directory
i ve also given execute permission to the folder where the file is located all the way to the home directory and i ve restarted apache service after doing all this changes

905813

see why have cpu manufacturers stopped increasing the clock speeds of their processors

906227
floating-point	integer
the processor may have multiple functional units of a particular type such as integer alus and or different types of functional units such as floating-point and integer units to which instructions may be concurrently sent

ancient history there was an incident about a year ago where there was a burning smell and it turned out to be a power cable to the ssd becoming loose and arcing but i managed to resurrect that by using a different sata power plug on the psu lead the original lead that was used was an adaptor from a molex or another cable on the psu and not one of the dedicated sata leads

906904
sudo	passwd
someone just reminded me that when one uses sudo one is asked for the non-root-user s-password not the root passwd

906906
sudo	passwd
sshd checks your passwd when you login using sshd - commands you execute thereafter are not checked by sshd - including sudo su etc

906913
switching	screens
i did not use the -k kiosk switching as i found opening pdf etc would also run in full screens kiosk mode and cause user s grief

906914
bmp	png
is this possible convert bmp to png while maintaining quality

906918
bmp	png
you shouldnâ t be that concerned about speed in a conversion process like this since bmp and png are lossless image formats but png is lossless and compressed

906918
bmp	png
meaning you should not experience any quality loss at all as your conversion program simply shuffles the bits from bmp to png format

906918
bmp	png
so depending on your computerâ s speed and powerâ as well as the size of the images being handleâ beingâ â œslowâ when converting from bmp to png is really a non-factor

906918
bmp	png
both are lossless formats with the main difference being that png compresses the data while bmp is basically raw and uncompressed data

this is no longer possible with the current version of synergy 1.7.1 + osx 10.10 yosemite check this issue

907594
daemons	systemd
one workaround is to use auto-login ew for the user with the agent daemons but then you can t lock your systemd by logging out

907594

interestingly enough you can show the login window while still logged in and the keyboard works but not the mouse

907674
filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	fat
so filesystems support for identifying bad sectors was a necessity and exists in fat and ntfs though by the time ntfs appeared with nt in 1993 i think these types of drives no longer existed or were on the way out

907674
filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	fat
the filesystems support for marking clusters as bad is still there in fat and ntfs but never used basically

907698
versioning	upgrade
regardless the only way to get around this is to not use the newer features in your database or to upgrade the other versioning of access

907717

908543
range	min
but in looking at what you re trying to accomplish-showing your kpi s within a range of min max-i suggest choosing a slightly different and easier chart

908546
google-chrome	firefox
similarly is there and browser setting in google-chrome firefox browser or that changes this behaviour

908556
wan	lan
i own a router which has 4 lan ports and 1 wan port

908572
wan	lan
in that case you would connect the 3 outer lan connections to a switch and the inner router s wan port to the same switch

908574
dpkg	aptitude
once you re up and running you should be able to use dpkg --add-architecture to tell your system you want amd64 packages as well as i386 ones and a subsequent apt-get update or aptitude update will offer both i386 and amd64 versions of packages

at higher levels beyond your home router there is no such strict separation between lan and wan

909508
ubuntu	linux
linux ubuntu gnome 15.10 latest patches

909596
rpm	yum
but uuencode uudecode is not on my system and as i look around the yum rpm process is ugly--this gives me the clue that maybe no one uses it any more and instead there is something more modern to do this

909596
rpm	yum
would like it to be something that tends to be in the native install so i don t need to yum rpm it if possible

909621

909750
folder	directory
look for processes executing out of odd directory in your home folder

909768
vpn	lan
a vpn is designed to extend a lan to a remote location and to do so in a way that shields the interior packets from the systems in between so its like you are abstracting away all the networks in between and tracerouting to a system in the same room you are in which may have only 1 hop

909768
tunnel	packets
the intermediary systems is between the endpoints can interact with the outside of the tunnel the packets with ssl encrypted payloads but cannot interact with the packets segments inside the tunnel which is the whole reason you are tunnel in the first place

909768
tunnel	packets
the packets inside the tunnel experience one hop no matter how many hops the outer packets takes between endpoints

909768
tunnel	packets
i suspect that if the remote endpoint system was configured to respond to udp ttl expired packets you would simply see one hop from your endpoint to the remote endpoint no matter how many iss the tunnel uses to reach the destination

909865
ethernet	wireless
it might be a better solution to look at using powerline networking or ac wireless bridges to connect via ethernet to your console

909865
ethernet	wireless
bridges would act as a wireless client where you would use an ethernet cable to connect your ps3 to a standalone device for an internet connection

wan	lan	wan	subnet
if so you need give the tp-link a static ip in the same subnet as the cisco lan on the wan interface

910088

911539
versioning	upgrade
i m running windows 7 as a virtual machine in parallels upgrade from versioning 8 to 10 if that makes a difference

911563
wan	subnet
if the wan is set at interface b ignoring the tp the next hop is 103.6.148.45 is 103.100.172.157 and 101.100.172.157 in the same subnet then

911568
bluetooth	usb
dell wireless 375 bluetooth module usb

911568
bluetooth	usb
aside from devices that are internal to the laptop chassis for instance the bluetooth module the only usb device i have connected to the laptop is a thinkpad compact usb keyboard with trackpoint

911568
mouse	keyboard
i have noticed that the dropouts occur far less often when i do not move the mouse or type on the keyboard

911568
mouse	keyboard
by occur far less often i mean that i can listen to an entire 4-5 minute song and only hear 2 or 3 instances of dropouts when i do not move the keyboard or mouse at all

911568
mouse	keyboard
but as soon as i start to use the keyboard or mouse even a little bit the dropouts come back and persist for several seconds

911568
mouse	keyboard
as long as it is plugged in i get at least periodic dropouts even when i am not touching either keyboard or mouse

911568
bluetooth	usb
i have verified that the bluetooth module and the keyboard are on separate usb hubs

911583
wan	lan
it will similarly have interfaces for each atm circuit as well as virtual ethernet-over-atm interfaces and will usually act as a nat router between atm wan and ethernet wifi lan

911583
wan	subnet
if the wan is set at interface b ignoring the tp the next hop is 103.6.148.45 is 103.100.172.157 and 101.100.172.157 in the same subnet then

911589
antivirus	norton
anyway i would recommend you to scan computer using a good antivirus such as kaspersky is norton security etc and not that free ones even a trial version will do the work

911598
ethernet	wireless
i have followed the instructions of one article to bridge the lan connection and wireless connection on my laptop and all i would have to do after that is connect the two computers with an ethernet cable and my desktop would have access to the internet through my laptop

911813
tunnel	vpn
i want to tunnel all traffic to and from port 23456 through the vpn

911833
hebrew	farsi
very often pdf files in non-latin scripts especially rtl scripts such as arabic hebrew and farsi are generated by software which sort of ltr-i-fies the text at the word or sentence-fragment level or just somehow gets the right glyphs to display but you get gibberish for the logical text

911834
put	get
i still can t get the scene to show if i put it back into the original port though

911871

you can do all your operations like before with keyboard and mouse and after that stop record you can take a look at the generated macro-code

911925

i have not managed to find a way to search the content in osx s calibre in yosemite 10.10.3

911983
disk	ram
smc pram reset reseating the ram verify repair disk and permissions safe mode reboot clean install of the osâ everything humanly possible

911994
folder	dir
the solution was to explore a dir with 7zip file manager and rename the folder by removing a white space from the end

911998
sudo	passwd
is it safe to sudo htpasswd etc nagios3 htpasswd.users nagiosadmin and key in a new passwd

912008

now if i restart my server the bundled nginx will start before apache and listen on 80 port before

912026
arp	dhcp
if it was my network i d identify the rogue dhcp server ip then identify which port their drop is on using the arp tables in the switch and disable them

912041
sudoers	passwd
you can add the user to etc sudoers edited from etc passwd that was a mistake

912055
peer	p2p
when you use a descentralized protocol like bittorrent you are using a p2p protocol who doesnt use a server to get the data so assuming that you are not allowed to made an default route cause your dont know the list of peer who can share that data with you from the beginning and assuming you have 3 adsl conections running in your pc you haves 3 pppoe miniports running at once so for your aplication you are only 1 host

912059
cpu	processors
but the cpu has a 64 bit system bus and the two separate pipelines are receiving information simultaneously is it considered a 32bit processors or a 64 bit processors

912064

i ran sudo chown -r www-data www-data var www but still getting the same 403

912186
ethernet	wireless
this router is wireless with four ethernet ports

912189
folder	directory
use directory blocks in the vhost config to restrict access at the folder level

912198
filesystems	ntfs
from a filesystems point of view i guess this is probably not a restriction of the underlying ntfs

912236
disk	ram
possibly but the thing you really need is free ram because tiny amounts of free ram force windows to actively use the cache disk witch is pretty slow

912242
google-chrome	firefox
i am using google-chrome firefox and word office

912244
disk	ram
the ram use that task manager shows includes ram used by the windows disk cache which windows proactively tries to keep as well-used as possible ram without useful data in it is after all useless ram

912244
disk	ram
any process asking for ram will cause windows to give it pages from free ram then from the disk cache

912244
disk	ram
only when disk cache ram is completely exhausted by ram allocation requests from processes does windows start swapping process ram out to disk and since you re not seeing disk activity that s not what s happening to you

912266
mouse	trackpad	mouse	keyboard
- the keyboard trackpad and ports will stop working except for the bluetooth mouse i m using

versioning	upgrade
if you want to continue to use skype you will have to upgrade to the newest versioning and either use pulseaudio or try one of the known workarounds like apulse

912316
mouse	keyboard
some users don t understand that you can only use the keyboard on burg and i was requested to enable the use of the mouse in it

912350
mouse	keyboard
in my case it was an xp pro sp3 machine so the energy switch was not available however the devicequery switch indicated that it was either the mouse or the keyboard

912393
switching	airplane
additionally the switching used to toggle wi-fi on and off is no longer present and toggling airplane mode does nothing

912410
chown	sudo
sudo chown -r ryan www-data www

912812
udp	tcp
in dig responses a message size 512 would cause a switch from udp to tcp but i tried a few and theyâ re all below that

912820
centos	linux
im pretty new to centos and linux in general but all ports necessary are opened....the only problem is that the server kills the internet...

912846
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu on the other hand inherits almost all of its packages and patches from debian which operates differently

912851
sudo	passwd
use diskutil unmount dev disk1 to unmount the drive and this command doesn t require a sudo and therefore doesn t need the administrator s passwd

912860
wan	lan
lan ip address is the address given to your host within your local area network while your wan ip would be the address given to your routers interface that is connected to the internet usually at your point of demarcation between you and your isp

912888
icmp	tcp
if icmp is blocked you can t ping the host in the normal way however if it is running an exposed tcp service you can use tcping

912945
vpn	lan
i connect to vpn through the cabled lan over internet to other lan and so my pc will get a local lan ip from that other lan

912964
hide	show
as i know stty -echo command hide stdin in terminal and stty echo enable stdin show in terminal

xfce	gnome
i can access this shortcut when i run gnome or xfce

912990
opera	google-chrome
now when i download i only get 6-12 mb s in opera or google-chrome

913015
stdout	stderr
redirect both stdout and stderr to dev null

913015
stdout	stderr
i used to think the latter would work because looks like an arrow which makes me think of pointers as does the word redirect and if i point stderr to stdout and then point stdout to dev null then both should be pointing to dev null

913027
wan	lan
wake up on lan wan is enabled

913032
installation	upgrade
so will i get an upgrade to windows 10 or should i just enter my installation disk and go back to windows 8.1 pro

913035
chown	sudo
you can easily change the permissions using the sudo chown -r command on your data folder

913037
rpm	yum
thus if you yum update only installed one of the packages you will end up with a broken yum and rpm

913037
rpm	yum
you might see error messages like these when trying to run yum and rpm commands

913037
rpm	yum
rerun yum update to update nss-softokn-freebl and fix yum and rpm

google-chrome	firefox
i m viewing the website from the uk via a decent consistent internet connection 80mb 20mb yet it performs extremely slowly on google-chrome firefox and ie11

perhaps it was upgrade from an earlier versioning of windows maybe xp

913081
sorting	filtering
this includes predefining sorting and filtering values

913112
udp	tcp
how do i make tcp and udp traffic on 5900 go to 3389

913117
filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	fat
another thing to try is creating an ntfs or fat filesystems on the second partition on each disk

913149
hide	show
i am trying to set up a way to mask hide my public ip and location so i can surf the internet anonymously and even use it to potentially show me in another country so i can access other country websites like netflix usa

913155
tunnel	vpn
you could use a virtual machine service such as amazon to host a server you can use to tunnel traffic through but a vpn service is generally more straightforward

913159
ssd	sata
from my understanding both the sd card and the ssd hard disk reliability is measure by the number of writes while the sata hard disk is measure by the total number of hours before they fail to store data

913165
ubuntu	linux
this is on ubuntu linux

913167
ubuntu	linux
this article will provide you with a step-by-step guide on how to set up a linux host machine that is running ubuntu

913176
switching	screens
when i set gta v to run in fullscreen and if i switching between the game and the desktop the screens goes black for around 2 seconds then it recovers

913176
switching	screens
if gta v was in windowed mode and if i switching between the desktop and the game the screens would not go to a black screens

913182
switching	screens
upon switching from a windows application back to your screens all of that has to re-initalize and those few seconds of black screens is the result

913183
wan	lan
this router has 300 mbps wireless but wan lan port only supports 100 mbps

913216
tunnel	vpn
as bigchris said the vpn should be ok once the tunnel is up but only if the host servers are actually secure and haven t got malware or bugs in the os

913258
google-chrome	firefox
i am working on a production issue which only occurs in ie10 and not in google-chrome firefox

913292
ubuntu	linux
i was on ubuntu and i wanted to move playonlinux to another partition to have more space on my linux partition so while checking my partitions format and i found a partition that linux categorized as free space

913302
tunnel	vpn
when you use a vpn you are opening something like a tunnel from your pc to the vpn server

913302
tunnel	vpn
that tunnel is an encrypted connection from your pc to the vpn server passing trough your isp his routers etc

913302
tunnel	vpn	tunnel	packets
when you are using a vpn and issue a ping the icmp packets goes inside the tunnel to the vpn server so you can t ping isp router or the intermediate routers

913368
freebsd	linux
on freebsd or most linux systems you can pipe the output of diff through cat -v -e -t to show whitespace differences

915281
subnet	packets
does the ip address of this outgoing packets fall within the subnet mask of any network interfaces

915281

there are a few annoyance like having to deal with a dialog box when you turn it on and dealing with a pop-up box whenever you try to edit a cell

i know this is probably related to stdin stdout and stderr things

915611
filesystems	fat
the problem is that the fat filesystems does not implement the concept of file owners so your chown command which works on ext2 3 4 partitions is doomed to fail

915623
freetype	libpng
brew install freetype libpng pkg-config

915634
switching	screens
as dean says yes you can use two laptops with the one screens and switching between them using the controls on the front panel

you could try with older simpler filesystems such as fat

915670
google-chrome	firefox
is there a way to block google-chrome or firefox from accessing anything located in localhost

915676
filesystems	fat
also be aware that some efis can be finicky about the fat filesystems on their esps

915693
filesystems	ntfs
while doing so i see the filesystems is raw it was ntfs primary partition shows 931.51 gb and properties shows 0 bytes used 0 bytes free space

915695
versioning	upgrade
the reason this will be important in your setup is you only have two drives so if you choose to use some of one of the 146gb drive s space when you go to upgrade to the next versioning of esxi down the road it will want to repartition that whole drive

915722
opera	firefox
i cant use firefox opera

915782
ethernet	wireless
what i m trying to achieve is i want to connect a router to the host s ethernet so pfsense assign an ip address to my router so i can connect wireless to the router and the router go directly through pfsense and finally coming out from pfsense through the wireless of the host

915807
osx	yosemite
how can i instruct osx to boot from my yosemite installation instead of the install os x mavericks container

915836
filesystems	ntfs
next i would have to modify the initrd to not only mount the ntfs filesystems somewhere but also to apply the posixovl to it mount it again

915837
cifs	smb
on a smb cifs network using netbios over tcp the group name x01 x02__msbrowse__ x02 x01 is registered which is the master browser for the subnet

one thought is to use a vnc solution to connect with the iphone then run some sort of keyboard mouse macro software on the mac

915864
google-chrome	safari
the final result is an mp4 that runs fine with the html tag on mac osx safari google-chrome and android google-chrome

915975
mouse	keyboard
the dongles will not be able to connect to your bluetooth speakers most likely unless they are bluetooth mouse keyboard

915975

916044
debian	linux
my os debian linux is on a ssd the raid will not contain an os

916051
asterisk	pbx
then you use pbx software such as asterisk to mediate the calls

916051
pbx	voicemail
the advantage of this over just plugging a hardware phone into the broadband line with a splitter is that you get to take advantage of the features of a pbx like voicemail voicemail to email fax to emails

916093
put	get
here you are at that magic moment when you get to put your hard work the backup back online by restoring the drive from which the backup was created

i have recently set my firewall settings to default and since that moment i can t access the websites hosted on iis on my machine or on machines in the same local network as me from the web browsers google-chrome ie firefox

for me this seems to be the directory entry on a fat filesystems not the actual contents of the file

916172
hide	show
the view menu is completely greyed out when colors are selected and there is no show hide option on my menus if it wasn t

916181

delete all files from current directory and sub-directories but leaving the folder structure

916217
robocopy	xcopy
look into robocopy xcopy or copy commands for windows

916217
folder	directory
ie recursively copy within a directory don t copy specific files folder etc.

916234
filesystems	hfs+
using this you should be able to copy the files to a more suitable location where you can work with them more freely without being restricted by the read-only limitation of hfs+ filesystems support

916237
mouse	keyboard
i can t log out of the session because the usb ports are disabled so i have neither keyboard nor mouse access to the system once it is logged in

916241
folder	directory
after the download is complete extract the folder android-sdk-linux to your home directory

916283
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome firefox so i can make sure

916325
osx	yosemite
sounds like you have both installed osx yosemite iirc installs 1.8 by default try adding 1.7 to your java --alternatives and or use the defined path symlinks are lovely for this

916358
folder	directory
i also discovered that if i create a folder on the program files directory it creates the same folder on the other drive

916362
mouseup	mousedown
if i use spy++ to monitor window messages then i can clearly see that s there s a series of mousedown mouseup mousedown messages like this

916369
ubuntu	linux
i now need to access the same data from a machine running ubuntu linux 14.04

916369
ubuntu	linux

916397
mouse	keyboard
then 3-4 minutes of totally dead keyboard mouse network even hdd led on

916410
ethernet	wireless
when i try to bridge the wireless network that has internet with the ethernet network adapter that has no internet windows doesn t bridge them and disables the ethernet

916410
wan	lan
would i then be able to connect my router s lan wan port to the ethernet port and share the internet

916419
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
this was true for both safari and google-chrome not firefox however but was not the case with incognito private browsing windows

916422
asterisk	pbx	asterisk	freeswitch	freeswitch	pbx
bought second-hand it is cheaper than many quality fxo cards which you would need to build an asterisk or freeswitch pbx yourself

916422
asterisk	freeswitch
also the time to set up and debug asterisk freeswitch to work reliably with any fxo card is substantial whereas the linksys box can do basic call processing by itself after configuring it via a web page

916422
asterisk	voicemail
later on you can integrate it with a separate asterisk server if you want more configurability or voicemail storage etc

916438

it looks like the main codec for decode raw data from hard phones is g723 g729 but i didn t found any resources on it for get it for linux ubuntu

916622
hide	show
could have even moved usr sbin sshd to tmp sshd then moved the malicious sshd to usr sbin sshd to attempt to hide it from that type of proc analysis but when tmp sshd gets moved back to usr sbin sshd the proc sshd pid exe symlink will show in ls as

916638
wan	lan
if i apply a rule to drop all packets to wan_local will that block requests to the management interfaces from the wan but allow requests from the lan since there is no lan_local ruleset

916708
tunnel	vpn
things like gateway anti-virus web filtering anti-spam vpn tunnel etc

916750
tunnel	vpn
a layer 2 or 3 vpn ipsec l2tp will send the entire dns datagram through the tunnel so presumably the isp would not see it as long as you are not using the isp dns servers

916813
google-chrome	firefox
but on my huge monitor with tons of windows floating around i never know if the browser window is google-chrome or firefox

916828

916956

i can only use external device usb keyboard and mouse

917004
rbenv	homebrew
what you re asking for per-dir homebrew config is effectively a virtual machine or container since it goes beyond virtualizing a language ex ruby via rbenv python via virtualenv and instead is for all system packages

917061
cpu	processors
processors intel r atom tm cpu n455 1.66ghz 2 cpus 1.7ghz

917063
udp	tcp
because the whole thing used tcp instead of udp we didn t see any frameskipping - we just had to deal with transmit delays which were incredibly tiny because we could precisely configure the source video quality and transmission bitrate and since the data was point-to-point and there were no relays involved there was virtually zero latency

917069
mouse	keyboard
the interesting thing is that if a key is pressed on the keyboard of the offending pc or the mouse is nudged the pc will continue to shut down and will be powered off within around 10 seconds

917074
virtualenv	conda
now conda allows for different python environments similar to virtualenv but it only ships with an activation.bat script for switching the environments

917082
bash	zsh
the windows command prompt does not support running programs as do bash or zsh

917087
post	get
when i turn it on i get a white screen directly there is no big xmg logo before and i do not see any post process it just gets to that white screen and does nothing after that

917094
subnet	packets
the solution was to add an acl entry for the vm s default gateway or in case of a custom route to the 192.168.y subnet the ip address of the route destination to allow packets to be routed through to the remote host

917109
mouse	keyboard
i remember seeing some versions of windows complain about waiting for a particular program to close before it would shut down but i ve never heard of an instance where the hang goes away after some keyboard mouse activity

917190
imagemagick	pdftk
maybe i didn t find the right pdfjam pdftk or imagemagick command

917228
sudoers	visudo
so i checked out the sudoers file sudo visudo -f etc sudoers which contains among others this line

917264
gedit	sublimetext
i currently switched from gedit to sublimetext

917264
gedit	sublimetext
one thing i liked with gedit but what is missing in sublimetext is that new files are opened in a new window when the current window is in another workspace

917287
osx	yosemite
at home i replaced a windows 7 box with an imac running osx yosemite

917338
put	get
since the directory contains lots of different stuff i thought i could use ls grep to get the apropriate file-names and then use pdfunite to get it put together

917353
post	get
the reason you get no video output is because the post power-on self-test fails which usually means some hardware is faulty and so it doesn t even load the bios uefi and gets stuck there

917355
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari

the other thing i would also try is to connect to a vpn that uses tcp and check if the udp traffic is forwarded correctly or not

917595
osx	yosemite
i recently installed osx server on a clean install of yosemite 10.10.3 and wanted to customise the apache config to change the version of php being used by the server

917595
osx	yosemite
after playing around for a bit i realised that the apache config file i was editing library server web config apache2 httpd_server_app.conf is being re-generated every time the osx server application is re-started reverting it back to the default version of php that ships with yosemite

if there are text entries in the column you re sorting and you have turned on filtering in the data tab then you will be able to sort alphabetically just as easily as you can sort numerically

917811
ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	linux
but seeing as linux mint is ubuntu based it should change most with that install but moreover as mint is its own spin off a a 14.04 ubuntu codebase you are likely to have major pointing errors and selinux would be another likely issue

917816
dpkg	apt
sudo apt install path to firefox.deb or sudo dpkg -i path to firefox.deb

for a system with insufficient ram that is what the os does for processes that does not appear to be very active - take their memory contents and write them to disk in a virtual memory store freeing up ram for other processes that need it

918136
disk	ram
just like there is distance between desk and cabinet there is distance between processor ram and disk

918136
disk	ram
if you want to continue working with the laptop install more ram bigger desk or install a solid-state disk cabinet with organisation features that make locating books faster

918181
tunnel	vpn
if the vpn is terminated at the pc in windows then no you cannot or rather should not since traffic to the remote network is forced into the vpn on the computer you would have to define a split tunnel to hive off some traffic to go to other devices on the local network without it going through the vpn

918219
for-loop	loops
you can use the extended features of a for-loop for this - even if it will not loops

918872
versioning	upgrade
to actually enable memory above 4gb on an operating system you would need to upgrade the os to a 64 bit versioning

918884
hid	keyboard
the usb protocol came out in the mid-1990s and apart from operating at a higher speed introduced the idea of a device being able to identify itself both with a particular class such as say hid human interface device for a keyboard along with a vendor and product id so that a particular device driver could be loaded in the case of devices that needed device specific support

918900

919238
versioning	upgrade
on major versioning upgrade 3.x to 4.x for example i will read the docs

919285
hash	md5
example to get the md5 hash of the entire windows directory tree

919310
filesystems	ntfs
one way to meet your storage requirements would be to create a loopback filesystems inside your ntfs partition but the catch to this is that performance of such a loop device would be worse because input-output i o would be happening in a filesystems within a filesystems

919331
bash	zsh
to search for all files recursively use a new globbing option which is it s available in bash 4.x zsh and similar shells

919381
emacs	textmate
edit i see there are clipboard buffers and i know a lot of popular text editors like emacs and textmate have clipboard buffers but i guess to differentiate myself here i m looking for a solution that uses dedicated keyboard shortcuts to access buffer_elements 1..n respectively where n equals 1-2 3 clipboards maybe...i m thinking now that i could potentially register new keyboard shortcuts to access a clipboard buffer via shell script and maybe have those dumped into a selected text area using applescript or something...that might work.

919411
hide	show
if these processes are executed with different command line for example using full path you can press c to show hide full command line with which the process was executed

919441
udp	tcp
first let me say that it makes little sense to speak of routing separately upload and download because even intense download tasks require that some packets flow backward to the source any download requires some upload flow this is less true for udp than for tcp but never mind that

919441
google-chrome	firefox
to sum up in linux and only in linux you may run a separate network namespace which is for instance connected through a vpn to your work place so that you access your work resources and if you run firefox you appear to be based at your work place while at the same time runnning google-chrome outside the network namespace and thus appearing on google-chrome to be based at home

919452
hide	show
you need to open the info dialog and untick hide extension if you want to show the extension

you can t perform it with firefox and safari

919595
sudo	passwd
one thing to try is to make a script just run sh and then run the sudo command from that sh prompt and see if a passwd is needed

919595
sudo	passwd
note that sudo tends to remember if you recently authenticated the passwd from the same login

919595
sudo	passwd	sudoers	passwd
so if sudo considers you to be sufficiently authenticated once perhaps you typed a passwd and then you make a change to etc sudoers and then you try to sudo again you could easily be misled because sudo might not prompt you because sudo might remember that you passed the test less than 5 minutes ago

919613

919825
google-chrome	firefox
ok so if you are interested in hiding your own ip and pretending to be someone else there are some softwares available some are free to try and some are paid .one example is hidemyass which is also available as addon for google-chrome i guess.and if you are using firefox browser there is this one-click proxy and other large number of addons. choose which one works for you .for downloading torrent files i guess the above things will be more than enough becos once connected with your torrent software it will possibly connect to peers and seeds all over the world

919849

versioning	upgrade

if the file is not in ram or there is not enough space to buffer the data to be written to the disk then the process will freeze until the request can be satisfied

920442
pop-up	dialog
typically when this happens windows will also pop-up the dialog box telling me i need to format the drive before i can use it

920494
ubuntu	debian
tested on osx 10.7 ubuntu 12.04 debian jessie

920534
ubuntu	linux
how can i install docker on my windows 7 machine and dock a linux distro say ubuntu 14.04

920606
filesystems	ntfs
if the system partition is formatted with ntfs filesystems you might be able to use safe mode to rename or delete the faulty software

920608
ssd	sata
in that case just add 512 ssd to the system you should have spare power however no promises about spare sata cable

920608
ssd	sata
if the 32gb ssd is normal sata drive then just swap it and disable it in bios

920608
ssd	sata
i have laptop - dell 7520 - with 256gb ssd 1tb hdd and isrt enabled and samsung magician says it s about maxed out performance benchmark despite hysteric messages about ahci not enabled and sata 6gb s not available

920635
queue	fifo
packets will start getting added to the queue in a first come first serve basis and released using the prioritisation set up that is configured on the switch - typically fifo fifo when no configuration like qos is set up

920635
udp	tcp
in tcp the nagle s algorithm is used to impose this rate limiting but in a udp connection the outcome would probably be lowering quality for things such as a video stream or just failing but the failure to receive enough data would have to explicitly come from the destination rather than by the lack of an acknowledgement

920652
filesystems	xfs
i will most probably use xfs as filesystems

920661
hide	show
you can show hide this toolbar by pressing command+shift+a

920708
button	checkbox
this is probably what you really want because the checkbox button run as administrator does trigger a uac prompt rather than really using an administrative user

920717
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
i m mostly interested in safari but a general answer would be welcome as well since the default behaviour is the same also in google-chrome and firefox

920792
ubuntu	linux
i usually use an ubuntu live usb key for this but it s available on a lot of linux live cd

920821
filesystems	ntfs
however this will usually not result in actually smaller data which is probably why microsoft designed ntfs to make the mutually exclusive and windows blocks you from doing both this is speculation only microsoft can really answer why they designed the ntfs filesystems to treat compression and encryption as mutually exclusive

920854
mouse	trackpad
i m trying to disable the trackpad for the lenovo thinkpad w541 running windows 7 i got at work because i would rather use a usb mouse

920863
wan	lan	wan	vlan
my tomato router is configured with one of the lan ports lan4 in the same vlan as the wan port

920863
wan	lan	wan	subnet
all other lan ports on the router are left in the normal configuration they are in the local 192.168.1.x subnet with nat to the wan port the computer s in this lan all share the public ip address 11.11.11.11 in this example

920864
google-chrome	firefox
running firefox and google-chrome with hundreds of tabs open requires a huge amount of memory

920878
debian	centos
if you want a more modern distro abandon debian entirely and use centos arch fedora etc

920902
mouse	trackpad
but i ve been using a macbook pro for a couple years and although i find the trackpad a bit uncomfortable my mouse doesn t work well with it either

920909
mouse	trackpad
there may be software you can download that further speeds up the mouse or you could purchase a new one if the trackpad still isn t cutting it for you

920941
google-chrome	firefox
works perfectly in firefox and google-chrome

920941
google-chrome	firefox
however again works fine in firefox and google-chrome

921012

when i rsync files from ext4 filesystems to btrfs with the following set of flags

921202
putty	winscp

921235
width	height
doubleclick speed height and width

921240
installation	upgrade
move the existing installation first then upgrade

921303
vpn	lan
by connecting a machine to a vpn network you re effectively isolate it from the local lan it won t see any other machines except those in the vpn network

921303
vpn	lan
so i think you got the vpn setup backwards - you want to run the vpn client on your remote machine and the vpn server on your local lan - to leave the local lan unaffected and make the remote machine feel connected to it

921326
installation	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
i have a dell laptop that came with windows 8 oem i upgrade to 8.1 and yesterday i had to reinstall the windows so i created a windows 8.1 usb using an iso from the internet windows 8.1 pro 64 bits which is the same versioning that i had but my windows 8.1 installation didn t recognize my windows 8 oem key so i used the windows 8.1 default key to complete my install off course the default key is invalid but my windows 8.1 wont accept the oem key that i found cracking my bios..

921381
ssd	sata
my question is can i use any sata hdd ssd with this

921382
dmz	was
the old router i have screw it up was updating firmware take long time so i reset unplug the router now it doesn t broadcast any ssid nor i can connect to it now here is the catch i have to port forward both gateway and linksys x2000 but it never worked i have tried dmz turning router firewall off and other thing that failed keep in mind before upgrading the router dhcp was supplied directly from the gateway but now it is supplied from the linksys x2000 also dhcp range in gateway start from 192.168.100.x to .254 and the linksys x2000 start from 192.168.1.x to .254 not changeable only last digits i have read that bridging the linksys x2000 will allow port forwarding to work but i cant use it as the connection from gateway to router uses ethernet not adsl

921397
mouse	keyboard
i also have a roccat mouse and keyboard

921397
mouse	keyboard
if they re plugged into the keyboard mouse ports the extra features of the devices no longer work

921407
google-chrome	firefox
in google-chrome go to menu bookmarks settings and import from firefox

921408
ansible	puppet
the above solution is the poor-man configuration management if you want something more structured and you have time to invest in to evaluate some configuration management solution to better fit your requirements you can check for ansible salt puppet or chef

921410
switching	screens
does anyone know of a way to kind of make a part of the screens completely unhinged from the rest of desktop switching and hot corners

921410
switching	screens
ideally i would be able to follow a video in the corner while switching between desktops going fullscreen entering hot corners without the screens getting affected and therefore be able to follow a video conference a facechat or the like without losing sight of the other person

921420
folder	directory
right-click on the zip file and do extract all and then extract to the default directory one inside the network folder with the same name of the zip file

921432
pulseaudio	mixer
pulseaudio still shows the line being plugged in and still shows the bar under the mixer level for the media player going up and down with the sounds as it should but no actual sound is leaving my pc

921445
disk	ram
microsoft says you can create an os disk up to 1023gbâ but all my instances have 29.3gb - 8 core 56gb of ram - 29.3gbâ etcâ i do have one system 1 core 3.5gb that is 127gb os disk - i have no idea how that happened

921488
vlc	mkv
it should automatically use either vlc or powerdvd for mkv files based on its size

921491
vlc	mkv
most 1080p videos especially those with wmv3 video stream or mkv stutter heavily and are not watchable in vlc but play smoothly in dragon player

921539
mouse	keyboard
i already use virtualbox so with that solution i can get as far as sharing the whole d data drive with that virtual machine mapping it to d there as well and then integrate the taskbar desktop mouse keyboard clipboard and drag drop

921541
wan	lan
the port is rj45 port and it directly get into my computer s lan port and a rj45 jack is connected to its wan port from isp network

921549
disk	ram
i have a gigabyte motherboard 2 gb ram memory an iball power supply unit dual core cpu and a seagate hard disk

921558
ethernet	wireless
but using an ethernet cable seemed to confuse windows ability to distinguish between wired and wireless

921558
ethernet	wireless
despite my wireless adapter in network and sharing center stating wireless was working properly no networks appear in the list and i can only access internet by continuing to use an ethernet cable

921559
ethernet	wireless
after much research it seems that many users do have this problem through different scenarios but all have a common event using an ethernet cable during a period when their wireless was working perfectly then losing their wireless functionality immediately after using an ethernet cable

921559
ethernet	wireless
first make sure you re not using an ethernet for re-establishing wireless connection

921595
ubuntu	linux
part of the confusion i had was that under linux ubuntu it was possible to install vbox guest additions via the apt-get system

921611
versioning	upgrade
if the guest has a newer versioning than the host you best upgrade virtualbox itself on the host

921696
wan	lan
however when i put my router netgear wndr4500 which has 10 100 1000 ports for lan and wan in between them i am only getting about 100mbps

where i d like to go from here i d like to debugging the user profiling services some more gpsvg.log appears to be of no help and trying to enable diagnostic logs on the user profiling service via event viewer showed no useful logs

921749
folder	directory
watch carefully that the folder i put in the commands above are just for example the directory you have to put there will appear when you scan the logical volumes

921755
mouse	keyboard
i get the exact same issue with this keyboard and my g700s mouse the only thing that fixes it for now is to re-boot but i am trying something else now

921755
mouse	keyboard
if this does not work then this keyboard and mouse are going to die horribly

921773
vbscript	vba
if you have a large number of spreadsheets then this vba code or this vbscript will help reduce manual labour

for the benefit of anyone else who arrives here by googling roaming not allowed by server and is using a linux ubuntu client you might fix that warning and then see -

921942
vmware	virtualbox
sometimes virtualbox or vmware can disable your network adapter

921957
fish	bash
i am using the fish shell which until this moment had been a perfect replacement of the good old bash but i came across the following problem

921957
stdout	stderr
fish does not forward stderr to stdout

921957
stdout	stderr
of course if i append forwards stderr to stdout to the command that i am running everything is ok but that is not the default behaviour

921979
folder	directory
i have recognized that deleting an empty folder at guest will remove it permanently at host as well instead of moving to recycle repository directory

922014
debian	linux	debian	mint	ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	linux
fwiw it works for me on ubuntu since 10.04 it worked on linux mint and on debian which serves as a base for both

922015
ubuntu	debian
update and upgrade from your repository on ubuntu and debian

922042
screens	tablet
the tablet screens contains a special digitizer layer to interact with the corresponding n-trig active stylus tip

922075
subscript	superscript
hypothetically having a difference between the two allows for the possibility of correct formatting for different situations 1 fraction slash 2 could be rendered with a superscript 1 and a subscript 2 as 1 2

922075
subscript	superscript
superscript + subscript 1 2 1 #8725

922075
subscript	superscript
they have a narrower spacing than solidus and look better with the superscript subscript numbers

922076
google-chrome	firefox

tftp uses udp port 69 only when establishing a transfer next the actual data transfer takes place on a randomly selected udp port that also has to be open in your firewall mechanism somehow similar to ftp transfers

922110
daemons	systemd
this tool is designed to be run by hand or as a systemd daemons

922150
ati	nvidia
usually recommended is to use autodetect on nvidia and ati too incidentally so proper drivers can be determined

922168
traceroute	lan
if the user running the vm is connected to your lan via wifi then you can identify him her by means of a traceroute

922168
traceroute	lan
for instance this is the output of my traceroute from another pc on my lan

922168
traceroute	lan
if your traceroute shows that there are no intermediate hops between your pc and the vm then at least you will know that you can rule out all lan pcs connected via wifi restricting your range of possibilities and making the switch technique an effective possibility if you have a managed switch or you are willing to unplug the cables in the switch one by one

922198
mouse	keyboard
other keyboard shortcuts seem working on lync and lync can be muted-unmuted by clicking with the mouse on the mute button in gui too slow as the mouse pointer must be moved to that button first

922241
installation	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
that being said i assume we will get an installation key to install the windows 10 upgrade if so you could use this to reinstall w10 at a later date it is not clear yet is if you have to have a previous windows versioning installed before you can upgrade to w10

922253
xlib	xdotool
for some reason xtestfakekeyevent xlib function didn t work at all and simulating keypress with xsendevent doesn t work with modifiers so i had to make a system call to xdotool

922253
switching	screens
one obvious solution would be listening to the super+ event with synergy in the first place and handling the logic there whether switching screens or send another keycombo to dwm

922265
folder	directory
i currently have a directory with folder and files inside

922277

ubuntu	debian
i m using vagrant for building and signing my debian ubuntu packages but i d prefer to not have have to copy my gpg keys into the virtual machine just to sign packages

922423
fullscreen	minimized
fullscreen windows cannot be minimized as they take their own space there is nothing behind them

922423

why is btrfs so grossly misquoting the size of small files on my filesystems

922475

switching	screens
a lines to appear on the main screens as they come in then switching to the alternate screens once scrolling is needed so the first of output will always appear in your scrollback

packets	multicast
i am investigating if i can implement an hpc app on windows that receives small udp multicast datagrams mostly 100-400 bytes at a high rate using a dozen or up to maybe 200 multicast groups using msi-x and rss i can scale to multiple cores does some processing per packets and then sends it out

i don t care if the program settings return to defaults but i d like to keep my firefox and google-chrome saved passwords on the windows boot

922867
versioning	upgrade
are you really getting windows 10 for free as in you upgrade from 7 8 8.1 but you still own the previous versioning of windows and windows 10 or are you really trading your old windows license for a new one

this may be a limitation of the backend database which by default is hypersql database hsqldb version 1.8 - if you are using the default backend the documentation is at and does not have anything like alter view or replace view

922910
versioning	upgrade
you have the option to upgrade to the current versioning of hsqldb versioning 2.3 which supports the alter view statement

if i buy a wireless mouse with a unifying receiver and download the unifying software will i be able to get my old keyboard and the new wireless mouse both running off the same unifying receiver the one which will come with the new wireless mouse

923111
google-chrome	firefox
this applies to google-chrome too so it s not firefox specific at all

923133
ssid	wlan
if you want my advice getting a semi cheap juniper srx 100 series to replace your sonic wall keeping your cisco for connectivity but set it up properly and then either adding in a wlan controller with wlan controller enabled access points or getting a few dlink ac3200 or netgear ac1900 set up in access point mode with different ssid s might go quite a way to solving your problem

923143
google-chrome	firefox
specifically text-area input field and select boxes so in firefox 38 i have created google-chrome folder and placed usercontent.css file inside that and it was working fine

923144
ubuntu	opensuse
this ubuntu page even shows you how to preserve the original bootloader so that should you wish to remove the disk on which you installed opensuse there will be nothing for you to do to have a working windows-only installation

923158
postfix	dovecot
does postfix 2.11 needs to be patched with vda patch for per user or domain quota support when dovecot 2.2.x is used as imap server

923170
doc	rtf
a simple solution for me was to save the doc as rich text format rtf

923185
postfix	dovecot
if postfix do not attempt to perform lda itself and invoke dovecot s deliver instead then postfix do not need to know about quotas at all

923202
hash	salt
this works because windows password hash don t salt

923245
mouse	keyboard
my keyboard is hooked up through the usb hub built into one of the monitors and the mouse is hooked up through the usb hub built into the other

tiff	png	gif	png
you can add custom artwork by dragging and dropping an image file preferable jpeg or png but i think tiff and gif would work too to the cover art box

923271
google-chrome	firefox
the same thing happens when i try to uninstall google drive install google-chrome or use firefox

923271
google-chrome	firefox
not when using internet explorer uninstalling google-chrome or installing firefox

923286
migrate	upgrade
see an upgrade offer before their company is ready to migrate to

parallels	bootcamp
i have heard about other people using mac and parallels to do the same as i and have the same problem the only fix was using bootcamp

923365

put	get
get a list of ids from your system and put them in column b

923470
put	get
means move up one so it would put you in the parent documents directory and then get you into assembly

923479
udp	tcp
suppose an attacker connects their computer with an ethernet cable to a black box computer which supports both tcp and udp over ipv4 over ethernet

wan	lan
if alice were on the lan side of a wap and charlie was on the wan side then alice would be able to ping charlie but not vice versa

923584
subnet	packets
every computer on the same network needs to have the same subnet mask configured along with being in the same actual network of course. the computer uses the subnet mask to determine not only the ip broadcast address but also to determine whether broadcast packets received should be processed by the network stack if broadcast packets for ips that would fall outside the address and subnet mask configured on the device many devices will ignore the packet.

923647
ethernet	wireless
just setup hostapd on it bridge it with your eth0 if you plan to use your ethernet cable to extend the repeater capability of the debian machine to a full-fledged wireless bridge or with a virtual interface tap not tun otherwise you will be forfeiting level 2 connections

923647
ethernet	wireless
as for the relation between wlan0 and wlan1 you cannot bridge them bridging requires the exchange of whole ethernet frames something which no wireless 4addr mode or not can do

923686
cpu	processors
as you can see the actual processors is quite small compared to the cpu package

923687
udp	tcp	arp	udp	arp	tcp
in the presence of a faulty communication line arp packets are no different than udp tcp and whatnot

923687
subnet	packets
however you have pointed out that the packets that are magically disappearing are arp packets which need no proper routing because they spontaneously fill the whole subnet they belong to

923687
subnet	packets
arp packets do not cross gateways and one reason for them to be dropped is that they fill their own subnet find no respondent then disappear without crossing the gateway separating the two different subnet

923740
hash	md5
in the image you can see that the file elasticsearch.yml has the same md5 hash in the command prompt and in cygwin but under mingw the contents are different

923746

mouse	trackpad
i know the hdmi and displayport cables and ports are okay because the ubuntu 14.04.1 desktop edition live usb recognizes the external monitor with either of those though both are very slightly flaky a the mouse trackpad sometimes leaves a trail on the external display which goes away if i click somewhere and b there s a thin vertical line on the left edge of the external display to the left of the unity launcher

925904

it looks to me like a kernel issue but in that case it s not clear why ubuntu recognizes it and debian does not since they re both running 3.16 kernels

926886
gif	png	gif	bmp	bmp	png
it depends on the type of image and the data contained within it but looking at the source code that handles the copy image functionality on windows as well as looking at how the windows clipboard api works there is a conversion done on the data to put it on the windows clipboard more specifically firefox puts the image into a bmp mime type via this line of code and while they support the dibv5 format which gives more color space and alpha information i suspect there s a bug elsewhere or the encoding need be changed in the code to support more formats like gif png with transparency

ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	linux
these instructions are for linux mint 17.1 but the steps should be similar for other linux distributions especially ones based on ubuntu

937491
vmware	virtualbox
i recommend using kvm instead of virtualbox or vmware or other vmware products

937491
vmware	virtualbox
even though usb 3.0 is supported without that expansion pack the usb support in virtualbox is more problematic than in either vmware products or kvm

937491
chown	sudo
sudo chown your_username group dev mapper virtual_windows_disk

937491
vmware	virtualbox
if you get stuck somewhere due to problems with virt-manager or kvm you can try other options like virtualbox or vmware

937494
stdout	stderr
you will cause the stderr ouput of ls to be written to the same filedescriptor than stdout and the stdout to the file testo so you have a unique flux that finish in your file

937516
min	max
lets say i have a column of data at the top of the column i have all my math calculations and i pull up important data points to the top of the sheet such as max and min data points based on a deviation from a reference value

937516
min	max
i d like to have my max and min values link to the corresponding cell in the data set without having to scroll though 45754 lines to find the actual value....i want to write a hyper link so it automatically links to the cell with a corresponding value....is that possible

937548
min	max
note if the min or max etc. value is not unique in data column you cannot link all cells containing it only one of them

937555
filesystems	ntfs
today i was devastated to see that a software project that i had backed up in my external hdd was almost completely ruined because the execution and other permissions where reset because the external hdd uses ntfs filesystems

937555
filesystems	ntfs
is there a way to backup data to an ntfs or fat32 filesystems while preserving permissions set in linux

937557
filesystems	ntfs
yes you can use tar to create an archive on the ntfs filesystems

937557
folder	directory
never use windows explorer to copy folder to another disk as a backup if you have long directory paths it cuts away everything with a path longer 255 charakters silently i hope i remember the number correctly

937743
arp	dhcp
because you are looking not at the list of dhcp clients but to the list of devices aka an arp table

937743
tablet	galaxy
now you can see why they have now disappeared by plugging into the ethernet plugs two different devices the router has become aware that your tablet and galaxy are not at the end of the cable line since there are two new players

937766
switching	screens
while there may be a special control sequence or configuration setting such as alternatescroll with xterm generally that is activated by the switching to from full-screen or the alternate screens in the terminal description

937839
wan	lan
you may be able to tell the zytel box that it is not a router but a bridge switch ap but as long as it is a router and they are connected in serial as described they the wan and lan ip networks must be differant from every routers perspective

freebsd	linux
other than the web gui the operating system kernel is a major difference because freenas uses freebsd which unlike linux has had zfs included in the kernel for years

938046
debian	linux
fedora 22 currently ships with linux 4.0 while debian 7 comes with 3.2 which is really old btrfs wasn t as stable back then many significant bugs have been fixed since then

938061
filesystems	btrfs
for example you could convert a single btrfs filesystems one drive to raid-1 2+ drives then to raid-5 3+ drives and to raid-6 4+ drives

938061
filesystems	btrfs
many will say that the raid-5 raid-6 implementation in btrfs is still experimental in some ways but as long as you take care of your system scrub every now and then to detect silent corruption monitor your drives and replace bad drives btrfs replace straight forward you ll end up with a very stable filesystems

938725
cpu	processors
for example an simd operation on a modern intel processors desktop takes only 25 of the time a typical arm processors mobile takes due to the fact that desktops can stuff in more transistors into the cpu since area and power are not constrained

938779

the bios uefi is the limiting factor often you must upgrade your bios uefi to a specific versioning before a newer and physically identical cpu is supported

filtering	grouping
for some reason keyboard filtering does not appear in grouping policy editor after i did add it to the distribution share and to the answer file used for the image

this is not a duplicate this is why i m trying to bind my left click on my mouse to press the f key on my keyboard instead of registering it as a left click from the mouse

940189

this would be your best bet as it doesn t render your mouse clicks useless and you still get to click a button on the mouse to activate a key on the keyboard

940191

from my own extensive experience virtualizing desktop os i can confidently tell you that ubuntu doesn t virtualize nearly as well as windows in general or leaner linux distros such as linux mint mate

on my end i generally use linux mint mate as my go-to distro for running under virtualbox or vmware workstation i use both

if you find virtualbox works well while vmware doesn t then at least that confirms your laptop is capable and something is not working right in vmware

i m just trying to add a confirmation prompt to a few linux commands like chmod and chown

940551
chown	chmod
however there is safe-rm package which you can install on your server which blacklists certain important directories which is quite a good solution but sadly there is no similar package for chmod and chown

940551
chown	chmod
so my ideal solution would be where chmod and chown have confirmation prompts and also certain directories are blacklisted from being chmod-ed and chown-ed

940560

the commands chown 1 and chmod 1 do not natively have sunch an option

if you disable split tunnel all traffic from your machine will cross the vpn link to the remote network

943902
vpn	lan
netgear fsv338 vpn filewall nat and dhcp connected to the lan port of netgear wndr3400 router

943906
folder	directory
this also allows me to sort in directory within the shared folder

943906
folder	directory
i say it was somewhat fixed because if i tried to sort any directory in the shared folder dolphin would freeze

943912
winpcap	wireshark
winpcap wireshark digs up some more showing the flash player connects to rtmp uc102.webvideocore.net live look for the connect live command and streams h.264 with he-aac

943915
google-chrome	firefox
probably not the cause but known to make google-chrome firefox run very slowly

943923
subnet	ip-address
for example your firewall has address 192.168.1.1 subnet 255.255.255.0 and distributes 192.168.1.50 to 192.168.1.200 you will have as first device asking for an address the ip-address 192.168.1.50

943943
post	put
there can be no generic means to do this due to the way webservers and webapplications use http post put operations to send data to the server from a page rendered on the client

943951
folder	directory
how can i get it to work so that you can type in the directory and it will list the files and folder with their size last modified times etc

943977
uefi	multiboot
on a multiboot system with a mbr and bios and also grub in its own partition for linux i think attempting to install windows 10 to a new partition from an iso might cause havoc as it ll want to use uefi i m sure and probably won t offer alternative options

943998
gmail	hotmail
if i opened it in gmail or hotmail the aforementioned problems would occur

943998
gmail	hotmail
i ve seen problems with gmail and sending html emails but not hotmail or thunderbird

944023
post	get
if i get time later i ll post a usable python script here but this should give you a good path forward

944054
folder	directory
this works in the command prompt because it is not subject to the special folder views that explorer uses for certain directory

944070
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
that being said there must be a way as when you think about it clicking a link in google-chrome or firefox opens that link in google-chrome or firefox not safari

944093
google-chrome	firefox	notepad++	sublimetext
i ve tested in sublimetext notepad++ google-chrome firefox word

944108
stdout	stderr
unix utilities send general messages to stdout and error messages to stderr so if we only want to see error messages then it will be sufficient to suppress stdout so only stderr gets output to the console

944108
fish	bash
the way to do this in both bash and fish is to append to the command

944108
stdout	stderr
this pipes stdout into nothingness but stderr with your error messages still comes through to the console

944108
stdout	stderr
the command prints nothing because the normal stdout output is suppressed and nothing was written to stderr

944137
daemons	systemd
after looking into nfs root file systemd i found that it doesn t have ssh daemons so i am thinking of adding openssh into nfs root file systemd

944137
udp	tcp
as per my little understanding of ssh and nfs ssh on the board uses port 22 and nfs on the board uses 1110 udp and 2049 tcp

944141
stdout	stderr
note that this will swallow the original exit code and will dump both stdout and stderr in the event of a failure

944146
move	drag
drag and move items between the two

944149
mouse	keyboard
the servers mouse and keyboard will be controlled by your computer which in turn will be viewed on the monitor

944154
spaces	delimiter
you do need a spaces delimiter between the command and the semicolon

944173
bids	ssis
does the 2012 ssis install that was for vs2013 work in 2015 or does 2015 have the ssis bids and reporting components built in

944234
dropbox	skydrive
a stop code would be very useful to verify the bcc said be which would typically be 0x000000be for stop code or the memory dump file you can upload it to dropbox or skydrive i d recommend just using a bsod dump viewer and dropping the output to dropbox though it d make troubleshooting it faster

944250
filesystems	ntfs
one example would be if the directory on the remote machine is within a mounted filesystems of a certain type for example ntfs which won t give you reliable unix-type modes and the kernel sets it to read-only because it wasn t mounted via fuse to give write permissions

944258
ssl	https
when visiting a website which is a virtual host without ssl support and with no reference to any https scheme within its database or any file within it s themes configuration etc

944273
appdata	uninstaller
i removed the pokki start menu app by first running its uninstaller as admin from c users default appdata local pokki uninstall.exe and then loading the default user s hive in regedit and removing any mentions of it there didn t take notes for this

944320
min	max
the min and max of the first column are given in e1 and e2 along with the initial chart of the data

944320
range	min	range	max	min	max
this basically says take the range that starts where column a contains the min value in cell e1 and that ends where column a contains the max value in cell e2

944320
min	max
change the values in cells e1 or e2 and the chart will change to reflect the new min and max

944347
sudo	passwd
when issuing the sudo command you will be asked to enter your passwd and you will be granted root access for the given command if you are allowed to run sudo

944361
mouse	keyboard
disconnect all devices from the computer except mouse keyboard network and monitor

944475
udp	tcp
ssh and nfs will establish different tcp and or udp in the case of nfs connections over the same ethernet interface

944480
filesystems	ntfs
this also requires linux system to have ntfs filesystems support

944490
mouse	keyboard
this method allowed me to just use keyboard no mouse clicks

944504
udp	tcp
i tried adding adding a traffic rule through the openwrt admin panel - source nat matching any tcp udp from ip 192.168.1.102 in lan to any host port 53 in lan with action rewrite to source ip 192.168.1.1 port 53

944530
udp	tcp
this will force the following protocols to periodically reconnect ssh irc mapi microsoft exchange imap4 games using tcp instead of udp like diablo iii starcraft ii almost any mmorpg like world of warcraft or eve online microsoft remote fileshares ftp remote desktop remote print jobs with large page counts.

944551
udp	tcp
a tcp connection or udp flow is defined by the 4-tuple

944551
udp	tcp
so the protocols support to a first approximation 2 48 connections flows to a single tcp or udp port on a single ipv4 address

944551
udp	tcp
consider both tcp and udp together and both ipv4 s address space and ipv6 s cosmically comically large address space and you can see that the the protocols themselves are not likely to ever be the source of the limit to the number of concurrent connections that a host can handle

944551
udp	tcp
similarly there s nothing in the tcp or udp protocols that keep a client machine from using a single source port on a single ip address to make multiple outgoing connections to various server addresses and ports

944551
udp	tcp
sometimes a given os s networking apis might not make this easy but it s important to remember that say the venerable old bsd sockets api is just one api to tcp and udp

944551
udp	tcp
tcp and udp may have capabilities that are not exposed by the traditional sockets api

944551
udp	tcp
so the number of concurrent tcp connections or udp flows a given host can handle is limited not so much by port numbers but by system resources such as the ram space and cpu time it takes to keep track of all those connections and service them all

944551
udp	tcp
for example in the unix everything is a file philosophy there might be a file descriptor for every tcp connection or udp flow

944551
udp	tcp
if your unix kernel has a limit to the number of file descriptors it can keep track of that file descriptor limit is an artificial limit on the number of concurrent tcp connections or udp flows your kernel can handle

944605
centos	linux
for some reason i want to configure the date time in my linux centos 6.5 to be different from the real date time but the setting won t work if i turn my computer desktop not laptop if this matters and this computer has no access to the internet on after a sudden power cut the date time will be the old date time before the configuration i unplug the power adapter manually to simulate the sudden power cut situation

944623
next	except
the next was it won t boot again into windows i thought windows only damaged the next day i got from friend a flash drive with windows xp inside it and installed windows xp then all of my files and partitions except winxp partition are damaged.

944660
osx	yosemite
i am using mac osx yosemite 10.10.4

944678
packets	multicast
with tcpdump i observe that the neighbor solicitation packets to multicast address ff02 1 ff00 212 from host is not received by my vm whose ipv6 address is 2001 da8 a0 600 212 64

944678
packets	multicast
obviously this multicast packets should have been passed to vm by macvtap

944678
packets	multicast
as a result of the problem of multicast all ipv6 packets is lost for neighbor discovery cannot work properly

944678
packets	multicast
after i set the macvtap interface over the host to promiscuous mode the vm get the neighbor solicitation packets along with some other multicast packets which should be filtered by macvtap but no unicast packets to other vm even when i ping6 other vms on the host at the same time

944696

944787
kde	gnome
i installed fedora a few months ago i ve been using gnome with it and wanted to use kde plasma 5 i tried it live first by downloading the custom fedora iso which contains kde instead of gnome

944787

i recently installed ffmpeg and it came with many libraries i needed but it was missing libvpx

944808
folder	directory
for some reason i had other .git folder in sub directory

944836
disk	ram
sometimes in the error message is stated that a font is missing sometimes - insufficient ram or disk space sometimes - something like unspecified error word document.xml line 2 column 0

944836
disk	ram
i also have lot s of free disk space and according to task manager when these error messages come only about 3-4 gb of available 16 gb ram are being used

but it seems this auto umounting behavior will be kept as long the pam_ecryptfs.so is loaded in memory on non-interactive sessions as cron jobs are

944917

945059
16-bit	64bit
unfortunately i don t have the exact error message wording but essentially it said something like you can t repair windows 7 64bit on your 16 bit windows os definitely it referenced 16-bit os

945059
16-bit	64bit
unfortunately the details are getting really sketchy this far in but essentially it said something like you can t repair windows 7 64bit on your 16 bit windows os definitely it referenced 16-bit os

versioning	upgrade
the windows 10 upgrade free to users of earlier windows versioning is out on july 29

945159
installation	upgrade
however my preference is to obtain the upgrade as a .iso file so that i can burn a dvd from and boot my machine to install from the disk on top of the existing installation

945159
versioning	upgrade
how to turn your windows 10 upgrade files into an iso disk image - looks credible from zd-net but mentions a build versioning at end of article and doesn t explain how this build versioning relates to the one that will be officially available on july 29

945202
google-chrome	firefox
is there a way to change the preferred language in the browser firefox and or google-chrome based on the visited site

945241
versioning	upgrade
however from how to upgrade from previous versioning of windows using windows 10 iso file on the same microsoft community

945241
versioning	upgrade
you must first upgrade from the qualifying versioning of windows 7 or windows 8 8.1 whether you do it through windows update or using the .iso file

945290
versioning	upgrade	ubuntu	linux
next wednesday i plan to upgrade windows to versioning 10 but before i do that i d like to replace ubuntu with arch linux

945315
daemons	systemd
if you need console access then the most reliable way is to install cygwin and activate ssh daemons also support public key authentication that used for decades on unix based systemd to remotely manage computers

945321
robocopy	xcopy
as a last resort a robocopy answer may be acceptable but i would really prefer xcopy without duplicating the parameter

945322
sudoers	passwd
i m a sudoers so i should be able to use my own passwd to connect to the network but it asks for root s

945367
debian	linux
i happened to have a terminal window open in linux debian and as i was browsing the web i heard a beep so i looked to see what happened and i found the following message in the terminal window

945386
sudo	passwd
so the reason i was being asked for the root passwd was because i wasn t running the command with sudo

945413
post	get
i saw this post about using ffmpeg but didn t quite get as to how to consider the values

945421
pull	push
i have three internal fans one push and 2 pull

vpn	lan
regardless of whether i am connected to the vpn if my windows pc is switched on i can rdp into it remotely not on the lan from pretty much anywhere - have tested on multiple devices from multiple locations

945435
screens	tablet
you can limit the tablet range on your pc to a single screens by running

945459
mouse	keyboard
some more info there s a game i play that is similar to a flight simulator but yaw and pitch are controlled by the mouse and there s no option in-game to remap this to keyboard buttons

945459
mouse	keyboard
so what i want is that if i press the 4 key on the numpad or some other key i don t care then the game reacts as if i were moving the mouse to the left with no delay or acceleration or whatever just the way it works in normal flight sims where you use a keyboard by default

945459
joystick	keyboard
it seems everyone needs to map joystick buttons to keys on the keyboard but not the other way around

945517
ubuntu	linux
on linux specificially ubuntu what s the easiest way to determine what types of wifi protocols your hardware and driver support

bluetooth	usb
or if you had another computer - or any device that would work with the usb keyboard - try using the thinkpad keyboard with that device while you re using your bluetooth headphones nearby

945701
uninstall	upgrade
the only way i managed to fix it was to compliantly uninstall ie11 and after to upgrade ie trough windows update

945754
disk	ram
maybe the program is eating all your ram and os starts paging to hard disk

945774
switching	screens
disable fast user switching control panel - user accounts you must be administrator to do this and use user input box on classic login screens to see what key is stuck

945782
vagrantfile	hosts
i believe that you should open the vagrantfile and drop the owner group and mount_options settings as they apply to a linux hosts only

945785
ubuntu	debian
on debian ubuntu it needs some modifications though to work correctly

945787
bluetooth	usb
i wish to put avrdude on server somehow trick the program so that the talk through usb actually goes through internet and reaches the iphone and then iphone uses bluetooth to talk to arduino

945790
google-chrome	firefox
unlike firefox and internet explorer google-chrome does not store its plugins in windows registry

945805
mouse	keyboard
set vmware to ungrab the keyboard and mouse shortly before the host screensaver will kick in

945812

also make sure that sata mode is set to achi in bios setup it s only correct mode for ssd

945960
width	height
remember the x between width and height

945971
tunnel	packets
if the openvpn is up you will see the packets routed through the tunnel tun0 or tap0 not through your regular gateway

945989
debian	linux	debian	mint	ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	linux
under linux mint debian edition will be the same under debian or ubuntu

946004
wan	lan
step 4 could be switch router b s wan port to bridge mode but too many gateways don t actually have an option to do that either so just using the lan ports is practically the same thing.

946012
mouse	keyboard
using a keyboard and mouse you can intermittently select files by pressing control and clicking the files you want to select

946102
width	height
just extending the width and keeping the same height was also more simple technically because you would only have to tweak the horizontal refresh rate timing to achieve it

946125
google-chrome	firefox
the problem is it wonâ t load for me in firefox or google-chrome

946125
google-chrome	firefox
local storage is enabled in both firefox and google-chrome

946125
google-chrome	firefox
i seem to get a 404 when i check the console in google-chrome and firefox and no one knows what the problem may be

946127
folder	directory
since you are attempting to run this as www-data check their home directory and verify that you can create and access files in the slimerjs default directory path or use -profile instead of --profile and verify you can create and access files in the specified folder

946201
mouse	keyboard
i have no idea what to do since it worked fine first but for a couple of weeks now the mouse and keyboard are unbearably laggy on the client to the point where i can barely use them

wan	lan
for the lan addresses the wan of my apartment block uses 192.168.1

946269
wan	lan
it is possible to setup the 2nd router using a fake wan ip range and connect the routers by connecting one of their lan ports and not through the wan port

946286
google-chrome	firefox
i am using windows 8.1 and i am using google-chrome and firefox

946287
stdout	stderr
internally it is basically caused by the fact that ssh is waiting for the time when the executed process will close file handles stdin stdout stderr which are redirected to client

i wanna buy an ssd and i believe the pcie connection should be faster than the sata port

946355

you will be able to do this provided on the machine the new hdd will be installed in upgrade an existing installation of either windows 7 or windows 8.1 to windows 10 from there you can perform a clean installation if you want

946355
installation	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
microsoft has released installation media for windows 10 versioning 1507 and windows 10 versioning 1511 once you have accepted the free upgrade you will be able to install windows 10 from that installation media straight to a new hdd if you want

ubuntu	linux
if you can try using a linux variant ubuntu etc to confirm the root cause to be a software issue which i haven t been able to do owing to space constraints

946580
ssd	sata
when i boot my pc by a live cd with the ssd connected to the sata port

946580
ssd	sata
only execute a secure erase when running the ssd directly from a sata port since problems may arise otherwise.

946587
wan	lan
make sure the extended one is configured to the lan not wan interface of the main device and you only have one actual dhcp server

946734
cpu	processors
well yes and no if you use a high level language such as c# java or something similar you are writing a program so yes you are giving instructions to the cpu but there is an intermediate layer between your code and the cpu that is basically translating your high-level code to the processors

946740
disk	ram
however in my experience your problem is most likely old hard disk and it s poor performance and or lack of ram

946768
tunnel	lan	tunnel	vpn	vpn	lan
if you create an ssh tunnel you create a secure tunnel to the remote computer on your local network like a vpn but only to a single computer device - thus if you browse to your server ip a lan ip it ll work as if you were within your lan at home or at your business

946768
lan	localhost
technically it s not localhost but your web server listening on more ips your lan ip than just localhost .

946777
google-chrome	firefox
users have ie firefox and google-chrome and each of those has a different way to manually disable flash

installation	upgrade
unfortunately you must upgrade an existing installation before you are able to do a clean install of windows 10

946860
folder	directory
how do i open the command line from a current folder so the console opens in the current directory

946889
versioning	upgrade
when i upgrade a qualified versioning of windows to windows 10 and then want to do a clean install i ve heard that the installer won t ask for a key

the x axis are the 30 grades the y axis are the wages min and max overall

946917

versioning	upgrade
to upgrade from my older xampp to a newer one i renamed the folder c xampp to c xampp_old and installed the newer versioning with xampp-win32-5.6.8-0-vc11-installer.exe into c xampp

947024
disk	ram
it could download them to disk first and then it would have more than enough ram to install the individual packages

947024

installation	upgrade
you have to run the upgrade from an existing windows installation and if you are already running windows 8 you need to install the updates to get the upgrade offer 1 2

947155
installation	upgrade
if you experience issues on a machine or license eligible for the upgrade to windows 10 and you don t want to look up and interpret how the error codes relate to your situation you can take the shortcut and reinstall from windows 8 refresh media after you have made a backup of your installation

947155
installation	upgrade
i received a new product key during my windows 8 upgrade back then which i used during the installation from the refresh media however i haven t received a new product key nor do i have any indication which licensing information was used to activate windows 10 and will probably be voided by microsoft for downgrades yet

947174

no key is required but you must have a valid genuine windows 7 8.x installation to upgrade from

947228
screens	tablet
cleartype is still there but of little use in solving this problem because the fundamental method of screens drawing has changed. microsoft s position on this is that greyscale anti-aliasing looks fine on very high-resolution displays on phones and tablet and they refuse to do anything about it for desktop users

947233
notepad++	sublimetext
it has a wide variety of programs to choose from including notepad++ sublimetext chrome 7zip and others

947238
sudo	passwd
is it considered to be safe enough to enable ufw and deny all incoming connections when using an unknown network on a ubuntu pc with a strong sudo passwd or is there more that one should take care of

947243

microsoft has released a tool that allows you to upgrade or create installation media

947247

here s my guess when you do normal upgrade procedure you get new product key for windows 10 based on the product key you had for previous windows versioning

947465
installation	upgrade
due to some difficulties with upgrading my old installation i did a fresh install of windows 8 and then i upgrade to windows 10 right after without updating to windows 8.1 first

947467
migrate	upgrade
now i would like to migrate to windows 10 pro by reinstalling the whole system no in-place upgrade

947475
installation	upgrade
in short it doesn t look like there s any magic way to circumvent the upgrade method on the first install since you need to get your machine id up on microsofts servers to be able to activate your windows 10 installation

947476

perhaps tunnel you on the vpn and then letting you hit the public side of your admin interface is impossible difficult for dd-wrt

to fix i had to revert the upgrade and uninstall the vpn then upgrade again

my windows 10 testing virtual machine which already had a complex pin with letters set when the preview was installed is continuing to use that pin now that it has upgrade to the full versioning

there should have a option to perform an upgrade installation

ssd	sata
every 550 mb s ssd i can find also has a 6 gbit s sata interface

947853
ssd	sata
and if your machine had a 3 gbit s sata interface the ssd would still be far faster than the hard drive you re replacing.

947853
disk	ram
and if you re hitting the disk a lot it may be a sign of not enough ram

947853
put	get
if it is and if you can put more ram in the machine you will probably get more improvement for your money by getting the less-expensive ssd and using the money saved for the ram upgrade

947853
ssd	sata
once the ssd completes a request it via the sata interface and the pcie bus sends the cpu an interrupt that says that one s done

parallels can use a bootcamp windows install as a virtual os inside os x - so long as you shut it down rather than suspend when you ve finished

948115
vmware	virtualbox
you can use vmware or virtualbox instead

948120
switching	screens
also play with the switching screens buttons and see if you actually have a cursor but it s simply invisible because it s on the wrong screens

948156

i have seen a variety of post discussing how to get a cell formatted in a non-dynamic way based on another cell here and here but i cannot find a description of how to do what i want to do here

948209
vmware	virtualbox
i thought from what i read on the net that virtualbox would be slower compared to vmware but that does not appear to be so on my system and so virtualbox is a serious and free candidate to vmware

948235
folder	directory
i have tried using sudo and have cd d into the installation directory into the bin folder where the matlab script is and it still does not work

948268
mouse	keyboard
when i plug it mouse stopped moving it cursor means the mouse stopped working but keyboard still working

948279
put	get
it s important when using 1 to put something around it to prevent the batch file from breaking when 1 is empty because 1 isn t a variable it gets substituted with the value like sql injection an example of injection in batch and when the value is nothing and the 1 is in an if then you get broken code

the microsoft file checksum integrity verifier tool is an unsupported command line utility that computes md5 or sha1 cryptographic hash for files

onenote	ms-office
i m not bothered about syncing onenote and other ms-office files with the cloud either

948668
filesystems	ntfs
e.g. if you boot into microsoft windows from a partition formatted with the ntfs filesystems and the other partition also is formatted with ntfs and is visible to the operating system then the malware can see the other partition and its files

948668
filesystems	xfs
if however the other partition uses the ext3 xfs or some other filesystems commonly used on linux systems or some other operating system that the operating system from which you booted the system doesn t recognize then it would not be impossible but would be much more difficult for the malware to spread since unless you ve added support for the other filesystems to windows yourself the malware would have to include code within itself to be able to mount other filesystems

948683
mouse	keyboard
try changing the settings in the microsoft mouse and keyboard center

948716

in this case the connection speed between your devices and your proxy server will be limited only by the local network speed usually ethernet or wireless

merge the contents of the windows 10 iso images with the extracted files by extracting the contents of the 32-bit iso into the x86 folder and the 64bit iso into the x64 folder

948808
filesystems	btrfs
from what i understand btrfs subvolumes share the same filesystems storage so i was surprised to know that moving files between different subvolumes is an expensive operation like moving between different filesystems copy + delete

948859
ssl	https
i assume they are blocking sites when seeing some specific http host header or for https with sni when seeing the host name in the ssl handshake

948919
ethernet	wireless
however if you control the router or whatever device could be a dhcp server at the other end which could automatically assign an ip address to your ubuntu system for its ethernet interface check its configuration for the ethernet interface since it might have a different ip address that should be used for the gateway address and the wired subnet may be different than the wireless one

after that launch the upgrade tool and after long re-downloading it will propose the installation in the desired language

949018

to start i knew i needed an airplay receiver for ubuntu linux unix based os that supported mirroring and hopefully open-source

949140
vpn	lan
now i knew airplay only ran over lan at the time not understanding how bonjour only works on the same subnet so i looked into some vpn options

949140
vpn	lan
i have my vpn to act as if my device is on the lan of my server now and i have slave in the magic mirror airplay server running successfully

949140
openvpn	iptables
now from my debugging i can only conclude it is either the cause of iptables firewall or openvpn filtering the ports or requests somehow

949140
openvpn	iptables
finding nothing in the config related to filtering in openvpn i moved on to my iptables theory

949149

additionally you could put your raid1 disk in lvm and get the benefit of future painless expansion

949177

it s the same installation you d get if you clicked on windows update when you get the notice from microsoft to upgrade

949247
versioning	upgrade
upgrade can only be done with the corresponding versioning of windows

949247
installation	upgrade
for example if you are using windows 8.1 pro the upgrade can be done with a windows 10 pro install disk iso not with an aio even if it has the windows 10 pro installation files

949267
osx	yosemite
i didn t specify the version of either osx win because they will be the latest available assuming yosemite and win10

949271
installation	upgrade
the problem is that it needs to be an upgrade so the install is free but i want to keep my windows 7 installation

949310
installation	upgrade
so i would recommend backing up all of your files should be done regardless reinstalling your laptop then trying the upgrade again also since you re on a slow connection i d also recommend microsoft s media creation tool to download an iso or usb installation media so you only have to download it once

i would like to create a portable ubuntu installation that i can run both on the desktop and the laptop by installing a hypervisor with little overhead on the desktop and laptop and then have a virtual machine linux on a usb flash drive

949478
vmware	virtualbox
i would personally recommend virtualbox as it is cross platform free unlike vmware and can save disk images in lots of different formats

949484
vmware	virtualbox
does vmware or virtualbox use the same internal ip addresses for the host and the virtual machine

949502
versioning	upgrade
tried to upgrade video drivers to latest 2 versioning of win 10 nvidia drivers

apache	nginx
if you need to run nginx or apache at port 80 set root privileges for .plist file

949514
versioning	upgrade
just like any other versioning of windows you will need to have a key for that specific versioning which means you need to upgrade from windows 7 8.1 and then clean install using the iso that way you need no key for windows

949603
switching	tun
you need to increase it in order to tun java and this possible only from openvz admin so you need to contact with your vps hoster support to make this changes or switching to kvm another hoster

949888
versioning	upgrade
given that i had this problem across every single device that i installed windows 8.1 on and in every single case the problem was solved when i upgrade to windows 10 i feel it is safe to draw the conclusion the problem was simply fixed in the versioning of ie that comes installed on windows 10

in the third chart i ve added the min max data from column f to the primary axis and in the fourth to the secondary axis

if the nas and the pc are in the same subnet then they should be in the same vlan so no routing will be used

if you want to do a clean installation you could choose that during the upgrade

there are various architectural features in server class processors that are critical for performance and the cpu frequency is just one aspect in that

bash	zsh
if i run a bash -l inside of that zsh and do ls in that bash my ls is colorful again

950494
installation	upgrade
or will the 10 upgrade simply wipe out any problems with the previous installation

950505
bash	zsh
zsh runs the gnu ls whereas bash runs the default mac osx ls

950529
put	get
shared excel sheets tend to grow to significant size as more and more revisions get put in

950557
wan	lan
arp is mostly a layer-2 protocol although forward requests are a l3 packet but they are not routed so no setting on your wan will affect anything on your lan

950557
wan	lan
likewise an arp on the segment between your router s wan and the modem dmarc device could not cross onto your lan or onto the isps network

950594
switching	screens
is there a simple screens command i can use to switching to see control the virtual consoles on my systems

950604
google-chrome	firefox
edit appears to work fine only in internet explorer not edge firefox or google-chrome

950669
installation	upgrade
i ve had some trouble with my win7 installation recently and i cannot go through the upgrade my pc option without it crashing

950669
installation	upgrade
i ve read a lot of articles that explain how to get a clean install of win10 but they all recommend an in place installation of win 10 first using the upgrade my pc option

950673
installation	upgrade
after you upgrade you can then proceed to reinstall windows 10 using installation media such as a disk

950733
stdout	stderr
the above command will attach to the process with pid 21019 and trace write-calls to fd 1 stdout and 2 stderr

950886
ethernet	wireless
an ethernet connected printer and various wireless devices that don t really factor into this question as i am concern most with the connectivity and performance between the nas and the macs

950886
ethernet	wireless
as i only have 25mb up down internet i figure that i would not be sacrificing any noticeable performance if i have the macs communicating with the fios gateway wireless and try to find a solution using ethernet where i could have the macs and the nas talking to each other directly

950886
ethernet	wireless
if it becomes a bottleneck for web traffic i was thinking that i could leverage thunderbolt and add two thunderbolt-to-ethernet adapters and keep the ethernet connections that i have now for regular traffic to keep the wireless bandwidth strictly for the wireless-only devices

950886
ftp	smb
a 2gb test file was created and file transfer was executed from the command line using both the drive mounted via smb and logged into the nas with ftp

950904
afp	smb
make sure your nas supports that and mount it over that protocol not afp or the old flavor of smb

950931
filesystems	fat
non-unix filesystems such as fat generally don t store ownership information

950931
filesystems	ntfs
ntfs does but not in a form that linux can use. since linux expects all files to have owners the filesystems driver provides synthetic ownership information making all the files appear to be owned by a single user that s specified at mount time

950938
vmware	virtualbox
after my failed attemp of virtualizing windows 8.1 with virtualbox i had many problems starting on a poor file system which results in permission problems for iis and many others i m looking for another solution i saw there is vmware and i found something named kvm

950965
mtu	pppoe
however the router is connected to the internet trough pppoe for example that has a lower mtu and so a lower mss of 1452

950977
appdata	uninstaller
the real challenge and puzzle is to have this maintained without manually touching things every time you install or uninstaller a program which means leveraging existing windows install behavior of appdata folder designation

951051
screens	tablet
note that it does not open in full screens and i have checked and tablet mode is not on

951051
screens	tablet
as pointed out in the comments the first screenshot does make it look like tablet mode is on but it is not i simply clicked on the start menu and hit alt-printscreen which takes a snapshot of the current window not the whole screens

951062
versioning	upgrade
does chocolatey know that a program has updated itself check whether a program is already the latest versioning before attempting to upgrade

951062
versioning	upgrade
or does it have some internal record-keeping that tells it that an out-of-date versioning is still installed and thereby running choco upgrade will attempt to install the versioning that is already installed

951068
filesystems	ntfs
now i want to put it all in an iso image and send it to windows with ntfs filesystems

951109

google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
when i start my mac everything is working i can browse any page through any web browser like safari google-chrome or firefox

951266

once you install a self-updating application you may want to pin the versioning in chocolatey so that it no longer attempts to upgrade it with choco

951338
jobs	cron

951387
osx	yosemite
i have both mac osx yosemite and windows 7

951388
mouse	keyboard
the only usb devices i have are a mouse and keyboard both still working and the hub inside the thunderbolt display

951432
ubuntu	linux
if you ve got access to an existing linux even the ubuntu installer booted in bios mode should do although you ll need an extra usb flash drive you can also try dd in linux to copy the .iso file to a usb flash drive as in to write imagefile.iso to dev sdc

951438
x86	64bit
i ve no specific experience with postgresql but in general with database drivers it s critical to start from an understanding of whether the program you are starting from has a 32-bit aka x86 or 64bit aka x64 architecture

951451
versioning	upgrade
at the time of writing the driver versioning shown in the dell site is 6.0.1.7509 which is weird because if i install the versioning shown by dell windows 10 is happy to upgrade to the newer versioning

951451
versioning	upgrade
however no matter which of the above two versioning i use my sound volume is no where as high as it used to be before the upgrade

951475
sudo	passwd
you ask about using sudo with strong passwd

951487
mouse	keyboard
i have a laptop that i connect to different external monitors at different locations sometimes i connect to my laptop from a desktop machine so i get the benefits of a fullsized keyboard mouse monitor

951504
udp	tcp
i then went into my comcast router control panel 10.0.0.1 and set up a port forward connection that forwards my computer s ip 10.0.0.2 at port 1723 type tcp udp although trying just tcp didn t work either

951504

and when i use ping to ping wan website it works well but when i ping a lan ip address it does not work

951542
debian	centos
the os is centos 6 but i had this problem in debian too

951556
google-chrome	firefox
there is a plugin for firefox called vimperator which does pretty much the same thing as vimium for google-chrome

if it s been less than a month since you ve upgrade to windows 10 you ll be able to go back to your previous versioning of windows from settings update security recovery

951578

i noticed on my windows 8 installation that after upgrading to windows 10 the windows key was changed upgrade to a new windows 10 key in belarc but the internet explorer key still has the old windows 8 key written next to it

951604
ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	linux
linux likely ubuntu or mint partition on secondary drive

951615
google-chrome	firefox
it is interesting that i can download it from all browser like firefox google-chrome etc

951650
mouse	keyboard
1 turn off your pc unplug all usb devices except your keyboard and mouse disconnect all secondary hard-drives and boot your system again

951655
puts	gets
apparently this registry key gets reset set back to 0 by another process likely during logon and this policy puts it back to 1

951725
versioning	upgrade
there is an upgrade path available for lower versioning of windows to higher versioning from home to pro for instance but these options aren t available for enterprise

951730
filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	btrfs
also the installer reformats your disk in a way windows would like to use that s not the way arch does want his formatting eg the filesystems windows want ntfs most linux use ext btrfs zfs

951803
ethernet	wireless
after this i can connect to it either via the ethernet or wireless so long as it s not plugged in to my modem

951815
mouse	keyboard
my keyboard mouse were disabled so i was unable to press install do anything

951849

i have tested this code on debian jessie and ubuntu lts 14.04

951934

all devices on the hub share that power which is fine if they are all low-powered devices like a keyboard mouse or data card reader

951935
installation	upgrade
this page describes how to make an iso file for installation on any device including those that for an unknown reason didn t receive the windows 10 free upgrade offer

after copying the directory i overwrite all the files with new ones but with the same names

952010

it doesn t go into much detail i recommend looking at the one i wrote openvpn - the easy and secure way note that s targeted for arch linux but most of it s the same or digital ocean s how to install openvpn on ubuntu

952082
hid	keyboard
install autohotkey on your computer and using autohotkey s hid functions the hid functions will tell you which keyboard sent the keys you should be able to write scripts that are triggered by other keys on that multimedia keyboard

952082
mouse	keyboard
edit you could do this without the multimedia keyboard and use a ahk with a gaming mouse with lots of buttons

952164
arp	dhcp
having both ciphers enabled complicates multicasts and broadcasts and critical protocols like arp and dhcp use broadcasts

952190
ethernet	wireless
it would not be as fast as a ethernet or wireless network connection

952202
overwrite	preserve
in the second one will it overwrite checked out files that have been edited locally or will it preserve those

another dialog will ask you for ideal width then ideal height

952248
mp3	wav
you should not notice any difference in audio quality because the conversion to wav would be the same sample rate but a much higher bit rate than the mp3 - which overall would mean you would still have the same quality as the mp3 originals as you can t increase quality if the original is lower quality - the audio would just take up more empty data than what would be necessary

952316
mouse	keyboard
you can use your keyboard as mouse ...here is an article to help you with how to use keyboard as mouse

although launchd and the term launchdaemon sounds like daemons it is the preferred way to automate beneath everything

952603
daemons	launchd
in most cases you should use launchdâ jobs instead as described in creating launchd daemons and agents

952603

ubuntu	mint
mint is derived from ubuntu so there s very little you ll be getting in mint that you don t have in ubuntu

952695
vmware	virtualbox	ubuntu	mint
you can even install mint s flagship cinnamon on ubuntu -- at least in theory i ve never tried it . if you just want to get a taste for something different installing it in a virtual machine using virtualbox vmware or the like is likely to be easier and safer than dual-booting

952695
ubuntu	mint
both ubuntu and mint will try to install grub to the efi system partition esp

952695
ubuntu	mint
dual-booting ubuntu and arch seems more worthwhile than dual-booting ubuntu and mint since arch isn t based on ubuntu

some of the recommendations to turn off allow this device to wake the computer in device manager would prevent these clicks from working especially disabling it for all usb devices if your mouse and or keyboard is usb

955149
disk	ram
another option is to use some sort of caching option such as a ram disk

955153
wan	lan
the next step is not using the typically upstream connected wan port and using only the lan ports for upstream connect to router etc as well as downstream clients will cause the lan ports to behave as as switch and then it would need to pull dhcp ip from an upstream device such as consumer internet router or dhcp server on a nas or domain controller

955153
wan	lan	wan	subnet
for e.g. in this home media network below the router wr1 is a dhcp provider for the local subnet while the router wr2 is connected via lan ports with wan disconnected

955153

if i was to connect wr2 using the wan port with its own dhcp enabled it would create another subnet of its own

i have opensuse 13.2 and i try to upgrade the kernel to the last stable versioning

955305
traceroute	packets
when the destination of a traceroute is a host 94.2.55.112 for example on the first packets the routers will use the traditional way process switching to know where is the destination but after that in the next packets the routers will use fast switching or cef

955305
traceroute	packets
when the destination of a traceroute is a router 99.34.xx.xx the intermediate routers will do the same as before first packets with process switching and from then cache but the destination router won t do it because there are no next hop

i putted wamp online to use it on my lan intranet

955420
google-chrome	firefox	toolbar	tabs
i m using google-chrome on a vm i can also use firefox and there is a toolbar that has a tendency to get stuck at the top of the page it won t retreat back into hiding like it s supposed to and that makes closing tabs really really annoying

955420
toolbar	tabs
the height of the toolbar is pretty much the height of the tabs on chrome so anything that could shift them down add some padding above them that is roughly the same height as the tabs themselves would probably work

955447
installation	upgrade
following the reboot the attempt to upgrade will fail because you removed the temporary installation files earlier in this scenario

955494

if you want the official versioning you must upgrade via the upgrade provided by windows

955504

you could look up thiojoetech s video on windows 10 how to clean install with upgrade for all steps for media creation tool as well as clean installation

955528

pop-up	dialog
also disable auto pop-up dialog

955646
wan	lan
some routers don t let you turn off nat or don t add the wan port to the lan-side switch when you turn off nat so you may need to use a lan port from each router as its upstream connection

955655
udp	tcp
udp will offer better performance but tcp may be more stable for you

955672
scatter	graphing
this will give you blank spots in your graphing if you are using a scatter plot but a line graphing will still connect between points

switching	screens
there s also the airplay method from your phone there are several apps to provide airplay on android which would interrupt whatever else is on the screens and play the music but it s also playing the audio off your phone like the first suggestion and would require an hdmi switching to avoid needing the tv on

955810
ssl	https
when i use yahoo web messenger or google hangout in my internet browswer i can see that the communication happens using https protocol which means that the data is encrypted using ssl certificate

955833
udp	tcp
with the protocol set to tcp it works exactly as desired internet routed through vpn access to local network machines however when i set the protocol to udp which i think would be desirable for better speed then i find i am able to ping any host ip address or domain name i can telnet and ssh again ip address or domain but when i try to open a page in a browser it appears to make an initial connection but then never loads

955833
udp	tcp
since everything works properly for tcp and very nearly properly for udp then i think the problem is not down to firewall iptables but i could be wrong

955841
width	height
i understand that this will rescale my video to a new frame size having 720 pixels set as a fixed height and the width dynamically calculated

955862
width	height
you can also just set the paper height and paper width using the geometry package and design your poster by hand in latex

955894
bash	zsh
probably a stretch but is there a keyboard command that is accepted by cp from the shell using bash zsh to skip a currently copying file for example if i am recursively copying a folder structure of small files but forgot to exclude one big file that is taking forever instead of ending the entire cp execution excluding the file and starting the copy over with -n can i skip the file for lack of a better term interactively

udp	tcp
as far as the tcp and udp protocols are concerned ports are all the same

956237
ftp	telnet
same with ssh 22 telnet 23 smtp 25 ftp 21 etc

956237
udp	tcp
when a client or server process asks to listen on a port or asks to initiate an outgoing tcp connection or udp flow and doesn t specify a particular port the tcp and udp networking code in the kernel the network stack assigns them a currently unused port arbitrarily

956273
wan	lan
plug the computer into a lan port not the wan port of the router

956304
wan	lan
i can set the ip on fa0 0 to reflect the lan network able to ping internally or the wan able to connect to isp but can t seem to accomplish this with a single wan port as before

956304
wan	lan
what am i missing here how can i assign the router an internal ip without using a wan port and then just connect down to my lan using the switch ports

956312
versioning	upgrade
any upgrade from previous versioning of windows am not concerned with extra cost

956346

956448

we have an asus zenbook ux305fa laptop running windows 10 that is able to be woken from sleep with an external keyboard and mouse when they are plugged-in directly into their individual usb ports

956448
mouse	keyboard
however after plugging in a usb hub and then plugging the external keyboard and mouse into the usb hub the laptop will no longer wake up from sleep with the external keyboard or mouse

956448
mouse	keyboard
however as this laptop is being used as a desktop the laptop lid is kept closed at all times which is why we need to be able to wake the laptop using the external keyboard and mouse

956448
mouse	keyboard
we need the other usb ports on the laptop to be free which is why we need to plug the mouse and keyboard via the usb hub

956448
mouse	keyboard
in device manager the power management settings for both the external keyboard and mouse are set to allow this device to wake the computer under keyboards and mice and other pointing devices respectively

956448
mouse	keyboard
how can we get the keyboard and mouse to wake the laptop from sleep when plugged in via a usb hub

956449
folder	directory
xcopy - copy files and or directory trees to another folder

956471
udp	tcp	udp	mtu
path mtu auto discovery is the mechanism used to automatically detect the mtu between you and the vpn server however it is more robust with tcp than with udp on badly-behaved networks because tcp mandates explicit feedback that can tell you which packets don t arrive

956471
udp	mtu
the reason it acts the way it does with vpn links is because the vpn encapsulation headers reduce the mtu of your tunnelled connection and because udp provides no feedback on dropped packets

956496

we are using tortoise svn with windows clients and we had integrated tortoise svn with collabnet team-forge

these are all on the same computer over ethernet so no wireless etc to get in the way

956666

i have not installed windows 10 yet but i am curious if microsoft has finally gotten rid of folders with spaces in their names and if they have gotten rid of the split between x86 and 64bit folders

udp	tcp	icmp	udp	icmp	tcp
this was the motivation for designing the internet protocol ip and related protocols such as tcp udp and icmp which all run on top of ip in a stack where ip runs on top of some physical networking layer such as ethernet over twisted-pair ethernet over coaxial cable token ring wifi etc.

956817
disk	ram
readyboost uses flash memory devices such as usb flash drives or memory cards taking advantage of their high random i o performance to speed up disk accesses for data that would otherwise be cached in memory on a machine with more ram

956823
ready	each
the advantages of this is that each machine has it s own usb stick with its own fully configured and ready to go image and there is no need for network connectivity

956825
wan	lan
you need to buy a router that has one ethernet wan port and ethernet wlan for lan

956825
wan	lan	pppoe	dhcp
connect the wan port to one of the lan ports of the isp router configure the router to get wan-ip through dhcp turn off pppoe and finished

956832
wan	lan
the simple solution would be to connect the wan port of your wireless router to a lan port on the isp box and you re basically done

956832
restrict	shared
this is probably sufficient if you re just trying to restrict access to shared files printers etc

956832
spoofing	traffic
the internet traffic from your private network will be flowing through the guest network so by using an arp spoofing attack a malicious guest could potentially snoop on your internet activity by redirecting it through his own machine before it reaches the isp box

956856

mouse	keyboard
of course there are a couple of workarounds like typing the alt-code in notepad and copy paste it or assign the glyphe to a button on my keyboard mouse which is my current solution however i m not quite content with these solutions i m much more comfortable typing in alt-codes

957159
versioning	upgrade
with all the updates installed you should get the needed versioning windows 7 sp1 which is the one that gets the upgrade app

however it is available in my upgrade versioning of w10 home and w10 pro

957763
lan	intranet
i always thought intranet was the webpages accessed on a lan network but that appears to be called intraweb

957763
lan	intranet
so what is the difference between intranet and lan

957768
lan	intranet
usually intranet is not used as a term for home networks but technically every lan is an intranet or part of one

957775
lan	intranet
i always thought intranet was the webpages accessed on a lan network but that appears to be called intraweb

957775
lan	intranet
intranet would technically be the entire collection of servers meant to be accessed by computer on the lan but not available from the general internet - and intraweb could be the web server only from the intranet

957777
wan	lan	lan	intranet
if you wanted to go with the raw definition every network in the world is a small internet and every internet intranet is a lan wan just composing of different rules and some variations in the protocols usually to combat security issues

957777
lan	intranet
intranet is a lan between computers who s function is to be utilized as a local internet

957777
wan	lan	lan	intranet
the protocols will almost assuredly be different than a normal lan wan because a normal lan wan is typically meant to severely restrict communications between computers on the network whereas an intranet would want to be able to do everything the internet does in communications between computers

957780
installation	upgrade
i think this maybe due to the custom setting disabled during the upgrade installation

the real cause of the issues you re encountering is that the cpu cooler isn t able to remove enough heat from the processors

958624

962253
filesystems	ntfs
choose fat32 filesystems not ntfs

962271
folder	directory
the only reason i can think of is i believe those folder may be tied directly to the client not the address itself but it seems whenever i link my mail to say my phone mail client all the directory come with it

962279
versioning	upgrade
after that the machine you have the upgrade versioning of windows 10 will still be usable but you can no longer upgrade to windows 10 from your windows 7 key

962310
disk	ram
the ram disk acts as a cache device and persistent storage as the backing device

962357
filesystems	fat
if you combine a filesystems which is not aware of that fat which keeps its directory listing in one place and updates that quite often with raw access to flash based storage then one part of your flash is likely to die before the device is obsolete

962364
for-loop	arrays
to get the keys of an associative arrays in awk we use a for-loop of the form for key in arrayname action

google-chrome	firefox
i work on windows 7 and have current versions of firefox google-chrome and ie at my disposal

962643

962674
versioning	upgrade
i happen to have w10 pro x64 but i upgrade from w7 and it says a newer versioning is installed

his computer is a few years old runs win7 x64 core i5 8 gb ram uses separate 240 gb ssd as a scratch disk displays on 30 monitor in 2560ã 1440

962774
ssd	sata
if you check an ssd benchmark i recommend anandtech you ll see that sequential read is often around 500 mb s assuming a sata 3 connection which is the most common whereas reading chunks of 4kb is much slower less than 100 mb s

962795

963025
rar	zip
also sometimes it happens when extracting files from rar zip archives

963073
wan	subnet
then on this assumptions i m leaving behind modem internal ip and external ip of the wireless router would have to be on the same subnet of the wan gateway which is getting a bit confusing

963073
subnet	packets
what i know for sure is that the external ip of my wireless router should be on a different subnet than 192.168.20.1 so that it can route the packets into another network which is in my case the internet

963117
kerberos	ldap
probably i mis-configured something when trying to set up ldap or kerberos a long while ago

963118
subnet	packets
subnet will be sent out the interface 1 and if r4 the actual next-hop out of interface 1 of r8 has another static to 14.0.0.0 through r1 your packets will cross r8- r4- r1- destination

963122
google-chrome	firefox
happens in both google-chrome firefox

963122

traceroute	packets	icmp	udp
ping sends icmp requests network layer traceroute sends udp packets transport layer and websites use http requests application layer

963182
daemons	systemd
reserving some number of filesystem blocks for use by privileged processes is done to avoid filesystem fragmentation and to allow systemd daemons such as syslogd 8 to continue to function correctly after non-privileged processes are prevented from writing to the filesystem

963196
google-chrome	firefox
i m new to linux so i just used most the defaults changed google-chrome to firefox and used sdb8 as home and sdb9 as swap

963271
udp	tcp
off hand the only thing i can think of is that ping and dns are udp protocols while browsing telnet and curl are tcp

963271

963425
rpm	yum
read up on centos security patching and spend more time running apt-get yum rpm whatever s the package manager to get the latest security updates

963441

to add the typical vpn establishes a tunnel via ipsec if you wanna look into the actual protocol it uses.

963498
debian	linux
i had grub as bootloader in my pc which allows me to select between debian linux and windows vista home premium

best would be to have a shortcut to show and hide the sidebar since i need it sometimes but when i work with many windows next to each other the sidebars are annoying

963522
macbook	bootcamp
running a clean install of windows 10 on a 2013 retina macbook pro via bootcamp

963522
ethernet	wireless
problem relates to wireless network and not ethernet - if i plug in an ethernet cable without restart speed is fine again

963545
installation	upgrade
when you choose upgrade as the installation method you should lose no user data on hdd

i know that it is 8-bpp monochrome and i know width and height of image

963584
disk	ram
a write cache is a volatile memory usually ram that the os and disk use to consolidate and cache write actions into

move	drag
when i start dragging a window i expect it to move but here it does not move and only becomes usable after a few seconds at which point i need to drag the window again

963607
versioning	upgrade
after the update i have made a sata fw upgrade crucial m550 now at version2 as well as intel rapid storage upgrade to latest versioning

963610
folder	directory
copy your file in a seperate directory so that s the only file in that folder and run this command in that directory

963644
folder	dir
if you type in dir in the ff prompt window check what folder it is referencing

963684
opera	google-chrome
i m not sure if the issue i faced is a result of google-chrome or windows 10 though but for now i m sticking to edge and opera

963699
pull	push
winscp can also be executed from the command line to watch a local directory and automatically push and or pull files to a remote file system via scp or sftp protocols

963772
min	max
if you can t set a min max then my suggestion would be to use a dummy series

963779
config	ini
and of course there are loads of putty clones that support config ini files

963779
putty	winscp
another option is to make use of winscp 5.9 or newer that can open putty from a session specified on winscp command-line

963796
width	height
so what i want to do is write a little script that will start a gnome-terminal at a certain position and a certain width and height which i know how to do but what i don t know is how can i zoom in by that i mean make the text font larger without increasing the size of the window

963802
switching	screens
whenever i m switching to full screens mode - be it a video a flash application or anything else - the gpu load is going through the roof

963802
switching	screens
when switching to full screens it goes up to over 90 and the video playback becomes very choppy

963802
switching	screens
even though there is the additional load for the vm layer videos play fluidly when switching the vm and then the video to full screens

963810

the installer no longer says upgrade but install suggesting old versioning is gone

963840
wan	lan	wan	subnet
the wan ip of your wireless router is on the same subnet as the lan local area network or internal ip of your modem

963864
mouse	keyboard
i have a specific scenario where i have a computer displaying cameras on screen but the operators keep plugging usb s and keyboard mouse into it

963864
mouse	keyboard
i am aware that i can disable the usb storage functionality quite easily but i also need to disable the keyboard and mouse for them to stop moving tiles and screwing around with the computer

963864
mouse	keyboard
if i completely disable all usb ports that would be alright until i needed to access it myself with a keyboard and mouse

963962
asterisk	pbx
if you want to hook it up to your phone line and run it locally you would need something to act as a pabx - in addition to the phones you will need a box which has an fxo port to connect to the phone line and pabx functionality - probably something running asterisk pbx

963962
voip	sip
you would probably want someone who provides sip voip services - i don t know where about you are and please don t consider it a recommendation - i ve never used them - but if you are in america vonage is well known - there are lots and lots of other providers though

963986
mouse	keyboard
hence can be ineffective against keyboard and mouse usage

964003
mouse	keyboard
the only peripherals he has connected to his machine is his ps3 controller speakers keyboard mouse and monitor

964046

file a dialog box will pop-up asking whether to continue

964064
pop-up	dialog
i am installing using an admin account from the standard windows 10 upgrade notification blue dialog box which pop-up on the system tray

opera	google-chrome
if you happen to be using google-chrome opera or another blink-based browser there is browser view-http-cache

964102
fish	bash
you can start fish from bash

964102

folder	directory
without manually going through the list and typing the name of each folder is there a way i can get a new line delimited list of the folder or file names for that matter in that directory

964184
folder	directory
navigate to the folder in question cd c my directory you can copy this from your explorer window

964207
apache	nginx
or by the service itself things like apache and nginx should write their own somewhere

964227
post	get
but now the problem is on how i can filter only the traffic i need to be sent through the vpn by checking http get post requests

964264
scatter	graphing
i d like the bar graphing to be if not centered at least in the same relative position to each set of scatter plot data

964301
filesystems	hfs
note that next to hfs plus many other filesystems support extended attributes as well they just don t always play nice with mac osx out of the box

964301
filesystems	ntfs
one example would be for instance an smb-mounted remote windows filesystems ntfs

964301
filesystems	ntfs
both the ntfs filesystems as the smb- protocol and mac-implementation of it support extended atributes but in that context they re called named streams

964309
minimum	max
for the data you ll have you ll need a minimum -8 8-16 or 8- 1 2 of 32 and max 312 296+16 or 296+ 1 2 of 32

964347
gentoo	linux

trojan	virus
i m not sure if it was a virus or trojan but i found out it came from bitcomet

964389
cpu	hyperthreading	cpu	processors	processors	hyperthreading
a thread can only run on one core or if hyperthreading is enabled logical processors at a time so a process can only use as many cpu cores or lps as it has threads that want to run at the moment

964389
processors	hyperthreading
i m not going to get much into hyperthreading here except to say that windows treats each of the two logical processors in a core pretty much the same way it would treat a core if ht was turned off

964389
cpu	hyperthreading	cpu	affinity	affinity	hyperthreading
because of priority boost decay and because multiprocessing systems either multicore or hyperthreading or both are so common these days and because there s always stuff running in background in windows but we hope not using much cpu time and because of the effects of both hard and soft affinity it s difficult to run test cases and get the exact results that would be predicted here

964430
ubuntu	linux
i am running ubuntu linux and have installed wireshark on it

964473
ssl	https
go directly to the configuring wordpress for ssl https section

ok quick story i was given this laptop to work on due to the trackpad mouse not working

964507
filesystems	ntfs
it s formatted using the ntfs filesystems

964510
firefox	safari
oddly the file plays fine when i visit the link with safari but not with firefox 40.0.3

964532

installed from scratch as opposed to upgrade from a previous versioning

i ve tried both debian jessie and stretch with gnome-fallback metacity kde and xfce as well as ubuntu 15.04 with xfce gnome-fallback metacity as guests

964808
srt	subtitle
but creating a dummy srt which should contain at least 1 subtitle entry in order for the subresync option to be enabled is cumbersome

964824
osx	yosemite
in osx yosemite 10.10 the location of the personal macro workbook is different

964824
hide	show
in excel you first need to ensure the developer tab is enabled by going to excel â preferences â sharing and privacy â ribbon â customize and in the show or hide tabs area make sure the developer checkbox is checked

964826
cpu	hyperthreading
my current fix for this is to disable hyperthreading and turbo-boost in bios setup which helps to limit cpu temperature around 80c but it also reduces overall speed of my computer

964827
mouse	keyboard
neither any usage of the mouse or the keyboard should according to the bios settings be turning on my computer

964832
lan	intranet
both the wifi routers are connected to the same private lan like a university s intranet

964836
post	get
in regards to google s usenet archive you used to be able to delete nuke a post if you still had access to the email address it was sent from or could get a court order that it was your email

964841
cpu	hyperthreading
some programs may use more or less cpu total when hyperthreading is not engaged depending completely on how the program is created if it is multithreaded to begin with and how it works with the hyperthreading system

964841
affinity	hyperthreading
using start affinity is one live way to contain a program to a single core live in the system but it is not the same as adjusting hyperthreading on-off in the bios

964846
put	get
is there a way to access the .exe file and put my id and get my password without the window closing

964856
x86	64bit
i wouldn t recommend installing the x86 32 bit version of windows 7 but this will allow you to get to the point of the installation to select x64 64bit if you have an iso file with both 32 bit and 64bit combined

964889
ubuntu	linux
in the same manner as described here for redhat and ubuntu linux there are keyboard shortcuts set up in windows still per default

964905
ubuntu	debian
debian ubuntu is specifically referenced in the instructions

964958
dns	spf
spf could stop this and i have spf configured in my dns but i m not sure i want to go the route of fully blocking all spf fails at the smtp level

964959
filesystems	ntfs
- formats with filesystems ntfs

964963
ssd	sata
1 windows 7 is on an ssd while i installed kali on the original hdd the laptop has two sata slots

964970
ubuntu	linux
some time ago i updated the later to windows 10 and when i started my linux ubuntu gnome with vmware a problem appeared

965002
vagrantfile	hosts
a single vagrantfile can also handle specificities of windows or mac hosts

965037
ubuntu	linux
but whenever i tried to boot with it it showed the grub command line the one with the most basic linux terminal commands and couldn t boot to ubuntu from the external drive and i had to type exit to enter windows

965043
ubuntu	linux
as an alternative to most virtualization technology linux ubuntu can be installed on a thumbdrive

965050
vmware	virtualbox
if your students can install virtualbox or vmware it should be trivial

965052
packets	pcap
and as far as your differences between iftop results and netstat goes this answer on server fault sums it up concisely iftop uses pcap packets capture to show capture all packets on a network while netstat strictly shows the sockets open machines on the network

965052
packets	multicast
and multicast means basically that just throw packets onto the network

965052
daemons	systemd
because what you are saying about this burst of 2.5mb of data every now and then seems to mesh nicely with some background daemons systemd monitoring process that is trying to â œreach outâ to a network central server to send data

965054
ubuntu	linux
i m not a completely new user of ubuntu linux but i m still by far a novice

965054
post	put
also i apologize for the length but i don t know how to put all the lshw results into their own separate scrolling window within this post

965056
mouse	keyboard
in fact the keyboard and mouse don t seem to work at all

965071
subnet	vlan
it may be you can get a vlan switch that can handle different subnet

ubuntu	linux
i m looking to migrate to linux and i d like my host os to be say ubuntu for starters and my guest os to be windows

965186
disk	ram
according to their figures if the students are using the micro instance 256 mb ram a couple of gb disk space if they pause the vm when they re not using it it would cost them 9 yr running it for 8h day

965193
kde	gnome
unfortunately it s only for gnome desktop manager is there any for kde

965195
put	get
if you put in a dedicated graphics card with the same 768mb of vram and turned off the integrated graphics you d get access to all 4gb in a 64-bit system but 32-bit would still have the same limit it does now because the os needs to be able to map the graphics memory into its address space along with other drivers but those other drivers typically require only tiny memory ranges

965195
16-bit	64bit
given that i would recommend going with 64bit unless you use 16-bit software or are absolutely sure you will never upgrade the machine

965195
16-bit	64bit
while 64bit oses can t run 16-bit programs without emulation there are very few 16-bit programs still in use and it s unlikely you have any of them

965205
scatter	graphing
i switched the graphing type from line to scatter

965206
hide	show
best example is vlc it show a similar window with a checkbox below hide future errors not xmbc

965212
filesystems	ntfs
efs encrypting filesystems is a feature of ntfs that performs transparent encryption and decryption of files using keys that are stored in the os and transparently protected by your account password

965228
ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	linux
after that i created a new partiotion from windows disk management to reinstall mint.booted live cd saw the installation programm didn t see the windows partition but i procceded to linux installation with something else option and created home and swap area.after the completion of install i was asked to continue trying mint from cd or restart pc.i chose restart a black screen appeared saying welcome to linux mint and then an error apperared something with monitordesktop i don t remember it excactly and restart stuck there.i pressed continuously power button to shut down.at the next restart gnu grub was there and i had the option to choose windows or linux.i booted in windows but in the next restart grub was not there and pc booted to windows.my next move was to boot linux live cd and mount the boot partition to see its contents so i did cd dev sda2 and with it i saw the folders one of them was ubuntu but i couldn t acess it for example with ls command giving me the input output error

965229
google-chrome	firefox
edit3 ok so i noticed that i have to type the http prefix so that i can bypass google-chrome s suggestion engine in comparison with firefox where i can type it without the prefix

965245

965620
kde	gnome
in practice there s usually at a minimum better integration if you use ones that are developed together you can run kde apps on gnome but since kde uses qt and gnome uses gtk they won t have the same look-and-feel and gnome tools that edit the way apps look in gtk may have no affect for qt apps

you can simply add a second nic to your system use a usb one if this is a laptop - you can then access the wan with one nic and the lan with the other nic

966286

once you set up the ip addresses dhcp configuration on both nics the system will be able to access both the wan and the lan and systems on the lan can see and access your laptop

966300

when you have the wireless bridge in place just connect an ethernet cable from one of its client ports to the outer port of your router and you are done from the point of view of your home network clients all of this will be totally transparent your home machines will connect freely to the internet and to the lan on the other side of the road

ethernet	wireless
if your wifi router does not bridge ethernet frames from and to wired and wireless network you need to use two different networks otherwise your setup cannot work because your client always assumes 192.168.100.x to be on the local network and will never send the packets to the router

966514

in the meantime i can use the mouse to open settings and turn on the on-screen keyboard

966670
arp	dhcp
the ip address of this device is set with the command sudo arp -s 192.168.0.27 mac_address because it does not make dhcp requests and can t be made to do anything other than its job

966679
arp	dhcp
many dhcp servers also perform arp checks before issuing a lease so if you used dhcp you wouldn t have to worry

i do not use the wan port i plugged my isp router in a 1gb lan port

in windows 10 when connected to a vpn with split tunnel enabled gateway disabled dns resolution always uses the lan dns servers ignoring the dns servers and the dns suffix set on the vpn connection

966833
vpn	lan
i have fixed this problem permanently by manually setting the metric of my lan connection to be higher 15 than the one windows assigns to my vpn 11

966833
vpn	lan
note that you could also change the metric of the vpn instead of the lan connection but this wouldn t be permanent as windows resets the metric when the connection is established

966833
vpn	lan
depending on your environment you may have a different default metric for your lan and vpn connection

966833
vpn	lan
simply adjust accordingly so that your vpn has a lower metric than your lan connection

vpn	lan
when you vpn into another network with a tool like the juniper or cisco clients a virtual adapter is created which establishes a connection at layer 2 allowing the remote terminal to appear to be physically connected to the remote network and as such it is no longer connected to the local lan

968130
tunnel	lan	tunnel	vpn	vpn	lan
split-tunneling refers to operating the vpn at layer 3 such that only ip traffic destined for the remote network passes from the client into the vpn tunnel and other ip traffic is passed to the local lan per standard routing rules

no is not there a problem with the driver that happen because you are running a guest and it haves his own hardware and is not linked with your phisical or host hardware it is virtual even if is paravirtualization your ethernet cards and wireless adapters can t be linked directly with your virtual machine

if you have no internal expansion slots such as a pcie slot that you could put a discrete gpu into and i d be astonished if that were true you re not going to get any faster or newer graphics chipset on this laptop and you re just going to have to resign yourself to that fact

968514
kde	gnome
it would depend on what window manager you re running and whether the window manager depends on a separate compositing manager compiz or does its own compositing kde plasma or gnome shell

968514
cinnamon	gnome
gnome 3 and cinnamon both ship out of the box with a compositing manager and even if you don t have any 3d graphics support in the guest at all it will fall back to a cpu-driven opengl renderer with no hardware acceleration at all

tunnel	vpn
you did not specify which kind of vpn you plan to use so that i can only give you a generic recommendation you must make sure that your mail server will receive always the same private ip address on the other end of the tunnel or bridge it depends... so you must make sure you know how to setup static ip addresses for vpn clients

969025
vlan	packets
it works by sending the vlan id as a header in the ethernet packets

969029

i am not sure because the card specifications say min 300 watts psu and max 29 watt used and i have that

debian	linux
i see the following kind of folders in reading my backup disc with osx similarly forbidden in reading by debian linux 8.1

969479
debian	linux
for example debian linux compiles everything for i486 so it won t make use of any modern cpu features which means programs may be a little slower

vmware	esx
it s difficult to say for sure as vmware esx for example and hyper-v are different products and may perform differently under given scenarios

969689
disk	ram
it s probably more important if performance is a concern to give your vm its own disk so it s not interfering with your host os and ensure it has plenty of ram and virtual cpu cores

the same happens in google-chrome and firefox it is system specific

ubuntu	debian
this answer may or may not be relevant since i use mostly ubuntu derivative xubuntu with little bit of debian and recently fedora xfce 22 for experience

i said this because i know the howtos packages exist in debian and ubuntu repositories

969879

i got even lesser result when searching in repositories on newer releases of ubuntu debian

969879
dnf	yum
on fedora 22 yum has been deprecated and replaced with dnf

969879
dnf	yum
instead of yum search howtos i ran dnf search howtos and the result didn t list any of packages

969879
ubuntu	debian
the howtos are not included in the ubuntu debian installation by default

969879
ubuntu	debian
if you are not running ubuntu debian system it is still possible to search for the howtos packages on debian site as well as packages on ubuntu site

969879

for example you can t find english version of howtos on debian wheezy or ubuntu trusty

try ubuntu s recommended pen drive linux installer and follow their directions

970238
google-chrome	firefox
i m a developer and have both google-chrome and firefox installed

970238
google-chrome	firefox
here s why i don t think the problem is actually google-chrome - recently i got fed up with having to reboot and started using firefox when google-chrome froze but i noticed that after using firefox for a while it would freeze and google-chrome would suddenly become responsive again

970238
google-chrome	firefox
in fact i m writing this in google-chrome write now because firefox is frozen in the background

970238

filesystems	ntfs
the filesystems is ntfs but the partition table might be corrupted

970718
ubuntu	linux
you may want to try using an open source program like unetbootin to get a linux image say ubuntu written to the usb disk

970718
filesystems	ntfs
this will let you access the ntfs filesystems back up the data and run a filesystems check on windows with ntfsprogs and fsck

970756
lan	intranet
ping in lan works to intranet devices

970756

somewhat surprisingly in 2015 with thunderbird 38.2.0 forcing thunderbird to refresh the imap folder tree after adding a new directory folder is still necessary

vmware	virtualbox
you can install vm software such as vmware or virtualbox for free

970841
vmware	virtualbox
here s vmware i ve found it seems to work more seamlessly for me than virtualbox lately but you can use either

970841
vmware	virtualbox
you will also need an operating system install image file to install on your virtual machine - you will follow the process as if you re installing the operating system normally on your computer but instead it will be installing it to a virtual computer that the vmware virtualbox software creates for you within your windows system

970841
ubuntu	linux
here s a decent image to try out -- lubuntu is a flavor of ubuntu which is a flavor of linux

970861
ethernet	wireless

filesystems	ntfs
windows can not see ext3 4 filesystems so put it either in a ntfs or fat16 32 partition

i ve had to install google-chrome on our office machines to access an ehr that works best on google-chrome but we still need to use firefox and ie for other websites

so yes you are causing a conflict with macs natively and linux running avahi bonjour daemon

971297
tunnel	packets
the way it works is this a router on your side accepts ipv4 packets that are to be routed outside and encapsulates them inside an ipv6 packets which is then sent to the tunnel broker service

971297
tunnel	packets
their ipv4 packets are of course first routed to the tunnel broker where they are encapsulated into an ipv6 packets and then sent on to your router

971297
tunnel	packets
in your router you configured a 4in6 tunnel to forward all ipv4 packets to the tunnel broker the tunnel broker usually has all the details that you need for that

971297
tunnel	packets
technically you could also use a second network card in the server and tell the router to forward all of the ipv4 packets from that link over the tunnel

i thought i might be able to fix this by adding a route for destination 192.168.1.1 subnet 255.255.255.255 i only want to change the route for exactly this ip gateway 0.0.0.0 on the wan interface

971419
vmware	virtualbox
remove vmware tools if installed and install virtualbox guest

971434
wan	subnet	subnet	ip-address
first you should assign to your wan port ip-address from the 192.168.1.0 subnet or another address

971435
disk	ram
if the programs you re entering passwords passphrases into were to wipe their ram afterwards it might help but ram could be swapped to disk at any moment i read somewhere that could possibly happen even if the program tells the os not to

so i would like to convert a software raid-1 partition to a non-raid partition ext4 in my linux system debian 7 but i am clueless how to do it

instead of defining min and max of each range you would see how the rate compares to the minimum of each range

note if anyone who sees this knows of a way to use the instructions here to put the dongle in bt mode and retain the ability to get into bios please share it

971815
bluetooth	usb
the program does exactly what the name says it converts the logitech bluetooth dongle from hid usb to hci bluetooth mode

971815
hid	keyboard
the way in which this solution is different is that when your system reboots the dongle goes back into hid mode meaning that your keyboard is immediately connected and you can get into bios

971882
openvpn	iptables
openvpn can not really do that but linux comes with iptables so we slap a rule that translates one port to another

971915
width	height
edit 1 after playing with various sizes on the conemu root window i observed that the initial white border width and height always remain the same

971923

if that changes you could of course subtract the row offset in the formula for each call to row for offset in sheet2 and or add subtract to the resulting row number for offset change in sheet1

971992
pop-up	dialog
i d like autohotkey to automatically detect when a certain pop-up dialog appears and take certain actions

971992
pop-up	dialog
however the above example is just for illustration purposes and there are cases when pop-up dialog appear at random and i d like autohotkey perform some action depending on the pop-up dialog s title

972053
filesystems	ntfs
yes you can you just need to repartition reformat your disk s with ntfs filesystems because linux uses different fs ext2 ext3...

this is which most fullscreen apps switching to for their duration and switching back to the normal screens when they quit causing the previous contents to restore and it doesn t have a scrollback buffer

972232

exponent	modulo
modulo n followed by exponent e with md5

972381
exponent	modulo
how should i extract modulo and exponent

972381
hex	binary
i have tried to echo the binary values of those hex digits

972381
hex	binary	hash	md5
which should output the binary data of those hex digits and then compute the md5 hash on that binary data but the hash i get is still different

972381
hash	md5
for v3 keys rsa 1024 bit keys hash with md5 the fingerprint is computed against 129 bytes made up of the 128 bytes of the rsa n mpi which starts at the byte offset 14 provided that the first byte is at offset 1 of the raw openpgp public key exported with concatenated with 1 byte which is the byte at offset 144 and therefore omitting the 2 length bytes at offset 142 and 143 as rfc 4880 says

972382
folder	directory
this let you to the either the installation directory and shortcut menu folder

972383
vmware	virtualbox
i want to know if i can open a virtual machine vmware virtualbox ... and for example install windows 7 + some programs chrome word antivirus.... and then save the current stat i don t have any idea how i can then execute a malware after that i want to know if it s possible to know the modified files and the new registry keys that they ve added to the vm all the modifications after the first saved stat just for malware analysis and then i want to be able to return the vm to the first stat in some tutorials on youtube i saw them saving the new modification in files like virus.vmem

972383
debian	linux
how can i do that on linux debian i ve already installed vmware and

972386

972462
min	max
now i no longer have this laptop connect to the company domain and would like to change the password policy settings max min pwd characters password complexity

972468
opera	google-chrome
i don t think it s self-evident to all users of opera that it is based on chromium and that therefore they should search for google-chrome solutions to their opera problems

972468
opera	google-chrome
finally while shift + delete works in google-chrome it does not work at least for me in opera in removing items from the address bar autocomplete

972491
sudo	passwd
i can still log in as the newuser but it doesn t have sudo privileges and i can t become a sudo user since i don t have the passwd

972494
versioning	upgrade
i don t believe i can extract the windows 10 key from my upgrade versioning but if i am wrong please educate me

972502
vbscript	jscript
you can also use windows scripting host vbscript jscript to invoke the com object

972503
filesystems	hfs
i m not sure if mac os x cds must still use the hfs filesystems as in old 90s macs or just the regular iso9660

972505
rpm	yum
install the dpkg rpm packages sudo yum install dpkg-devel dpkg-dev

972513
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox open the options page and check donâ t load tabs until selected a similar option is currently not available in google-chrome but may be added in a future version

972545
tunnel	vpn
if your isp is blocking all incoming ports you can get round this by using a vpn - although you will need to ensure the vpn provider provides you with a unique ip address you can tunnel back through or equivalent

972553
filesystems	ntfs
while i ve often thought it would be handy to the point of considering writing software to create one most filesystems ntfs definitely included do not support unifying two directories the way you ask

972570
asterisk	pbx
asterisk is pbx not billing system

972579
tunnel	vpn
does a vpn tunnel neutralize the protection offered by a nat router

972585
openvpn	iptables
mitigating fixing this is not so much a matter of configuration of the openvpn server as ensuring iptables is running on the local machine and blocking ports as appropriate

972595
udp	tcp
neither udp nor tcp offer inbuilt mechanisms for splitting up

972676
folder	directory
under the root directory there is a folder named volumes

972686
udp	tcp
i need a way to tunnel all tcp and udp traffic through it in order to play fps games

972688
udp	tcp
this is particularly true because you will be routing udp over tcp - while this works it defeats the purpose and many of the benefits

972716
google-chrome	firefox
with this nice google-chrome extension cellect just like excel you can easily select and copy single multiple cell row column whole table by pressing shift + click drag to select like what you do in firefox by ctrl

972719
wpa	arp
i ll bet multicast is breaking maybe due to buggy equipment not handling a wpa wpa2 group key rotation correctly and arp request broadcasts aren t getting through to that machine so arp replies never get sent back so machines that aren t constantly pinging lose their arp table entries for that host and can never find out its mac address again

972720
button	checkbox
supports text fields checkbox radio button combo boxes and list boxes

972778
tunnel	vpn
the only thing i can think of is that this must be some kind of caching issue in conjunction with the running vpn tunnel

972789
folder	directory
a -d to exclude directory folder from the list as subsequent del command would delete files instead of directory as per del

972789
folder	directory
if a directory is specified all files within the directory will be deleted but the folder itself will not be removed

972789
folder	dir
treat folder apart use another for f against dir with a d switch but in this case use rd instead of del command to delete a folder

972796
icmp	udp
timeout conn 1 00 00 half-closed 0 10 00 udp 0 02 00 icmp 0 00 02

972857
mouse	keyboard
this is a wireless mouse used with a also wireless logitech dinovo edge keyboard which has a mouse trackwheel + buttons built in

972857
mouse	keyboard
once the mouse starts misbehaving it can also affect the keyboard s trackwheel buttons

972884
stdout	stderr
it will run the same command on a list of nodes specified by parameter and you might even parse the stdout and stderr for any of these nodes answer

972885
daemons	systemd
we have a active directory ad setup with our red hat enterprise linux rhel configured to use systemd security services daemons sssd

972911
folder	directory
knowing that i felt comfortable running the visualsvn server.msc right out of the bin folder in visualsvn s install directory which does get the management console to pop up but there s an error

972924
mouse	keyboard
a vnc server can be shared by multiple clients in read-only mode clients can t control the server via keybooard or mouse or read-write mode clients can take control of the server via keyboard or mouse but it can get tricky when multiple clients have write control simultaneously as they can interfere with each-other

972961
ubuntu	debian
ip6-localhost or ip6-loopback debian 7 ubuntu 12.04

972962
ubuntu	debian
ip6-localhost or ip6-loopback debian 7 ubuntu 12.04

972981
x86	64bit
the reason is because some badly-written software creates a program files x86 folder or writes to a wow6432 node in the registry even on 32-bit platforms so their presence does not necessarily mean the platform is 64bit

972985
move	drag
drag itself will move if the same volume or copy if to another same as win

972985

i firstly realized that i had some usb peripherals and i unplugged everything except power dvi for monitor speakers and ps 2 keyboard and mouse

973036
stdout	stderr
stdout and stderr are still attached to the parent shell

973036
stdout	stderr
if you don t want to see stdout and or stderr you can just redirect them to a file or dev null

973045
ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	linux
you were trying to install software from a repository for ubuntu but you are using linux mint and so the first command created a false entry in etc apt sources.list

973045
ubuntu	mint
instead of rafaela the mint code name the line for your repository should include the code name of the ubuntu version your mint release is based on that is apparently ubuntu 14.04 trusty

973072
sudo	passwd
it will ask before the passwd for sudo on the remote machine the one of remoteuser remoteserver and after the passwd of the destination the one of localuser localserver

973072
sudo	passwd
try to do sudo ls on the remote server and give your passwd when requested

973072
sudo	passwd
in that case you have not to write the passwd for sudo

973089

i have many pptp vpn tunnel or servers to connect to and linux would assign ppp0 for the 1st connection ppp1 for 2nd connection and so on

973185
ati	nvidia
substitute nvidia control center for ati catalyst control center when applicable

973201
width	height
-s 1280x720 scales the video to the same width and height as the original canon video

973210
pop-up	dialog
the first thing i tried was to download offline installer using firefox but the downloaded installer seems to bear some untrusted mark that always causes a similar dialog to pop-up

973219
versioning	upgrade
i ended up reinstalling rtm versioning of windows 10 as i was upgrade from technical preview before

973250
screens	tablet
my surface tablet has broken screens

973298
put	get
what i usually do to get it sorted is to use also the -r flag so the mount point is at least put into read only mode

973307
udp	tcp
many of the steam games use udp and cannot be forced to use tcp instead

973333
folder	directory
add a config file within a .ssh folder in the home directory and populate with saved hosts

973347
udp	tcp
a common misconception about tcp udp implementations is that there is only one way to code but there are choices to make when coding...and not all programmers make the same choices

973377
vmware	virtualbox
with virtualbox or vmware it should be similar you should be able to use snapshots to rollback to a previous state

973380
google-chrome	firefox
is it the sand boxing google-chrome firefox has that prevents potentially malicious scripts from running outside the browser

973382

973511
mouse	keyboard
sleeping worked for 6 years with the current mouse keyboard monitor and ups so their usb connections are not the cause

973512
sudo	passwd
i m logged in automatically as expected but when i try to run some command with sudo i enter the passwd and when i press the enter key nothing happens i have to kill sudo with ctrl+c the same happens when running sudo -s

973527
wan	lan
use the 4th lan port as the wan replacement also default

973565
filesystems	ntfs
on most windows disks you will be using a filesystems called ntfs new technology filesystems this stores filename information in the master file table mft separate from the file contents

973673
des	aes
use aes aes256 instead of triple des

973709
versioning	upgrade
if you re not running your recent versioning of virtualbox you should upgrade it

973709
installation	upgrade
but since this was issue on windows 7 but you re using windows 8 this still can be related to some upgrade issues during the install which could broke your virtualbox installation

973715
filesystems	ntfs
how to mount partition with ntfs filesystems and read write access use ntfs-3g

973715
filesystems	ntfs
in many distributions the original ntfs is linked to ntfs-3g in the beginning with ntfs linux was capable to mount ntfs filesystems read only so in some distributions if you use ntfs in your fstab it will attempt to use that kernel driver and mount your ntfs as read only

973734
filesystems	ntfs
moreover each filesystems has its own file structure and stores different types metadata with different sizes for example posix permissions are very different from ntfs permission and there are also inode numbers in posix which do not exist on windows so how can you count those metadata into file size

973738
filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	fat
the question is tagged win7 but looking at other simpler filesystems such as fat or ntfs may be useful as the concepts are similar

973843
vim	emacs
you can use neovim it has a built in terminal mode similar to emacs although very new - this lets you have it in a window like any other vim buffer

973881
freebsd	debian
the tools are adduser on debian useradd on arch pw user add on freebsd and so on.

973895
versioning	upgrade
i understand that microsoft gives users a 30 day window from the day they upgrade to windows 10 in which to downgrade back to the versioning of windows they had before

973909
put	get
to get home and end to work in vim and in the shell put and in your home .bashrc file

973913
google-chrome	firefox
if you just want to re-order firefox or google-chrome hitting f11 to put a browser into full screen mode will put that browser window to the far right of the list

973919
osx	yosemite
i have a macbook pro from 2011 with 4gb ram and an i5 running osx yosemite 10.10.5

973956
put	get
as the title states everything is working fine but when i try to connect to any of our intranet servers i get â œserver cannot be found.â if i put the ip address of the server in the browser it connects right away

973956
opera	google-chrome
doesnâ t matter which browser i use mozilla google-chrome or opera

974015
versioning	upgrade
i also have xcode 7 beta 6 and iâ d like to upgrade that to the release versioning of xcode 7

974034
width	height
imagine you scale an image down to half its original height and width

974047
wan	lan
your own rooms are on the inside the lan side and the rest of the world is outside the wan side

974047
wan	lan
you can again go two ways â towards your home lan or drive out towards the rest of the world wan

974047
wan	lan
it s a poor analogy but maybe it ll get the point across â the internet actually seems quite similar to me there isn t necessarily a clear line between belonging to lan and belonging to wan

974047
wan	lan
instead in this situation lan and wan are just names describing the port function

974047
wan	lan
often the wan interface also runs a dhcp client to obtain its own ip address from the isp while the lan interfaces run a dhcp server to provide ip addresses to connected devices

974048
ubuntu	centos
i have the same results with fresh installation of centos 7 and ubuntu latest

974049
width	height
imagine you scale an image down to half its original height and width

974064
switching	screens
but after shutdown and starting the asus express gate cloud the switching os button does not work - leads to a black screens and remains stuck there until i take out the battery

974074
ubuntu	linux
unfortunately - the above instructions only send email from my linux ubuntu to my gmail

974074
ubuntu	linux
my biggest desire is to receive emails sent from my gmail to my linux ubuntu

974107
ubuntu	linux
on a linux machine ubuntu 14.04 connected to the same network also with dhcp i can ping servername successfully so the dhcp and basic dns is working but ping servername.company.local fails unknown host

974114
google-chrome	firefox
my primary browser is firefox but i ve had it happen in google-chrome and it even happens in other applications such as windows explorer the little noise it makes when you hit backspace

974166
ethernet	wireless
i recently hooked up my routerâ a tp-link tl-wr841n wireless n300 home routerâ to my ethernet jack in my dorm room

974171
wan	lan
if you are not using the wan port as your main network connection that then feeds lan ports 1 through 4â and just using those lan portsâ then you are effectively using your â œrouterâ as a switch in some odd way

974171
wan	lan
with nat happening all traffic going from the wan would then be nat-ed from the wan to lan

974207
division	multiplication
and i don t even want to think about how you d do multiplication division or floating point. plus you need binary digital logic to implement the rest of the computer s processor anyway

974247
opera	firefox
change the default homepage for internet explorer firefox and opera

974247
opera	firefox
proxy settings for internet explorer firefox and opera

974250
centos	linux
i m new to linux i have a vps under centos and i do have a root user

974278
pull	push
well you have two options you can pull or push the backup

974291
google-chrome	firefox
but if i go to the google-chrome or firefox default font settings i can choose open sans from the dropdown.

974327
openvpn	iptables
i know that i need to add a route on network a to access the vpn network that s clear to me but i cannot see how to disable nat in openvpn also there are no iptables rules present so some openvpn internal nat mechanism seems to be in use

974354
cifs	smb
if itâ s a regular smb cifs network share itâ s executed on the client

974377
subnet	packets
now you need to add a rule to the router to route packets for the openvpn subnet 10.0.0.0 24 via the openvpnserver let s assume it has ip address192.168.0.127

974383
ethernet	wireless
what you plug into the moca modem can be an ethernet switch or a wireless access point so you can have a bunch of stuff using one modem

974383
ethernet	wireless
the routers lan jacks then provide routed ethernet just like your wireless does usually using ips 192.168.x.x

974383
wan	lan
and it would likely have two ethernet jacks one labeled wan and the other lan

974383
wan	lan
you would connect the latter to the wan side of your router and the other to the lan side

974383
wan	lan
you could even have a wireless router in the same box - then you would not have the wan jack but hopefully there would be several lan jacks

974383
wan	lan	wan	subnet
if it s a switch it will not have wan or lan jacks just a bunch of jacks. important unless you want the various rooms on separate subnet or something you must configure this wireless router in access-point-only mode

974383
wan	lan
for most routers that just means the ethernet comes into the router s lan jack not wan

974383
ethernet	wireless
you could also use a wireless access point here which would just have a single ethernet jack and no option to do routing

974407
translation	localization
disclaimer i m using the italian localization of firefox so i m not sure about correct translation of some of the commands further detailed

974445
installation	upgrade
these folder holds the installation media for winodws 10 upgrade

974461
macports	homebrew
this question is also similar to this one but their answer also wound up being just bail on macports and install homebrew

974461
macports	homebrew
i ve never been a user of homebrew â not that there s anything wrong with it i just started with macports and am fairly set in my ways

974507
versioning	upgrade
when this happens in order to upgrade the software to the latest versioning i have to physically go to the computer and use a local administrator password to allow the upgrade to occur

974525
chown	sudo
i also ran sudo chown root wheel iocdstoragefamily.kext and sudo chown root wheel iodvdstoragefamily.kext to make sure that their file permissions are set correctly

974531
versioning	upgrade
most likely the software you are trying to install is of sufficient different versioning that it is not compatible for an upgrade or the makers simply messed up the installer used a different identifier when building the installer

974545
ffmpeg	handbrake
you can use free software like ffmpeg or handbrake to do so fairly easily and how-tos on doing so abound

974568
min	max
then next step would be to choose group by adding a min and max columns based on the date and adding a sum column based on your count d column

974569
wan	lan
in laymanâ s terms nat functionality does exactly what your question describes it creates an isolated subnetworked lan that then allows you to communicate with the larger school networkâ s wan connection without having to acquire more than one ip address from the larger school networkâ s wan

974592
min	max
finally create a pivot table with the columns you require min max

974618
mouse	keyboard
think about it - the active inactive indicates which program is taking input from the keyboard and mouse which is the active program

974623
wan	lan
have you checked that the connection from the uni is plugged into the wan port - if its in a lan port it won t work - and indeed this could cause issues for others

974635
debian	linux
debian gnu linux

974635
debian	linux
debian gnu linux x32

974635
debian	linux
how do i add x32 boot options to grub give it a name like debian gnu linux x32 ensure its a boot option for the kernel during boot and ensure the changes survive after an upgrade or dist-upgrade

974636
vpn	lan
149.etc is my lan and 10.etc is my vpn

974665
folder	directory
j â creates a hard link to a directory or folder

974672
versioning	upgrade
there was a bug on this versioning of tuleap please upgrade to a newer versioning

974679
google-chrome	firefox
edge internet explorer firefox and google-chrome all started working again

974688
vmware	virtualbox
when using virtualbox 5.0.4 on ubuntu server 14.04 i get verr_not_supported when trying to import a vmdk which was created using vmware vcenter converter standalone client v6.0.0 as a p2v from a local machine running windows server 2012 r2 foundation

974688
vmware	virtualbox
i believe it s due to the new version of vmware converter perhaps generating a new type of vmdk that virtualbox doesn t recognize

974703
icmp	tftp
if its responding to icmp and tftp but nothing else it likely partially flashed before crashing and thus leaving itself with an incomplete os

974704
countif	sumifs
i ve tried all various combinations of sumifs countif and pivot tables but not managed to count the unique projects with the exclusion of admin

974719
subnet	traceroute
in what case is there two neighbor hops in the same subnet in a traceroute output

974746
tunnel	vpn	tunnel	traceroute	vpn	traceroute
another common occurrence occurs when running a traceroute from a device connected to a vpn concentrator which tunnel its traffic over the vpn to the remote device

974746
traceroute	lan
if we suppose this was the cause of your traceroute output the .14 device would likely be the concentrator connected to the corporate lan at the remote end

974746
traceroute	packets
there s nothing wrong with this and traceroute is legitimately showing you the identities of all the devices responsible for touching the packets at the ip layer

974747
restrict	shared
hostip shared to get all the files in it but everything is restrict

974787
mouse	keyboard
take this as an example the laptop has two usb ports one is 3.0 but that doesn t seem to matter and i usually keep a hub attached to it with a mouse a keyboard and pendrives or whatever

974787
mouse	keyboard
this also happens for example if i remove the hub completely and attach the mouse or keyboard to one port and the midi or audio device to the other

974799
solaris	bsd
for grub1 if you want to fire up an os which can be any dos ms windows bsd solaris or linux installed in the 2nd partition of the 1st disk the grub legacy commands will be

974809
debian	linux
if you are stuck at the command prompt in grub you may use terdon s suggestion suitably modified because as it stands it does not work on my debian and arch linux systems but the following does instead of appending text to the linux line in the grub display as terdon suggested type 3 three instead

974838
ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	linux
since you re using linux mint it s likely that the package for ubuntu 14 15 will work for you

974844
unix	aix
i have a unix bull aix client with ftp installed and a centos 6.2 server with vsftpd installed

974853
hard-drive	hdd
many external hdd enclosures feature the otb functionality which i hear is a one-button to backup system to hard-drive

974872
ssd	sata
at this point i used the sata cable connected to the hdd and move it to the ssd and then use other sata cables to connect the remaining drives

974967
google-chrome	firefox	ethernet	wireless
i ve tried ie11 google-chrome firefox disabling the firewall and av software swapping between the wireless adapter and the ethernet adapter running the microsoft fix for the hosts file flushing dns changing machine name creating another user account on the machine resetting ie to default settings putting the website into a trusted zone running ccleaner to clean out cookies and temp data and quite frankly i m at a loss as to what to do next

974971
macports	homebrew
macports and homebrew provide a coreutils package containing greadlink

974981
ssl	https
for https traffic - http traffic is sent over ssl so theoretically any proxy can only see that someone sent a blob of encrypted data with unknown destination

974998
wan	lan
on the spare router disable dhcp client on wan and and dhcp server on lan

974998
wan	lan
on the spare router manually configure the spare router s wan port to 192.168.5.2 and its netmask to that of the other router s lan

974998
wan	lan
the spare router should then have a wan interface numbered 192.168.5.2 and be connected to the other router s lan

975015
min	max
is there any way to remove all the buttons including tab close and browser close min max buttons bars title tab menu ect

975030
versioning	upgrade
i upgrade to the latest versioning

975043

975084
antivirus	rootkit
honestly if an antivirus isn t removing malicious code properly and assuming you have the scan for rootkit option enabled you should assume the second worst your boot sector is infected

975088
windows	winpe
in my experience it seems that this doesn t happen to the normal windows disk manager but does happen to the winpe disk management subsystem for some reason

975127
filesystems	ntfs
secondly on the same website it is mentioned 2tb as the maximum volume size of the ntfs filesystems

975128
mouse	keyboard
both are set up in a way so that keyboard mouse and ethernet commands are not waking the pc

975264
hdd	floppy
goto bios settings and disable floppy drive and set hdd containing windows to boot first

975266
folder	directory
the directory along the path you are requesting in this case folder are not being blocked by iis

975278
width	height
you ll find the width height settings under the framebuffer dictionary

975288
portrait	landscape
in this particular case the landscape orientation is photographically correct though the camera may have been in a funny position causing an accelerometer to think that a portrait orientation was intended

975293
kde	cinnamon
i just installed cinnamon and kde in kali 2 but i don t know how to change my desktop to cinnamon or kde

975319
folder	dir
ansible works as far as i can tell without a local ansible.cfg and thereâ s nothing in the ansible folder in the user dir but iâ m confounded

975323
folder	dir
thereâ s nothing in the ansible folder in the user dir but iâ m

975344
x86	64bit
if you have such a large amount of hardware reserved memory it mostly happens because you used a 32bit x86 and not a 64bit x64 windows

975348
ubuntu	debian
you seem to be running ubuntu debian if you are running sudo service postfix restart but what other details can you provide

975348
ubuntu	debian
assuming you are on an ubuntu debian setup open up the config here

975363
cpu	irq
so for example when there is instruction that just copy data from one to another location mov or instruction that cause cpu to set its instruction pointer to given value jmp or irq alu isn t used

975373
subnet	packets
the problem lies with the machines receiving the packets from 10.1.1.0 24 subnet

975389
folder	directory
i have a folder structure in a directory which is something like

975467
mp4	webm
i m running some videos through ffmpeg to generate mp4 webm and ogg files for html5 player playback

975490
put	get
its not cheap to put a new cable just to get a network there

975512
centos	linux
i m making a pxe server centos 7 that will be able to boot legacy and uefi clients so far this works fine but i also want to be able to boot into wds via the linux pxe i was somehow able to make this work by adding the following entry into pxelinux.cfg default file

975528
installation	upgrade
you can try to repeat the upgrade using a full windows 10 installation media

975530
jsch	openssh
but jsch library 1.0.52 works with openssh 6.7

975534
spaces	delimiter
i m not sure how cut handles spaces as a delimiter so i used a regular expression + which matches many spaces as one

975574
vmware	virtualbox
however you cam still use oracle virtualbox vmware paralelles amd maybe some others

975618
mp3	wav
did you lose the original mp3 and now you only have the wav file and you want to get back the quality you had in the mp3

975618
mp3	wav
unlike mp3 wav is a lossless format so sound quality should not have been lost in decoding mp3 to wav

975618
mp3	wav
on the other hand information will be lost if you encode it back to mp3 from wav but you can of course try it and see how it works for you

975628
fflush	gets
however for sync fflush events the default behaviour is to ensure that flushing the os cache actually gets the data onto the media tell the drive explicitly fflush the internal cache too

975697
versioning	upgrade
homebrew seems to install new versioning side by side with old versioning when upgrading outdated versioning brew upgrade at least i have a bunch of packages with multiple versioning

975709
subtraction	addition
addition and subtraction is identical as with unsigned numbers so cpu doesn t need additional instructions for adding signed numbers

975739
uninstall	upgrade
disable preferably uninstall your antivirus utility before attempting the upgrade

975739
versioning	upgrade
how to upgrade from previous versioning of windows using windows 10

975740
installation	upgrade
run the tool select create installation media for another pc not upgrade this pc now

975745
google-chrome	safari
if you are using google-chrome or safari you will see each tab you have open has its own process

975774
google-chrome	firefox
i say permits because it s hardly mandatory as so far as my research has shown firefox simply reads this information and makes it available for easy addition under the search engines dropdown box rather than quietly auto-adding it like google-chrome does

975855
packets	pcap
i ve done a lot of searching but none of these seem to work they either inject the packets or they only modify a pcap file not the live traffic

975924
tunnel	vpn
i m more a windblows head but it d be something like route add 10.8.0.0 24 10.8.0.1 so that traffic for vpn clients goes to the tunnel and everything else just goes to the internet via your router

975961
ubuntu	linux
i then used a linux live cd with efibootmgr to modify the list of boot options adding only the ubuntu and windows ones

975990
debian	mint	ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	debian
on debian ubuntu mint

976031
mouse	trackpad
i really like the middle mouse button and use it quite often so i would like to use the middle button above the trackpad as a middle mouse button

976062

by applying this service you can add benefits from the latest versioning of windows to systems that have not yet been upgrade

976079
folder	directory
it created a directory in my home folder

976081
google-chrome	firefox
i just came across this extension for google-chrome firefox and thunderbird markdown here

976163
hdd	floppy
load first sector 512 bytes of the device you re trying to boot from hdd ssd floppy disk optical disc etc into memory

976166
ffmpeg	libvpx
you may have installed libvpx but your ffmpeg build is missing --enable-libvpx and --enable-libvorbis or --enable-libopus and therefore has not been configured to support it

976166
ffmpeg	libvpx
you can compile ffmpeg but the easiest method is to simply download a static build of ffmpeg it has libvpx support

976181
ethernet	wireless
problem my high level goal is to have a device which would be connected to an 802.1x network over ethernet and would act as a wireless router offering wpa2-psk wireless access to the wireless clients with possible device mac address filtering

976181
udp	tcp
that is it s transparent to tcp udp and above levels

976181
ethernet	wireless
my university dorm only has an 802.1x ethernet connection and i d really like using wireless

976185
filesystems	xfs
about other filesystems based on my experience with linux mint 17.1 xfs behaves badly when hot-unplugged often leaving a non-removable mount that requires a re-boot

976187
debian	centos	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	centos
the name of the install script has changed since 2009 but the howto is still very helpful and gives commands for debian ubuntu and rhel centos style distributions

976191
ethernet	wireless
you could do this if you have a wireless router that can run an 802.1x supplicant on its wan port and that also does nat so that its wireless clients mac addresses aren t exposed to the 802.1x-secured ethernet network

976191
udp	tcp
so yes it s transparent to not only tcp udp but to ip as well

976191
ethernet	wireless
but if you leave your wireless router in bridge mode the client s traffic will cause 802.1x to lock out your ethernet port

976197
mp4	webm
i get the error when i try to convert mp4 to webm

976229
sudo	passwd
in yosemite when i create a new account without administrator privileges i can still su and sudo without being asked for a passwd

976250
uninstall	upgrade
if you re in win 10 after upgrade and didn t uninstall cisco first you likely have no networking ability

976270
png	ico	gif	png	gif	bmp	gif	ico	bmp	png
file types support are ico bmp dib gif jpg jpe jpeg jif jfi jfif png apng svg every file types that firefox or seamonkey support including url

976282
post	get
however it s also worth a look at the setconsolefont module from the technet gallery thereâ s a 4sysops blog post that might help to get it installed imported but i don t have a high enough reputation on this site to post that many links in a reply

976290
wan	lan
i used to connect to my computer via rdp through wan and lan with no issues

976290
wan	lan
when issue occurs i can replicate it on windows mac or ipads iphones over lan or wan

976299
filesystems	btrfs
the drive with the broken controller is recognized but will not join the btrfs filesystems

976305
centos	linux
lan windows linux pcs servers - centos gateway firewall box - isp

976323
opensuse	linux
install your linux distribution opensuse

976328
mouse	keyboard
putting it simply - the only two activities that reliably prevent sleep hibernate are keyboard and mouse touch input

976329
onenote	ms-office
it is the onenote which is pre-installed on windows 10 not ms-office onennote

976331
tunnel	vpn
is it possible somehow to make that public ip the one of my home router for some services using a vpn ssh tunnel s or anything else

976343
mouse	keyboard
i ve disabled wake-on-lan as well as wake on keyboard mouse movement

976346
folder	directory
i found that the username i used was not in user accounts but there was already a folder for it in the user directory and it was assigned to a domain

976365
switching	screens
i could alter the display to 2560x1440 manually using a generic driver but the the dell display manager does much more notable dividing the screens into predefined windows and layouts and auto manually switching between rgb and srgb depending on the program being used

976381
folder	directory
the profile can be entirely local default mode or roaming copied from server on logon copied back on logout or it could be local with folder redirection where the main directory is local but things like desktop are actually hosted on a smb file share

976385
cifs	smb
this isnt wol that you re talking about i suspect if you have a cifs smb share a shared folder setup then other devices searching for network peers can sometimes wake the machine from sleep

976398
ubuntu	linux
on my laptop i m running ubuntu and i also have a dual boot pc running win 8 and manjaro linux

976489
google-chrome	firefox
pdf readers that are built-in in current versions of firefox and google-chrome neither can verify the signatures

976489
google-chrome	firefox
i m fine with using a gui command line tool or a firefox google-chrome extension to do this

976507
freebsd	solaris	freebsd	linux
some systems linux freebsd solaris for example provide a command-level sleep command which accepts intervals smaller than 1 second

976513
google-chrome	firefox
for firefox there are a couple of other solutions for this problem but for google-chrome i have not been able to find any

976597
ssd	sata
later i disconnected all drives but the new ssd one ssd is m.2 boot disk the other is sata data disk and i got into windows had the time to format the ssd data disk but then on the next boot i got the same problem

976627
ethernet	wireless
my issue is that esxi can only see the ethernet nic whereas i want it to run on the wireless card

976632
sudo	passwd
take a look on ps output when you prompted with sudo passwd

976632
sudo	passwd	sudoers	passwd
so you need to put above command to etc sudoers to grant you sudo power without passwd when you launch sshuttle

976648
versioning	upgrade
i m trying to upgrade the power pivot for excel add-on from versioning 10 to versioning 11 but i keep getting the error that microsoft excel 2010 must be installed first

976648
installation	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
when i first start the installation process to upgrade to versioning 11 i get the message that a lower versioning already exists and asks if i d like to upgrade

976672
hash	md5
the problem is that the output from md5sum includes both the hash value and the original filename so the variable md5 gets set to something like 28a6a6c11f088d6149d178af6e45102a dev datto0

976718
ubuntu	debian
hope this helps anyone else on ubuntu debian for whom the other solutions didn t work

postgresql	mysql
directory hdfs sharepoint lists oracle db2 mysql postgresql

976741

now i can get it to come up and show post and get into the bios every time using the same stick of ram

976741
post	get
signal does get to the monitor but it s just a black screen after the post is finished

976744
udp	tcp
i m only concerned with outgoing tcp ip connections and udp since the router firewall blocks incoming traffic well enough

976754
switching	airplane
in my lenovo yoga 13 windows 8.0 when i set airplane mode switching

976754
switching	airplane
is there any way to make airplane mode switching re-enable also the wi-fi adapter

976761
pop-up	dialog
it does not give an option to allow or deny but fails the first attempt always then pop-up a dialog asking what you want to do for the same application in the future
