centos	linux
on linux centos in case that matters i m having a problem with git commands

325741
google-chrome	firefox
my default browser is google-chrome but when i occasionally use firefox for whatever reason there is often an update to it

325744
google-chrome	firefox
as for why google-chrome doesn t do this - i think it is subjective and you will get different answers - imho it is designed in a more traditional way - it allows all add-ons and if anything breaks the onus is on the user to find the error where as by disabling until they know it is safe firefox may annoy the average user but is a safer solution to the end user

325754
google-chrome	firefox
i m using firefox 6.0 google-chrome 13.0.782.112 i.e 9.0 latest version and is the same problem with all those browsers for downloading i ve used download manager systems too.

325786
opera	firefox
not sure what changed but chromium 14 opera 11.50 agree with current firefox rendering giant canvas showing just the red country so i m guessing the new behavior is correct given the markup

filesystems from fat to ntfs for their flash drives

325914
sudo	passwd
i realize mark szymanski said that rebooting didn t help in his case but i thought i should mention this anyway if it really is stuck in login the most common cause is that you ran sudo and then closed the terminal while it was waiting for you to enter your passwd

325914
sudo	passwd
if you do this sudo waits forever for the passwd and this blocks all logins until you kill the sudo process

325914
sudo	passwd
as of mac os x lion 10.7 sudo will notice when the terminal goes away and stops waiting for the passwd so this problem should no longer occur

325915
cpu	processors
you will likely see that the process itself uses about 25 cpu time on a 4-core processors 1 processors fully in use or about 12.5 cpu time on an 8-core processors

326709
stdout	stderr
in addition to standard out stdout they may also write to standard error stderr or standard log stdlog

326709
stdout	stderr
so to make sure that you capture all output you need to redirect both stdout and stderr in windows stdlog is automatically redirected to stdout

326709
stdout	stderr
in the example below the microsoft compiler cl.exe prints the banner header text to stderr and the rest of the help text to stdout

326744

scatter	graphing
+ using the scatter graphing format i have no issue creating a graphing of duration expressed as hh mm ss even if theres an am pm or even a date showing up in the function bar

327034
wan	lan
the traffic would have to come through the public ip pass through port 80 of the main router 192.168.2.1 then be forwared through the wan connection of the m0n0wall box 192.168.2.2 out of the lan connection 192.168.10.2 and finally into the server

327045
antivirus	mcafee
the best possible solution would be to uninstall mcafee and install some other antivirus program

327045
norton	mcafee
these all have a lot going for them and are very much equivilent to mcafee in terms of robustness and they are also free and tend to take up a substantially smaller footprint than mcafee or norton would

327077
mouse	keyboard
you could use something like this with a wireless keyboard and mouse

327104
antivirus	mcafee
as mentioned in the other answers this does appear to be related to mcafee antivirus

327132
wan	lan
because of the technical hurdles associated with moving lots of data long distances reliably wan links tend to be lower bandwidth and higher latency than lan links

327132
wan	lan
because it all uses ip applications that use ip don t have to know what physical and data-link layers are in use so anything you can do on a lan you can potentially do on a wan as well if you have high enough bandwidth and low enough latency for whatever it is you re trying to do and as long as you haven t blocked it at your firewall or via the accidentally firewall-like properties of a nat

vmware	virtualbox	virtualbox	parallels
i have tried parallels desktop 6 vmware fusion and virtualbox when trying to run a virtual machine with a bridged network adapter

327182
wan	lan
in the past yes location and distance were the predominant factors in the distinction between lan and wan

327182
wan	lan
for example a company can have a lan in their office building but when it connects to their lan in another building in another city country it forms a wan

327182
wan	lan
two small lans form a small wan which itself is a lan that connects to other small lans which form a larger wan and so on

327182
wan	lan
another distinction for lan and wan that is easy to remember is the makeup of the networks

327182
wan	lan
a lan is usually just individual systems devices connected to each other while a wan is usually networks connected to each other

327182
wan	lan
that is you donâ t usually have a sub-network in a lan and you donâ t usually have a single computer attached to a wan all by itself

327184

i think you need to upgrade to a newer versioning of ubuntu

327481

the router has one pot for dsl four ethernet ports and a wireless antenna nothing specifically like a wan port

327538
filesystems	ntfs
fat32 was implemented on windows 95 osr2 windows 98 and millennium and still has compatibility with windows 2000 and windows xp using a more modern filesystems ntfs which was continued and is also used in systems windows vista windows 7 and windows server 2008 r1 r2 enterprise server

327834
vmware	virtualbox
for the vm i would go with either vmware or virtualbox both gave me very good results

327836
vmware	virtualbox
at this point of time i d recommend virtualbox over vmware server since vmware seems to have eoled vmware server

327836
disk	ram
other than that it depends on what you need - i d suggest setting up a vm with 256 mb of ram and 4-10 gb of hard disk space to start with and increasing if need be

327836
ubuntu	debian
distrowise for the first timer ubuntu or debian is probably best

327847
ubuntu	debian

mouse	keyboard
note i cannot use wireless solutions except for the mouse keyboard but since i will have some available usb ports to the end point then i can connect the mouse keyboard there

328274
mouse	keyboard
this basically does the same thing only the box acts as a client and usually results in a better faster experience - you plug your keyboard monitor and mouse in to it and it acts as the client - no other local hardware required

vmware virtualbox are not processor emulators thus you are out of luck there as well

328352
ubuntu	debian
the specs are plenty for debian or ubuntu and its a case of what is called to use the technical term random gremlins

328387
windows	wow64
windows wow64 subsystem can happily translate addresses and function calls from the 32-bit world to a 64-bit environment so most 32-bit applications with a few exceptions should have installed in the first place

328400
cpu	processors
virtualization can make use of certain high level cpu features such as vt-x or amd-v and as a normal user you do not have the required privileges to be able to access those functions and control the processors

328401

kate	kde
in my kde 3.5 session i can t start any kde application kate kmail kwrite ...

328427

328439
disk	ram
a hard-drive requires the disk to be spinning and the head to have power in order to read or write but an ssd is more like ram when it comes to reading and writing

this same setup works fine in windows with both the nvidia and ati drivers installed

328604
disk	ram
like you said youâ ll need to make sure that you use the mode that xp called hibernation in that the ram is flushed to the disk and thus power can be completely removed as opposed to what it called standby in which a loss of power means a loss of state

this sounds slightly counter-intuitive but but when you think of your downloads as a stream of data that comes to you in a queue and you are effectively ticking off each portion of data as it comes in when you put more data packets from somewhere else in the queue you are efectively increasing the amount of data packets in that queue and thus delaying the process just long enough for your acknowledge packets to get back to the remote server so they can send more data back to your queue

processors	hyperthreading
the i7 has 4 physical cores but each core can do hyperthreading which allows this processors to handle 8 threads at once

329912
ubuntu	linux
i have a private linux box ubuntu 10.04 which is running various applications many of which i access remotely using local forwarding

329913
disk	ram
seems that task manager is right tools to get info about amount of ram pages owned by process discard kernel and driver pages and how many pages are swapped to disk

329919
processors	hyperthreading
the reason is hyperthreading which your processors supports

329919
processors	hyperthreading
hyperthreading isnt the equivalent of an extra processors but can really boost performance on multithreaded applications

329921
cpu	processors
to simplify how the cpu is seen to the system each hyperthread is seen as a separate cpu so a dual core 2 thread per-core processors appears as a quad core processors

329921
processors	hyperthreading
it is also possible for the operating system to use core-parking a feature in newer intel processors allows the operating system to suspend one half of a hyperthreading core so that when the extra processing ability of hyperthreading is not needed then the single thread performance is increased as the core is no longer sharing it s cache across 2 threads and can now fully devote the on-core cache to a single thread

329991
cpu	hyperthreading
it s worth noting here that while hyperthreading can significantly increase the amount of work you get out of your cpu it s nowhere near as good as having that many physical cores

329991
processors	hyperthreading
when your chip advertises itself as having 2 cores with 4 threads that means it s a dual core processors that supports hyperthreading

330004
folder	directory
put it in the same directory as the script or into the autoit include folder

330026
udp	tcp
your router may still be working as a nat device but that doesn t relate to tcp udp port numbers as used on your computer

330065
installation	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
i decided to upgrade a working winamp installation to the latest versioning but now it crashes right after loading the main window

330067
udp	tcp
there are two main transport layer protocols above ip these are tcp which is connection oriented and udp which is not

330067
udp	tcp
both tcp and udp use port numbers to distinguish between concurrent connections from the same client and to locate services on servers

330072
wan	lan
when you load balance you can use each link up to the maximum but once something on your lan initiates a connection and is sent over one of the links it is limited to the max bandwidth of that particular wan port it is going out of ie one computer goes through the cable wan connection and uses the full allotted bandwidth the router puts the next connection to the adsl circuit to balance it out that connection can only get 1.5 max

330114
fink	homebrew	fink	macports	macports	homebrew
i believe homebrew still puts things in usr local by default whereas macports uses opt and fink uses sw

330114
macports	homebrew
so i guess my better way to avoid this conflict is to use macports instead of homebrew and leave macports set to its default prefix of opt

with the firefox addon you can click on explorer s address bar and paste localappdata google-chrome user data default to quickly get to that folder

problem 2 can be worked around by redirecting stderr to stdout before piping it as follows

330140
ubuntu	debian
debian ubuntu should have deb package for chntpw or you can just build the utility from source

330148
wan	lan
with this setup no single connection from the lan an http request an rtp stream etc will ever go over any other wan port than the one the connection was initiated on so the max bandwidth of any connection is the max speed of the circuit it is routed over

another popular option for running multiple operating systems is to use a virtual machine manager such as virtualbox or vmware

330340
virtualbox	parallels
virtualbox can use parallels .hdd disks in simple-format without conversion

330340

then create a new virtualbox machine matching the cpu and memory settings as closely as you can to the parallels machine

330496
tunnel	vpn
i m assuming that 0.0.0.0 is a kind of code for everything so i m not sure how i could get this to work but the general idea is that i need a specific ip range to be resolvable on the local network of the client meaning it does not go through the vpn tunnel and the client can connect to locally

330559
cpu	processors
these lower limits are what the processors down clocks to with speedstep these multipliers are also hard coded for each cpu also with a voltage limit to save power evidently speaking

330574

however this is not an option at the moment because they only support windows server or redhat centos want something debian based

switching between displays tends to be software based - by the mention of ssh i assume its linux linux i d suggest trying to set the vga out and the screens in question as a default explicitly in your xorg configuration

one possibility would be to spawn the child process with popen so its output will come back to the parent to be processed displayed if desired or else completely ignored create your popen object with stdout pipe and stderr pipe to be able to retrieve the output from the child

virtualbox	parallels
after converting a parallels vm to virtualbox the converted vm still does not run

both xcopy and robocopy work the same way since neither of them knows the difference between local and remote paths

perhaps ensure no other virtualization engines are running at the same time ie parallels as they may be keeping the amd-v vt sub-system busy and so virtualbox can t use it

331488
processors	hyperthreading
hyperthreading is when a single core processors has some extra hardware which lets it behave as a dual core for certain tasks

331493
filesystems	ntfs
edit just one more doubt any particular format of filesystems for disks i should be preferring what i mean is it asks ntfs or other types which should i choose

331505
processors	hyperthreading
hyperthreading is essentially a duplication of the architectural and state hardware that surrounds the actual central processing units on a processors core

331513

331611
mouse	keyboard
i have to install the operating systems without a keyboard or mouse

331640
dpkg	apt
you could look into pinning and other advanced apt features but it would probably be easiest to just download the .deb and install it with dpkg -i

331657
x86	64bit
it just happens to be amd who invented the 64bit x86 instruction set which intel copied later on

331665
ubuntu	debian
for most newbies i d suggest a fairly well supported and common distribution to start with and one that has a livecd or minimal install cd - i tend to suggest ubuntu for people using newer systems or debian but there s plenty of good newbie centered distros

331700
versioning	upgrade
i have upgrade the versioning and still code 52 any help is appreciated

331797
google-chrome	firefox
i am running windows xp and have tried using ie firefox and google-chrome and the problem persists across all three

331810

331851
antivirus	mcafee
antivirus he had mcafee av something called iyogi malwarebytes antimalware and microsoft security essentials

331863
filesystems	btrfs	lvm	btrfs
either you ll need to reboot using a cd or external drive or another os on the same machine so that the partitions and files you want to back up aren t in use during the backup process or you ll need to use a filesystems setup that has snapshot capabilities such as lvm and or btrfs

331863
folder	directory
maybe all you really need is to back up specific folder in your home directory

331871
rtp	sip
sip is session based so once a session is created between two points by way of a sip server the actual rdp packets that carry the rtp audio stream travel only between the two points so if this is on a lan once the sip server wherever that may be initiates the connection between the two points it backs out until it receives requests from either of the phones such as a transfer or a bye

udp	tcp
i also tried add exceptions of putty.exe new directory port22 tcp and port22 udp to the windows firewall still doesn t work.

332016
filesystems	ntfs
the ntfs filesystems uses unicode exclusively but if you mounted it while having an incorrect locale the driver might be in a translation mode

332030
mouse	keyboard
from what i can tell you must install both the intellipoint keyboard driver and the intellipoint mouse driver which come bundled as a single install package to get the keyboard to function correctly at least for the model i was using which was actually a part of a desktop set that also came with a mouse

332036

ethernet	wireless
i have a tp-link wireless router tl-wr340g that is connected to my university lan via an ethernet cable which assigns a dynamic ip address to each device connected

332069
ethernet	wireless
maybe i m guessing wrong but could it have something to do with the dns server rejecting the ip address of my computer which is assigned by my wireless router s dhcp instead of the university dhcp as it would be if i were connected directly through ethernet

332069
wan	lan
i m wondering if there s a way i could route all requests from my computer through my wireless router in such a way that they all carry the router s assigned wan ip address which is basically the university lan s dynamic ip

332144
mouse	keyboard
indeed when it goes to sleep for more than something like 3 hours trying to awake it through a mouse move or a keyboard press doesn t seem to work

332149
mouse	keyboard
as an experiment i dug up an old desktop with ps 2 connectors connected the keyboard and mouse backwards the keyboard did not light up or work while in the bios windows loaded and the mouse or keyboard did not work the windows hardware wizard said it installed a new device and to reboot

332149
mouse	keyboard
i rebooted but still they did not work so i hot unplugged the devices and connected them to the proper ports the mouse still did not work but the keyboard came to life

332149

i know virtual memory is a paging file that computer uses to store a part of ram on hard disk for a running process

332564
disk	ram
is it the ram or hard disk or both

332577
disk	ram
archiving email from the server to say a tape drive is akin to the computer paging parts of ram to disk

332587
filesystems	ntfs
some usb drives use wear-levelling algorithms and you should also be aware of the filesystems you use on the drive use fat32 if you can since ntfs is a journaling filesystems so you may wear out the sectors in the journal fairly fast

332597
cpu	processors
my presumption is that there was some hiccup with one of the processors on my cpu an intel core i5-2400 quad-core

332610

332611
ati	nvidia
nvidia s gpus are better for floating point operations so they are used in most scientific applications when ati s gpus are unsurpassed in field of integer and bitwise operations and are used for cryptography

332624
folder	directory
according to wikipedia s article on temporary folder the temporary directory on windows is determined by the environment variable temp

332624
temp	tmp
even if tmp is available if a user or the system has set the temp environment variable the value of that variable should be used instead

332648
folder	directory
java uses the userprofile environmental variable but if you want to move the home directory to some other folder or other drive this is a bit tricky

332648
folder	directory
move the complete user s directory contents to the new folder from c users johndoe to c johndoe

332660
mouse	keyboard
at this point the difference is so minor i would save the 30 or invest it in a better keyboard or mouse which you are much more likely to notice a difference

332731
range	minimum
the memory capacities subsection says it can support a range of different memory modules 128- 256- 512-mb or 1-gb and the minimum memory for 1 module should be 128 mb

338701
kde	gnome

mouse	keyboard
the document map would probably work well for this but in word 2007 it appears to not be able to get keyboard focus so it only works with the mouse

338718
ubuntu	debian	dpkg	apt
basically since dpkg and apt are shared between debian and ubuntu they will be able to read and use repositories made for the other side without problems

338718
ubuntu	debian
some packages are named differently on debian and ubuntu so if they were listed as a dependency of the package you are trying to install you might end up with missing packages or duplicate installations

so how can i use some fixed linux tools to directly check it out to make sure its wan ipv4 or lan ipv4

339061
wan	lan
however note that the difference between wan and lan is more or less conceptual

the log is stored in the systemroot directory normally c windows folder

339255
google-chrome	firefox
is there any program plugin browser extension preferably for google-chrome or firefox that allows me to quickly change the ip back and forth or lets the browser choose its own dns server or hosts file independent of the system s so i could just use one browser using the system settings and another using its own settings eg

filesystems	ntfs
ntfs is the filesystems windows primarily uses

339319
ssl	https
the only effective fix for this problem is full end-to-end encryption known on the web as https or ssl

339324
ssl	https
if you log into a website without ssl https then that particular password is vulnerable but your master password will be safe

339355
wan	lan
i ve got a configuration of a modem a that s connected by the wan-port to another router b and this one connectects to a another router c lan to wan

this program encodes live audio from line-in or microphone directly into ogg vorbis mp3 flac speex and other formats

339358
speex	ogg
the current version only has built-in support for ogg vorbis and speex

339358
speex	ogg
it means you can use any other encoders too but for encoders other than ogg vorbis and speex you ll need to manually specify the command-line

obviously the workaround is to use firefox when i want to do something which requires flash but safari is my default browser on the mac and this is just a real pain in the neck

339449
ssd	sata
from what i ve read most if not all mechanical drives don t reach the full saturation point of sata ii although ssd drives are getting there supposedly prompting the development of sata 6gps so at the max standard length which you have of 100cm you probably won t see any issues so long as your cables meet the sata standard

339450
filesystems	fat
short answer copy the installer to and back from a fat filesystems before running it

gentoo	linux
so here s the deal for some time i ve been running windows as my main desktop os with gentoo linux in a vm

mouse	keyboard
if i don t i have also acquired a pci card which claims to add a ps 2 keyboard and mouse - and 2 usb ports - to a machine but for now it remains untried

339696
google-chrome	firefox
if you don t like to be bombarded by tons of advertisement while surfing the web and slim down your browsing experience with less network transfers you can use adblock plus for mozilla firefox or google-chrome

339738

at least in the case of adsl the modem performs such functions as obtaining an ipv4 address from my isp through either dhcp or ppp oe|oa distributing addresses to my lan and finally publishing management functions over http telnet and snmp

339776
button	checkbox
i did have to make one manual pass to click checkbox since windows uses non-standard checkbox which autoit recognizes as a button so cannot click on it

339782
folder	directory
then for many of the folder including favorites links documents desktop and quite a few in appdata i created directory links to the folder on the e drive

339792

340112

your best bet would be to set a main directory where you save everything and to use it as a large paid dropbox folder on both computers

340216
ubuntu	debian
if this is ubuntu debian this will be etc default php-fastcgi - look in there for a parameter with the same variable name as the chuid parameter

move	drag
you can override these defaults by holding modifier keys as you drag the item command to force it to move the item option to force it to copy and command - option to force it to make an alias

340449
snmp	mib
standard would be snmp mib entry .1.3.6.1.2.1.4.22 .iso.org.dod.internet.mgmt.mib-2.ip.ipnettomediatable

340449
arp	snmp
if your router does not support snmp your next option would be to connect using ssh or telnet run ip neigh or arp -n then parse the output

340458
ubuntu	linux
one other possible wrinkle is that the desktop is a dual-boot machine and usually is on the lan with the same hostname and ip address but running ubuntu linux rather than windows 7

x86	64bit
i have recently figured out that mac os x actually can run 64bit x64 applications even if x86 kernel is loaded

340591
freebsd	netbsd	freebsd	linux
other operating systems can run i386 processes on a 64-bit amd64 kernel but not amd64 processes on a 32-bit kernel for example linux freebsd netbsd and windows

340618
ubuntu	linux
on ubuntu linux you ll find home username pictures - macos has its own obvious equivalent

cpu	hyperthreading
they are talking about their hyperthreading technology that allows the cores in the cpu to each perform the work of almost two

340944
processors	hyperthreading

340960
google-chrome	safari

removing the installers installation program will mean that the installed program cannot be uninstalled worse some wont install an upgrade if the program cant be un-installed using the original parts

341062

341215
mouse	keyboard
by and large motherboard manufacturers still support ps2 technology ports instead of providing an additional couple of usb ports for keyboard and mouse

341236
mouse	keyboard
finally the main point is that ps 2 connector itself is relatively small not very difficult to use and it is sufficient for keyboard and mouse use

341273
mouse	keyboard
if a keyboard or mouse doesn t work in a usb port plug a keyboard or mouse into a ps2 port

341292
mouse	keyboard
i mean it has no mouse keyboard and screen but i guess it has to be initialized

341328

341330
udp	tcp
tcpview is a windows program that will show you detailed listings of all tcp and udp endpoints on your system including the local and remote addresses and state of tcp connections

341348
mouse	keyboard
the vnc service could theoretically be started via command line even remotely but that would mean you d somehow need to get to the device before anyway be it using a real keyboard mouse or having remote access before

341359
x86	64bit
this is a link to a win7 64bit driver package alps windows 7 x64 you should be able to find an x86 driver with a bit of digging at sony support as mentioned by slhck

best ones to get is google-chrome and firefox

341404
unix	bsd

mouse	trackpad	mouse	keyboard
quirks such as weird screen refresh issues apple keyboard apple one-button mouse or trackpad doing weird stuff desktop-integration weirdness sorry i can t think of specifics

341497
disk	ram
also i thought ram was equivalent to the term volatile memory but apprently hard disk drives are also ram and not rom.

341501
disk	ram
a hard disk would never be referred to as ram

341501
disk	ram
the only time these two ideas get close is where an operating system might pretend it has extra ram than it really does by using part of the hard disk as swap or virtual ram

341501
disk	ram
basically the os will swap unused contents of ram to disk to free memoryfor other applications then swap them back again when they are needed

341529
ubuntu	linux
i can t run virtualbox on ubuntu linux 11.04

341536
ubuntu	linux
i run ubuntu linux and have installed qemu

341579
disk	ram
in addition a disk s attribute of storing a large amount of data leads to hijacking of the term for other mass-storage media such as ram disk and solid-state disk

341579
disk	ram
apprently hard disk drives are also ram and not rom

341626

341698
cpu	processors
logging processors usage can be done with the cpu utilization monitor or i assume any number of other apps this was just the first foss app that showed on a google search for log processors usage

341708
folder	directory
i understand that i can use xcacls command on files and folder and i thought about using the command on the program files directory and that would work on most applications but for other cases when an application is stored in the c drive itself how would i deal whith these application

341708
folder	directory
could i add the modify change in xcacls to all folder in the c drive except the folder i know will be there from the beggining and are sensitive like windows directory

hide	show
to show file extensions choose hide extensions for known file types from the big list under advanced settings on the view tab

345167
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
unix linux on the other hand has traditionally used case-sensitive filesystems so programs from that world sometimes get the reverse effect they re more likely to have trouble on a case-insensitive filesystem

if it s xls or xlsx it s likely that she saved her changes to another file and didn t choose macro-enabled workbook file extension xlsm while saving it

but then recently i just found out why not create a brand new virtual machine with empty virtual hard drive then install my windows xp sp1 on it using the retail versioning of xp cd and then upgrade to the latest fixes and sp3 etc and then also activate the xp using the serial number and then shut down the machine and burn this .vhd image to a dvd-r and now i will have a virtual machine or i can start a brand new machine any time and as many time as i want to

345517

345640

alternately fedora which is a redhat variant â same tools just swap your redhat iso where it wants fedora has a proper liveusb option which is preferred since it reduces writes on your drive by only saving the differences from your base image

installation is quite simple place the ecofontsetup.zip archive in a temporary folder on your local harddisk and unzip the content to an installation directory

disk	ram
even more so by hibernating and letting it write to disk you ensure that your current ram data is kept reasonably safe even when you unplug the macbook pro for a longer amount of time and the battery power isn t enough to keep it in the hibernation standby mode

345969
disk	ram
if this outputs a hibernate mode of 0 your data isn t saved on the disk itself but only kept in ram

345969

the system will store your ram to the disk and will power the memory during sleep

setting up a ram disk in effect gives windows a hint when you decompress these files to a directory you don t have to persist them to disk which will definitely speed things up in the long run

this will depend on the laptop manufacturer and if there is some third-party software installed for your trackpad and mouse buttons

from wikipedia solaris is based on unix in some sense

346530
unix	sunos
bsd-derived unix sunos 4 with one based on svr4

346537

solaris is normally big-endian because suns used big-endian cpus while unix was originally little-endian because it ran on little-endian machines

voip	sip
i was under the impression that sip is a protocol for the initiation of communication between applications and that the protocol voip is for the transmission over an established pair of ip addresses for voice

346602
voip	sip
however i guess you could say sip phones are a large subset of voip phones

346602
voip	sip
i would generally assume that any voip phone is sip compatible

346605
voip	sip
so sip is considered to be voip and so is skype

346605
voip	sip
so it s called a sip phone since it s using the sip protocol but wouldn t work with any other voip protocol

346614

if you can i suggest you to open the computer and re-insert the ram and connect the cables to hard disk properly

the character is reserved for separating the names of directory folder from each other and from the filename

346647

if they are inside a system directory try copying them to your desktop or another folder you have full control of and running them from there

346677
init.d	pid
it appears that running etc init.d sinatra start creates two processes - sh and ruby and the pid that ends up in the pid file is that of the sh process

346677

it is set to automatically at server startup run a script named sinatra in etc init.d that launchd the a control script control.rb which then runs a ruby daemons command to start the server

uptime	reboot
i ve got 47 day uptime and if reboot is the answer clearly linux still has a long way to go

346729
put	get
unless you have an intelligent bios that spins the drives up one by one you are going to need to make sure that your power supply can put out some rich chunky amps down both the 5 and 12 volt lines most probably the 12 volt line will get hammered the heaviest and that s assuming that you don t have something else like say a processor or graphics card or something trying to use that power at the same time

346759
unix	solaris
your assumptions are incorrect solaris is not big-endian unix is not little-endian

346759
unix	solaris
solaris is one flavor of unix others similarly run either big-endian or little-endian depending on the cpu being used

your mac dims the display because you re not using the mouse or keyboard and you re on battery power

346903
put	get
if you put it in the computer configuration section it will get system privileges which should allow it to do anything

346920
filesystems	fat
files on fat filesystems are getting fragmented over time if there is a considerable create-delete activity

346920
filesystems	ntfs
ntfs and unix filesystems manage fragmentation better

346920
filesystems	fat
fat filesystems are often more noisy because the assumption is that power cord can be yanked at any time thus they try to flush as soon as possible since fats can be easily corrupted

346920
filesystems	ntfs
journaling filesystems ntfs ext3 etc. keep data in cache longer thus reduced disk seeking

346958
ssl	https
i would like to test client connections with imap over ssl https and other secure text-based internet protocols over ssl tls the same way i would using telnet or netcat if they were not tunneled over a secure protocol

346962
starttls	smtps
starttls is supported via -starttlsâ imap or -starttlsâ smtps options and the program will automatically negotiate it

346983
filesystems	ntfs
it seems that ntfs-3g in mint if booted when win7 is in hybrid sleep can corrupt the ntfs filesystems - however it s always a bad idea to hibernate windows then boot linux so it s not completely mint s fault

347011
versioning	upgrade
these obsolete data stores appear only if you do in-place windows upgrade and there are some restore points from a previous versioning of windows

when you measure the printed circle you ll find its height to be less than its width

versioning	upgrade
the answer is to upgrade the bios from the initial versioning 0302 to the latest versioning found on the asus hardware web site

356553
filesystems	fat
using a usb key formatted for the fat filesystems download the bios

356583
ethernet	wireless
however i lack the will to purchase an overpriced wireless adapter and i much rather not have an ethernet cable strewn across the room

356608
ubuntu	linux
this is a strange issue i m having with ssh from my macbook pro to a linux ubuntu 11.10 server

356608
rsa	dsa
on my macbook pro i only have a dsa key but ssh is listing out an rsa key what s that all about

356666
mouse	keyboard
do i have to include a psu case keyboard mouse

356686
mouse	keyboard
and of course to be able to use a computer fluently you ll need a monitor mouse and keyboard

356744
folder	directory
take for example the whole systemvolumeinformation folder in the root directory

356747
wireless	umts
i want to share my internet connection umts via usb via the wireless lan interface in win 7

356747
wireless	umts
the first step was to activate the sharing for the umts interface which is done and the chosen device is the name of my wireless lan device

356792
vpn	lan
go to the connections tab and click on lan settings untick use a proxy server for your lan these settings will not apply to dial-up or vpn connections

356831
google-chrome	firefox
or someway of using google-chrome addon in firefox

356844
xfce	gnome
if you have xfce installed in a gnome system and you re never using it remove exo-utils

356924
udp	tcp
your application is probably sending packets to a specific udp or tcp port number or to a specific ip-address

356928
versioning	upgrade
later during other upgrade some inactive packages are still there after everything has been recompiled against later versioning

356941
put	get
normal folder and that older application is 32 bit windows knows to put it in the x86 folder and programatic references to program files within that older application successfully get redirected to the x86 program files folder

356946
chown	chmod
note that additional care may be required to account for parentheses in filenames under locales for instance and that chown may silently unset setuid and setgid bits set by chmod

356953
mouse	keyboard
neither mouse nor keyboard input is handled and everything is just stuck

356955
debian	linux	debian	mint
my toshiba laptop is running lmde linux mint debian edition service pack 3 i686 kernel

357060
ubuntu	linux
imho that is a big benefit over generic linux distros fedora ubuntu etc which tend to consider old ppc hardware as an unpopular afterthought

357065
freebsd	opensolaris
personally i recommend zfs over fakeraid if you can afford to use freebsd opensolaris as it does not require hardware controller supports bit rot prevention via checksums for user data and metadata can read from other disk in the mirror if checksum fails unlike any top-notch hardware raid can make materialized-on-disk copy-on-write snapshots can use ssd as a level 2 cache to speedup read iops and has many more features

357101
debian	linux
this linux is rather debian very old

357106
solaris	aix
fyi for less-forgiving nix environments mac darwin solaris aix .

357117
mouse	keyboard
the only thing close that i can think of is that vineserver formerly osxvnc has the option preferences sharing server always allow multiple vnc connections in combination with disable remote control of keyboard and mouse that might give you multiple concurrent viewers over vnc in real-time

357120
ubuntu	debian
i have a laptop running ubuntu hosting a debian virtualbox

357134
versioning	upgrade
i am wondering how to upgrade the bios versioning in this machine bios does not recognize my keyboard which has the ps1 ps2 plug on it

357150
ubuntu	linux
if you d like to use the windows bootloader you can which under 7 i believe will detect linux otherwise you can follow ubuntu s docs on how to save or re-write your mbr so you can continue using grub

357155
put	get
i want to get for example the file root file from the second linux machine onto my machine and put it under var tmp without entering any login password manually

357167
pop-up	dialog
if you set it up to send to the virtual printer it can print to a graphic file .png .bmp .ps or to a windows printer on the host it pop-up windows a print dialog

357174
debian	linux
os crunchbang linux based on debian 6

357202
folder	directory
i have a folder named c jobs job#1 c jobs job#2 c jobs job#3 etc and a lot of directory and sub-directories under it

357249
stdout	stderr
here all the stdout will go to outputfile.txt while all the stderr will go to errorfile.txt

357296
google-chrome	firefox
you can also try another browser such as internet explorer or google-chrome to see if the problem is specific to firefox or you are reaching some limit in windows

357329
installation	upgrade	installation	downgrade
there is no way to upgrade or downgrade your windows installation from 32-bit to 64-bit or the other way around

357336
truecrypt	umount
i know damage to a filesystem can occur if it is taken offline without flushing writes by turning off the computer without umount the volume first - i assume this also applies to truecrypt volumes

357393
ssd	sata
that would be the same dollar amount as a ssd and granted the ssd is larger but it eats an sata port adds heat takes more power than ram

357400
firefox	safari
i was unable to get much farther than viewing the default inactive lags because in firefox and safari on mac things don t make much sense - the apply buttons supposedly javascript don t work

357490
google-chrome	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome
this won t fix safari or google-chrome though what s the word on opera

357493
macbook	bootcamp
i have a macbook pro with snow leopard and windows 7 pro bootcamp

357496
factors	matrix
plus some manufacturers advertise an active power factors correction scheme as opposed to a passive scheme -- the word active usually means better when we re talking about pc components see active matrix lcds active noise cancelling etc. but the little i ve been able to find on this says there s no difference

357505
ubuntu	linux
if you have a spare hard disk laying around you could try install a copy of linux like ubuntu

357505
vmware	virtualbox
after linux is installed try installing vmware or virtualbox and see if the error presists

357513
sudoers	visudo
so i made an entry in the etc sudoers file however visudo shows an error but doesnt specify

357524
ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	linux
linux mint contains their own version of ubuntu s wubi installer called mint4win

357587
google-chrome	firefox
my first thoughts are that perhaps you might be better using a different internet browser perhaps mozilla firefox or google-chrome

357594
gentoo	linux
boot a minimal linux livecd such as the gentoo minimal install cd and run the appropriate fsck on your partition s

357646
google-chrome	firefox
is there an easy way in windows firefox or google-chrome to copy and paste unformatted text

357651
screens	tablet
so far as i know there is no special code to control displayed pages because next page has different meaning on an iphone on a 10 tablet and on a dual 24 screens pc

357688
google-chrome	firefox
whilst declaring the proxy variables in etc environment seems to work for wget curl and google-chrome it has no effect on apt or firefox

357702
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome will respect the proxy environment variables but firefox does not even though it has apparently addressed this issue

357703
post	get
i get no noises or beeps or a post or a bios i get absolutely nothing just a computer that looks like it should work but doesn t

357737
mouse	keyboard
i intend to use a small form factor pc with windows 7 professional installed as a network appliance attached directly to my customer s lan without connecting a monitor keyboard or mouse

357755
mouse	keyboard
bring a small keyboard mouse display with you for the initial setup

357764
disk	ram
more ram will prevent memory being swapped to the disk which is quite time consuming

357766
mouse	keyboard
synergy lets you share your mouse and keyboard between multiple computers on your desk

357779
macbook	bootcamp
i m running windows 7 sp1 on a macbook pro via bootcamp it boots natively

357799
switching	screens
but i didn t switching from screens until today

357819
disk	ram
so by unplugging unsafely you have some risk that recently written pages temporarily kept in ram will never reach the disk

357833
disk	ram
the only performance delay will be if the os decides to use them because it has filled all the real memory ram in which case you will experience slowness as your system pages to disk

357833
disk	ram
if you over-allocate then your system will behave as if it has more ram albeit with this performance penalty that disk are slower than actual ram

357842
icq	xmpp
i m using a gateway service on the side of my jabber xmpp server to communicate with lots of contacts over proprietary networks like icq or msn

357848
rsa	dsa
you can use ssh s authentication which can be by rsa or dsa key for cvs on any modern operating system

357850
jobs	cron
you will have to decide how often you schedule the script to run - and if you run it via a cron job you ll need to check out how to make cron jobs persist across vmware server reboots

357855
mouse	keyboard
you may find that the intent of an option in poorly-documented bios interfaces is slightly different than the results it produces - for example on an early build of the p8z68-v pro efi image bios replacement if you turn off usb legacy keyboard and mouse support.

357878
min	max
i ve run intelburntest to max out the cpu to see if it was a heat issue and at full tilt after 20 min it was only at 85c and the machine didn t crash

357889
udp	tcp
the problem is that my university campus doesn t allow connections to go outside when the port is different than tcp port 22 80 443 or udp port 123

357889
udp	tcp
on my debian server i would like to listen to all my udp and tcp ports so i can clearly figure out which tcp and udp ports my university let through their firewall

357903
filesystems	fat
this device has flash memory part of which is partitioned as a fat filesystems

357903
filesystems	fat
however i am seeing these errors on the console these days and the fat filesystems becomes read only

357910
filesystems	fat
the most likely cause of this is the fat filesystems has become corrupt through power loss or some other issue that prevented a file operation to be finished successfully

357918
ubuntu	linux
i also have an ubuntu machine available if there is a linux utility

357922
put	get
to make my own normaliser i could create a new effect and put just creatives compressor in as a filter adjust things and finnaly get exactally what your talking about

357939
restrict	shared
additionally how can i restrict specific folders of that network shared and allow only specific folders to specific users

357964
mouse	keyboard
you will also need to extend keyboard mouse for control

358031
128bit	64bit
32bit 64bit 128bit increase by powers of 2

358060
integer	unsigned
this is why a 32-bit unsigned integer can store any number from 0 to 2 32 - 1

358070
umask	mount
i want to mount an ext3 filesystem on a device with uid gid umask options set

358093
switching	screens
i managed to fix this issue once but it was more than two years ago and i can t remember what i did and out of all of the things i ve tried so far connecting the screens to another pc and performing auto adjustment switching the cables etc. none worked

358102
folder	directory
i ve never tried using the pathname for local folder but i have done it by changing the local directory lcd

358109
debian	linux
this is a vmware linux debian vm

358111
ssms	sqlcmd
if you do not have ssms installed you might still have sqlcmd installed

358130
disk	ram
similarly files that are being written or copied to the truecrypt volume are automatically being encrypted on the fly right before they are written to the disk in ram

358155
versioning	upgrade
by the way i initially had the problem with ffmpeg 0.6.1 installed from yum but i upgrade to the latest git versioning and the problem remains

358163
opera	firefox
but in firefox and opera it stop retrieving data at 12

358180
ssd	sata
i have a 2.5 inch sata ssd that i want to power from an internal usb port

358194
versioning	upgrade
the numbers i can find show that it only has 512mb of memory for graphics but it is possible that upgrade versioning came with a larger chunk of dedicated video memory

358211
ubuntu	debian
although for ubuntu rather than debian makes interesting reading

358248
tunnel	vpn	tunnel	packets
if you only have access to the tcpâ ssh port then an ssh tunnel is as good as a vpn at least for ping and packets backtracking

358258
x86	64bit
either one one of the x86 derivatives without kfreebsd - the 32 bit i386 or the 64bit amd64 intel uses a compatible architecture called emt64 but since amd was first to market many refer to it as amd64 - the correct generic name is x86-64 would do practically speaking - the 64bit x86 architecture is backward compatible with the 32 bit architecture

358258
freebsd	debian
the kfreebsd alternatives use a freebsd kernel with debian userland tools

358300
subtraction	addition
for basic addition subtraction mulitiplication and division.

358306
tunnel	packets
any packets sent to port 8080 locally would then be sent via the tunnel to the proxy server port 8080

358310
versioning	upgrade
depending on the chain of upgrade versioning 3.x - 4.x - 5.x the database file can end up in odd places

358321
put	get
in order to allow the mouse events to get through to the real window use setwindowrgn to put a 1-pixel hole in the dead window where the mouse is

358325
pop-up	dialog
when i try launching the software it pop-up a dialog saying scanwizard pro can t find any scanners

358333
processors	hyperthreading
most intel processors feature what they call hyperthreading basically another virtual core for each physical core

358336
vbscript	autoit
you can do some similar tricks with vbscript and the windows scripting host which you should already have but i found autoit easier

358360
cpu	processors
while comparing intel s two new i7 processors i noticed that the only difference between them apart from the l3 cache size and cpu speed is that one has quickpath interconnect and that seems to account for most of the massive price difference between the two 600 vs 1000

358363
google-chrome	firefox
i don t know how to do that in firefox and google-chrome

358365
google-chrome	firefox
with both google-chrome and firefox you can just highlight the term you want to delete and hit the delete button

358373
cpu	processors
the memory controllers are moved from the chipset into the cpu shortening the path from each processors to ram and preventing data from going a back and forth through a central shared chipset to get at memory

358376
filesystems	ntfs
ntfs is a mature filesystems and most of the operating system supports read and write especially linux

358400
versioning	upgrade
first you need to upgrade your nvidia graphics card driver to versioning 2.70 or higher

358412
min	max
small 3 min video takes max 10 mins

358413
versioning	upgrade	uninstall	upgrade
is it better to uninstall the old versioning first and then run the new installer or will all installers have the facility to upgrade automatically

358422
versioning	upgrade	uninstall	upgrade
is it better to uninstall the old versioning first and then run the new installer or will all installers have the facility to upgrade automatically

358425

i want to install the debian testing linux version

358432
umask	mount
mount -t ext3 -ouid 1001 gid 1001 umask 0066 dev mapper mdev5 dir

358443
disk	ram
i m not sure what you re asking...you just want to use your ram as a ram disk

358483
folder	directory
if dropbox is running as user tomas you should also run a chmod -r command on this folder that gives tomas all permissions for the directory tree

358489
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
the find and search commands each would return the index of a given needle in a haystack find is case-sensitive search is case-insensitive and allows wildcards

358507
wan	lan
i want traffic outgoing to some ip in wan to be redirrected to local pc in lan

358507
wan	lan
for example traffic to ip 1.2.3.4 wan would be redirrected to 192.168.0.3 to my lan computer

358564
tunnel	vpn
the problem sounds like it may be that the vpn server is set to compulsory tunnel which means that no other network connection is allowed except through the vpn

358564
tunnel	vpn
vpn on mac os x snow leopard with split tunnel

358601
versioning	upgrade
also if your development is heavy with the databases database versioning is disk intensive and that would again make the cpu a less than favorable upgrade

358655
sudo	passwd
sudo passwd root

358669
bash	zsh
if you use bash or zsh you can use disown and the shell will no longer send sighup and the processes will stay around

358700
bash	zsh
when using advanced shells such as bash or zsh the which tool is inaccurate since it only checks path but there are several more possibilities

358708
ubuntu	linux
in another question about installing java on ubuntu linux it said that i needed to do the following

358715
filesystems	ntfs
using ntfs filesystems on linux i am able to have a partition that is either compressing the data or not

358728
antivirus	norton
it is positioned below the premium norton 360 and above the entry-level norton antivirus

358731
filesystems	ntfs
volume shadow copy is a mechanism for storing snapshots on ntfs filesystems

358732
filesystems	ntfs
volume shadow copy is a mechanism for storing snapshots on ntfs filesystems

358758
xfs	ntfs	filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	xfs
for some background i looked at the jfs and xfs filesystems ntfs has a limitation of the number of files per volume

358795
debian	linux	debian	mint
is it possible to map right - ctrl to esc in linux mint debian edition

358809
ubuntu	linux
so sometimes the vdi is used by virtualbox on linux and then sometimes by ubuntu

358818
wan	lan
on the wan side it is assigned the 10.89.49.101 ip address from the basement router and on its lan it provides the 10.89.7.0 24 network

358827
ubuntu	linux
so i need to create a ipv6 virtual network in my linux os i use ubuntu

358829
put	get
if i only get the file ntpdate and put it on my linux machine under tmp is it possible to run

358837
mp3	wav
these recorders record high bitrate mp3 and the panasonic also records wav

358857
debian	linux
you need to reboot with a linux cd for example debian installation cd than enter in recovery mode and mount your linux root partition and boot if it is in a separate partition

358861
filesystems	ntfs
windows filesystems such as ntfs apparently store the encoding with the filename but utf-16 is standard

358861
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
some parts of windows are case-sensitive other parts are case-insensitive

358861
filesystems	ntfs
it is easy to create distinct filenames like ab and ab on a windows ntfs filesystems

358880
folder	directory
if you re not running active directory every person on the lan has to be a user on the computer with the shared folder

358884
ssd	sata
if the drive is a standard 2.5 drive and has a normal sata connector then there is a good chance that a 2.5 ssd can be used as a drop in replacement

358889
google-chrome	firefox
internet firefox or google-chrome

358913
ubuntu	centos
it looks like on ubuntu and windows it s apache2 but on centos it s httpd

358959
vmware	virtualbox
you can use some virtualization software for that like xen virtualbox vmware etc

359006
post	get
i will update this post one more time to add a link to the script whenever i get it working in a more serious fashion

359026
jobs	cron
but i think vixie cron supports cron jobs for root and has a start up time setting

move	drag
you can also drag the tab within the active window to spawn a split-screen view by selecting one of the two move to new view or clone to other view when you release the mouse button after dragging

bash	tcsh
on one of the mac machines i m somewhat responsible for snow leopard something periodically changes the default login shell from bash to tcsh

google-chrome	firefox
after a good session of web usage i often have 10 or more google-chrome or firefox instances open at once

359091
google-chrome	firefox
under each browser if you go to their respective menus eg file menu for firefox and customize and control google-chrome the wrench icon for google-chrome click the exit

359107
folder	directory
i want to copy a file from a source directory into multiple folder of a target directory and rename each copy to its original name plus the name of the folder

359112
sudoers	visudo
as far as i know the major difference is that visudo has a simple parser for seeing if etc sudoers and other sudoers files is goodly

359112
sudoers	visudo
from what i can tell this is because visudo does not honour values unless they are listed in sudoers

359113
mouse	keyboard
whenever kde i think detects no mouse or keyboard activity for a while it dims my laptop screen then turns it off

359115
ati	nvidia
if the motherboard has an nvidia chipset i d be wary of installing an ati graphics card and vice versa

webgl rendering anomaly in google-chrome and mozilla firefox browsers resolved

359274
ubuntu	debian
i have a preference for a debian based system because as a frequent ubuntu user i am used to apt-get all the time

359315
bash	zsh
if you don t like that use zsh instead of bash

359320
put	get
set the subnet mask to 255.255.255.0 and set the default router address to that of your swisscom my case 192.168.1.1 i also set the dns to the same address and this seemed to work - i guess you could get the dns address of the isp and put it in here if you want

359341
wav	flac
i have a flac file which can be converted to wav if required and its original cue sheet is there any audio editor freeware would be better that allows me to adjust the start stop position of the individual tracks from the cue sheet

359349
google-chrome	firefox
how can i get google s google-chrome or mozilla s firefox or even microsoft s internet explorer and microsoft office to recognize the capital letter in the middle of a word as beginning a new word and therefore not marking the word as misspelled unless the 2nd word is misspelled ex superusr

359366

in the past i have even skipped the first step when moving from ati to nvidia and it wouldn t do any damage but it is usually best to remove the old driver

359601
mouse	keyboard
when the pool runs out dev random waits for it to refill which requires monitoring system behavior keyboard input mouse movement etc. whereas dev urandom will continue to give you pseudo-random data

359601
prng	random
i ve seem claims including in other answers here that dev random implements a true random number generator as opposed to a pseudo-random number generator prng

359601
mouse	keyboard
generators like dev random and dev urandom that harvest entropy from some practically unpredictable source like i o activity this is why pounding on the keyboard or moving the mouse can cause dev random to produce more data

359601
prng	random
it s not clear to me whether these satisfy the definition of a prng i ve seen definitions that say a prng is deterministic but neither are they true random number generators

359613
width	height
furthermore if your screen is centered on your tv and it s not using full width and height it might be that your graphic software like nvidia amd ... is using an overscan of a certain percentage mostly 10

359613
width	height
you can set that to 0 to use the full width and height of the tv at all times

fink	homebrew	fink	macports	macports	homebrew
the most popular are homebrew macports or fink sorted in the order i would recommend

359734
mp4	h.264
you should go with the mp4 option which uses the aforementioned h.264 codec if possible

359734
mp4	h.264	mp4	webm	h.264	webm
as you can see the best quality is available through mp4 equals h.264 codec and webm only

ubuntu	linux
or use an ubuntu or other linux live cd to copy your data off without removing the hard drive

359774

359806
vsto	add-in
you may want to look into writing a vsto add-in for something like that

359824
udp	tcp
for instance any vpn operating over udp ip will add at least 36 bytes 20 for the tcp header 16 for the udp header to each packet including the small ack response packets that acknowledge receipt and for larger packets it may break them into smaller blocks making this overhead more significant

359824
udp	tcp
for low bandwidth interactive traffic such as a ssh session this could almost double the amount of data transmitted during the session sending a single keystroke to the server would be 42-ish byte ip packet 20 for the ip header 20 for the tcp header and one or a few for the key which might get 40 bytes added by the vpn 36 for the headers of the udp packet it is wrapped in and a few bytes for some form of sequence number used to check for transmission errors requiring resending or reordering of packets bringing that 42 up to 82 even if there are no packet retransmissions needed

x86	64bit
some people have problems loading it but the problem seems to be that you have to have the microsoft visual c++ 2010 redistributable package x86 installed even if you have a 64bit operating system

359881
firefox	safari
the flash player now works with safari and firefox

359887
x86	64bit
the trick is that it installs it in both programfiles x86 folder and also in program files folder which is 64bit but the default short-cut link when you click on ie icon is pointing to 32-bit so we should change that to pint to program files folder that is 64bit

359893

well a kvm switch will allow you to easily move between pcs with one keyboard mouse monitor but i ve never heard of anything like that for ethernet

other than bootcamp i ll recommend to use vmware fusion which is a powerful virtualization software to run windows applications on mac side-by-side without rebooting

360895
disk	ram
if you have enough hardware resources cpu disk ram it s really nothing to worry about

360895
vmware	bootcamp	parallels	bootcamp
if you re debating on whether it s a good purchase or not you should approach it more functionally and see if the programs you need will run with windows via bootcamp or vmware parallels

360895
vmware	bootcamp
from my personal experience using windows on mac are just fine both in bootcamp and in vmware

360909
versioning	upgrade
because some organizations cannot upgrade to ie9 due to requirements of old web apps which do not support all modern standards it s typical for ie upgrade beyond the versioning included with the original release of the os not to be included on a windows disk

360909
disk	ram
i used imdisk to make a 16gb ram disk and it worked very well and sped up the operations by at least an order of magnitude

360909
folder	directory
at this point move the wim file out of the working directory or ramdisk and paste it back into the folder with the extracted contents of the iso

360909
ramdisk	umount
don t forget to re-enable your anti-virus software if you turned off realtime protection to speed up disk mounting and also umount the ramdisk if you used one so you can recover that memory for use by your system

this will all be part of a much more detailed su blog post on creating an integrated installer disk but i wanted to get each of the components out there in an easily understandable form

361199
mouse	keyboard
a great tool for controlling multiple machines from a single keyboard mouse

361201
disk	ram
first problem with it is that disk are so very slow when compared to ram that the cpu would practically spend all of its time waiting for the disk to finish keeping up with data

361201
disk	ram
the up side is that we re using almost no ram as all data from the disk can be transferred directly to the ram in video card

361201
disk	ram
next we have the unfortunately common and most obvious solution for the problem of slow disk access we ll just copy the whole file to ram and work the the ram copy

361201
disk	ram
when we re finished we ll somehow synchronize the ram version with the version on disk and solve the problem

361201
disk	ram
ram is compared to disk extremely fast and disk generally work better when larger amount of data needs to be transferred

361201
disk	ram
do note that in this answer i haven t discussed much about countless caches and abstraction layers that exist in modern computers between the disk ram and processor

361201
disk	ram
for example in a real world situation if you have one program which is doing heavy disk access and another that tries to save a small file that file may be stored somewhere in ram in a cache until the disk has enough free time to write it

361201
disk	ram
also when reading the os itself may load into ram more disk blocks than an application asked for because it correctly or not predicted that application may need them soon

361234
installation	upgrade
if done from windows vista an upgrade check would be performed and then rebooted and you are given the option to upgrade or do a clean installation

imagemagick	wand
this is despite the fact that magickwand.h is already in the system in usr include imagemagick wand magickwand.h

361437
imagemagick	wand
the key is in the configure output where it says checking for wand magickwand.h - clearly the imagemagick directory is not expected in usr include which means you need to either move the contents of that directory up a level or you need to install imagemagick itself differently

361438
gif	png
at a guess i d say it s probably because png has only really gained popularity as a free replacement for gif images and jpeg is far better for it s high compression and reasonable image quality when used with modern high-megapixel digital cameras

xfce	gnome
i want to completely remove installed gnome lxde and xfce but not to damage already installed applications

362012

how would one go about to wrap it into a vpn server pptp l2tp or openvpn if possible in order to have devices that do not support tunnel but support vpn like the ipad or dd-wrt routers be able to log in to the vpn which will then transparently funnel everything through the ssh tunnel

362563
ethernet	wireless
there under network adapters look for your wireless device...most likely it will not have ethernet in it that will be a seperate device

i can get it to work after i manually login with the keyboard and mouse that are connected to it and then adding synergy to the autostart.sh

362868

folder	directory	filesystems	ntfs
if the vhd image contains a ntfs filesystems windows requires administrator perms in order to create files but not folder in the filesystems root directory

363019
filesystems	ntfs
thus far i ve solved this by using vfat filesystems which don t do any perm checking but it would be very nice to have a few of the ntfs features like sparse files and per-file compression

363019
filesystems	ntfs
how can i goad windows server 2008 r2 into letting users create and write files in the top-level directory of a mounted ntfs filesystems

363096
folder	directory
it would be easier for me to do it by creating a .cmd script in every of such folder that would run burning application that would be smart enough not to clog some deeply nested directory in my user data folder on system partition with gigabytes of temporary data unnecessary consuming and heating my notebook disk to move the data between partitions

363099
kde	gnome
the first time you do it you may have to tell it to use gnome instead of kde

363100
folder	directory
i have a small set of files and folder in a directory on my computer that are causing issue

363185
ubuntu	mint
you re using mint 11 which is based on ubuntu 11.04

363185
ubuntu	mint
i d recommend going back to mint 9 which is based on ubuntu 10.04 the current lts

363602
filesystems	hfs+
i have an hfs+ filesystems image recovered from a failing mac harddrive and can loopback mount it on my linux machine

363604
put	get
if you chain the switches the switch closest to the router will get more traffic than if you put them parallel where it will all go through the router depending on your usage heavy internet accesses needed vs heavy access to own fileserver you can weigh one off to the other

363633
filesystems	btrfs
otherwise you would need access to the linux filesystems guess ext4 or btrfs which is not very well supported within windows

363642
xfs	btrfs	filesystems	xfs	filesystems	btrfs
btrfs zfs jfs and xfs are just a small subset of filesystems that can be used for a linux installation

363643
mouse	keyboard
xerox alto 1973 used mouse and keyboard for input and a monitor for output

when logged in i want them to be able to view the directory and go past the main folder directory

363675
tunnel	packets

363851
tunnel	vpn
i m using shrewsoft vpn client to access work vpn and i wanted to make sure that only work related traffic goes through the tunnel

363867

google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
i m on a mac and use mainly firefox 8 but the problem that i ll describe happens with google-chrome and safari as well

you can use the route command in your os to force it to route the traffic for your office over the vpn tunnel but everything else continues going through your standard internet connection

363888
traceroute	packets
i think but am far from sure that a traceroute would allow me to see till which point packets are going

i tried the google-chrome extension and am pretty sure that the firefox extension also works similar to it

364222
filesystems	btrfs
however i like btrfs and would like to convert the ext4 filesystems to btrfs but i was thinking about performance and maintainability

364222
mdadm	btrfs
for an example with btrfs i can t easily see the status when i remove add another disk to the array like i can with mdadm or perhaps i just do not know how - i searched through the btrfs docs and could not find this

364254
countif	sumifs
if openoffice doesn t support that try sumifs divided by countif

364301

364673

after some tinkering around it seems virtualbox allows you to create the virtual hard drive as vmdk files native format of vmware

365365
vmware	virtualbox
i brought this up on the virtualbox developer forums and it seems that the vmdk spec defined by vmware and used by everyone else including oracle virtualbox is hardcoded at 2gb chunks

365379
postgresql	mysql
it is possible to save gnucash database on mysql postgresql or sqlite so you can make any sql statement to collect data as you wish without loading gnucash

udp	tcp
i m reading about tcp and udp from a article

365642
udp	tcp
in the end what i understood is that udp is faster than tcp but it is unreliable

365648
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
it looks like something called ipartition worked to change a partition from case-sensitive to case-insensitive and i would assume it could do it the other way around as well as what you need to do is actually simpler

365662
temp	tmp
i also intend to redirect tmp and temp to this ssd disk

365662
ssd	sata
i did however put all temp directories and cache directories on the sata to prevent degrading the ssd disk as there are many frequent small read and writes

however this only is true for certain filesystems like fat

365931
queue	fifo
a disk scheduling algorithm in general orders this queue in an attempt to more efficiently handle the request such that the head has to move less the fifo aka fcfs algorithm is an exception to this as it just reads the queue.

debian mint is 32-bit version linux kernel is 2.6.39-2-468 xfce is version 4.8.0

366402
x86	64bit
if you have 32-bit version of notepad++ on a 64bit os then change the path to c program files x86 notepad++ notepad++.exe

366410
maven	pom.xml
note because you did not want to operate on the pom.xml file but instead wanted it to exist in a particular path name and then execute the maven command it did not make sense to code the script with the find command

366412
put	get
here s the question when i put the two together i get trouble

366418
google-chrome	firefox
noscript is exclusively for firefox however a version for google-chrome called notscripts is available

temp	tmp
however i noticed a large difference moving my ie temp files to a ramdisk and setting my temp and tmp enviromental variables to point to the ramdisk

366438
tunnel	vpn
so something like that you d probably have to have a vpn tunnel in place and network-share access to a remote server

366571
ati	nvidia
if it is grayed out the problem may be with the ati or nvidia installed drivers

366596
stdout	stderr
stderr lines normally get listed inbetween stdout lines inside less

366598

just tell the shell to redirect fd 2 to fd 1 stderr to stdout

366599
stdout	stderr
you have to redirect stderr to stdout

366602
ethernet	wireless
my desktop was connected via ethernet cable to the router and all the other clients in the house were accessing the network wireless

366602
ethernet	wireless
i tried configuring my linksys wireless-g router as a gateway but i don t think that works between wireless networks because there s no place to enter into the router the parameters of the wireless network that i want it to connect to and the only connection i can make between my desktop and the linksys wrt54g is an ethernet cable

366610
stdout	stderr
stderr lines normally get listed inbetween stdout lines inside less

366610
stdout	stderr
you re telling me how to redirect stderr to stdout but that s not what i wanted

366610
stdout	stderr
i don t want stderr to mix with stdout inside less

366612
stdout	stderr
if you want to mix the errors into stdout you can use which says essentially append stderr to stdout

366638
tunnel	vpn
see windows 7 vpn how to not tunnel internet

366707
versioning	upgrade
using the commands above is equivalent to using update manager and does not do upgrade of the system versioning - if you are on 10.10 it would stay so

366753
google-chrome	firefox
that said i have updated cmd + option + f to be cmd + k to match firefox and i think google-chrome

366851
binutils	glibc
is it possible to build glibc gcc binutils in the version combo of say 2.4 4.6 2.22 or some later version of gcc used by the oldest stablest linux distro s still around

366851
binutils	glibc
build new binutils gcc using this old glibc version

366966
vp8	ogg	vorbis	webm
note a browser that supports html5 webm vp8 and ogg vorbis is

366969
cpu	processors
assuming that the hardware fully turn off the cpu and cuts power to it would it not be better to disabled the cores entirely instead of relying on the various sleep states of a processors

367006
rss	feed
there are various sites that can create rss feed from webpages

367037
vmware	esx
i haven t had much experience with vmware but on vmware esx you need to tell esx to pass-through the device to a specific vm

i d simplify it as much as possible during initial install and create 2gbyte virtual ide hard disk an ide cd-rom 16mb of ram and nothing else

367059
parallels	bootcamp
importing the bootcamp partition into parallels desktop - which couldn t boot it up either and failed anyway

367092

367095
bonjour	avahi
i ended up using avahi mdns bonjour and just added .local

367117
ip-address	lan
it would have to resolve to your external ip-address anyway the same one as all the other computers on your lan - this is what network address translation nat in your router does

367124
vim	emacs
i love vim though i am sure it is possible in emacs too

367143
putty	winscp
the thing is i am in an environment where i am not allowed to use anything else than either putty or winscp

367153
cpu	processors
again while i agree it will save power even shutting off half of your cpu cores may halve the power consumption of the processors although in reality you may only save 30-40 since those cores still need to sit idle but this is far from the only component in the system using power

367163
width	height
is there a way to trim the margins get a new pdf file with smaller page size such that each page is just a pre-defined area of the original pages start at 1 cm from the top and from the left and take 15 cm width and 20 cm height

367178
logmein	hamachi
you can easily do this using logmein hamachi www.logmein.com

367191
opera	google-chrome
and to top it off this happened in both google-chrome and opera my two favorite browsers

367192
sudo	passwd
this first updates your sudo timestamp asking for a passwd if necessary which requires a tty ssh -t and then uses sudo to create a tarball remotely and extract it locally

367221
google-chrome	firefox
in addition to internet explorer i have tried other browsers like google-chrome mozilla firefox but the issue persists

367230
switching	screens
i tried a 3rd party tool cleartype switching but unchecking use cleartype while leaving enable smooth edges for screens fonts checked disables all forms of anti-aliasing

367276
mouse	keyboard
normally how this would work is the hub has one plug that goes to the computer then 4 ports that you can plug in other things to thumb drive keyboard mouse etc

367277
mouse	keyboard
what you want is a usb kvm switch - keyboard video mouse switch

367277

367323
mouse	trackpad
i have a gaming mouse that has custom dpi settings and i can make it so that moving the mouse about 6 inches across the mouse pad moves the cursor on-screen only about 100 pixels which is closer to what i want but i can t seem to find a way to do this with the trackpad

367326
jobs	cron
where does cron store the history of what jobs were run and when

367342
ubuntu	mint

when i have mixed content ssl and non-ssl on a https page i would rather have a broken page than an insecure page

367432
vmware	bootcamp	parallels	bootcamp
through vmware fusion or parallels it is quite slow and my disk is full so bootcamp is not a good solution for me at least until i clean the disk

367436
parallels	bootcamp
if you re running windows via bootcamp there is no os x running in parallels

367445
postgresql	mysql
currently to setup iis + sql server + vs seems not so simple as to setup apache + mysql postgresql + eclipse netbeans

367467
sudo	passwd
the sudo part answers the section part of your question but will obviously need to prompt for a passwd to escalate to root to do the install

367489
filesystems	ntfs
not so sure about sectors but ntfsresize from ntfs-3g lets you resize ntfs filesystems to kibibyte precision which usually corresponds to two sectors

367489
gentoo	linux
all or a subset of the above are available on most linux live disks i myself prefer the gentoo live disks available here

367490
disk	ram
does this mean if any machine with a 32-bit os be it windows or unix has more than 4gb total of ram + page file on hard disk for example 8gb ram and 20gb page file its memory will never be used up

367496
ati	nvidia
however the motherboard has an ati on board video card and the video card i selected is an nvidia stand alone card to be plugged into pcie 2.0

367496
ati	nvidia
will the nvidia stand alone card take priority over bypass the ati card

367497
ati	nvidia
this allows the use of completely different cards together - even ati and nvidia - in some sort of sli crossfire mode

367513
ubuntu	linux
another option would be to use some linux livecd - ubuntu knoppix etc

367525
disk	ram
does this mean any 32-bit os be it windows or unix if the machine has ram + page file on hard disk more than 4gb for example 8gb ram and 20gb page file there will never be memory used up

367540
rar	zip
i m looking for some tool that given a zip rar tar archive file mounts it as a new windows drive

google-chrome	firefox
haven t found these type of settings for google-chrome or firefox yet but i would suspect that firefox s about config would have similar settings

367651
ethernet	wireless
also hardwiring the computer downstairs would only give me moments of connectivity and then i d have to seesaw back and forth through the device manager with the wireless by switching off and on the ethernet and the wireless cards and this would only work once in a while

367661
wan	lan
your computer s nic will send traffic to a single gateway on the lan and that gateway s nat router will load balance the traffic out over both wan connections to the destination on the wan

367661
wan	lan
when the traffic comes back from the wan the router re-assembles the received packets and sends the packets to the source on the lan in a single coherent stream

367862
disk	ram
theres normal standby ram is powered hibernate sleep where the contents of ram are stored on the hdd and hybrid where the ram-content is keept and additionally written to disk to prevent data loss on power outage

367864
disk	ram
standby is suspend-to-ram str hibernate saves the ram contents to disk

367882
mouse	keyboard
i would like to give him his own mouse and keyboard

367882
mouse	keyboard
this isn t really what i want but would it be possible to run one x-server on each monitor and give each it s own keyboard mouse

367898
google-chrome	firefox
quick kludge for firefox prolly something similar for google-chrome reloadevery plugin

367916
mtu	icmp
also your mtu could be configured incorrectly on your desktop which becomes problematic if your router isp filters out icmp packets necessary for the automatic mtu discovery

367930
google-chrome	firefox
maybe with a firefox google-chrome extension

367935
ubuntu	linux
please do not refer me to linux ubuntu bootable installers from usb i am not asking to boot linux

folder	directory
2 i also tried two other file operations from ubuntu directly into the win partition generating a pdf-file from openoffice and creating a directory folder on the win desktop

368292
filesystems	ntfs
in addition to paths filesystems objects can have other identifiers such as the inode number on unix filesystemes or object id on windows ntfs which can often be used to find all paths to a file with known id

368335
google-chrome	firefox
and here you can configure google-chrome to use alternative memory models with various tradeoffs including firefox style single process mode

368391
google-chrome	firefox
well i don t know about windows specific bu google-chrome and firefox have some email checking add-ons that you can set the checking interval

368437

368613
stdout	stderr
the redirects stderr to stdout so you can manipulate it

368621
disk	ram
that said there s very few scenarios where ht slows things down on a modern cpu but moving from 4 to 8 processes might add enough i o that other areas of the system turn into a bottleneck disk network ram bandwidth etc.

368623
folder	directory

368654
vim	notepad++
i ve got the 2 editors that i like vim and notepad++ and stick with those

368673
disk	ram
this just means linux is using your free ram to avoid hitting your hard disk and such so it can run faster

368682
ubuntu	mint
mint is ubuntu s clone you might use the following page for info

368682
ubuntu	linux
by the way they re both linux not ubuntu and linux as you wrote

368715
debian	linux
the linux distribution installers don t help either the only one that cares about writing random stuff to the disk before encrypting is debian

368730
mouse	keyboard
is there a way for me to connect a mac to my current setup and easily switch between the two while only using 1 keyboard 1 mouse

368733
mouse	keyboard
you will need a usb dvi kvm that will allow you to switch monitor and mouse keyboard between the mac and a pc

368735
mouse	keyboard
is there a way for me to connect a mac to my current setup and easily switch between the two while only using 1 keyboard 1 mouse

368735
mouse	keyboard
it allows you to share you keyboard and mouse across computers without a physical kvm switch

368735
mouse	keyboard
in the scenario you can have you keyboard and mouse attached to your pc and then share them with the mac mini using synergy

368758
google-chrome	firefox
still using firefox because can t find image toolbar add-ons for google-chrome chromium

368787
mouse	keyboard
i often found myself dragging resizing and rearranging windows by hand with the mouse and i found this very disturbing for my workflow where i try to avoid the mouse if i can and do most things with keyboard commands quicksilver etc.

368837
google-chrome	firefox
i m using google-chrome but if anything like that can be done in firefox just tell me

368851

368867
google-chrome	firefox

368879
button	checkbox
you can also use it to click multiple checkbox button and javascript links with a single action

368906
gentoo	linux
a quick and dirty solution to this might be to install a very slim linux distro gentoo for example and install virtual box create some virtual machines and install your oses and have the linux distro load the virtual machines in full screen mode at boot

368923
versioning	upgrade
all you need to do is updating your installed versioning of camera raw through adobe updater which you will find sitting in your systray already prompting you to upgrade or in your programs

368955
ethernet	wireless
everything works as expected except when sharing files between client-a and server it sometimes uses the ethernet connection as intended and sometimes the wireless connection not intended very slow

368961
ethernet	wireless
or you could just bridge the ethernet and wireless network cards on the 2008 server and use a single network without routing

368996
mouse	keyboard
if it doesn t seen any mouse keyboard activity in 5 minutes it can assume i m no longer at the computer

369000
google-chrome	firefox
plays just fine in google-chrome and firefox

369093
public	protected
i searched for ways to make a subfolder of a protected directory public and all i could find was to use the satisfy any directive but this doesn t work for me

369109
mouse	keyboard
unlike a lot of the other changes from xp to vista 7 i donâ t really mind about this one because to use it means reaching over to push it then back to the mouse keyboard to choose what to do

369109
mouse	keyboard
in that case you may as well use the mouse keyboard to choose what to do in the first place and forgo the power button altogether

369110
switching	screens
option 3 many launchers and macro utilities also include a command for logging out to the fast user switching screens

369157

vmware	bootcamp	parallels	bootcamp
i ve tried xp sp3 x86 and windows 7 x64 with bootcamp parallels and vmware fusion

369214
vmware	virtualbox
i am also a virtual machines fanatic and i use vmware workstation for my needs but i have also used virtualbox as well

369236
hex	binary
since there s an easy mapping of binary data to hex and vice versa 4 binary digits to from one hexadecimal digit and binary contains very little information per digit hexadecimal is generally the preferred way for humans to read binary unless there are specific reasons to prefer a different representation

369236
hex	binary
some text editors might have a hex editor mode and some heuristic that tried to determine whether a file is text or binary and automatically select one mode or the other

369265
hash	md5
i rather would suspect a bug in tcs compare by content feature and double-check using local checksum generation for the files on both sides using something like md5 or sha-1 hash and comparing the checksums visually

369342
tunnel	vpn
software like hamachi from www.logmein.com is a great example of zero config vpn tunnel

369363
mouse	keyboard
i have ctrl+shift+p bound to paste from the selection buffer in urxvt which generally means i can do everything without moving my hands from the keyboard vim is x buffer aware and i have a tmux hook to place copied text into that buffer however when i go to firefox et al i have to move my hand to the mouse to middle click

369372
vmware	virtualbox
also i like having a backup to my backup so this software will give the option of trying 4 different vm with either vmware or virtualbox

369374
temp	tmp
you will need this for storing your temp and tmp folders but there are workarounds

369374
temp	tmp
change the location of temp or tmp folders

369374
temp	tmp
in here you will find your temp and tmp variables are pointing at the z drive

369374
temp	tmp
you will find your temp and tmp will have been relocated to the c drive and you will have no problems

369418
udp	tcp
does tcp udp protocol always send or receive file packets sequentially

369420
udp	tcp
neither tcp nor udp can guarantee packets arrive at their destination in sequence because they both use ip packets and ip doesn t do any sequencing

369455
width	height
i doubt the pci specifications provide definitions of common english language words like length breadth width depth or height

369457
google-chrome	firefox
shockwave plugin one time failed on all three browsers ie9 google-chrome and firefox couldn t watch youtube i had to restart.

369473
ubuntu	debian

369590
folder	dir
if you re working with files or folder other than on c make sure you add a line to change to that drive before attempting to make a folder or change dir into one

369594
traceroute	packets
why is a ping packets s data length 32 while a traceroute packets s data length is 64 bytes

369605
pop-up	dialog
one thing i know for sure is that if i dismiss the below dialog that pop-up when it happens then the whole system hangs completely but if i leave the dialog alone i can continue to work and use the os as normal however upon shutting down at which time the dialog is inevitably closed the system hangs resulting in a needed reset

369610
traceroute	packets
both ping and traceroute have options to modify packets size

369610
traceroute	packets
tracerote s option modifies the total size running traceroute www.google.com 80 will send udp packets with the total size of 80 bytes 20 bytes ip header + 8 bytes udp + 52 bytes data

369610
traceroute	packets
if your ping s default is 32 then the total size of a packets is 60 bytes not much different from your traceroute s

369610
traceroute	packets
the most common reason to increase both ping s and traceroute s packets size is to debug mtu problems other then that the defaults work just fine

369613
daemons	systemd
if by startup you mean rebooting the pc there s an option in the daemons tools lite settings menu named automount that will mount the latest used iso files at systemd start so disabling this would help

369640
tunnel	vpn
an ultimate solution would be virtual private networks vpn or ssl tunnel of all the network communications to a trusted private network so you have less to worry about

369643
arp	icmp
then run arp -a you should see all the address that are responding to icmp requests on that subnet

i already restarted my computer this time but what i ll try next time is to restart all the running network services and check what happens if i change between lan wan on the fly

369802

vmware	bootcamp
i then used vmware fusion to load bootcamp as a vm as well as the other vm having both vms running made the computer incredibly slow but my 6gb of ram certainly helped - your results may vary and i initiated a windows easy transfer between them over a network because they re on the same virtual network the files simply transfer on the hard drive and not over a network - it s very fast

ethernet	wireless
i already had a wireless router but the reason i bought this linksys router was to give my old pc which had no network card access to the network so the router was to act as a bridge between the existing wireless router and the old pc the old pc does have a nic with ethernet port

371503

anyway i needed to set the router up in wireless ethernet bridge mode and set the ssid and security settings to match those of the existing router which i have done

don t forget that ubuntu gentoo and even joli os are all designed to have one iso build run on as many hardware variants as possible but chrome os is designed to only run on a very specific hardware profile

as right now you need to use a ethernet cable in-between the two routers with wireless bridging you could set up the two to relay over a wi-fi link and thus no need to use a cable

371763

however if you got it working fine now and the ethernet cable running between the two is not causing you any hassles then you won t really see any benefit with using wireless bridge mode over what you are currently doing

i tried the usb keyboard ps 2 mouse combo in ubuntu and it works there - so it is a windows-only problem

i m positive this has something to do with the permissions in that folder because i can change the virtualhost directory to a page i ve created at the command line with sudo and it works fine

372367

i would also suggest you uninstall the ps 2 mouse driver in device manager with the keyboard and restart the computer to reinstall it to check the result

when we want to get data from a floppy or older hdd we send the cylinder number head number and sector number to the drive controller and it moves the head to appropriate location

372863

instead of having programmer calculate address of data on the disk using chs we ll just assign a number to each block just like each byte has its number in ram and access the data using that

filesystems	ntfs
the ntfs junction point is implemented using ntfs reparse points which are ntfs filesystems objects introduced with windows 2000

373224
filesystems	ntfs
an ntfs reparse point is a type of ntfs filesystems object

373224
filesystems	ntfs
reparse points provide a way to extend the ntfs filesystems by adding extra information to the directory entry so a filesystems filter can interpret how the operating system will treat the data

373224
filesystems	ntfs
yes when windows vista came around they decided to extend the functionality of the ntfs filesystems object s by providing the ntfs symbolic link which is a soft link that acts in the same way as the ntfs junction point

373224
filesystems	ntfs
hard links are not ntfs filesystems objects but they are instead a link to a file in detail they refer to the mft entry as that stores extra information about the actual file

ethernet	wireless
it was originally designed and deployed for wired ethernet networks and was later adopted by the ieee 802.11 wireless lan working group as part of the 802.11i security addendum to 802.11 to serve as a per-user or per-device authentication method for 802.11 networks

also there may be error conditions that stop wget even seeing the output of the script perhaps for some reason it can t even see the web server for some reason occasionally quite possible if the server it is calling is remote in which case there will be nothing for it to output to the file specified by -o so as well as logging the script outout log wget s stdout and stderr as suggested by stephen s answer

i ve got full access to folder options so if someone post the data to put in there i can do the rest

378298
spaces	delimiter
is it possible to specify the number of arguments that xargs takes without doing it explicitly with -n option but implicitly with a delimiter so that the single parameters would be delimiter with a spaces but a group of arguments that xargs takes at once would be delimiter with for example n

378493
vmware	virtualbox
each virtualization package does raw disks slightly differently but vmware workstation vmware fusion and virtualbox all support it without too much effort

378493

one of things that i hate in firefox when i press tab on some web-page firefox moves cursor between links and input fields but i d like it to move just between input fields like opera does

378875

378918
vmware	virtualbox
oracle has one called virtualbox or just do a google search for vmware

378945

378997
filesystems	fat
you could have remembered windows os which used fat fat16 fat32 filesystems

378997
filesystems	ntfs
in contrast newer ntfs filesystems received journal support of its infrastructure which means on the low level of os and hardware access layer information would be kept in a stable safe condition by recording of any actions to be commited

379000
disk	ram
in that case the operating system calls for all processes to halt execution saves the contents of the ram to disk since the os is also responsible for managing the memory allocation and safely shuts down or restarts the computer

with the new setup we ll look to output 720p either as mpeg-4 part 2 or part 10 h.264 in suitable containers like avi mov mkv mp4

379436
width	height
to apply this for your situation set range to the first cell of data use an absolute reference see below in the formulas rows to the offset columns to 0 since we don t want to shift the column and finally set height and width to 1 since we are returning a single cell

379447
thin	webrick
if you prefer thin you need to start server with thin start or webrick will be started

vmware	virtualbox
amongst your type-2 hypervisors vmware workstation and oracle s virtualbox will both accelerate guest direct3d and opengl with varying levels of success

379539
udp	tcp	udp	rtp
does that mean that they will tolerate packet loss when sent over an unreliable transport protocol like udp without any additional layers like rtp and enable the clients to resynchronize or do they still require a reliable transport protocol like tcp

379572
put	get
the simplest solution would be to get a switch and put it in your av room then be done with it

379596
width	height
the third is to have a software that makes my two displays be detected as a large display and then captures the output of the video card splits the images and renders them as 2d images to both monitors or a simpler one but that would make outputted pixels double the width or height would be to capture the output of the graphics card to one screen split it in two and enlarge it to fit both monitors and then output it to the monitors

379616

folder	directory
a much easier way to empty an entire folder also avoiding the too many arguments issues discussed in this answer is to simply delete and recreate the directory itself

379796
switching	screens
if i switching the keyboard layout to a correct one eg canadian english and open keyboard viewer the correct layout is displayed until i press any key then the layout shown on the screens changes to a different us english i think although the heading at the top of the on screens keyboard still says canadian english

380013
rtp	rtsp	udp	rtp
i think the most popular method of streaming video via udp is rtsp rtp

380013
rtp	rtsp
gstreamer should support this and there are probably also some dedicated rtsp rtp servers available for linux

i ve re-installed my linux ubuntu xubuntu several times

380038
macbook	bootcamp
i m using a macbook with bootcamp

filesystems	ntfs
ads spy is a tool used to list view or delete alternate data streams ads on windows 2000 xp with ntfs filesystems

380103
disk	ram
all the ones i know of are disk- memory moving important files to ram rather than moving to a local disk from a slower wan link or slower local disk

380145
jobs	cron
how do i disable cron jobs for a specific user

380154
tunnel	vpn
use putty to ssh into your nas and use tunnel - its like vpn but slighlty faster and does not requiere any other ports opening except ssh

380215
debian	linux
i have a debian linux installed with lm_sensors package and running command sensors show eight different values without any description temp1 through temp6

380296
mp4	h.264
as far as support goes mp4 h.264 is a highly supported usually mobile format

380296
mp4	h.264
maybe they ll come out with a newer better compression method and mp4 h.264 becomes obsolete

380331
ubuntu	linux
i can not give you a more specific answer since i m not using ubuntu but arch linux

380358
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
it looks like you can restore from time machine to a case-insensitive file system from a case-sensitive one

380358
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
carbon copy cloner does support restoring to a case-insensitive system from a case-sensitive one - see this

380369
mouse	keyboard
note that my mac keyboard didn t work on my windows 7 machine with synergy 1.3.8 though the mouse did

380374
mouse	keyboard
or a way for there to be no screen saver but instead of locking it disables the mouse and most of the keyboard until i hit an unlock key

move	drag
then move the taskbar to the top of the screen and drag it up so it hides away ontop

380393
disk	ram
that is treat the disk blocks where a certain file resides as swapped-to-disk vm pages so the app can easily get arbitrary blocks of the file loaded into ram quickly just by reading those addresses in memory

380394
move	drag
i m used to move the windows in the task manager by drag and drop

380402
cyberduck	winscp
well in this case the classic file copy backup option using a scp client such as winscp or cyberduck might be a good idea - you would start with a installed system with a vps anyway so simply copying over files such as the contents of your home var and etc directories would be a good enough backup method

380404
docx	xlsx
upload the troublesome files xlsx docx etc

380445
filesystems	ntfs
that should hopefully also apply to non-system drives providing that the filesystems is ntfs and you re using truecrypt 6.1 or later and windows vista or windows 7

380462
16-bit	64bit
note that 64bit windows does not support running 16-bit windows-based applications

380462
16-bit	64bit
so 16-bit programs cannot run on 64bit windows

380484
trojan	virus
i get a feeling as if some device is using too much bandwidth maybe has a virus trojan

380486
folder	directory
so now i have my server correctly allowing me to setup directory outside of my wamp www folder and it is allowing me access to the sites via my url www.acyrid.com only within my network

380577
ati	nvidia
most ati nvidia cards will only support a total of 2 monitors across vga dvi and hdmi

380599
disk	ram
the fact that you are able to reinstall the os without any catastrophic failures clicking failure to boot unrecognizable disk along with the fact that data becomes corrupt during memory intensive processes and the fact that your windows installation was only using a portion of your available ram makes me suspect the controller or slot

380620
redhat	fedora
according to this article configuring the system for the second monitor on redhat enterprise linux 4 and fedora core 4 you can enable both monitors to use an extended desktop by

380622

380757
mp4	h.264
two-pass example h.264 video aac audio in mp4

380765
cpu	processors
the processors can change clock speed many times a second depending on cpu load and so you may find that repeatedly checking the speed on one or both of the method you used will give different readings at different times

380823
mouse	keyboard
everything works fine on the server if i log directly into it with mouse and keyboard

380834
mouse	keyboard
i found somwhere on the internet that disabling allow this device to wake up computer checkbox for keyboard and mouse may help but not in my case -

380852
vpn	wlan
the remote worker is connected to his soho-network via wlan his normal ip-settings while not in vpn looks like the following

380852
tunnel	vpn
as you can see the cisco vpn client adds a default-route that has a low metrik and sends all traffic into the tunnel

380880
ethernet	wireless	wan	lan
if the router has both wan and lan ethernet ports you can usually disable dhcp in the router and change the configuration to move the wireless router s network configuration to some unused ip range then plug your network into the lan side of the router and nothing into the wan side to make a poor man s access point

380880
ethernet	wireless
wireless clients will connect to the wireless router and receive an address from your main dhcp server along with the main gateway dns servers etc then communicate with the rest of the network without using the router part of the wireless router as if they had been plugged in to a switch or hub on the network which is what the lan ethernet ports are

380888
disk	ram
i think the cpu can work but 2gb ram and 80gb hard disk is just very low

380893
hide	show
i found some people who use the terminal to hide files by putting a dot before the filename so it doesn t show up in the normal user interface

380924
vmware	virtualbox	virtualbox	parallels
check and then you can try free hardware visualization capable software like virtualbox parallels desktop or vmware fusion

380939
hash	md5
thus in more professional encryption software you ll often be given a choice on both the encryption algorithm aes rc4 etc. and the hash algorithm md5 sha etc.

380957
gif	png	gif	bmp	bmp	png
this assumes that the image is in a format that ppt can insert bmp gif png jpg etc

380966
disk	ram
it used to be when ram was much smaller that there could be enough time with large capacitors in the power supply or even oddly using the energy stored in the disk drive rotor to generate electricity to write ram to disk before power dropped but that possibility pretty much vanished when ram grew larger than 100m or so

380966
disk	ram
but it s also possible to use a hibernate strategy where ram is written to disk as a single block and then the system powered off

381003
daemons	systemd
i don t know how rdiff is different from a rsync but i know that rsync only needs either 1 an rsync daemons listening on the remote systemd tcp 873 by default or 2 an ssh daemons listening on the remote systemd tcp 22 by default

381008
put	get
now the messed up part about all of this is that i am on my computer right now....if i take the battery out and put it back in and setup the bios again manually i am able to get into my computer...but this is not normal.

381012
macports	homebrew
i m a big fan of macports homebrew apt-get and even portableapps.com

381016
debian	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	linux
most of the projects hosted on such sites are aimed at linux where a distribution has one package management system such as apt on debian ubuntu pacman on arch

381016
macports	homebrew
for example what happens when you try to install a program from macports but it has already been installed from homebrew

381016
macports	homebrew
finally even mac os x has macports and homebrew however all of them are similar in that they are specific to the operating system but never to a website

381020
google-chrome	safari

381057
ffmpeg	handbrake
it s built into many applications but most prominently ffmpeg with the libx264 codec or handbrake

381062
udp	tcp
at least not at the level that the port usually indicates you know what sort of higher level ip protocol is being sent eg tcp udp but not what the content of that is eg http smtp

381062
ssl	https
occasionally you get nice behaviour for incorrect clients like the plain text http errors that some https servers will give when you don t use ssl to the port

381062
unix	bsd
on the server side when you listen only one process can accept new connections on a port in unix bsd sockets but it can pass the established connection to other processes to service

381081

opera	google-chrome
in opera i can choose to hide bookmarks and bookmark folders from the bookmark bar is this also possible with google-chrome or chromium

381228
udp	tcp	spoofing	traffic
the spoofing would only need to hold up to cursory inspection such as direct tcp or udp traffic not necessarily packet inspection between my computer and one not on the network

versioning	upgrade
there s also vmware player which is free and an upgrade versioning that isn t

381347
vmware	virtualbox
while you can use virtualbox vmware or some other virtualization product the best option from a cost perspective is almost certainly to use xp mode which is a pre-built xp virtual machine provided by microsoft

381353
udp	tcp
your home cable dsl modem may be crippled by your provider to only allow tcp udp incoming port forwarding and not have the option to forward the gre protocol

381353
tunnel	vpn
in this case only ssh based tunnel will work and this is not supported by the built-in vpn facility on any of your devices

381353
tunnel	vpn
however there are solutions such as issh on the ipad iphone or tunnelier putty related on a windows laptop that will do vpn style tunnel for you

381376
mouse	keyboard
i got answer and disabled it but disabling my keyboard disabled my laptop mouse touchpad also

381402
put	get
the process to get those blocks usually means taking the chips off the ssd copying each chip with a special device and then it all needs to be put together using reverse technology and it is not always possible to re-assemble the puzzle because of the way that ssd shuffles areas around to reduce read write stress

381427
filesystems	ntfs
is there a way to provoke a corrupt ntfs filesystems

381438
mouse	keyboard
when i run long simulations perhaps for days i would like to prevent any interference by locking the keyboard and possibly the mouse

381438
mouse	keyboard
lock keyboard - ignore input leave mouse working

381438
mouse	keyboard
can something like the old ctrl + alt + del exist that will still allow an application a heavy simulation to run while disabling input from keyboard and mouse

381446
filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	fat
the only thing you will not be able to do from here is mount these disks as they are because about the only filesystems windows understands natively are fat ntfs and the various optical formats

381458
folder	directory
is it possible to create snap shots of certain directory daily which are saved on the same server but in a different folder

381477
filesystems	ntfs
the type code for ntfs is 7 for example. changing the type code has no effect on the contents of the partition but windows will ignore a partition whose type code doesn t indicate one of the filesystems that windows supports

381477
filesystems	ntfs
it ll still contain the same ntfs filesystems â even if you change the type code to the one for ext3 for example you re not actually changing the data to ext3 you re just making the partition table lie about what the data is

381501
tunnel	vpn
and outgoing traffic on your router except for vpn tunnel

381531
ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	linux
i encrypted my external hard drive using linux mint ubuntu and password protected it

381531
ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	linux
note i m not sure exactly which algorithm was used to encrypt the drive but it was the standard option in linux mint ubuntu and it sounded universal but apparently not

381537
ubuntu	mint
i am pretty sure that ubuntu mint uses dm-crypt with luks and aes-algorithm as standard for home encryption as most modern cpus support aes natively and thus it is very fast faster than read write of the harddrive

381555
tunnel	vpn
this will make sure all your outgoing traffic except the ones to your local network and the vpn server goes through the tunnel

381558
mouse	keyboard
i have vnc working now but the remote screen displays and allows input from the mouse and keyboard

381560

versioning	upgrade
actually you only have to upgrade your fdm versioning

381701
mouse	trackpad
this affects mouse and trackpad alike if have have both

381736
folder	directory
i d recommend running it with the copy products into selected directory option saving it to some location you can access on the computers in question i ve done it off a shared folder before - in which case don t use the automatic install and recall option and running it

381782
google-chrome	safari

381811
calloc	malloc
is there alternative allocator that can be ld_preloaded into a process overrides malloc calloc etc

382037
ubuntu	linux
recently i have made several bootable usb drives with a variety of linux distributions ranging from ubuntu to backtrack using the unetbootin installer

382052
mouse	keyboard
when done i ll be able to replace vnc by using ffmpeg streaming with x2x or synergy for forwarding keyboard and mouse events

use the router s ip address as visible on the wan lan ppumkin outside of the setup

382180
debugdiag	debugging
use debugging diagnostic tool debugdiag 1.2

382224
int	chars
for example if you take a random 32-bit int lets say 1 342 749 as binary this would be 00000000 00010100 01111101 00011101 which as hexidecimal would be 0x00147d1d now if we try to read this as chars using the ascii chars set we would get

382250
titlebar	window
the popup window will gray out during processing and progress will be displayed in the titlebar

i setup the wireless router s wan port to get an address from isp which should be coming from my wired router running dhcp and the lan as a subnet 192.168.1

382310
wan	lan
make sure the wan port on the 2nd router is connected to the lan port on the 1st router

382311
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
what i usually do is edit the html css files in vim from the command line and then preview them in safari and intermittently in firefox an google-chrome to see if that also works

382316
debian	linux
the above experiments were done on a debian gnu linux 9.0 stretch system

382326
vim	emacs
to repeat my answer from there i prefer as the tmux screen key because it doesn t get in the way of normal bindings in either vim or emacs

382327
tunnel	vpn
i am look for a vpn tunnel that is free and that i can just configure into my system preferences mac os x lion

382344
mouse	trackpad
this seems to not re-reverse external mouse events and in this particular case i will only be using the trackpad when i m using the laptop as a laptop

382346
folder	directory
the for command still only looks at each file in the folder i know including the sub directory i don t know

382360
google-chrome	firefox
or maybe you could use a firefox google-chrome extension

382371
firefox	safari
for some reason even though i only have an ipv4 address on the network firefox and safari are trying to connect to the ipv6 addresses which of course fails

382407

google-chrome	firefox
i love using firefox s and google-chrome s custom keyword searches

382633

i have a running process running in a bash terminal that is printing some prompt and i would like to send it to the background with the stderr stdout prompt that is printing either redirected to dev null or somewhere else so that i can keep using that terminal for something else but not have to kill the process and restart it

382653
bmp	png
depending on the software you use to create it png images are compressed by filtering and using the deflate algorithm which means that their file size will probably be smaller than the original bmp

382703
mouse	keyboard
my question is assuming the switch looks the same to the computer as plugging and un-unplugging my mouse and keyboard every few minutes when i make the switch is that using up a large amount of memory and combined with the running excel macro causing the crashes

382708
mouse	keyboard
when you say you are un-plugging the mouse and keyboard are you just switching input output from desktop pc to laptop of vice versa

382708
mouse	keyboard
the kvm should allow easy swictchin of one keyboard mouse and monitor between two or more computers without issue

382709
mouse	keyboard
plugging and unplugging a keyboard mouse and monitor shouldn t cause any significant memory usage

382709
mouse	keyboard
if you re using ps 2 connections for the keyboard and mouse the os probably doesn t even notice

382714
debian	linux
there is computer with debian but no internet connection at one place and computer with windows 7 arch linux at other place my home with internet connection

382729
mouse	keyboard
possible but given the cost of a keyboard and mouse it would be a bit easier if you had them

382729
mouse	keyboard
once set up the keyboard and mouse are not needed if you use a remote tool like rdp or the drac

382734
mouse	keyboard
the normal practice is to connect them to a mouse keyboard and monitor possibly via kvm while the initial setup and installation is performed and then remove those items when the server is put into production

382734
mouse	keyboard
this is a device that connects to your server and presents a keyboard mouse and display to it but rather than connecting to a real keyboard mouse and display set s up a service that you can connect to over the network to control the server

382734
mouse	keyboard
unfortunately the price is likely higher than just buying a display keyboard and mouse

382735
debian	linux
you should update a debian system or any other linux unix system as soon as new security related updates are released

382751
ubuntu	linux
i am using a spare linux ubuntu 10.04 box os is non-negotiable to playback videos while riding on a bike trainer

mouse	trackpad
how do i disable my mouse trackpad on a lenovo notebook running windows 7

382778
mouse	trackpad
the trackpad will either appear as something relevant to trackpads like ibm trackpad or a generic mouse

382804
ethernet	wireless
for your particular situation it d likely be best to install a wireless airport express and enable the ethernet port to distribute in bridge mode

382809
skype	hangout
if i m listening to stereo audio and then decide to jump into a skype call google hangout or goto meeting bluetooth often crashes and i can only get things working again by shutting down the device disabling bluetooth and getting things back up and running again

382815
daemons	launchd
for example when i launchd two mysqld processes and the second one does not work port etc.. i cannot figure out which daemons has which pid

382833

382853
versioning	upgrade
will there ever be a newer kernel than the distro versioning and if so should you upgrade

382855
mouse	keyboard
but to be honest it ll be a lot easier to just use a mouse and keyboard

382856
opera	firefox
firefox won t even load the page and opera using its inbuilt ftp manager says authentication failure and asks for both username and password

382879

ubuntu	linux
i got apache installed on my linux ubuntu and i need to upload some big files and i want to make it available to download only when the transfer done

382914

is gitweb the only thing i need to pull and push changes with this setup

382914
gitolite	gitosis
if not enough do i need gitolite or gitosis to push changes

382936
feedback	review
you don t have to worry about counterfeits if you pay attention to their feedback scores and review nobody is going to blow a 10 000 rep for 50 and make sure to open a dispute in time if it does turn out to be counterfeit to get your money back

382946
installation	upgrade
the problem has persisted across multiple clean installation not upgrade of leopard snow leopard and lion

382951
ethernet	wireless
you ll need a wireless router that supports the firmware and you can connect the pcs on one side of the room to the ethernet ports on the router running in client mode so you only need one device and you can use conventional ethernet to connect those systems rather than have multiple wireless adaptors have the ap and other computers on the other side

382952
vmware	esx
afaik only vmware esx has support for this feature but this is an enterprise product and would not be useful at all on your desktop

382953
youtube	vimeo
improved encoding presets for youtube vimeo and other popular output formats

382963
pull	push
you don t need it to pull push

382963
pull	push	gitolite	gitosis
gitolite please no gitosis it is obsolete is an authorization mechanism also not needed to push pull unless you want to restrict access to a group of users

382967
ethernet	wireless
hd video takes a lot of network bandwidth how do you have your pc connected to the storage is it through ethernet cable if so does it go straight to the storage or does it go through a switch if it is wireless can we have some details on the wireless points routers

382967
ethernet	wireless	put	get
the best way to debug this problem if it is connected via ethernet cable is to get a 1 metre cable and hook it straight up to your pc and put your storage device next to your pc if it stops skipping you know its either a too long cable faulty cable faulty network switch router if it connected via wireless try hooking it up via ethernet cable

383025
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome still require the dns setup to server the .pac file for proxy configuration

383027
folder	directory
i keep creating new folder in a directory and adding pictures to them

383030
filesystems	ntfs
the filesystems should be fat32 or ntfs and for older xps the partitions should be max 128 gb

383055
mouse	keyboard
if you disable on chip the keyboard and mouse are forced to enabled according to manual this would seem to imply the enabled setting allows access to other usb devices outside of windows like boot from usb

383061
wan	lan
â router provided by my isp lan wan

383075
vmware	virtualbox
vmware virtualbox or qemu will allow easy network access

383087
versioning	upgrade
sometimes the distribution chooses not to upgrade to the latest versioning of some software mostly for security reasons so it might be possible that you cant install from the normal repositories

383104
move	drag
while this works to some extent i also found another workaround set the first text box of your section to the desired language and when you want to create another section type out the first few letters in your text box that s already in the desired language and then use the drag drop handle to move it to where your new text box should be

383114
ubuntu	linux
well for maximum performance and lightest host you probably want ubuntu its one of the many linux distros just install this instead of the os you have now

383138
udp	tcp
for example if you right-click some tcp send or udp receive events you can select to hide those be aware that the column under which you perform the right-click has an effect on the contents of your context menu

383149
filesystems	ntfs
chkdsk checks the ntfs filesystems for corruption which is exatly what you want

383204
folder	directory
when i installed matlab it created a directory in the documents folder for all of my files that i created

383234

however the dialog that pop-up asking me if i want to make it genuine seems to crash or give a fatal error 0xd000006

383274

i m thinking i should probably shift to one strategy or another so i don t get confused and use a single approach uniformly for all uses including documents and also the big sync jobs like iphoto and itunes

383490
macports	homebrew
i now want to try homebrew but it s clear from what i ve read here and elsewhere that the default installations of homebrew and macports cannot easily coexist

383490
macports	homebrew
so my question is this has anyone come up with an alternate way to install homebrew which can coexist with macports

383498
ethernet	wireless
after the upgrade i couldn t connect to the internet and found out that i have no adapters wireless or ethernet

383498
ethernet	wireless
i ve been looking under the networking wwan networking wireless lan and wireless according tabs for the correct wireless driver and networking ethernet for the correct ethernet driver.is there a way that i can lookup the hardware components that i have to narrow down what drivers i need to install

383508
sudo	passwd	pop-up	dialog
another thing i often resort to is sudo -i to a root shell from the terminal to run software-center or other common gui apps like gparted that otherwise just love to pop-up modal passwd dialog

383522
ati	nvidia
look into your display driver settings ati catalyst control center intel display settings nvidia forceware etc there has to be an option to change the display rotation

383530
division	modulo
the most significant in mathematical terms is that their modulo division by 512 is 0

383545

you can assemble a raid-5 6 of slow sata drives in the background using the ssd as a dynamic cache of frequently accessed data

383554
opera	firefox
it is not browser specific the same code shows on all browsers firefox ie opera

383568
trojan	virus
it s possible however for a virus trojan to be impersonating this service so if you are suspecting of something like this doing a virus spyware scan is advised

383573
opensuse	linux
when i want to run xen on linux i install opensuse select the kernel with xen support install the xen package and then i manage xen through the usual opensuse sysadmin gui

383573
opensuse	linux
in my opinion you should get to understand xen first using something like opensuse before you attempt to patch it into another distro of linux

383613

383625
ssid	wlan
i ve reached this conclusion after switching to a totally different router zyxel where i re-entered exactly the same wlan config as in the fonera - same ssid and wpa2-psk though with a different channel - most of my devices accepted this switch without complaining

383679
mouse	trackpad
if no mouse is connected bluetooth is turned off and yet the pointer is moving then it has to be some problem with the trackpad

383690
next	except
i can t think of any way to test this except to wait for the next brownout

383713
mouse	keyboard
everything is fine until i get to the screen to type in my username and then the the mouse and keyboard go away

383713
mouse	keyboard
now the mouse still works direct io required but the keyboard will not capture

383744
disk	ram
most operating systems will not immediately write data to disk but buffer or cache it in ram and wait to actually write it

383767

i have found out that if i have chromium open it detects the edge of the screens and lets me switching

383769
udp	tcp
tcp and udp use the notion of ports and sockets

383769
udp	tcp
not everything going out of a network interface needs to be tcp or udp

383770
udp	tcp
the physical or link layer does not know anything about tcp udp ports nor about ip addresses ndash

383770
udp	tcp
in this case packets received by your computer may bave different tcp or udp port numbers than those originally sent.

383775
folder	directory
combined together means the source directory s attributes and timestamps will be mirrored to the created folder

note that the installation instructions provided at gnome-look.org are not appropriate for ubuntu mint debian

383811

for extra security since you don t have any windows installation cd it s not a bad idea to keep a bootable linux installation dvd such as ubuntu somewhere

383849

can i do this by creating vmware or virtualbox instances that are connected to each other to form cluster

383869

using wmic you can get the screen width and height

384134

384162
mouse	keyboard
in graphical user interfaces you have two input devices - the keyboard and mouse

384162
mouse	keyboard
you use the keyboard for most editing and the mouse for moving around the document

384162
mouse	keyboard
normal mode is akin to using the mouse - except you re going to use the keyboard to move around the document

384177
itunes	iphoto
i was wondering if anyone knew of a way to use iphoto without having all the photos and movies lumped into one giant archive file but rather store them as individual files in subfolders similar to the way that itunes stores music

384230

before switching to vim i ve been using textmate 90 without the mouse

384230
kde	gnome
here is a list of cocoa shortcuts both windows and kde gnome have their own too

384230
vim	textmate
switching from textmate my reflex was to make vim a clone of my previous editor

384272

there are some historical reasons why vim does it like that and why let s say emacs opted for combos but that s another story

384279

you can use command ss is used to dump socket statistics and command nc arbitrary tcp and udp connections and listens

384318
ethernet	wireless
ubuntu 10.04 doesnot have drivers for atheros ethernet card and broadcom wireless cards

384343
filesystems	hfs+
unfortunately time machine requires an hfs+ filesystems which windows cannot read or write to by default

384349
hfs+	ntfs
so in short you re probably best using disk utility in applications utilities to partition your drive into an hfs+ partition for your mac backups and an ntfs partition for your windows backups

384357
folder	directory
my plan b at this point is to rsync the changing directory to a different folder and then zip the static location up but that ll take up twice the space and i d like to avoid that if possible

384371

enable is to activate unit aka daemons aka service at startup of systemd

384376

it s a decent os but i prefer ubuntu and do all my work in linux

384685
kerberos	ntlm
also note that if your computer belongs to a windows domain you should not need to give the credentials explicitly - should be enough for ntlm kerberos in addition to being more secure

384685
kerberos	ntlm
recently microsoft software has been switching from ntlm to kerberos ndash

384685
kerberos	ntlm
there is not much documentation on kerberos proxies with ppm but http-negotiate might be worth trying if you cannot get ntlm to work

384744
mouse	keyboard
another option is to use a lan enabled kvm switch this is different to using remote desktop in that the signal for the mouse keyboard is fed directly into the keyboard and mouse sockets on the pc at the other end instead of being virtualised by remote deskptop so the mouse pointer would appear in the vm the same as it does when viewing it at the pc itself they are not overly cheap though although you can prob find a second hand one on ebay

384752

in windows 7 you can show and hide fonts via the control panel

384784
fat	hfs+
usb hard drives on airport extreme usb port can only be hfs+ or fat 16 or fat 32

384784
hfs+	ntfs
so you can see the mac formated one hfs+ but not the ntfs one

384887
umask	mount
note to auto-mount a ntfs drive in debian based distros not sure about others you ll have to add an mount point in etc fstab with umask 000 for write privileges

384887
folder	directory
usually they require their own folder placed in the user directory and not all support selective sync

384901
vmware	esx
i suspect this is true for most virtualization platforms vmware s esx server may not have this problem.

386830

osx and almost every xnix use different filesystems and don t usually need to be defragged since they re not usually using fat ntfs. a lack of defragmenting is almost always the number one culprit if all we re talking about is a decrease in performance

do not use wan ports on 1.2 and 1.3 unless the routers have the option of changing that port to a lan port which they do sometimes

i am really starting to think this is a mb issue seeing as i replicate the problem with all distros all browsers and using usb and pci wireless and ethernet cable

the workbook was sized very large when a spaces delimiter .prn version of one worksheet was made

387292

387302
ubuntu	debian
sometimes when downloading software from the internet i find that there is a .deb package ready for either my debian ubuntu and also a tarball to be compiled

387312
opera	google-chrome
opera handles large images just fine by default similar to google-chrome

387331
sudo	passwd
since i already have the root passwd i execute command with sudo as follows

387331
sudo	passwd
i hope sudo does get the root passwd internally as i m already authenticating before executing anything in my uninstaller

387376
disk	ram
i noticed that speed of those machines drops if i run multiple of them in the same time they still have same amount of ram and cpu cores assigned and i also noticed heavy disk usage

387386
bash	zsh
i am using zsh and like it very much but work a lot with android source which has compilation scripts that require bash to be evaluated correctly

387386
bash	zsh
zsh cannot source these files and if i try to issue emulate bash my shell becomes non-functionnal with plenty of these error every time i hit space i am using oh-my-zsh maybe that is a cause

387386
bash	zsh
is there a way for me not to switch to bash to evaluate these files or to invoke a bash instance and import the new environments variables functions it defined during sourcing into my zsh session

387405
iscsi	smb
or i would set up an iscsi smb share on the remote system and back up that way

387412
vmware	virtualbox
take a look at vmware server but i think i saw that product hit eol and you can look at virtualbox as well

387424
filesystems	ntfs
some fs like ntfs uses a journal to record every fs operation before they are carried out which basically eliminates filesystems integrity problems due to unsafe unplug or power loss

387424
filesystems	fat
however most flash memory uses fat which does not have a journal thus very susceptible to filesystems integrity problems

387433
folder	directory
shell folder are linked to target file system directory in both directions

387433
folder	directory
there are registry settings that point from namespace folder to file system directory and within the file system directory there is a desktop.ini that points back to the namespace

387433
folder	directory
let s say you ve carefully named the raw directory to taste mapped the shell folder to this target and set your desired namespace name within the desktop.ini in the directory

387457
folder	directory
for example suppose your home directory is on myserver in a share named homedirs in a folder named georgehome

387460

lenovo changed my mainboard and ram and now it works with the same hard disk image

jobs	cron
for linux you can use cron jobs to schedule your program

387487
subnet	vlan
this means that you can broadcast to all hosts on your vlan typically in the same subnet by either layer 2 or 3

387487
vlan	packets
for example if you have 4 computers plugged into a single switch on the same vlan and in ip range 192.168.1.0 24 you can send a packets that will be broadcast to all 4 computers using either of the following methods

387487
udp	tcp
if you re planning on using tcp or udp i would go with the layer 3 broadcast

387487
subnet	packets
to be clear you re not going to be able to use broadcast packets to find hosts on different subnet

387491
mouse	keyboard
it allows you to have multiple windows machines side by side and have them controlled by one mouse and keyboard

387494
disk	ram
however as the machine will have 8gb ram i m not certain readyboost would do a huge amount as there should be plenty of ram left of disk cache

387499
mutt	thunderbird
at various occassions i ve tested thunderbird evolution mutt windows live mail outlook eudora and outlook express.

387506
mouse	keyboard
it turns out that it was a bad usb device wireless keyboard mouse combo or a bad usb port on the motherboard i am leaning toward the port on the mb

387517
min	max
not the max or the min but the last one entered in the column

387522
debian	linux
what exactly are the technical considerations that need to be made with getting integrated graphics hardware acceleration working under linux debian environments

387550
redhat	fedora
redhat fedora splits software into both runtime which is what you probably have installed and developer headers static libs packages

387571
cpu	processors
finally the cpu is a general-purpose processors as compared to a gpu and so it will tend to be slower overall

387580
versioning	upgrade
iâ ve read about this new windows anytime upgrade which will upgrade your current os to another versioning provided you have a windows anytime upgrade key

387591
norton	mcafee
what you don t want is 2 active av software s installed at the same time norton and mcafee for example

387593
itunes	iphoto
but i don t like it s one file dmg approach i also don t like the same approach with iphoto although that being said i do like iphoto s approach to managing the folder names by date and similarly the way itunes works and organizes files by their tags

387594
versioning	upgrade
the thing to realize is that there are numerous versioning of windows each with different rules for upgrade

387648
jobs	cron
it s normally updated by system cron jobs

387652
sudoers	visudo
so far so good the problem comes when i try to add a new user by modifying sudoers file using visudo

387652
sudoers	passwd
i didn t add any passwd in the sudoers file

387658
spaces	delimiter
since .cxt is just spaces delimiter with the order of the columns pre-determined you could to save as... .prn file

387658
spaces	delimiter
.prn files are spaces delimiter fixed width

387670
ubuntu	linux
at the time a version of a linux distribution is considered stable and released ubuntu 11.10 many packages will already be outdated again

387691
google-chrome	firefox
i notice that the text on some web pages look bad when viewed in google-chrome 16.0.912.77 m while ok with firefox 10.0

387699
asterisk	pbx
there s stacks of advice on the net but most of it assumes i m running an ip pbx like asterisk or using an external voip provider

387704
vmware	virtualbox
you can always open existing vmdk vmware disk images with virtualbox though

387721
mtu	pppoe
mtu problems on home broadband are most common on dsl services that use pppoe

387721
mtu	pppoe
pppoe has an mtu limit of 1492 instead of the ethernet value of 1500 and some isps may have an even lower mtu

387721
mtu	ppp	mtu	pppoe
home gateway routers often employ a trick called tcp mss clamping to make sure your traffic fits inside the lower mtu but maybe some don t do that or maybe your isp s equipment is screwed up and doesn t negotiate a proper ppp mru during pppoe negotiation

387736
post	get
i have seen the related post but i just need a clear explanation of how one might get the connection across the internet rather than just a lan.

387768
gentoo	linux
this repeats endlessly ever since i boot into my gentoo linux computer

387768
gentoo	ubuntu	gentoo	debian	ubuntu	debian
to be honest i have no idea on what could be producing the errors i ve always had problems with getting it to work previously in gentoo ubuntu arch and debian but i never had this kind of thing going on

387806
folder	directory
open windows explorer and go to the windir system32 drivers etc folder windir is your windows directory

387813
versioning	upgrade
the problem happened since i upgrade to firefox 9 from previous versioning

387816
wan	lan
where i live i am part of a controlled lan referred to as the wan

387816
wan	lan
i want to create a lan within this wan so that i can protect myself and my network devices with the caveat that the wan sees each device at least with respect to traffic

387816
gentoo	ubuntu
the box currently has ubuntu and gentoo on it

387831
ethernet	wireless
the base station will be reachable via ipv6 only from other devices on the data-link networks wired and wireless ethernet directly connected to the base station

387831
packets	multicast
the base station will use the advertised prefix and other information in the router advertisement multicast packets and use slaac to create a publicly routable ipv6 address for the base station

387831
wan	lan
router the base station will expect to have native ipv6 service out its wan port and will act as an ipv6 router for devices out its lan wlan ports

387831
wan	lan	tunnel	lan	tunnel	wan
tunnel the base station will expect to establish a connection to the ipv6 internet via an ipv6-in-ipv4 tunnel out the wan port and will act as an ipv6 router for its lan wlan-side clients

387848
rss	feed
what i want to achieve is to sync my rss feed â

387851
ubuntu	linux	lvm	btrfs
i will describe a solution that i have tested based on native linux zfs which is available in an ubuntu ppa but lvm md and btrfs can be used to achieve the same

387851
lvm	btrfs
using lvm or md it would be possible to remove drives and shrink the array if desired at the expense of less sophisticated recovery tools in zfs compared to btrfs

387851
lvm	btrfs
btrfs devs everyone wants this and lvm or md are not technically necessary and in my opinion sub-optimal

387879
put	get
another and perhaps more functional way to get what you want would be to put the dpc3825 into bridge mode and add an outboard linksys router capable of running the tomato third-party firmware

387907
gentoo	linux
i need to see currently installed updates and security patches on linux gentoo

387913
vim	textmate
vim is not textmate or whatever other editor you have used before

387917
ethernet	wireless
the os works great except now i can not get my wireless and ethernet to work

387951
ubuntu	mint
as i recall mint is based on ubuntu so you should be able to check apt-cache policy apache2

387962
mp4	h.264
i have successfully transcoded 1.2gb files mpeg-4 avi to h.264 mp4 in the past with this program though mov may run into problems

387969
switching	screens
after disabling rdp on all computers one user just reported she got switched off of her account and was looking at the xp welcome screens a switching not a log off and then about 5 minutes later it happened again but this time actually logged her off

387974
debian-based	mint
on debian-based systems which mint is the apache configuration takes a different approach

387980
wan	lan
it s only 100mbit lan there is no wan

388053
rijndael	twofish
rijndael won the aes competition primarily because it s the fastest and easiest to implement in hardware not because it s the most secure. twofish and serpent are usually considered more secure but since they are all extremely rock-solid that s a very subjective claim

the cpu has two cores physically but supports hyperthreading

388128
processors	hyperthreading
note that some intel processors the i5 included use hyperthreading a system where a single processors has for example 2 pyhsical cores but will provide 4 logical cores - allowing the operating system to treat the processors as having more cores than it really does

388139
cpu	hyperthreading
unfortunately for you no you have only one i3 cpu with two cores and enabled hyperthreading

388253
mouse	keyboard
â when the system was so bogged down by something that the mouse not only froze but the keyboard even locked up such that the -lock leds would not change and the internal speaker beeped

388253

388286
google-chrome	firefox
as i mentioned i couldn t find a firefox or google-chrome extension or built-in feature like this

388291

asterisk	pbx
taking the information from your question i tend to think that a custom-built system consisting of asterisk pbx and a custom-written software that can query a mysql database from asterisk can help you

388379
mouse	keyboard
every now and then when i use the kmv switch it will be blinking which indicates its waiting for the machine to accept the usb keyboard mouse through the kvm of course

388379
mouse	keyboard
when its not accepting the keyboard mouse such as i have described it will also not accept any other usb devices which makes it impossible to retrieve my daily backup

388379
mouse	keyboard
do you think it could be my kvm switch malfunctioning or maybe the keyboard mouse causing the issue

388384
google-chrome	firefox
how can the omnibar in google-chrome be made to act like the awesomebar in firefox

filesystems	ntfs
once you ve secured a way to install a bootloader you can just delete the mint partition and resize the ntfs partition and filesystems to reclaim the space

388619

the vbr bootstrap program is not a full filesystems driver and so isn t capable of handling things such as compressed ntfs files

388759
installation	downgrade
is it possible unofficially of course to downgrade a normal windows server 2008 r2 installation to server core

388770

389000
mouse	keyboard
in kde i m using mouse navigation to move the mouse pointer with the keyboard

389024
filesystems	btrfs
for a normal user without knowledge of the filesystems or how to manage it the most important benefit is that btrfs will eventually be able to repair corrupt data caused by media errors and well as being more space efficient for some workloads

389024
filesystems	btrfs
since btrfs checksums both data and metadata both the files and the filesystems itself you as a user should not have to worry much about silent data corruption

389026

389410
google-chrome	firefox
i replicated this on firefox ie and google-chrome

389439

if it s not possible with virtualbox i would be open to switching to another virtualization solution such as vmware

389612
installation	upgrade
if your goal is a quick install go the upgrade path but only if you feel that your installation of vista is not overly corrupted

389668
udp	tcp	icmp	udp	icmp	tcp
to do this i created a new security group called pingable that basically allows all tcp udp and icmp traffic to all ip addresses 0.0.0.0 0 just to test why it wasn t working but still unsuccessful

389676
freebsd	linux
i often use movable disk usb to change data between different oss almost four kinds -- linux windows mac os x freebsd

389761
google-chrome	firefox	opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome
it works in firefox opera steam and itself but fails in google-chrome probably because of the multiple processes

389761
mouse	keyboard
i also chose to use hot-keys keyboard shortcuts instead of mouse wheel to showcase that feature here

389761
mouse	keyboard
using volumouse with keyboard shortcuts combining the settings use hot-keys instead of mouse wheel blue method and change the volume for application in focus red method worked better for psycogeek as the hot-keys were functioning in applications where the mouse wheel didn t

the first release of solaris was sunos 4.1.x which was retroactively renamed solaris 1

389816

389845
disk	ram
esx i download page you can easily run several vms if the server has enough cores and ram but do not forget disk

389930
filesystems	ntfs
whether the data is stored on an ssd or a traditional hdd if you are running windows the ntfs filesystems will become fragmented and as a result you will never achieve the manufactures rated speed and throughput due to ntfs file and free space fragmentation

389933
google-chrome	firefox
firefox 10 has a new inspect and developer mode - it is pretty much like google-chrome - i don t like it you cannot edit on page css you can t edit text and tags simply like firebug - i would be on google-chrome now if it fully had firebug

google-chrome	firefox
pressing ctrl + b in firefox opens a bookmarks toolbar i d like to move to google-chrome but this is holding me back

390037
google-chrome	firefox	opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome
my personal recommendation as i think bookmarks are so 1999 would be to use one of the read-later style services instead like instapaper or one of the many alternatives but if you want to stick with the bookmark approach then the only thing lacking in default google-chrome is the side panel layout like firefox and opera

390071
disk	ram
it is built with the assumption that disk writes are really expensive has very little effect on systems with plenty of ram and does not scale properly if your ssd is 100gb+

390084
google-chrome	firefox
this behavior is the same for ie firefox and google-chrome

i m using google-chrome 18.0.1025.11 beta-m but i ve had this problem since switching from firefox over at least 5 releases

390142
ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	linux

390142
ubuntu	mint
if anyone from ubuntu mint are reading this please make a glc package

you should run thorough antivirus malware spyware adware scans to remove any rouge processes which could be causing this problem

390351
afp	smb
in cases like file sharing you are also configuring the afp smb nfs daemons with access control lists

390351

dpkg	apt
you could potentially use the package manager apt dpkg information to figure out what the ownership of all the files on the system are supposed to be

390910
dpkg	apt
i could figure out how to do that with rpm but i m not that intimately familiar with apt dpkg

390910
dpkg	apt
if you can find the equivalent for apt dpkg you can get there

390935
ubuntu	linux
my current system is ubuntu linux and i use bash

390944
filesystems	hfs
disclaimer i know about filesystems in general but not hfs specifically.

390944
filesystems	fat
they might be the same a filesystems using 4k clusters on a disk with 4k physical sectors or they might be different you can make a fat filesystems with 64k clusters but no disk has sectors that big

390952
vmware	virtualbox
a type 2 hypervisor such as vmware workstation or virtualbox runs as an application on an ordinary host operating system

390967
sudo	passwd
sudo asks for the user s passwd every so often when using bash

390977
fat	hfs+	hfs+	ntfs
so basically what microsoft calls clusters in fat and ntfs apple calls allocation blocks in hfs+

390977
filesystems	hfs+
this answers your second question yes hfs+ is an example of a filesystems that uses both extents and clusters allocation blocks

390985
sudo	passwd
sudo and you screensaver just validate the input passwd against the same database

390985
sudo	passwd
i m very sure you could write some sort of script that enumerates all open terminal windows and inserts a sudo and directly inputs your passwd

391052
vim	emacs
if this is not possible in vim would it be so in emacs or another editor

391055
ip-address	lan
the dhcp server should be configured to provide the printer with an appropriate ip-address plus the ip_address of the default gateway in it s lan segment and the ip-address of one or more dns servers

391057
put	get
format the cell you put this formula in as date and you ll get a prediction as to when your number of installs will equal the number of users

391073
sudo	passwd
i think it is better that aliasing sudo rm because you are explicitly told which files are to be deleted while with sudo you re only asked for a passwd like on dozen other occasions and before you know it you will approve the command

rss	feed
is there any rss feed or mailing list where notifications about released windows updates are sent to

391215
rss	feed
the best way to manage this i can imagine is having an rss feed that i would check and each time i d see new update coming or enough smaller updates piling up i d go through the set and update machines as soon as i consider it s good moment to do so

391222
kde	gnome
i noticed this was tagged gnome however for those who ended up here and are using kde it is really easy to make the numpad always print numbers

391284

this machine is running linux mint debian it s an asus a7n266-vm with geforce2 integrated graphics nvcrush11 that is targeted by the legacy drivers

391906
cpu	processors
a necessary consequence is that mobile processors are slower but they probably incorporate power-saving tricks that are not so much used in desktop pcs i think variable cpu clock-rates started in mobile processors

391921
ubuntu	linux
which assumes that linux.iso is in the current directory and is a generic linux .iso name used herein as an example only to substitute for an actual linux .iso file name in order to illustrate the dd command usage and where x is the letter of the usb device name which can be determined by using the disk utility application from system administration from the main menu bar ubuntu

391959
centos	linux	ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	linux
i need centos to study for red hat certs so the ubuntu install was mainly so to have a linux with which to probe and get more info for comparative diagnosis which i didn t get around to as i was trying to profile the different installer discs to see which would work and compare the differences

391959
centos	linux
-this motherboard has a uefi bios and at least red hat which centos and scientific linux is built on has specifically noted that uefi is only supported on 64-bit builds of their distro

392166
xfce	gnome	xfce	kde	kde	gnome
can kde or gnome compete with for example xfce if configured right

392172

i suspect this is due to a malware in google-chrome for a couple of reasons it is only in google-chrome not in firefox and it seems to have been syncronized through my other pc with some delay

392175
ssd	sata
without given the price of both hard disks and there is no pc nearby that you can connect both hard disk to see whether it is a ssd or sata so is there any way to differentiate ssd hard disk and a sata hard disk based on just physical appearance

i just found out that in truecrypt preferences there s an option to choose if truecrypt should umount all volumes on quit

392299
srt	subtitle
i need to write a sed script that places the actual text of the subtitle in a srt file on a single line

392367
folder	dir
you should be able to see all files extensions by just deselecting the hide extensions of known file types in the folder options settings or you can type command dir from the command line to see the files with extensions and you would see that the folder names do not have any extra extensions

392374
button	checkbox
they are few checkbox underneath and a button named display cookies..

392378

392542
vmware	virtualbox
say virtualbox or vmware or virtualpc

392543
flac	ogg
the cumulative effect of all that noise adds up to a net loss of sound quality comparable to the loss of fidelity from flac to ogg acc or some of the other more advanced lossy compressions

392552
xlsx	xlsm
because the file has all of the xml plus the binary the file is larger than the corresponding xlsx or xlsm file

392552
xlsx	xlsm
i use mercurial for my code repository and with the zipdoc extension turned on i can tell it that xlsx and xlsm files are zipped xml text files instead of binary.

the best you could do is to use some kind of checksum md5 hash or similar to be able to at least detect if something was changed on your hard drive

392674
rar	zip
q why do some people use rar rather than zip for compressing

392674
rar	zip
rar zip don t have that problem

392680
versioning	upgrade
upgrade your versioning of ffmpeg

392686

392688
rss	feed
this url in question doesn t have an rss feed

392702
filesystems	hfs+
i have been reading up on old forum threads and questions here and my understanding is that time machine demands a volume with hfs+ filesystems meaning it would not work with ext4

392703
filesystems	hfs+
if you really need read write support from both oses then you only have one choice namely to format as hfs+ since time machine won t work with others and macos can t natively write to ext4 see how can i mount an ext4 filesystems on os x

392711

i m looking for a very simple 2 or 3 line lcd display that allows me to print custom data to it from the a linux box ubuntu and rhel

392806
cifs	smb
if you want to share then you will need to use a file sharing protocol such as smb cifs or nfs

393016
tunnel	packets
host_work is behind non-transparent squid_proxy its not but to get outside you need to use it all other packets are black-holed on gateway not to mention 0 incoming where we have ssl so that means also http_connect or just connect support which is needed for ssh tunnel via putty in the first place

393016
lan	localhost	tunnel	lan
i added proxy port to putty and it would reverse tunnel only to localhost port not to some other box in lan yes i set it myself r3390 127.0.0.1 3389 in tunnel panel

393016
tunnel	vpn
if you mention ssl tunnel i would prefer vpn solution than that

393044
ethernet	wireless
it s possible to keep a networking card or two powered up at least partially for the sake of wake on lan while the host is asleep but moving the traffic between a wired ethernet card and a wireless card without using the host processor or os is the tricky part

393044
ethernet	wireless
i don t know of anyone who makes a combo wired wireless ethernet card that can act as an 802.11 ap or wireless router while the host is asleep

393077

393162
ssd	sata
recently i ve installed an internal sata ssd drive on my home machine transferred eclipse installation and project to it and noticed a significant improvement in eclipse performance

393166
ssd	sata
there is no reason you could not install a ssd in your laptop provided the one you currently have has a sata disk interface

393187
ssd	sata
with consumer desktop hdd s and ssd my own research suggests that to benefit from ahci you ll want a 6 gb s sata port and ssd or you ll want to use hdd thats known to show improvement with ncq

393200
width	height
it is also advisable to provide a specific width and height if possible

393213

393331
google-chrome	firefox
internet explorer firefox and google-chrome

393334
x86	64bit	vmware	virtualbox
it depends on the virtual machine software you re using but with the main ones such as vmware virtualbox and microsoft virtualpc hypervisor you won t see any downside to running a 32-bit guest in a 64bit host on x86 x64

393350
case-sensitive	case-insensitive
in practise this means that all applications will see your filesystem in a case-insensitive way regardless of whether your filesystem is actually case-sensitive under the hood

393350
filesystems	ntfs
the only way i can think for you to practically force case-sensitivity is to write a filter-driver which will remove the obj_case_insensitive flag from the incoming syscall requests which will then allow ntfs ext2 or whatever internal filesystems you have to behave in their default case-sensitive way

393353
rss	feed
shavlik now offers notification via twitter as well as an rss feed of their patch file updates which as before include more than just microsoft products

393388
ethernet	wireless
since i m cheap i decided to use my laptop and the internet connection sharing ics option within windows 7 to share my internet from my wireless card to my ethernet port and from there to my xbox

393404
versioning	upgrade
your versioning of rhel needs to be upgrade to support that

ubuntu	debian
it really depends on which distribution you are using if it is debian based ubuntu etc then apt is the standard

393439
redhat	fedora
if you use a redhat based distro centos fedora then you would normally use yum

create .lso firefox chromium safari directories and make each wrapper just link the directory that is supposed to hold the lsos to the directory of the concerned browser

396707
ethernet	wireless
i have a pc which is connected to a modem router through a ethernet cable and a laptop which can be connected to the internet over wireless through the same router

396726
rss	feed
my hosting company made some change in their hardware and now suddenly all wordpress sites hosted on that machine some are mine others aren t are getting http errors and name lookup timed out when trying to read external stuff like rss feed

396774
filesystems	fat
there are a lot of possible causes for this kind of usb not formatted error such as the drive is severely corrupted after years of usage or due to improper operation strong plug-out of a pc while in data transfer damaged fat filesystems not compatible with your current pc if this is the first time you connect it to the computer etc

396776
google-chrome	firefox
internet explorer uses the most ram then firefox and lastly google-chrome i remember reading up on some stats a while ago 40 windows in firefox take up 1.2gb ram

396797
ethernet	wireless
then i connected an ethernet cable from a lan port on my verizon supplied actiontec mi424wr-gen2 e router to a lan port on the access point and turned off the wireless in the router

396813
rar	gzip
i want to make a rar file not tar or gzip with several parts in linux shell how can do that please

396819
ubuntu	linux
i have a laptop let me call it a with intel centrino 1030-n wireless iwlwifi module running arch linux and another laptop i will call it b with atheros ar928x wireless ath9k module running ubuntu 11.10

396829
ubuntu	linux
i don t know of any way to stop windows 8 from installing that bootloader so you have to install windows 8 to whichever partition you set aside for it then boot up any linux live environment and reinstall grub to your first partition which is either 7 or ubuntu depending

396829
ubuntu	linux
once you boot up in the linux environment browse to your existing boot grub menu.lst file -- it should show entries for ubuntu and windows 7

396852
mouse	keyboard
users should only have keyboard mouse monitor â that s it no computer

396852
mouse	keyboard
they will only have keyboard mouse monitor

396855
ubuntu	linux
note that the product seems to be somewhat integrated with ubuntu linux

396879
tunnel	vpn
the asus wireless router rt-n10+ is able to pass through vpn traffic but doesn t have an option to tunnel all traffic through a proxy

396918
google-chrome	firefox
i m looking for a google-chrome or firefox plugin that allows me to have windows with different sessions

396956
ethernet	wireless
actually come to think of it to see what your maximum wired to wireless throughput really is without possible constraints of your broadband internet connection you should try putting one of your machines on wired ethernet on the lan port of your ap and do the iperf between there and the other client which would still be on wireless to see what kind of max tcp throughput numbers you can get

396966
sudo	passwd	sudoers	passwd
you could also configure etc sudoers so that user2 can run sudo su user1 and or sudo su - user1 without entering a passwd

396972
debian	mint	ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	debian
for debian ubuntu mint install with

397046
hide	show
you can hide this column and do your or somewhere in column d if you don t want the helper column to show

397195
folder	directory
i want to install it in different folder under c but when i try to change the install directory i can only it to desktop and users folder

397225
ssl	https
serving any content over http to a https webpage potentially compromises the entire security behind ssl

397249
udp	tcp
unfortunately acls cannot be applied to devices or parts of the network stack such as tcp udp raw streams

397252
folder	directory
this is a folder in my ecryptfs encrypted home directory

397254
folder	directory
if the folder is backuped nightly you might find it more useful to first tar the entire directory compress the resulting file and then encrypt that don t encrypt and then compress because compression doesn t work on encrypted files

397256
udp	tcp
if an attacker continues to send traffic to that ip your network card does receive it but your system s tcp ip stack and your network card won t consider it as destined for that system and therefore won t grab it - the traffic will never make its way up to the application listening on specific tcp or udp ports

397256
udp	tcp
standard network applications that just listen on specific tcp or udp ports can t receive any traffic in this situation

397273
antivirus	createprocess
basically if you re browsing the web and just after visiting a dodgy website internet explorer suddenly starts dropping files onto your machine and trying to call createprocess on them any antivirus worth their salt will start jumping up and down regardless of what zero-day exploit may have been used to attack the browser in the first place

397299
directx	direct2d
not unless you re using direct2d directx in which case you can use a shader

397308
folder	directory
a windows virus moved all my ebooks from their sorted out folder to the parent directory

397322
ftp	smb
just transfer the text file over the network somehow smb ftp http whatever

397338
virtualbox	bootcamp
you ve probably already discovered bootcamp and virtualbox is also an option if you want to do this while booted into osx

397353
vim	emacs
examples of an applications where it doesn t work are cygwin vim emacs not necessarily started from cygwin and for operating systems launched inside of virtualbox

397365
spaces	delimiter
xargs can pass file-names which contain consecutive spaces by changing the input delimiter to n with the -d option

397389
cpu	processors
now i am having issues with getting bsods that say a clock interrupt was not received on a secondary processors within the allocated time interval and i ve seen that this may be caused by an incorrent vcore of the cpu

397412
filesystems	ntfs
exfat can be used where the ntfs filesystems is not a feasible solution due to data structure overhead or where the file size limit of the standard fat32 filesystems without fat+ extension is unacceptable

397421
ubuntu	linux
here is a more up-to-date information 22 february 2013 - for linux ubuntu touch

397429
google-chrome	firefox
so i m wondering if there s a browser extension for firefox google-chrome or any other browser which will for instance let you find one term and highlight it in say yellow and find a second term and highlight it in say bright green

397474
processors	hyperthreading
hyperthreading allow your processors to pretend to have x amount of cores

397498
sorting	filtering
i am using imap and other sorting or filtering methods but it still create a mess for me

397544
ubuntu	linux
it s been a while since i ran ubuntu so i am not sure if that s the exact terminology they use the partition chances are pretty good that you can boot into a linux recovery console and use a tool such as fdisk to simply reset the partition type to ntfs hpfs

397544
filesystems	ntfs
however my guess is that the installer also formatted the partition using the new filesystems in which case critical ntfs data structures boot sector pointers parts of the mft etc. as well as user data were very likely damaged or even outright overwritten by their ext3 counterparts

397598
google-chrome	firefox
in for instance google-chrome and konqueror the fonts look alright but in firefox the fonts are tiny almost too hard to read

397610
vpn	lan
if both adapters are active and have internet lan access with different ips then this is possible by using the route command to specify that the vpn ip address is on a route that is only supported by the wireless adapter

397628
mouse	keyboard
it froze twice yesterday the mouse keyboard everything

397660
daemons	launchd
in legacy sysvinit initscripts which are just shell scripts often launchd directly by the sysadmin it is necessary to make sure the admin s environment does not propagate to the started daemons

397662
spaces	delimiter
the find -print0 | xargs -0 uses null delimiter instead of spaces and the second uses newlines instead of spaces to terminate input items

397694
icmp	udp
#313 - how the internet works icmp udp

397708
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
firefox and safari both are able to remember the certificate for future reference but google-chrome has no mechanism for doing so

397745
unix	solaris
there are also still oses that have a heritage in the original unix versions - solaris and some of the bsds for example

397745
solaris	bsd
none of these are gnu licensed - most bsd varients are bsd licensed and some versions of solaris were under the cddl

397758
ubuntu	linux
my plan is to install ubuntu 11.10 or 12.4 in the newly-freed 20 gb of space via a single partition but every single install documentation i ve seen says linux needs three partitions.

397766
filesystems	ntfs
ability to work with include writing to ntfs filesystems without any problems

397771
filesystems	ntfs
i assume the partition you want to back up is dev sda usually the first ata or scsi drive and that you only have one hard drive installed so that the usb drive becomes dev sdb with a single partition dev sdb1 containing your ntfs filesystems

397774
ati	nvidia
unlike nvidia you can also mix and match different ati gpus when using crossfire

397792
udp	tcp
there is a finite number iirc 2 16-1 of tcp udp ports for a given ip address so even if the firewall part of the router was unwanted it could not possibly open up every port on every computer on the local network which in principle could be 2 24-1 devices for the 10.0.0.0 8 network unless there is only a single connected computer

397804
google-chrome	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome
she said i probably didn t need google-chrome but that opera might work better for me and she thought it might be a bit more secure than safari

397833
filesystems	ntfs
ability to work with include writing to ntfs filesystems without any problems

397850
ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	linux
note this method should be avoided if you have a normal linux distribution like ubuntu mint fedora arch.

397852
median	max	min	median	min	max
it has sum min max avg etc but not median

397859
hide	show
however this toggling should keep the hidden columns hidden -- it s just the visible columns that should appear disappear when performing the show detail hide detail toggle clicking on the + - signs

397907
udp	tcp
it will allow you to view all tcp udp packets that are received by your entire machine regardless of the port

397921
folder	dir
so i tried copying my libc-2.11.1.so to a folder in my home dir say home users myuser lib made a symbolic link so that home users myuser lib libc.so.6 would point to the actual so and added the lib folder to my path

397929
disk	ram
i scraped the computer saved the hard drive ram floppy and disk drive and got rid of it

397968
versioning	upgrade
i m trying to upgrade an oem versioning of windows 7 professional x64

398039
debian	linux	debian	mint	ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	linux
linux mint is a linux distribution based on ubuntu which in turn is based on debian

398040
debian-based	mint	debian-based	linux
linux mint is a debian-based open-source linux distribution

398071
hide	show
i want to be able to hide and show the wi-fi menu item from the terminal

398075
xfs	mdadm
if laclie won t do support and you re not feeling confident about mdadm and xfs then a data recovery shop is probably the best option

398075
xfs	mdadm
even if you do feel confident with mdadm and xfs a data recovery shop might be the best option

398153
sudo	passwd
again this can be done as root via crontab or by configuring sudo to not require a passwd for that script

398153
sudoers	passwd
the passwd requirement would be removed by editing sudoers

398208
xfs	ntfs
ntfs and refs are a bad choice because linux and mac can t properly decode it and ext2 ext3 xfs are bad choices because you need custom windows drivers for it to work

398237
mouse	keyboard
other times it is mouse and keyboard that become unresponding

398237
mouse	keyboard
can such problems also have repercussion on usb peripherals like keyboard and mouse

398241
disk	ram
please check your ram usage as windows is probably paging copying to disk these memory intensive programs that are idle

398272
google-chrome	firefox
if you only demand it when you browsing web pages there re extensions for firefox and google-chrome both called something like redirector

398276
autodesk	catia
autodesk inventor competes directly with solidworks and solidedge and less directly with creo elements pro catia and nx unigraphics

398352
put	get
now how do i get the two to coordinate so i don t have to put the password into the web account login screen

398362
put	get
now how do i get the two to coordinate so i don t have to put the password into the web account login screen

398382
put	get
put on your rocket boots and get ready to sail

398408
chown	mount
im not sure what you keep on the home partition but if no useless stuff i would just mount the old home partition under the new system in home mountpoint and chown -r username.group home username to set correct uid and gid

398418
jobs	cron
check sar log and identify peak times if ever this happens and try to match those time with disk intensive cron jobs eg backups over network

398454
folder	directory
in windows 7 my downloads folder in my user directory disappeared

398484
opensuse	linux
i am pretty new to linux and i tried to install configure the apache 2 on opensuse 12.1

398528
ubuntu	linuxmint
linuxmint is user friendly and based on ubuntu so support as many softwares as ubuntu can

398609
mouse	keyboard
i recently discovered that the unifying transceiver works with my acer android tablet and gives me the ability to connect a real keyboard and and real mouse to it

398609
mouse	keyboard
assuming for the present that i m using the pc and tablet one at a time ie the other is switched off is there any way i can use one set of keyboard mouse to easily connect to the appropriate system

398616
punctuation	words
in case the 1st isn t an option is it possible to tell the spell checker something like if it has punctuation in it treat it as a valid words

398616
punctuation	words
i m a programmer so if a words has punctuation in it there s a really good chance that it s something like foo.py or get_cksum and i don t need that to be spellchecked.

398644
stdout	stderr
the 2 1 will combine stderr and stdout from your program

398671
screens	tablet
besides the mail app is only neat for tablet because on desktop it uses more than less than half the screens for the actual emails having you to scroll sideways just to view them properly.

398761
sin	sqrt
which i ve bound to a keyboard shortcut which opens a terminal with this command which gives me a lightning-fast competent calculator with exp sqrt sin log pi e etc

398769
google-chrome	firefox
i m using google-chrome and oddly enough flash performs slightly better in firefox

398806
ubuntu	debian
it needs some debian stuff in addition to ubuntu too

398839
comm	grep
ps -eo user comm | grep nginx will give you the user who running nginx

398862
disk	ram
so with that - i m pretty sure that this is not a disk cache who is using the ram because normally it should have been reduced and let other processes to use ram rather then go to swap

398876
freebsd	solaris	freebsd	linux
it runs on gnu linux solaris freebsd os x and windows and can be ported to other posix-conformant platforms

398945
switching	screens
every time i switching into full screens f11 in chrome it says you ve gone full screens

398977
google-chrome	firefox
it works great with my desktop browsers google-chrome and firefox and it even sees http requests that other programs make

398996
folder	dir
i don t like programs that mount a remote dir as a local folder since they are really sluggish if you have a slow network connection

399009
mouse	keyboard
remove any peripherals such an external mouse keyboard monitor usb flash drive etc

399024
debian	linux
i have a debian linux server recent install

399036
ethernet	wireless
if you re dealing with 802.11 wi-fi at all note that 802.11 is a data link layer protocol basically wireless ethernet

399036
ethernet	wireless
a device that connects a wireless ethernet to a wired ethernet is technically called an access point or ap

399036
ethernet	wireless
an ap can be a simple link-layer bridge between wired and wireless ethernet

399052
ssd	sata
the problem wasn t the ssd and was something to do with my sata configuration with several large capacity sata-2 drives

399065
opensuse	linux	ubuntu	opensuse	ubuntu	linux
we basically use linux ubuntu and opensuse as well as android and ios tablets

399086
cpu	hyperthreading
you only have one cpu installed in your system but it might be a quad-core or a dual-core with hyperthreading

399086
cpu	hyperthreading
edit an i3-330m is a dual core cpu with hyperthreading so in this specific scenario cpu1 and cpu2 are the first core cpu3 and cpu4 are the second core

399088
mouse	keyboard
last note the wireless mouse came with a wireless keyboard that i am still using

399097
ubuntu	linux
i found a solution i was using google chrome in ubuntu linux and i installed a chrome extension called flashcontrol

399145
vmware	virtualbox
but luckily i don t need a lot of juice in my linux environment mainly it will involve watching videos and programming so i m thinking it could work to run linux virtually in top of windows in some kind of virtualization software like virtualbox or vmware

399157
filesystems	hfs+	filesystems	hfs
finally mac os x creates files called where is an existing file to store the mac resource fork on filesystems which don t support it which is almost anything which isn t hfs or hfs+

i heard that the hard disk may become damaged and i could lose important information but i m worried about the other components like the processor ram or motherboard

399308
dropbox	skydrive
dropbox sugarsync windows live mesh skydrive etc

399327
punctuation	words
i tried this with words by using find replace find and replacing with blanks but even with this i stuck with all the remaining blanks and punctuation symbols

399357
google-chrome	firefox
i whenever i open google-chrome or firefox on my pc i get a really annoying buzzing noise

399357
ssd	sata
i have an ssd so i ran only that drive and the noise still existed so i ran just a normal sata drive and same problem still the noise

399369
mouse	keyboard
as long as the machine is in clamshell mode with display and power connected a usb keyboard or mouse will wake it

399430
mouse	keyboard
there are techniques for linux and windows but is there a way to count mouse and keyboard events in mac os x

399432
decoder	encoder
from this i can assume that there is an issue with quicktime and that is what premiere is using as an encoder decoder for the codec

399445
google-chrome	firefox
i want to move to firefox from google-chrome

399445
google-chrome	firefox
is there a simple way to export the saved passwords and booksmarks in google-chrome and to import them into firefox

399460
google-chrome	firefox
i just moved from firefox to google-chrome for a test run p

399485
google-chrome	firefox
and one kind of important part is the browser tabs that reopen when i restart google-chrome and firefox

399506
google-chrome	firefox
both firefox and google-chrome store bookmarks and tabs data in their respective profile directories their locations are as below

399512
kde	kubuntu
my right click context menu on konsole 2.7.4 kde 4.7.4 kubuntu 11.10 tells me these keyboard shortcuts

ubuntu	linux
i m using totem movie player 3.0.1 with gstreamer 0.10.35 in a updated ubuntu 11.10 machine with 3.0.0-16-generic linux kernel

399570
flac	ogg	mp3	flac	mp3	ogg
if your devices can handle compressed formats mp3 flac ogg etc you would be better served by burning the files to a disk directly rather than burning them as cdda disks

399574
mp3	flac
audio cds are a different format as kotekzot mentions to mp3 or flac or what ever format you are using

399590
cpu	processors
cpu intel core i7-950 bloomfield 3.06ghz lga 1366 130w quad-core processors bx80601950

399591
google-chrome	firefox
i use this approach effectively in firefox google-chrome and ie

399601
vmware	virtualbox
install virtualbox or vmware and install 32 or 64bit ubuntu from iso image

399601
debian	mint	ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	debian
no idea - ubuntu is a graphic shell over debian just like mint

399609
wan	lan
in some cases you can turn off nat and dhcp services on the wireless router and their wan port ends up getting bridged in with their other lan ports

399609
wan	lan
in other cases the device always has nat enabled between lan and wan so you have to just not use the wan port plug a lan port into your 5-port gige switch and if you can t turn off the dhcp service completely give it a zero-length address pool range of addresses to hand out

399625
debian	linux
my linux debian sid desktop started to become sluggish in the last few weeks

399630
filesystems	hfs+
that depends but conventional filesystems including hfs+ afaik usually work splendidly at least up to 90 utilisation

399637
arp	dhcp
however if you truly do not know it s ip then arp and dhcp will not help

399637
winpcap	wireshark
if your switch is also a router wireless router it may have its own web interface and ip tools you can use instead of trying to get tcpdump to work on win 7 winpcap tcpdump wireshark cygwin etc

399647
ubuntu	mint
another alternative is to boot a live unix cd like ubuntu or mint

399683
ubuntu	debian
unfortunately and i don t understand why ubuntu s implementation of ddrescue does not include ddrescuelog but it s fairly easy to get the latest from debian and compile install it about the simplest i ve seen

399689
logmein	hamachi
you can use a program called hamachi from logmein in a gateway configuration

399696
webkit	gecko
you can use avant browser ultimate 2012 with gecko and webkit core

399723
bash	zsh
the usr bin time command doesn t have this limitation and neither do the inbuilt time commands of most other shells for example bash or zsh

399776

399822
filesystems	ntfs
i want to convert one partition of my windows which is ntfs or can be fat32 to a linux filesystems partitioning

399870
mouse	keyboard
it does not take any input from the keyboard or mouse and it does not recover at least not in less then 10 minutes

399882
versioning	upgrade
this happens when you upgrade your bios to a newer versioning

399900
ethernet	wireless
since you said your office don t have a wireless router i can only assume you re using ethernet to connect to your work network

399909
sse	avx
all models support mmx sse sse2 sse3 ssse3 sse4.1 sse4.2 avx

399921
cpu	affinity
right-click the process again and select set affinity and make sure that all of the cpu check-boxes are checked this is the default

399987
bash	zsh
i m using zsh with .oh-my-zsh right now but i had this same problem when i was using bash with no real customization done

399989
folder	directory
instead it now saves streaming videos to the regular browser cache folder in the user data directory localappdata google chrome user data default cache and the files can be easily copied from the os windows explorer

400014
ethernet	wireless
its probably easier to connect a usb wireless ethernet adapter to the tv for less than the cost of a new router

400024
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu v8-9 used to come with a rescue option that would reinstall reconfigure grub for you from the live cd which just about always worked with linux installs and always with windows for me even in the developer preview of win7

400083
folder	directory
will create the directory structure including empty folder but without copying the files

400104
ubuntu	debian
first of all i was thinking about an os problem i m running debian so i try windows ubuntu still the same problem

400146
folder	directory
other directory like your home folder obviously belong to your user

400168
sudo	passwd
if you have the sudo passwd then you should be able to run

google-chrome	firefox
use the stylish extension for firefox google-chrome etc then use the code i added below

400185
kde	kubuntu
after experiencing some issues with kde 4.7.1 on kubuntu 11.10 i tried to restart it

400209
ubuntu	linux
this is ubuntu bodhi linux though and other systems may have fewer extras

400210
folder	directory
what i want to do is to list all the folder within that directory but also include the owner and the size of the directory

400212
xfce	gnome
i could get to another console using ctrl+alt+fx and tried to reinstall my desktop i have xfce running i tried reinstalling both gnome and xfce but whenever i tried to do something with yum i got the message that i have 0 bytes left on my hard disk

400225
vmware	virtualbox
try using vmware or virtualbox

400305
debian	linux
today i installed linux debian in dual boot with windows 7

400305
ubuntu	debian
before debian i had ubuntu and there wasn t any problem

400351
daemons	systemd
i understand that ubuntu derivatives support systemd v which some consider the old method of starting services for a specifc runlevel and upstart however how do i tell whether a service or daemons is managed by scripts started by init or upstart

400372
kde	gnome
i think gnome terminal and kde konsole do this as well but apparently the ones you tried do not

400372
vim	emacs
the likes of vim and emacs do this but less does not

400374
solaris	bsd
use an os that is able to read the full raw disk like any gnu linux distribution solaris or a bsd and then run the strings command with the raw device as argument eg with linux

400374
unix	aix	unix	solaris	solaris	aix
as you mention unix and not linux it is very possible that the machine wasn t using a bios and thus was not using an fdisk partition table but some custom label like solaris hp-ux aix and other unix do

400421
ati	nvidia
for both nvidia and ati drivers for sony vaio after performing this solution you can restore the brightness via the mobility center windows + x

400486
filesystems	ntfs
other popular choices supporting modern filesystems features like permissions and reasonable platform support are ntfs and ufs

400508
jobs	cron
i have accidentally wiped out all my cron jobs

400508
jobs	cron
what are the possible ways that the cron jobs can be completely wiped out

400510
jobs	cron
jpmath s answer correctly points out that crontab -r will also wipe out your cron jobs that s what it s for

400513
ubuntu	linux
the vmware image ubuntu linux has a stable ip address being online or offline but my host machine windows 7 has not

400520
move	drag
then right click on the internal partition now located at the very left most end of the a larger partition and move resize it to the very end of that partition you can just click in the middle and drag it to the right

jobs	cron
according to what i ve discovered about anacron from random anacron set-up tutorials i first need to have cron running hourly to trigger the anacron script which then handles the daily plus jobs

once you have an md5 sha1 sha256 hash of the file you can search virustotal for that hash and that will tell you whether or not those are infected files

vpn	lan
the lan can ping the interface of the open vpn gateway

401159
udp	tcp
i have tried both udp and tcp connections and have added explicit rules to the lan interface

401175
openvpn	iptables
if you are the one operating openvpn on the server-side you need to look into setting up basic routing first by i think and then setting it up some basic firewall access control rules with iptables since after all you just turned that machine into a router

401178
switching	screens
if the problem is that the display is mangled because it switched to a different symbol character set you can add a so control character to your prompt to automatically switching back or run your terminal inside gnu screens which will do similarily

401205
vmware	virtualbox
however if it won t meet your need you can try vmware virtualbox too.

401211
hex	binary
as already mentioned by others binary files which contain numbers should be viewed by a hex dump program or hex editor and not by a text viewer

401211
cpu	processors
of course this is a lot easier on an 8-bit cpu or microcontroller than a 32-bit cisc processors with a dozen memory address modes

401249
direct3d	directx
i currently run windows 7 in virtualbox with full directx and direct3d support but without support for graphics card integration it s not as good as actually running the operating system

401257
wan	lan
a router is basically a 5 port switch 1 wan 4 lan one of the ports wan accepts the internet traffic

401257
wan	lan	wan	vlan
the 4 lan ports are on a vlan which connects to the dns and dhcp server that will allow connection to the internet through the wan port

401323
cpu	processors
honestly though if you re going to be doing a lot of cpu intensive applications on a netbook you should probably be using a better processors

401323
ethernet	wireless
lower your brightness get a ssd disable items in the bios if not needed use ethernet instead of wireless i would say downclock the cpu but that may suck with an atom reduce startup items use better cooling

401340

in google-chrome and firefox the results are sent directly to a file on my computer

401522

unfortunately there is no setting that you can change to enable this however there are two ways you can do it that simply requires an extra keyboard command or mouse click

401526

i already have them all installed with both 32 and 64bit versions and i ve narrowed it down to the visual c++ 2010 x86 redistributable

401541

i understand now that a type 2 or hosted hypervisor is the same as using vmware or virtualbox within an existing operating system so i want type 1

401541
direct3d	directx	vmware	esx
would vmware esx or esxi run both windows 7 and ubuntu simultaneously and support directx direct3d and hardware acceleration using my graphics card drivers properly

daemons	systemd
starting in at least snow leopard and possibly leopard all logging on the systemd goes through the apple systemd log asl mechanism which is like a central daemons and database for all log messages

401705
logmein	hamachi
the one thing that will probably save you more time and efforts than anything would be to use hamachi from logmein

401705
logmein	hamachi
create a network either through hamachi or logmein s website interface

401718
folder	directory
for example if your images directory is full of unnecessary folder drag the folder into the suction interface and it will do away with the folder leaving you just with the files

401788
width	height
i need a piece of software a freeware preferably that will display what is the pixel width height of a pdf page

401790

401790
rss	feed
is there a way to copy all the old rss feed of a website and copy into a text or microsoft word file

401793
google-chrome	firefox
i tried opening page which uses this font however my web-browser whether it s google-chrome or firefox doesn t render it and just shows simple font i thinks times new roman however if i ssh from my machine to other machine which is also running linux and open same page with web browser inside it with x-server everything works fine

401812
rss	feed
assuming you have established that that rss feed are available then you can use wget to obtain the rss feed contents

401812
rss	feed
rss feed usually terminate in .rss or .xml so an example would be

401812
rss	feed
this saves the rss feed found the this url to a text file

401812
rss	feed
note that rss feed can overlap so some de-duplication may be required

401816
macports	homebrew
this arrangement used to work fine with grep from macports and on ubuntu before that so i figured my problem might be caused by homebrew

401816
macports	homebrew
i can t go back to macports - i had to switch to homebrew for other reasons and as i understand it they don t play nicely together

401818
disk	ram
in addition a few weeks ago i set up a ram disk about 256 mb and have put firefox s temp files in it

401818
disk	ram
also i think that with 4 additional gb i may use about 2 of them as a ram disk and put things like windows s page file in it

401829
disk	ram
so you ll get performance boost because ram r w speed is much higher than disk

401844
wan	lan
you may be confused if the device you are connecting all the computers to has multiple lan ethernet ports and then a single wan port

401850
versioning	upgrade
you can upgrade to the lastest versioning by running

google-chrome	safari
i have a strange issue that happens with both the google-chrome and safari browsers

401865

in my case i am attaching folder actions to directory in my music folder

401865

i want to set up the music folder so that if i add a new artist folder to the music directory that folder will have the same actions all the other artist folder already have and the same for the album folder

401872
pop-up	dialog
if i now press r the windows run dialog will pop-up because windows still thinks the windows logo key is pressed

401887
sudo	passwd
or open a terminal window and type sudo shutdown -h now and enter passwd

401892
stdout	stderr
in mac os 10.6 the console.app had an option to show the console log which included what looks like the stdout stderr message of running applications not explicitly sent to syslog

401892
stdout	stderr
does the mac no longer provide a way to see the stdout stderr messages for running applications those run as .app and not from terminal

401908
sudo	passwd
for sudo there is a -s option for accepting the passwd from standard input

401928
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
new versions of google-chrome safari and firefox are likely supported but ie tends to disappoint

401930
sudoers	passwd
while it is easiest to simply run the script as root you could also create a group in the sudoers file that can run the program without a passwd and add your username to that group

401936
folder	directory
i am using innosetup to install a .net winforms application that creates directory and folder on the fly

401936

i have set the folder options to display hidden files folders... although the files that are added to created folder appear within the application they do not show when using windows explorer or even when issuing a dir from a command prompt

401962
google-chrome	firefox
i was quite surprised to see that the image scaling anti-aliasing of internet explorer 8 seems to be significantly better than that provided by google-chrome and firefox

401962
google-chrome	firefox
is it possible to tweak the image scaling anti-aliasing of google-chrome and or firefox to match internet explorer

401962
google-chrome	firefox
and there was no difference between google-chrome and firefox

402011
opera	google-chrome
ps the scaling in opera also seems to match your google-chrome screenshot

402015
google-chrome	firefox
ad-blockers are also available as plug-ins extensions for firefox google-chrome and internet explorer

402018
google-chrome	firefox
you can manually disable things from your browser - instructions below for firefox and google-chrome - i don t use ie but i can check if its your browser of choice

402018
google-chrome	firefox
you can disable load images automatically which will prevent images from loading - this is under options - content on firefox or privacy - content on google-chrome

402018
google-chrome	firefox
and switch all mimetypes to always ask - this is under the applications tab on firefox and i believe handlers under google-chrome

402019
versioning	upgrade
if i install vs11 express will it keep vs2010 as it is now or it will imagine that i want to upgrade to the later versioning and erase damage the old one and the only solution i have is to install vs11 on a virtual machine

i have a folder full of many directory representing all the vendors my company does business with and they include many .pdf files of receipts invoices

402175
folder	directory
then i have another folder with many receipts invoices in it that used to be maintained separately from the master vendor list and was supposed to include a manually-created copy of every receipt invoice that was entered into the appropriate entry in master vendor directory structure

402175
folder	directory
i ve searched for files of type .pdf in the top-level folder of the master vendor list so that my search results include receipts invoices from all the vendors in the directory structure

402175
folder	directory
i compared those files to the files in the taxes folder using winmerge to see if any of the files in the taxes folder don t exist in the master vendor directory and vice-versa

402175
folder	directory
there are hundreds of these files if any are in the taxes folder that aren t in their corresponding master vendor directory i need to rectify that file them correctly

402178
debian	linux
however it is quite possible to install debian from within a different linux install

402185
ssd	sata
to initially have my drive recognise the ssd at all i had to change the bios option to force gen ii instead of auto for the sata controller

402185
google-chrome	firefox
there were no errors in the event log related to disk usage but watching the perfmon i could see the highest active time and the processes usually pagefile.sys being written to or google-chrome firefox caching which was correlated to the hanging

402185

i set the width height of the stage to 480 800 px

402188
width	height
i want to change the size of that window without changing the stage width height

402188

so it should be possible to change the window size to 1000x1000 without having to change the stage width height

402201
centos	linux
i d like to use a windows console application on a linux server centos 6 via wine

402201

i understand that it might need to have novel ways to process what used to be keyboard input as well as mouse input and i d like to see what s out there

or maybe do you know of a theme extension for firefox or google-chrome that puts them all on the same bar and still keeps its good looks

402434
ssd	sata
regardless if your notebook supports sata 3 or not a ssd will be a huge performance increase over a spinning platter hard drive

402438
put	get
on another pc obviously i downloaded the latest win7 drivers for my motherboard and put them on the usb stick that i was installing win7 from although this should probably work even if you install from dvd just as long as you can get to them when you browse from the error dialog

i ve been having this severe performance issue both in ubuntu 11.10 and debian wheezy

402512
disk	ram
if one process uses up a great deal of ram say 3700 mb out of 3900 mb the system quickly becomes unusable with constant disk thrashing

402516
disk	ram
disk operations are far slower than ram operations causing the system to slow down significantly

402516
disk	ram
edit because your system is low on physical memory programs need to read from the hard drive more often because free space in ram is normally used to store files frequently or recently accessed to reduce disk reading

402550
ubuntu	linux
how do i do this on linux ubuntu 11.10 to be specific

402560
notepad++	gedit
alternative is to copy from that into a text editor gedit in linux notepad++ in windows do the search and replace and copy it back

402572
rar	zip
rar and zip compression can achieve similar ratios if the input data is for example mostly nothing but a long string of the same byte

402572

ideally i would be able to run a single command within a directory that would search and remove for all files and folder with trailing whitespace and their subfolders

402655

sudo chown -r deploy deploy

402655
chown	chmod
there are a lot of similar questions on chmod command on but none on chown

402823
copying	overwrite
when copying merging large directory structures under windows is it possible to do something like yes to all but in reverse so that all existing files are not overwrite

402866

it should be on the same disk as booloader ntldr bootmgr so bootloader can pick it up early and copy to ram

402867

i d like to think that most home gear can do wire speed when just bridging not doing nat so it might be interesting to do some lan to lan lan to wlan and if the wrt54g supports it bridge-only non-nat wan to lan iperf tests plus a nat mode wan to lan iperf test to really characterize the revision of the wrt54g you have and the firmware image that s on it

google-chrome	firefox
it happens to us all windows just slows down to a grinding halt some sort of memory leak is causing it as you re a typical 132 tabs open in google-chrome 57 open in firefox 24 windows open in total doing a complex operation involving them all at the same time as you do job on top of job on top of job.....kind of guy and it gets so slow that you actually start wasting time just waiting for things to happen on your computer.....so you simply have to reset your session that s been slowly building up over the past 5 weeks and finally succumb to the nightmare that is recreating your intricate mess of windows and opened files and explorer folders after the dreaded windows restart

403720
tunnel	packets
at some point in the fairly distant future when ipv6 powers an overwhelming majority of traffic i could see a reversal of fate for ipv4 where ipv4 traffic must be encapsulated inside regular ipv6 packets and tunnel brokers serve a similar but reversed role due to the lack of broad ipv4 routing ip assignments

403724

there is not much you can do about that except to maybe get another battery and put it in a parallel connection to the motherboard

403870
filesystems	ntfs
i have an image file on my ntfs filesystems and get the following message when i try to copy to my fat32 drive

403871
filesystems	ntfs
the linux kernel was obviously very concerned about data integrity until they were confident their ntfs filesystems support was fully stable and understood

403871
filesystems	ntfs
now imagine how much harder it would be on the kernel team if windows had 3-5 other filesystems just as popular as ntfs

403871
xfs	btrfs
think ext3-4 xfs reiserfs btrfs etc.

403874
cifs	smb
you need to install and configure samba so that the windows machines can use smb cifs to access the contents of the drive

403875
filesystems	ntfs
ntfs files can hold ads alternate data streams would be transferred to other ntfs filesystems storages but will be dumped when you go to fat32 with it

samba is sharing service between ubuntu to other networks windows linux and others

403915
sudo	passwd
once you type your passwd sudo will record a timestamp and let you run more commands under sudo without having to type your passwd for a few minutes

403915

if you want to clear that timestamp so that someone else can t run sudo without a passwd you can run sudo -k

403927
vlan	packets
maybe one would be untagged native and the other would be tagged that is packets for the other network would have the vlan header on them

403973
wan	lan
connect the second router s wan interface to the main router s lan and enable dhcp on both

403984

googling for answers reveals many many different answers broken registry spyware antivirus program fragmented disk turning of visual effects etc

404633
folder	directory
as i often use total commander to browse through the files i ve first defined a hot directory entry that would point to my special folder

404633
folder	directory
so in total commander i ve defined a hot directory command to be explorer path to the special folder

404634
vim	emacs
so you can modify this in your shell init scripts .bash_profile .bashrc .profile etc but that won t work if eg you launch vim or emacs as a gui application

404652
tunnel	vpn
you can use multiple vpn connections at one time if their routes are correctly defined in the spirit of split dns or split tunnel with no overlap of their ip segments and if none of the vpn servers is configured to use vpn tunnel

404652

404755
disk	ram
i bypassed the requirements by virtualizing a computer that meets the system requirements and installing to it then using virtualbox clonehd to create a raw image which i wrote to my hard disk - this worked for bypassing the ram requirement for a time

404779
ubuntu	linux
after dual booting ubuntu alongside windows i noticed the fan would constantly run on linux and windows

404802
disk	ram
it is stuff that ought to be in ram if possible but must be put on disk either cause there isn t enough ram or because the programmers just made the program use swap to be extra careful makes things a bit slower even in last case

404808
hex	binary
if the hex editor doesn t support assembler search do the disassembly while listing the original instruction bytes so you will know for which binary bytes to search for

404820
vundle	pathogen
once you are ok with the basics of plugin management in vim you should try pathogen or vundle or some other solution

notepad++	textpad
open the most recent file probably sessionstore.js in an advanced text editor supporting regular expression search and replace for example textpad and notepad++

404833

405041
ubuntu	debian
is it a wise decision to install ubuntu related software to debian

405051
pull	push
as a result we are no longer able to pull from and push to the repository on bitbucket

405052

while theoretically it might work it can cause problems when debian and ubuntu have different versions of packages

405068
kate	nano
i just discovered that nano kwrite and kate all silently overwrite read-only files when editing as root -- even if the file permissions are 400 -r--------

405068
kate	nano
i don t see it mentioned in the nano manual here for example but i m hoping there is a way to fix this at the system level. additionally the behavior isn t limited to just a specific editor as my testing with nano kate and kwrite show

this is used for hg clone hg pull and hg push with urls

opera	google-chrome
in terms of sending blocked search results to google i m not sure how much useful data that would provide given how few opera users there are compared to google-chrome

405327
x86	64bit
check your computer s system information to see whether you need an x86 32-bit or x64 64bit version of the program and then contact the software publisher.

405371
folder	directory
to that end i m thinking about moving them inside my users folder as it is the most redundantly-backed up directory on my computer

405382
wan	lan
backs up to a centralized server over lan or wan whenever a network link becomes available or on a schedule

405382
wan	lan
supports interrupted resumed backups and hopefully file-delta only backups since connections to the network wan or lan are often slow and only open for half an hour or so

405383
rss	feed
therefore i am looking for an alternative solution to this problem and wondered if i could change the directory to which the images were downloaded on the rss feed

405387
norton	mcafee
like one that comes with mcafee or norton or avg or zone alarm that could be the issue as well

405388
mouse	keyboard
if on the other hand if your vpn client is such that you can t connect via the command line i d look into autoit or other mouse keyboard macro scripting languages to see if you can automate vpn connection

405390

boot from a live linux distribution and see if the problem persists - for example knoppix ubuntu dsl slax etc

405394

405443
pop-up	dialog
so in the file sharing dialog folder properties - sharing - advanced sharing - permissions i selected permissions allowed everything for everyone and denied everything for public but it didn t work as expected public still has full access even though the warning message that pop-up right after doing that suggests that it should actually work the order in which the permissions are applied should be allow - deny

405451
chown	chgrp
i understand what the commands chown and chgrp do however do not understand why you would want to use them apart from assigning ownership to either another user or group

405452
chown	chgrp
if i use the command chown username groupname filename to assign permissions to both a user and a group does the command have the same results when executing chgrp groupname filename

405459
chown	chgrp
if you have a bunch of files saved on a usb flash drive created on one os and need to use some of those files or all of them on another linux os you may need to run a find command and in one instance traverse down a directory tree to chown all of the files and then in another find command follow up with a chgrp command using the -exec feature of the find command in order to use the files presumably with different user and group ids so that the files can be used on both different linux oses

405466
chown	chgrp
btw chown group path file does the same thing chgrp does note the colon in front of the groupname by using chown user group path file you can do both

405508
cpu	processors
does the height of a cpu s heatsink affect the cooling of the processors

405563
folder	directory
so what you probably could do is after vmware puts the shared vms in the shared vm directory you could move the vm back to it s dedicated drive and make a symbolic link at the location and name that vmware put the shared vm and have the symbolic link point to the dedicated drive folder

405582
vmware	bootcamp
but using vmware fusion version 4 i was able to attach the acronis cd to my bootcamp virtual machine and boot from it

there is one for firefox and one for google-chrome

405832
google-chrome	firefox	hide	show
in fact both firefox and internet explorer seem to allow finer control of the position and content of headers and footers rather than just a show hide which according to forums was only introduced to google-chrome recently

405833
mouse	keyboard
it s not as efficient as the above method but autohotkey also allows much more advanced changes binding a key to a key-combo auto-replacing entered text launching a specified program with a keyboard shortcut binding gamepads to mouse keyboard inputs etc

405839
cifs	smb
update i m hoping there are some registry locations i could check that could be misconfigured in some way that might explain why smb cifs stored credentials for non-domain systems seem to be auto-invalidated in this weird way

405871
mouse	keyboard
the macbooks are set up to function when closed using an external monitor keyboard and mouse so you can plug everything in and tuck the machine out of the way

today i had to realize that some cron jobs werent run on my server

406669
tunnel	vpn
update the vpn is aep ssl tunnel

406705
disk	ram
another scenario could be that you do not have enough ram in your system therefore the os is having to refer to the swap file on the hard disk

406712
fish	bash
however while i do like bash and fish for scripting powershell s deep integration with windows services and servers makes it a more appropriate shell to use despite it s less capable interface

406718
tunnel	vpn
you want to configure split tunnel between your vpn and home network

406720
wmv	flv
at that point in time the best solution i came up with for supporting users of macs and pcs was to provide the videos in both wmv and flv formats

406720
wmv	flv
is flv + wmv + m4v the best solution

406724
vorbis	webm
the most widely-supported options are ogg vorbis theora and webm both of which will work natively on most browsers although ie requires that the relevant codec be installed on the underlying system and safari+quicktime may also require additional codec installation

406743
disk	ram
as a result when you start using them again it has to page all of that back into ram which means that for a while a few seconds to a few minutes depending on how much memory needs to be read and the speed of the disk and location of the swapfile it will be slow and sluggish

406743
disk	ram
once the memory is read back into ram from disk the system should start getting more responsive again

406748
opera	google-chrome
opera as do google-chrome also supports incognito mode by pressing ctrl+shift+n but this will come with the drawback that one cannot reopen closed tabs

406763
sudo	passwd
but it s not without problems git has to run under sudo passwd and private keys may be stored in the repository installed packages can t be meaningfully tracked and git will have a fit if i try to extend this approach to all the system s directories

406774
installation	upgrade
you could just set-up firefox sync - this will sync your bookmarks plug-ins personas etc - sounds like you are not doing an upgrade so you can set this up and then sync from the windows 7 installation and check it works ok before you ditch your old setup

406780
hash	md5
md5 message-digest algorithm 5 is a 128-bits unidirecional hash algorithm

mouse	keyboard
most of these devices support keyboard mouse storage devices etc

406852
ubuntu	mint
though i might suggest mint over ubuntu in my tests it s been slightly quicker

406857
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome do not honor last used printer under certain configurations

406861
pop-up	dialog
in addition to martã n s essential list of shortcuts which work almost everywhere you should know that in a file open or file save dialog you can press or to jump straight to a pop-up sheet that will let you type in a folder path

406873
cpu	processors
they can possess their own processors and specific faster logic systems to make for better off-loaders which will free up the system cpu s from processing network traffic

406876
cpu	irq
on x86 since it has only 1 irq line on the cpu when it receives an interrupt further interrupts are automatically disabled except for nmi reset and smi until the cpu acknowledges the interrupt source and reenables them

406882
ssd	sata
but i ve run the echo utility and transferred the hdd win7 partition 50g to the new ssd drive on sata port 1

406882
ssd	sata
i can get the ssd to boot on sata port 1 by disconnecting the hdd

406891
ssd	sata
1 sata ssd primary os disk

406892
google-chrome	firefox
these programs such as firefox and google-chrome i could just signup to and they would sync history across all my browsers

406892
folder	directory
i ended up using microsoft synctoy to copy files from the program directory to the dropbox folder

406893
macbook	bootcamp
macbook pro late 2010 using bootcamp 3.3 in windows 7 64bit all updates current as of 2012-mar-30

linux is also a problematic answer not all linux builds are meant for pcs although you could easily list 20 versions of ubuntu made for pcs

406951
opensuse	linux
i tried latest version of opensuse unlisted linux iso new syslinux but none of them booted into gnome 3.4 desktop

406967
traceroute	packets
traceroute works by sending a packets with a deliberately low ttl count

406967
traceroute	packets
the next packets sent by traceroute has an initial ttl one higher enabling it to reach one router further along the chain and get that next router to send an expiry response

406969
ubuntu	debian
install reaquired packages on debian ubuntu

406975
traceroute	packets
traceroute is a common networking utility to determine the path a packets takes to a target ip device

406982
debian	linux
the debian project and possibly other linux distributions uses the term stable and unstable to describe releases in the manner evotopid states

406983
google-chrome	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome
the turn off the lights browser google-chrome safari opera ie extension supports all websites video or no video

406986
apache	lighttpd
in my case this fixed the problem though i am not using apache but am using lighttpd in which case i had to do this to var www and set it to writable by www-data

407002
filesystems	ntfs
i installed a total of 36 gb of memory 4x8 gb + 2x2 gb onn the host windows 7 and i used imdisk to create a 32 gb ramdisk and formatted it with an ntfs filesystems

407002
disk	ram
to the newly created ram disk

407011
ati	nvidia
i have an ati and nvidia brand card

407011
ati	nvidia
both cards are also picked up in windows one being the ati and the other one as the nvidia but it says vga controller although the card only takes 2 dvi

407011
ati	nvidia
3 monitors but only 2 the hdmi ones from the ati pick up not the third one which is connected to the nvidia via dvi

407027
google-chrome	firefox	opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome
firefox google-chrome opera

407047
lan	localhost
also when your router got a packet from a host on eth0 that would have been better delivered to another host or via another router that was also on the data-link layer network in this case the ethernet lan out eth0 it could send an icmp redirect message to inform the localhost that sent that packet that it should really have sent it directly to that other host or router on the same ethernet lan

407052
google-chrome	firefox
this is how it works on firefox maybe it is the same with google-chrome

407079
bgp	ospf
routing protocols such as rip igrp eigrp ospf and bgp are used between routers to work things out such as who is routing for a subnet who s the backup and to track when routers are no longer reachable

407080
sudo	passwd	put	get
i couldn t get into the database because it kept saying i put in the wrong passwd so i looked on the internet and found that i could log onto mysql using the command sudo

407094
chown	chmod
what you are looking for are either chmod chown or setfacl

407106
disk	ram
since vm store their disk in files the host operation system may cache this files in ram and they will work noticeable faster

407124
tunnel	vpn
an encryption tunnel is set up between me and the vpn server

407132
tunnel	vpn
without knowing exactly how their vpn works i can t say for 100 certain - but with most vpn tunnel your isp will be able to tell

407132
tunnel	vpn
when you established the vpn tunnel

407132
tunnel	vpn
when you disconnected the vpn tunnel

407132
tunnel	vpn
they should not be able to see what you used the tunnel for nor what ip address the vpn endpoint assigned you

407140
ssd	sata
tried using the power and sata cable from the working drive and giving it the ones that ssd drive were using

407180
gentoo	ubuntu	gentoo	debian	gentoo	linux	debian	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	linux
you need to install a linux server..redhat ubuntu gentoo debian exc..

407234
solaris	irix
environment if irix mode is off top will operate in solaris mode

407234
solaris	irix
you toggle irix solaris modes with the i interactive command

407249
spaces	delimiter
tokens are delimiter by spaces by default

407274
sudo	passwd
if it never starts the terminal session even if you wait a few minutes the most common cause of this is that the user closed a terminal while sudo was waiting for the passwd

407278
put	get
i need to get all the sams and put them into column d all the bob bobbys into column e all the james into f ect ect

407288

407336
vpn	lan
i need vpn to access certain lan

407356
tunnel	vpn
this is called a split tunnel where not all of the traffic is routed through the vpn

407356
packets	multicast
the downside is that udp multicast packets won t be received from the remote network by the client

407368
packets	multicast
the problem is that i do not receive udp multicast packets from lan

407368
vpn	lan
i think this is probably because join group request was sent to internet instead of sending to lan via vpn

407368
vpn	lan
when internet works join group request is sent from wrong ip 192.168.1.4 - this is ip of my lan not vpn lan

407374
mouse	keyboard
the same goes for mouse and keyboard signals if you plug those devices into the switch

407442
pop-up	dialog
when saving a document in word or another office application the file appears to save but the save as dialog pop-up again

407503
filesystems	ntfs
since ntfs is a proprietary filesystems developed by microsoft you can never be certain about whether third party drivers are working properly

407503
hfs+	ntfs
as long as most of the data is still accessible on the drive try to get it off the ntfs partition and reformat it to hfs+

407517

running chown and chmod 777

407664
bluetooth	usb
i recently bought a logitech h800 headset usb bluetooth and windows just automatically routed my audio to the headset

407702
subnet	vlan
however a vlan is usually configured to map directly to a network or ip subnet which gives the impression that the layer 3 is involved

407745
dpkg	aptitude
the solution we ended up using was to use aptitude to download the .deb files and then use dpkg to install them

407764
put	get
consider buying an older laptop off of someone and put an ssd in it see what you can buy from friends family or auction sites from people who have recently upgraded their laptops and want to get rid of their own one

mouse	keyboard
one way to fix this is to shift + right-click on the taskbar button select move and then tap an arrow key on your keyboard to lock the mouse cursor to the window

407767
firefox	safari
for jailbroken iphone you could use useragent faker available in cydia and set mobile safari s user agent to firefox

not sure if this works for all rss feed but i had this problem setting up an rss feed from jira in outlook 2007 and 2010

407837
subnet	vlan
as far as i know in order to use two subnet on one physical cable vlan s are recommended

407869
google-chrome	firefox
we have tested on google-chrome and firefox

407875
ubuntu	linux
run memtest alternatively boot from an ubuntu live-cd and try the linux version of blender to see if the same behaviour happens

407883
ubuntu	linux
i have also tested with usb linux puppy linux and ubuntu linux on 8gb drives

407891
pop-up	dialog
in the web app there s frequent use of new window which pop-up which works like a dialog box for the app

407935
ubuntu	linux
your elisp code works fine on my gnu emacs 23.1.1 linux ubuntu

407955
children	parent
as said before this will only delete the parent folder keeping the children hierarchy intact

407956
udp	tcp
also what headers should be excluded if they want to do so ip tcp udp headers

407962
put	get
most home dsl modems are quite easy to get ssh into as you have the password and login information but if the isp has put in a router at your office they probably won t give you access to their router

407964
rss	feed
suggests that i open the rss feed to get the audio links

407964
rss	feed
the problem is that i can t find the rss feed anywhere just a view in itunes link

407986
inherited	properties
i doubt it can be done for not-yet-created filesystem objects as it s probably a properties of executables only and i can t see a mechanism for having it inherited on a folder

407991
rss	feed
however i ll accept any answer that shows how one can get the rss feed from itunes.com

407996
wan	lan	wan	vlan
choose the port the lan 1 port 1 and put it in the same vlan the wan w port is in

408015

there is some keyboard shortcut to open these shutdown options on windows 8 or another other way to do this without a mouse

408049
mouse	keyboard
i am still able to watch movies videos surf over the internet continually for n-amount of time without using my keyboard mouse but whenever i am trying to do something sometimes replying to certain questions on stackexchange the screen goes blank for a small amount of time and in less than 3 seconds the machine restarts

408130
disk	ram
however with 8gib of ram your system should not be reading from the disk on its own account unless you re trying to do things outside of the vm at the same time

408130
put	get
on the other hand if you re running multiple vms concurrently you ll get best performance if they re on different physical drives from each other or if you put their disk images on an ssd which is expensive but has the advantages that there s no drive head to impose seek-time costs

408151
cifs	smb
the smb cifs protocol is highly used by microsoft windows operating systems

408151
cifs	smb
windows for workgroups was the first microsoft operating system using the smb cifs and every microsoft operating system since then have come to possess the ability to function as a server or client smb cifs

408151
cifs	smb
the microsoft operating systems use smb cifs protocol for remote file operations typically the mapping network drives navigation via the network neighborhood authentication windows nt and 2000 and remote printing services

408151
cifs	smb
it is reasonable then to say that the core of microsoft s native network-based services is the smb cifs

408152
cifs	smb
smb cifs is a network protocol that allows sharing of files across a network of nodes

408158

408440
disk	ram
assume i put enough ram and a decent hard disk int here.

408456

i know i can probably make 60 cron jobs to do this but that would make it difficult if i ever needed to edit the job

408490
switching	screens
when i switching on my computer usually it shows the bios boot screens

408547
sudo	passwd	sudoers	passwd
keep the root passwd secret and use sudo to give restricted users access to just what they need see man sudoers for some examples

408552
wan	lan
pings on your external wan interface should not be affecting traffic on your lan

408552
wan	lan
unless there s hundreds of pings every second it shouldn t be causing any perceptible difference to the traffic going from your lan to your wan either

408598
sudo	passwd
try sudo mdutil â e in the terminal admin passwd required or via the spotlight preferences add the whole computer to the privacy list of excluded folders then remove it

408707
ssd	sata
one example is the bytecc bt-m252u3 which is usb3 and supports two sata 2.5 drives hd or ssd with the main drawbacks being it looks to require external power and is much bigger than a usb thumb drive

408757
ffmpeg	avisynth
many video editing programs can export the audio seperate and do not have to have a video nessisarily just like super any video converter that has some parameters could probably do it like avisynth and ffmpeg

408757
mp3	flac
program to convert flac to mp3

408773
mouse	keyboard
what rdp does is essentially send keyboard and mouse input and provide you with the screen output over a network internet connection

408773
mouse	keyboard
a larger screen capable wireless card and internet connection preferably a large full size with numpad keyboard and a good touchpad or wireless mouse would help

408889
google-chrome	firefox
windows applications identify themselves by name firefox google-chrome etc. not by a generic family type

408898
bash	zsh
3 bin sh may be symlink to bin zsh for example so yes if you mean to run bash child script from the bash main script you should explicitly say bash -c

while md5 still maintains its preimage resistance for practical purposes given the hash it is difficult to obtain the message it has a big flaw when used for authentication its quickness

409225
sudo	passwd
upon usage i face-palmed and realized that sudo needed my passwd as the admin

409225
sudoers	passwd
i ve looked into the sudoers file tried it and it hasn t worked it still prompts for a passwd for the most basic configurations

409225
chown	chmod

409397
folder	dir
if i chmod the home dir to 750 then when the user attempts to login he cannot get to his her own folder

409484
wan	lan
the router lists the mac address for the gateway as being assigned 192.168.0.110 but that ip did not work either as i imagine that is its address from its wan side not its lan side

409485

409811
put	get
the workaround is to get a non-bootable raid card and put the boot drive in the second optical bay using either the ata connection meant for a second optical drive or a sata connection from the motherboard originally intended for an internal drive but now idle because you ve switched the internal drives to the raid card

409836

i mean will there be a difference if i convert 1411kbps wav to 80kbps mp3 vbr

409840
mp3	wav
if you convert from a lossless format wav to a lossy one mp3 you will also lose data indeed this is the entire point of lossy compression removing unneeded data in order to get a reasonable file size

409861

409908
rar	zip
is there a tool we re not talking about archive tool like zip 7z rar here that i could use to unpack properly repack the firmware file

409917
mp3	wav
an mp3 stream contains info for generating a set of samples where each sample corresponds to a sample in the original lpcm data like from the wav file but a side-effect of encoding is that there is some extra junk added to each end and a side-effect of decoding is that there is even more junk added to the beginning

409917
decoder	encoder
so i would look toward making sure you use a compatible encoder decoder combo to get correct-length junk-trimmed files as output

410082
dedicated	dnsmasq
however since you want the local domain to work on the dns server computer too you will need to create a dedicated copy of resolv.conf which would be used only by dnsmasq while the original resolv.conf would point to nameserver 127.0.0.1

410082
ubuntu	debian
in particular check the debian and ubuntu guides on dnsmasq

you need a filesystems such as zfs or btrfs with block-level checksumming to protect against that

ssl	https
on the other hand it seems somewhat bizzare that your re being forced to use ssl https for a arbitrary protocol - ssh tunneling would be good enough to prevent someone from listening in if the protocol was unencrypted and is both trivial to do and relatively simple

410592
google-chrome	firefox
i can say that openssh server on all sort of unixes gives you a socksv5 proxy that putty can utilize connection- ssh- tunnels destination localhost click auto and dynamic the port you give here will be your socks proxy port in firefox google-chrome

ethernet	wireless
ethernet cable from the modem to the router and the router in the room where you need the wireless internet access

vim	emacs
what i mean is that it won t help you much to track movement and editing keys and use it as a basis for a new layout since they are easily reconfigurable in any editor worth it s salt and since we are talking about a programmer s layout we are most likely talking about vim or emacs shouldn t interfere with the placement of the literal keys and have already been optimized again we are not talking about notepad

vim	emacs
there would be a much greater effect in simply learning more about the tools once again probably vim emacs

413700
macbook	bootcamp
i have a late 2011 macbook pro with lion and bootcamp windows 7

413708
subnet	packets
so usually a host will not send a packets to the gateway if it is in the same subnet

413708
subnet	packets
so even if your host has bung rules and does send that packets to the gateway the gateway will have correct rules that say any packets with a destination on the subnet for this interface will go to that interface

413739
put	get	vpn	lan
if the host shortly later connects directly to the network or through a vpn to a different host the packet may get to the router and the router will have to put it back on the lan to get to its destination

414425
folder	directory

415137
mouse	keyboard
unfortunately unlike the installing windows question i helped you with the other day unless the bios specifically supports using a mouse only you will need to attach a keyboard to your system and use it temporarily until you have the bios set up

415137
mouse	keyboard
as a side note even with bios s that support a mouse you still likely need to press a key on the keyboard to get in to it

415137

tunnel	vpn
from what i understand the vpn administrator can either allow or disallow the split tunnel

415862
mouse	keyboard
both are free and are capable of sharing one computer s keyboard and mouse across multiple computers using only a network connection

415863
mouse	keyboard
you could use the kvm switch you suggest and just plug-in the mouse keyboard cables

415863
mouse	keyboard
or find a switch that just does keyboard and mouse - i have seen some 4 port versions but not a 16 port version

daemons	systemd
for a quick experiment check if any telnet or inet daemons are running in your systemd by listing all processes

416351
folder	directory
on one of our windows 2003 file servers somehow someone or something managed to create infinitely recurring directory trees within some of the users home folder and they can t be deleted

416351
folder	directory
trying to delete the directory tree from the system it resides on results in error deleting file or folder cannot delete file

416379
folder	directory
it s possible that whomever was working in that folder manage to create a junction point that loops back up from user.name to servername thus creating a the infinite loop directory tree

416379
filesystems	ntfs
junctions are a feature of the ntfs filesystems that lets you create a symbolic link to a directory that operates as an alias to the directory

416380
folder	dir
you see that the first two entries are marked as dir while the third a symbolic link to another folder is marked as symlinkd

ethernet	wireless
bridging between a wired ethernet link and an 802.11 wireless link is easy if you re the ap but hard otherwise

416459
ethernet	wireless
so if you want to bridge frames on someone else s behalf you either have to have both ends of the wireless link support wds so that bridging frames on behalf of non-associated devices is allowed or your have to have the wireless client perform a fake 802.11 authentication and association on behalf of any wired ethernet devices it s bridging for this is called proxy sta

416459
ethernet	wireless
they re generally called wireless ethernet bridges or wireless gaming adapters or some variant of that

416469
folder	directory
if that doesn t work extreme cases try fast folder eraser and or mass directory eraser

vsphere	sysprep	vmware	esx
i have been dealing with possibly a similar issue with sysprep under several environments with real pc s and virtuals on vmware esx vsphere

416546
udp	tcp
well an isp knows if you have a tcp or udp connection it might look into the packets and then knows if the connection is encrypted or not

416553
sha	dsa	x509	openpgp	rsa	dsa
the only thing openpgp and x509 have in common is their usage of cryptographic algorithms rsa dsa sha et cetera

416579
cpu	processors
get a nas with raid x86 processors and gigabit ethernet to have enough cpu to not be a bottleneck and the side-benefit of being able to run normal backup apps

416623
ethernet	wireless
i have both ethernet card and a wireless card i set static ip netmask for the ethernet card but sometimes i still see the symbol the one looking for an ip address on system tray

416623
vmware	virtualbox
also i installed both virtualbox and vmware three extra virtual ethernet cards

416630
hex	binary
use xxd with the -r argument and possibly the -p argument to convert from hex to plain binary octets and base64 to convert the binary octet form to base64

416665

416753
ssd	sata
buy an external 2.5 hard drive enclosure and put an ssd or plain sata drive in it and store my vm instance on it

416774
versioning	upgrade
for server though you should consider to run an lts versioning such as 10.04 or the coming 12.04 if you want the final beta and later upgrade to the real versioning

416797
put	get
i believe you should install kde 4.8 preferably install the win7.lookalike icon theme get gnomenu and put it on the panel and use the icon-only task manager plasmoid on your panel instead of the task manager

416811
ethernet	wireless
are there any cable options that could provide power to the phone and an ethernet jack back to my wireless router

416815
ethernet	wireless
since it s an emergency situation only i would tether the phone to my desktop pc and then bridge the wireless and ethernet adapters together so that the desktop would become the new gateway

416818
debian	linux
everything worked fine then i went to w8 and realized i forgot to format the last part of the drive to ntfs in debian for shared data between win and linux

416818
debian	linux
i gave up and decided to give fedora a try since i was using debian based distro before and want a bigger switch anyways installed fedora 17 beta out in a month not many bugs left deleted all linux partitions created new linux partitions and at the end of install procedure it failed to install grub again

i have 2 folder a and b in my file directory that link up to the same git repository

416872
bash	tcsh
are you experimenting using bash or tcsh

416872
bash	tcsh
if you re using tcsh you re essentially using a totally different command so you probably want to run bash and mess with cd there

416940
versioning	upgrade
so the goal is to i ll start with whatever ancient versioning of python is included with my distro and get the latest versioning of pip and virtualenv ideally with a clear and simple upgrade path for each

416953
daemon	cron
the package consists of a daemon incrond and a table manipulator incrontab analogous to the well-known crond crontab pair of cron

416992
mouse	keyboard
bob s suggestion is probably best for keyboard but if you want to use an android touchscreen device as a mouse you can use remotedroid or premotedroid

416992
screens	tablet
as i understand it you can only use the touchscreen as a laptop-style touchpad not as an actual tablet device you can t map the device to an area of the screens and draw on the tablet like a digitizer tablet but you can at least use it as a mouse substitute

417026
mouse	keyboard
currently i have one vga cable and an usb cable between the computer and the display the display also does usb hub so my mouse keyboard devices are connected permanently to the display

417066
folder	directory
this will output a list of all the files and directory and subdirectories in the folder to output.txt

417081
ubuntu	debian
having switched from ubuntu back to debian a the one thing i miss is the auto-opening on cds when inserted into the cd drive

417088
move	drag
so if i want to sync my whole 1gb documents folder i drag move make shortcut copy

417088
folder	directory
if i move it the folder is no longer in my main directory which i don t think is how it s supposed to work

417091
debian	linux
system specifics crunchbang linux a debian variant paired with openbox usb3 hard drive running on usb2 ports virtualbox

417134
filesystems	ntfs
the right-most column is the filesystems on the partition and with grep we only pick those partitions that are ntfs

417134
filesystems	ntfs
mounting an ntfs filesystems

417134
filesystems	ntfs
suppose your ntfs filesystems is dev sda1 and you are going to mount it on mymnt win do the following

417189
ready	each	folder	directory
i ve initially written a batch file to copy the templates directory and its contents over from the default user.v2 on the dc each time a user logs in but this doesn t remove the folder and its contents ready for a fresh copy

417194
filtering	grouping
that allows you to filtering back to a certain target grouping but unless you re feeling particularly masochistic and you enjoy reading frame headers you want to get the nmtopusers expert

417195
ethernet	wireless
it will issue out ethernet ip s however when it comes to laptops with wireless they are not being handled by the dhcp server

417195
ethernet	wireless
i have a wireless router connected to the modem and then everything more or less connected to the router wireless and ethernet including the server

you can determine this by booting into a livecd environment such as ubuntu or opensuse and running disk utility on the drive

417311
opera	firefox
i was experiencing problems with all flash content tried firefox chromium opera ubuntu fedora and several flash releases to no avail

417332
sudo	passwd
the purpose of sudo is to allow authenticated non-root users to run certain commands as root without knowing the root passwd

417332
sudo	passwd
if sudo bash is allowed to any user that user is root simply by virtue of knowing his own passwd

417332
sudo	passwd
if an attacker obtains the passwd of any one of the accounts which are able to do sudo bash the attacker thereby has root

417332
sudo	passwd
the proper way to do the equivalent of sudo bash obtain a root shell is su followed by giving the root passwd not your own

417336
width	height
height and width to sort by pixel size

417347
mouse	keyboard
i wanted to share the desktop s keyboard and mouse with the laptop

417347
mouse	keyboard
i did not do this and as a result my keyboard and mouse were experiencing major problems even on the master computer

417371
opensuse	linux
i run a opensuse linux version 12.1 - and all works fine

417427
filesystems	ntfs
therefore i would recommend using the ntfs filesystems with the recommended allocation unit size i believe that s 4k

417488
debian	linux
i am trying to copy data from one server to another server in linux debian using this command in putty

417559
min	max
the properties i m interested in are diameter shortest path from index page min max average degree of vertices and other properties that do not require solving a np-complete problem

tcp udp port name resolution transport layer

417562
udp	tcp
try to resolve a tcp udp port 80 to something more human readable

417562
udp	tcp
tcp udp port conversion system service wireshark will ask the operating system to convert a tcp or udp port to its well known name 80 â http

417569
vpn	lan
if this ftp solution is not inside your lan s foot print i would recommend sftp ftp over vpn or scp for moving files to and from the server

417570
google-chrome	safari
google-chrome 18.0.986.0 safari 535.15

417627
bash	zsh
before that i used bash with a lot of custom stuff and i am only missing one thing because zsh is trying to be too smart

417659
width	height
that s width columns x height rows + xoffset + y offset

417692
ubuntu	opensuse
what you may want to consider instead is booting into a livecd environment such as ubuntu or opensuse

417697
antivirus	norton
5 you have some sort of bogus rogue antivirus software that is overprotective such as norton

417704
vmware	virtualbox
i thought vmdk is for vmware though in most cases virtualbox can use it but not always

417706
folder	directory
for the global variable path you will need to add new directory entries for each folder which contains items such as mysql and svn you want to have available globally

417771
vmware	virtualbox
thousands of people use virtualbox anyway without ill effects myself included. if you re looking for a virtualization tool that supports linux guests and whql-signed host drivers i believe vmware is your best bet since microsoft s own virtualpc tool doesn t support non-windows guests.

417792
sudo	passwd
usually when i run sudo it will ask me to enter a passwd the first time and it will remember that i m authenticated for the next few minutes until that authentication times out

417797
screens	tablet
of course if you could get your os to recognise your screens overlay as a tablet that may help

417801
move	drag
select and drag to move a point

417804
folder	directory
update i realize there is more to it than apache httpd not serving the files correctly - sometime when i create a new folder on the host the entry is shown as a bunch of question marks when doing a directory listing in the shell of the guest

417809
vpn	lan
you want to setup a vpn server on the company lan which is also accessible from the internet

417809
vpn	lan
external machines would use a vpn client to connect to the vpn server and the vpn server would forward packets to other machines on the company lan

417809
vpn	lan
the only catch is that you need the response packets from the lan machines to go to the vpn server -- this can either be done by configuring the router or configuring all the machines the former being easier

417810
folder	directory
i d like to copy all files recursively but in the destination folder i d like to squash the directory structure

417823
putty	winscp
however now i ve lost my putty and winscp configurations because they are stored in the registry

417823
putty	winscp
i figured out how to load a hive from my old profile and exported the winscp and putty branches

417843
stdout	stderr
the will redirect both stdout standard-out and stderr standard-error to output.txt

417858
hash	whirlpool
both sha-512 and whirlpool are 512 bit hash while ripemd-160 is 160 bits

417858
pbkdf2	hash
truecrypt uses these hash with pbkdf2 to derive keys

417863
ubuntu	linux
i want to install ubuntu on seperate hard drive then my current win 7 and i want to dual boot either linux or windows when i start my pc

417870
udp	tcp
tcpview for example gives you real-time monitoring of tcp udp sockets filemon can show you activity related to file accesses .

417943
post	get
shutdown in windows 8 is really a form of hibernation which means you will not get access to the bios functions on power up it will post but goes directly to the hibernate file to boot up

417967
filesystems	ntfs
this is not really a trivial task - this is one example with a linux filesystems that uses a badblocks file to create a set of clusters marked bad and the equivilent for windows which uses a low level ntfs editor to edit filesystems metadata see the appendixes

417981
versioning	upgrade
i also upgrade my ff to versioning 12.0 current â â no difference

418018
starttls	smtps
if it does not work try giving the same server for both imap and smtps and configure smtps to use port 587 starttls normal password

418045
freebsd	linux
is it worth attaching the hdd into linux or freebsd computer without mounting it and dd the whole hdd into one image

418052
opensuse	linux
however i have a linux installation as well opensuse 12.1 and i thought i could make that mouse work for both system since both of them shares the same bluetooth receiver

418076
crypt	hash
there is a true crypt setting and then dropbox does a block hash and uploads your 1gb container in seconds

418103
cpu	processors
you need to go to the motherboard manufacturers site and examine the product page and view the support cpu list for that board to know what processors are supported for that board

418106
avr	microcontroller
there is an example of an 8bit avr microcontroller running a 32bit linux kernel using an emulator

418111
post	get
if this does not get a post try removing the memory module s and re-seat them if this does not help and you have more than 1 memory module installed try each memory module one at a time

418120
google-chrome	firefox
now i get a redirection to in google-chrome as well however the site works on firefox

418133
kindle	nook
one more thing worth noting if you primarily want a portable device for reading you should also consider getting a reader with an e-ink screen like the kindle or nook

418165
ubuntu	linux
the rocketfish rf-hd3025 usb 3.0 2.5 sata hard drive enclosure which is a very nice looking product appears to be incompatible with linux at least it does not work with ubuntu 12.04 and a thinkpad laptop

418178
disk	ram
however on many windows systems the scanning seriously pollutes the main store and disk management mechanisms hogging ram creating long i o queues etc

418178
norton	mcafee
in my experience norton is halfway well-behaved only pollutes the system moderately while mcafee doesn t pause nicely when you re using the system and thus causes the system to behave poorly for the roughly 24 hours required to scan even a relatively small 200g laptop system and kaspersky though it seems to pause at least some of the time leaves the system badly polluted

418178
norton	mcafee
so to answer the op s original question i don t believe that there s any major av product at least not norton mcafee or kaspersky last i checked that allows you to disable background scanning

418228
wav	flac
flac is a method to compress pcm wav without loss

418234
pop-up	dialog
if you re lucky some other menu will drop down or some obvious change will occur some dialog will pop-up or the text style at your insertion point will change leading you to find what control is sharing the alt-o accelerator

418238
versioning	upgrade
i have win 7 home when i upgrade ie from versioning 8 to 9 it not display any content but a black page what s the problem

418241
versioning	upgrade
we currently have linux mint installed on a number of devices and would like to upgrade the versioning of libreoffice installed 3.4.4 to the latest versioning of 3.5.2 however upon running the command it returns the versioning 3.4.4

418241

i also downloaded a tar gzip package of libreoffice from the official website however having gone through the readme it is recommend that i use the package manager that comes with debian or ubuntu derivatives

418255
debian	linux
i need to boot a debian linux installed on sd card

418259
munin	cacti
my favourites are cacti and munin

can still use fvwm instead of something else like kde or gnome

418277
vmware	virtualbox
i m using virtualbox and have tried vmware on a windows 7 host with an ubuntu server guest

418277
folder	dir
i ve set up folder sharing in virtualbox so that my ubuntu server home dir is a mount of my windows 7 home dir so that i have access to the same files regardless of which os i m in

418300
spyware	norton
i scanned the computer using mbam norman tdds killer norton super anti spyware symantec root kit killer and from ubuntu with clamav but none of them found a virus

418302
vmware	esx
if the time on the esx is different from the time you are trying to set and if the vmware tools are configured to sync the time that will indeed be the reason

418335
cpu	processors
s1 all processors caches are flushed and the cpu s stop executing instructions

418345
dropbox	skydrive
after the recent 25 gb update i wanted to sync my pictures with skydrive as i finally have enough space my almost 10 gb dropbox is full with other data and i need more than 10 gb for my pictures alone

418401
mouse	keyboard
i have a recent issue with a keyboard mouse combo

418401
mouseup	mousedown
some keystrokes and mousedown mouseup events are ignored

418401
mouse	keyboard
first i thought that since this is a cordless keyboard mouse combo there is an issue with radio signal especially since what i observe is very close to what would happen if the receiver is too far away from the keyboard mouse or if something in the middle is blocking the signal

418401
mouse	keyboard
windows was installed months ago while the issue with the keyboard mouse is recent two weeks

418401
mouse	keyboard
there are no special drivers for keyboard mouse to install reinstall

418401

418455
voip	sip
an spa3102 is meant to connect analog phones to a voip service essentially turning the analog phone into a sip phone

418490
spaces	delimiter
this is because a filename can contain any character except and the null character and ls does not use either of those characters as delimiter so if a filename has a spaces or a newline you will get unexpected results

418535
google-chrome	firefox
you can make it easy for the thief to be distracted by installing 3 web browsers firefox internet explorer and google-chrome and a bunch of freeware games and they are all on the desktop

418552

418682
folder	directory
in terms of whether there should be dummy versions - in order for your init scripts to mount them those directory will need to exist as empty folder

418718

419022
lvm	mdadm
say that i create the raid using mdadm with 4 drives using raid5 then make an lvm volume

419022
umount	mdadm
if i add it using mdadm --grow then after that is done i still have to umount and resize the ext3 filesystem

419022
umount	mdadm	lvm	mdadm	lvm	umount
i thought if i used lvm on top of mdadm it would be unnecessary to umount and wait for the resize which takes forever with a 5tb raid

419022
lvm	mdadm
i have done this before without using lvm using just mdadm --grow then i think resize2fs

affinity	processors
the easiest way to do this is by setting the processors affinity for a given process or telling the os which logical cpus cores that process is allowed to run on

419426
affinity	processors
sadly there s no easy way to remove all processes from a certain processors or to automatically set a specific mask on a process when it starts up-- you ll need a script to monitor for new processes on the system and set the appropriate affinity that you desire

419435
temp	tmp
temp and tmp point to existing directories with no lfn names no broken variables with nulls or such and while the path is long it has been such for some time

chgrp	chmod	folder	directory
if you want a stranger sniffing your network to be able to delete everything in a folder just give new user write permission on that directory typically by changing the group of the directory to one that new user belongs to chgrp groupname directoryname then setting permissions chmod g+w directoryname note that this may cause problems with other applications and is inadvisable for any directory outside user s home directory unless you really know what you are doing

421565
gentoo	ubuntu
i am running a gentoo guest on an ubuntu host

421565
disk	ram
if the process was disk bound then i believe a second run of the video would have improved the host-to-guest cpu usage ratio as the video would have been fetched to the main memory the video is approx 1 minute 40 mb and the guest ram is 4 gigs but that does not happen

421572
move	drag
the drag drop inspector which comes with processexplorer of course doesn t work because you can t move the mouse to another session -

421819
google-chrome	firefox
i think google-chrome firefox are good enough for common use

421819

i store my music on a network share and was annoyed that music programs default to using the hidden userprofile music directory which is the default location for the magic my music folder

422377
folder	directory
it appeared to work and my music player -- which had automatically added the my music folder to its list of directory to watch -- began indexing the music on my nas share

422377
folder	directory
change the magic my music folder back to a local directory so i can try this again

422402
width	height
dpi is dots per inch ppi is points per inch or pixels per inch. those ratios increase and decrease based on the resolution width x height in pixels and size in inches of a given medium

422404

ubuntu	linux
i was running 512 mb ram with ubuntu linux and that ran smoothly playing minecraft

422718
robocopy	xcopy
you could use a more sophisticated tool like xcopy or robocopy that can operate on hidden files

422720
folder	directory
while it s probably okay to keep a git repository inside a dropbox folder the problem is that multiple systems will be sharing a working directory and an index if you keep them there

422720
pull	push
if you want to use dropbox to keep git repositories in sync i would recommend keeping a bare repository in dropbox then pull from and push to it from separate repositories

422720
pull	push
when you make commits you want to share you would use git push dropbox master in one repo and git pull dropbox master in the other

423498
bash	subshell	subshell	ifs
the issue is that using cat in a subshell substitution like this will make bash tokenize the output according to ifs which by default includes spaces

423520
ethernet	wireless
and assuming you buy a high-quality simultaneous dual-band ap it should have enough cpu horsepower to move packets at full line rate on both wireless interfaces and its wired ethernet interfaces all at the same time

423522
tunnel	vpn
for a website to tunnel through the vpn it s ip address or subnet needs to have an entry in the routing table on the client computer

423608
cpu	processors
you can t say you have 6 3ghz cpu but you can say that in theory you processors can go 6300000000 cycles per second but frequency stays at 2 1ghz for individual cores 2100000000 cycles per secod

423623
gentoo	ubuntu
you can probably pick up gentoo s lesspipe.sh and put it on your ubuntu system without much hassle

so it seems reasonable to ask is there a firefox modification branch that has multiprocess sandbox support ready to run each plugin instance for a tab in sandbox

423784
direct3d	directx
if somebody could give a lengthy and in-depth explanation or a link to an article as to why opengl never took off but instead direct3d directx became dominant in the gaming sector it d be much appreciated

423784
direct3d	directx
i mean before direct3d directx and opengl established themselves glide and voodoo gpus were the gpu to have if one wanted 3d

423788
unix	bsd
arp in most linux unix bsd distros

423801
folder	directory
assuming that your hard drive is mounted with the same drive letter always you can move picasa2 and picasa2albums from directory to external hard drive and create links to them in that folder named correspondingly

423833
ethernet	wireless
if you have a second computer you could plug it on the router s ethernet lan ports and run a sniffer on that too at the same time to see if my hypothesis of an arp broadcast visible on the lan but not on the wireless has some merit

423841
ubuntu	linux
otherwise i prefer unix-like environment particularly ubuntu linux

423856
disk	ram
dvd ram drives or any reasonably modern dvd drives should have no issues with dvd+ dvd- or any other common disk types - if you had an early dvd reader you d have issues- and all dvd ram disk capable drives are new enough to support most common disk types

423881
folder	directory
this will make the host folder that you named shared accessible as the directory mnt c on the linux guest

423891
ssd	sata
save to sata ssd via fmc daughter card which i can buy

423894
cpu	processors
the reason they were historically excluded from cpu isas is because they re not useful for most traditional general-purpose computing tasks like running oses or word processors surfing the web reading email etc. which rely on sisd or perhaps misd instructions

423898
folder	directory
one can locate repositories by looking for a folder named repodata in its root this directory holds all the metadata for the repository

if your mouse doesn t work either don t blame the keyboard

424024
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	mp4	h.264	mp4	webm	h.264	webm	firefox	safari
there is no single codec format that works in every browser but if you generate h.264 in mp4 and vp9 in webm with the respective audio codec you will have support for google-chrome firefox safari and some versions of ie

424024
vorbis	webm
webm vp9 vorbis

424024
mp4	h.264
mp4 h.264 aac

424048
subnet	packets
where as a packets destined for 192.168.1.33 would use it s most specific route 192.168.1.0 24 this isn t the best possible route for that subnet just the best route we have at the moment

424071
subnet	packets
when we talk about wireshark and others capturing packets from the same subnet will i be able to capture all the data of 10.0.0.0 8 or only 10.0.2.0 24

424072
subnet	packets
when we talk about wireshark and others capturing packets from the same subnet will i be able to capture all the data of 10.0.0.0 8 or only 10.0.2.0 24

424072
subnet	packets
you might also see extra packets flying around if there are other subnet on the same physical network but this isn t guaranteed

424075
opera	firefox
i am an ex-user of firefox that has recently migrated to opera next 12.00 beta 64-bit linux edition and would like to make this available

424236
rar	zip
select rar or zip

424240
mouse	keyboard
i ve got a wireless keyboard and a mouse a4tech 6100f on debian

424254

the number of clock ticks per unit time how many decimals of pi it can calculate per unit time how often it needs replacement and its angular velocity when you throw the processors around like a frisbee are all frequencies of your cpu

424284
putty	winscp
you could use putty to uncompress on the host but it s simpler to simply transfer your folder and let winscp handle all the file copies

424291
filesystems	ntfs
however it is not recommended to use ntfs or any other fuse filesystems for the linux root partition due to the added complexity

424295
installation	upgrade
just upgrade my win7-32 computer by adding a new hard drive new memory and a new installation of win7-64

i would put all of the required software on a web server on your network tar archive or rpms and get it with wget

424401
hfs+	ntfs
it should not be different for ntfs fat32 hfs+ ext2 3 4 etc

424432

424440
centos	linux
so i have a dozen of centos linux servers

424444
hash	md5
i was seeing a video on how to hash passwords with md5 hashing

424450
hash	md5
md5 is a one way hash

424455
filesystems	xfs
gparted does support shrinking partition but you have to make sure your filesystems itself supports it as some of them don t xfs and jfs for example

424456
public	protected
password protected streams or just not public stream

424459
ubuntu	linux
teseract seems to have the best results but again some of these tools are not supported well in modern versions of ubuntu though if you can set it up and fix the problem i had where the image layer not matching the text-matching layer with tesseract then you would have a pretty workable solution and once again linux windows

424461
hash	md5
this is safer but remember the same password will always hash to the same md5

424480
salt	md5
md5 salt+password where salt is unique per user and stored in clear that requires the attacker to generate a rainbow table for each password he wants to crack

424532
udp	tcp
in tcp and some udp connections the router will look at the source and destination ports to create a nat translation table to map the real ip address and port to the natted ip address and port

424543

424802
centos	linux
is there a way to achieve this in centos linux

424810
ethernet	wireless
it s also possible to accomplish this kind of thing if the devices are physically connected over ethernet cables which reduces any bandwidth reduction from wireless repeater not wireless client mode

424813
folder	directory
the fixup.sh script will be the shell commands that will move the top-level files and directory into a clean folder in this instance the folder called cleanup

424817
google-chrome	safari
in safari google-chrome this does not happen the link properly goes to home write-journal

424846

ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	linux
i had loud fan noise too upon a new install of linux mint 13 an ubuntu derivitive but when i install the additional drivers in the form of the nvidia video driver the fan speed goes back down to normal volume i can hardly hear it now

428614
sudo	passwd
sudo executes the command with higher privileges and will ask for your passwd before it lets the command be executed

428634
versioning	upgrade
however if you have an older versioning of this software that feature may not be available at which point you will have to upgrade the software to get this feature

428643
daemons	systemd
the print queue is the visible part of the printer service daemons that was originally a program called spool for simultaneous peripheral operations on-line such as for the hasp os360 operating systemd running on ibm 360 mainframes

428643
ethernet	wireless
since more data than just the text for the page that is the complete page in pdl form has to be sent to the printer older interfaces such as the centronics parallel port and rs-232 serial have been replaced by usb and ethernet wired and wireless

428643
disk	ram
unless you really have a print server with mass storage a hard disk drive the network printer really cannot accept a complete or multiple documents unless they are all small enough to fit in the printer s ram

428643
ready	each
note that it would only know of requests and not hold any page data that is still on each pc until the printer is ready to begin that job

428656
google-chrome	firefox
if i download something in google-chrome or in firefox and then click on that file to open it it opens in emacs

428737
post	get
you d need to get a board that takes in a composite input and output to lvds - which probably exists - try the comments of this hackaday post for ideas - they suggest a company called njytouch

428740
filesystems	hfs
they are all errors related to the filesystems on the disk having inconsistencies and or corruption - the details are somewhat unimportant unless you want to go read the hfs spec and write some code around fixing it

428746
spyware	antivirus
i tried to defragment the disk and do a virus spyware scan with antivirus but still the welcome screen comes along

428755
put	get
once the podcasts are on my computer i can select to put only the ten most recent unlistened to synch to my iphone but what if i want to only download the ten most recent -- the question is how do i do less than get all but more than selecting a single one or two episodes of a particular podcast

428801
stdout	stderr
i recently had a similar experience where a script had stalled it turned out that script called was performing a mv command and waiting for a confirmation if a file not owned by the current user should be removed but i couldn t see that message because unfortunately the programmer of that script had decided to redirect stdout and stderr

428802
stdout	stderr
in unix and others there are typically two output streams you want to use stdout and stderr

428802
stdout	stderr
similarly you can redirect stderr to stdout

428835
dropbox	skydrive
on windows 7 i use both dropbox and skydrive desktop apps to sync my files

the system acts like it can t find the drive because the bios post messages get to

429111
cpu	processors
minimum and maximum processors state is the percentage of cpu speed of which it will run at

429111
cpu	processors
edit each cpu has a number of processors state we can not set the cpu other than these cpu states

429121
ubuntu	linux
on my wireless network i can tracepath to a mac using mtu of 1500 on ubuntu linux 12.04

429121
mtu	icmp
update if i tracepath to google.com i can see my router on its wan link reply with icmp packets stating that fragmentation is needed and subsequent frame mtu needs to be 1474

429134
netcat	stty
note that the stty and netcat commands must be run together otherwise the shell itself would likely reenable it when displaying its prompt.

429156
put	get
you may as well take it indoors if you can but if for some reason you must leave it in the car at least put it under the seatâ maybe in the trunk but under the seat is better since the trunk can get hot and under the seat is closer to the cooler ground

429159
mouse	keyboard
i am using microsoft ironic wireless mouse 5000 and microsoft wireless keyboard 3000

429165
range	minimum
minimum and maximum processor state control the range within which windows varies the clock speed

429165
cpu	processors
for example assume that your cpu is capable of 0 to 2.4 ghz meaning that your maximum processors speed is 2.4 ghz

429203
ethernet	wireless
my question is if i connect two or three computers via gigabit ethernet will i be throttling the connection speed by tunneling that connection through a single wireless adapter

429233
disk	ram
a boot sector or boot block is a region of a hard disk floppy disk optical disc or other data storage device that contains machine code to be loaded into random-access memory ram by a computer system s built-in firmware

429234
ubuntu	linux
once you have usb-creator.exe run it and follow the same steps as described for linux point it at your .iso file or your ubuntu cd-rom point it at your usb flash drive make sure you have the right device selected then make startup disk

429307
jobs	cron
i want to create some alias for cron jobs

429311
folder	directory
is there a way i can automatically have that folder and all sub folder removed and have all the files in the one parent directory

429326
cpu	processors
2 i m using tmonitor to monitor the cpu clock speed and wprime to push the processors to the maximum allowed speed

429332
wan	lan
i can succesfully wake my server over the wan or lan using wol

429345

utorrent simply displays this for all file types check the do not show this again box and hide it

429383
ubuntu	debian
i am thinking about setting up a modest web server using some old hardware and ubuntu 12.04 or debian 6

429386
ubuntu	linux
if you end up using bitpim then there are some workarounds that may help get it working under linux both ubuntu and fedora

429392
ubuntu	debian
one important thing to note is that you must have a look at your logs to keep an eye on them easily install logwatch should be in your default repositories on debian ubuntu to alert you by mail daily or weekly

429392
tunnel	vpn
if your sites require mysql or for any other reason you need to administer mysql or another database from internet if you don t use a vpn use a ssh tunnel so you connect to a local port on your machine and the tunnel encrypts the connection to the server so you don t need to open the database port have a look at the -l and -d arguments in man ssh

429418
ubuntu	linux
not sure what you need to make it a game server but if it is available for linux you are all set as it runs on a fedora base soon to add ubuntu

429440
macbook	bootcamp
my setup my usb stick was created by apple s bootcamp assistant using x64 windows consumer preview for my triple-boot macbook air that boots using efi loader and then grub for win linux.

429445
google-chrome	firefox
since newer versions of google-chrome and firefox both use at least version 3.7.0 of sqlite you may be able to set wal mode on your local storage database and it ought to persist when google-chrome and firefox start using it

429478
ubuntu	debian
the problem is that i can t install a full desktop just for this application my os is debian and ubuntu cli

429487
ubuntu	linux
i m setting up an ubuntu linux server on an old machine i have at home never done this before and am starting to get things working how i d like

429511

mouse	keyboard
i just started using this from iogear at work to share two monitors keyboard mouse between two computers

429520
mouse	keyboard	hid	keyboard
hid v1.10 keyboard hid-compliant mouse hid-compliant mouse on

429520
mouse	keyboard
i noticed that on some descriptions it s marked as keyboard and others mouse

429532
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu is setup for linux use not windows use so we need to install a package that will allow ubuntu to more readily mix in with windows networks and use netbios

429545
for-loop	loops
the codes does a series of computation inside a for-loop and dumps the output whenever where i is loops variable and n is a constant

429558
switching	screens
screens has a ctrl-a ctrl-a to switching between two latest windows

429570
tunnel	packets
it appears that some isps also use deep packets filtering to discover ssh tunnel which are then bandwidth limited--luckily my isp in my apartment does not appear to do this presently

429592
vsto	add-in
i have developed an outlook add-in using vsto 4.0 in vs 2010

429625
opentype	woff
yes the woff format is a container for the table-based sfnt structure used by truetype and opentype

429655
folder	directory
i do believe i remember reading something about excluding everything else from being copied from the level directory except the folder that one wants to copy but though it should work doesn t seem practical

429666
sudo	passwd
this is the same passwd i specify when using sudo command

429673
mouse	keyboard
otherwise you can get a kvm switch to change over the keyboard mouse and monitor between computers all at once there are probably variants that only change the monitor as well

429675
sudo	passwd
also the passwd you type when using sudo is the passwd of your own user not root

429675
sudo	passwd
you can change the root passwd using sudo passwd

429688
folder	directory
i have a command setup in the registry as a folder association so i can shift + right-click any folder and open a vs2010 prompt there instead of having to open a command prompt and then cd to the directory i m working in

429717
ubuntu	linux
i have been setting up my computer for work which runs linux ubuntu and we use a lot of programs etc

429717
ubuntu	linux
linux ubuntu 12.04

i want to install linux ubuntu on my computer for now

429744
ubuntu	linux
where one have windows and second have linux ubuntu

nas	qnap
on my nas qnap ts 509 i do have a technical issue

429775
filesystems	xfs
fuse-xfs is a macfuse osxfuse driver for xfs filesystems

429775
filesystems	xfs
this driver allows mac os 10.7 with osxfuse macfuse to mount xfs filesystems in read only mode

429775
filesystems	xfs
this software should be considered alpha and provides no guarantees that the xfs filesystems remains unaltered although the code does not support writing in any way

429776
chown	sudo
sudo chown deltik dtkbktemp to give me username deltik rights to the partition

429795
ssd	sata
i have an hdd and a ssd the ssd being on the mini-pci-express interface while the hdd is on a usual sata 2 interface

429795
filesystems	ntfs
i have windows 7 on the ssd and ubuntu on the hdd + free space on the hdd in ntfs filesystems to store files from the windows partition

429797
mouse	keyboard
2 there is a free program called synergy out there that everyone who runs multiple side-by-side computers should at least know about--allows you to easily share keyboard and mouse although it is really made for multiple monitors so it may not be for you but still you should know about it it s fantastic

429799
temp	tmp
change the tmp and temp environment variables for both the user and the system to c temp then reboot

429819
width	height
i m trying to resize my safari browser to be a specific height width

429831
bmp	pbm
however character recognition converters usually only allow image files pbm bmp jpg

429845
width	height
for example if you only want to resize the height leave the width blank and enter a value for the height

429848
sudoers	passwd
use the ubuntu installation cd choose the rescue a system option and then drop into the shell of the target system to change the passwd of the user s or modify the etc sudoers to your liking

429848
sudoers	passwd
boot into single user mode and modify the passwd or etc sudoers

429860
move	drag
to move the files simply select them and drag drop or cut paste them to the target folder

429873
folder	directory
it needs to be in the root directory because there is no place in the boot loader to accommodate for a folder location or even another drive

429909
robocopy	xcopy
along with xcopy it s superseeded by the new and improved robocopy

429912
dreamweaver	fireworks
open applications adobe fireworks cs5 configuration html code dreamweaver slices.xtt and locate the following line line 662

429925
folder	directory
it also presumes the home directory is where your user folder are so adjust accordingly if not

429938
ethernet	wireless
they should also both connect to the same bridged ethernet network that is if ap1 is doing nat and dhcp service then ap2 should be just a bridge so that clients of ap2 s wireless service still use ap1 s nat and dhcp services

429945
temp	tmp
my user variables only define temp and tmp

429946
kde	gnome
reading the source of emacs auth-source.el show that it can do quite complex thing in particular you could use m-x customize-variable auth-sources to choose different way to specify login mdp to emacs including gnome and kde stuff

429959
folder	directory
its a little bit wierd in that it actually sticks folder for the files full path in so if encode from c users me music and output to c users me music2 you ll end up with c users me music2 users me music as the effective output folder but it does the job and preserves directory structure

429966
twitter	myspace
by default autopager works with a ton of sites including lifehacker the new york times digg ebay amazon yahoo youtube flickr live msn myspace wikipedia ebay taobao twitter and of course google

430044
chown	sudo
sudo chown -r myuser

430049
filesystems	xfs
fuse-xfs is a macfuse osxfuse driver for xfs filesystems

430049
filesystems	xfs
this driver allows mac os 10.7 with osxfuse macfuse to mount xfs filesystems in read only mode

430049
filesystems	xfs
this software should be considered alpha and provides no guarantees that the xfs filesystems remains unaltered although the code does not support writing in any way

430060
vmware	virtualbox
i tried virtualbox and vmware but they both have this issue with non-hardware-virtualization processor

430060
xen	openvz
i thought maybe another virtualization system may help like openvz or xen or kvm

430060
xen	openvz
won t openvz or xen or kvm work

430102
vorbis	webm
the problem is that webm format seems to be more picky than matroska with respect to the vorbis stream it can contain

430112
folder	directory
you will need to go to the install directory of the vmware workstation folder

430156
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
installed and tried other browsers firefox google-chrome apart from safari

430205
logmein	hamachi
using logmein hamachi you can have a small server even atom based setup at each of your remote locations

430205
logmein	hamachi
the gateway network from logmein hamachi would basically be just like you were there in that office plugged into their network

430206
google-chrome	firefox
firefox was able to successfully save the history of that field and google-chrome still works with 99 of other fields

430246
disk	ram
as the amount of data you are using raises the importance of disk access speed and ram grows

430304
disk	ram
this way the dictionary that was just read stays in memory for the next set of hashes and the next read occurs from ram not disk

430315
rmdir	mkdir
back in the old old days there were no rmdir 2 and mkdir 2 system calls we re discussing 7th edition unixâ here and rmdir 1 was of necessity a suid root program that used the unlink 2 system call to remove directories

430315
rmdir	mkdir
it seems reasonable to have a command rmdir 1 to undo what mkdir 1 did

430315
rmdir	mkdir
plus they are these days simple exercisors of the the rmdir 2 and mkdir 2 system calls mdash

430367
google-chrome	firefox
this also applies to google-chrome which leaves firefox as the only browser that i have that can browse external sites

430378
bluetooth	usb
for example such a device that gets data sent to it by wi-fi network or bluetooth and resends it to the usb

430378
bluetooth	usb
i have a bluetooth usb but i think it can t work without a driver

430404
folder	directory
in the root directory of your working copy there is now a single .svn folder with a sqlite database

430407
versioning	upgrade
rather than downloading and creating disks for however many different isos exist basic pro ultimate 32-bit 64-bit upgrade full versioning and testing each one until one works is there a way i can discover what the key is for specifically

430426
cpu	processors
however according to the product cpu support list the core i5-3570k and other 3rd generation intel core processors are listed note that the 3570k is 22nm

430466
stdout	stderr
i would like to be able to redirect stdout and stderr to different pipes at the same time

430475
stdout	stderr
unfortunately this can only redirect stdout or stdin or combined not stderr by itself due to limitations in the pipe operator | in the windows command prompt

430475
stdout	stderr
this provides the desired effect of one console window to watch stdout and provide stdin and another to watch stderr

430485
sudo	passwd
the second version might work with some conditions sudo should not be asking for a passwd and amcli should be in path not root s path which is probably set when you type sudo su - but your path because sudo uses your path

430489
filesystems	ntfs
all filesystems are ntfs

430513
udp	tcp
http is your preferred option unless http is the option that failed then tcp then udp as a last resort

430519
vmware	virtualbox
i have tried vmware 7 and virtualbox but both give me the same error

430527
sudo	passwd
a better solution is to set up sudo so that your user is allowed to execute full path to amcli without providing a passwd

430536
x86	64bit
btw i installed this hp1010 with universal printer at win7 64bit and also made it work as shared printer at remote win7 32bit machines by including x86 drivers too in 64bit driver

430555
profiling	debugging
it s primary usage is for profiling debugging but it can be used just to constrain bad behaving apps

430571
google-chrome	firefox
is it possible to make google-chrome works more like firefox and spell check the entire text field automatically

430576
pop-up	dialog
in an email and emailing it your gmail account - you won t see any pop-up dialog when you open the email

430651
folder	directory
i want to iterate the folder change the working directory to the current folder and make some processing with the appropriate set of files

430660
google-chrome	firefox
install firefox or google-chrome make sure flash works and tell her to use it instead of ie

430663
installation	upgrade
check out rescue a windows 2000 installation with an in-place upgrade for more info

430679
installation	upgrade
is there any way i can upgrade to 64 bits with no new installation

430685
folder	directory
set home c rsync --- i moved my pub and private keys for ssh folder and files to this directory and made sure the security was set to everyone for this folder on the box running this because the task is run as a service account not the admin

430698
mouse	keyboard
what works for me is to use the arrow keys on the keyboard rather than the mouse to move the motion paths

430700
antivirus	norton
beforehand scanned the hard drive with malwarebytes microsoft security essentials and norton antivirus on separate computers

430738
tunnel	vpn
except if they are explicitly banned every vpn ip. also this will tunnel everything on your computer

430750
ssd	sata
but with my 20gb ide drive i don t see a point in buying an ssd for a simple file server or trying to buy an adapter kit to convert sata to ide

430774
filesystems	fat
note fat is not a separate filesystems but a common part of the msdos umsdos and vfat filesystems.

430774
umask	mount
never the less you should actually read the manpages about mount groups and umask because i cannot guarantee for the above to work

430792
google-chrome	firefox
i am currently using firefox but i am also happy with google-chrome

430795
google-chrome	firefox
firefox needs an extension for using user scripts but google-chrome has the ability built-in

430807
folder	directory
i already trying running only the core of vim disabling my .vim .vimrc and also the plugin and autoload folder on the vim runtime directory

430821
temp	tmp
open the folder tmp defaults to localappdata temp in windows 7 and userprofile local settings temp in xp

430827
google-chrome	firefox	opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome
i tried it on windows in firefox google-chrome opera and ie

430857
mouse	keyboard
after my computer shuts down i still have the power to the keyboard and mouse

430857
mouse	keyboard
this causes both the keyboard and mouse to have lights that remain lit while the system is off

430861
mouse	keyboard
you can also check your bios to see if you are able to disable a setting that allows your system to be awake via keyboard or mouse signal

430884
google-chrome	firefox
when i m in xp shiftboard.com or any variations of that url won t load in either firefox or google-chrome

430888
sudoers	visudo
use visudo to edit etc sudoers never edit this file directly -- if you make a mistake you will completely lock yourself out

430889
sudo	passwd
otherwise sudo requires that users authenticate themselves with a passwd by default note in the default configuration this is the user s passwd not the root passwd

430889
sudo	passwd	sudoers	passwd
once a user has been authenticated a time stamp is updated and the user may then use sudo without a passwd for a short period of time 5 minutes unless overridden in sudoers

430892
google-chrome	firefox
perhaps there is something wrong with the configuration of firefox and google-chrome such a proxy settings

430951
width	height
set the marquee width and height to specific values

430997
bash	subshell
if you re diffing non-files subshell fifos in bash all you need to do is redirect the non-files content into files and run the graphical tool on that

431010
traceroute	vlan	ubuntu	linux
i have a strange issue with linux hosts running kernel 3.x e.g fedora 16 ubuntu 11.10 i am unable to ssh and traceroute only tests done currently hanging when travelling over a vlan network partition

431035
put	get
if you can get an intermediate router between your internet connection and your lan and put dd-wrt on it you could use this guide to monitor http requests with it

431063
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari
if it this is not possible at all in firefox then the next best would be a solution for the first of the following browsers for which it is at all possible google-chrome safari ie opera

431104
mtu	upnp
router settings such as mtu beacon interval upnp .

431109
x86	mips
ext 2 3 4 are the same filesystem on an arm x86 x64 ia64 ppc mips or any other cpu

431124
switching	screens
i know an older version of chrome had a command line switching --kiosk that allowed it to start in full screens mode

431130
arp	dhcp
without that you won t have unique mac addresses properly recognized by the ap which mean 1 the ap s dhcp server will not give you mutliple valid ip addresses and 2 any ips you make up won t ever appear in its arp table and will be dropped immediately by the ap

431132
opera	firefox
also without these large files and with most restore points removed i use 17 gb for windows 7 64 bit openoffice firefox thunderbird putty opera etc.

431171
debian	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	linux
now out all the several guest images i have the linux based ones debian and ubuntu the latter with vmtools installed cannot reach the internet anymore

431195
tunnel	vpn
there is one exception if both you and the other party connect to a third-party vpn service that will tunnel your connections then it can work

431195
tunnel	vpn
since a connection initiated by both hosts exists to the vpn server and the vpn server will be forwarding traffic between hosts acting as a router within the tunnel you can then accept incoming connections over the tunneled virtual network

udp	tcp
i suggest openvpn because it uses either tcp or udp at your option

431310
int	chars
you can use the class to convert an int to an ascii chars

431313
udp	tcp
iftop will show the tcp udp streams on an interface in realtime which is often sufficient to identify which host is hogging the bandwidth

431346
filesystems	ntfs
1 technically ntfs is case sensitive but the oses mounting filesystems of this type are almost always configured to hide this underlying feature and only preserve the case

431392
folder	directory
for mac users assuming you ve placed sublime text 2 in the applications folder and that you have a bin directory in your path you can run

431420

is there a way to have the following in google-chrome like firefox

431494
x86	64bit
or if you want to automatically switch between the 32-bit and 64bit binaries for wow64 you can put the 32-bit binaries in programfiles x86 and the 64bit ones in programw6432 and then write your batch files like this

431545
width	height
so anyway once you get into the shapesheet you can see items like the shape s width height etc.

431545
width	height
change the height formula to be width 2 and you ll see that as you adjust the width the height maintains being half the width

431546
min	max
as a bonus you can also choose any of the other aggregate functions min max avg and you can choose to format the pivot table s labels in a traditional date format without affecting your data table values

431558
wan	lan
if you want all your ips in the 192.168.9.0 network you can connect the wifi router to your pc using the lan port instead of the wan port and disable dhcp on it

431558
wan	lan
unplug the wire from wan port and connect to any lan port

431588
ssdp	upnp
i discovered this problem as my upnp device a sony bravia tv constantly lost connection with the windows media player sharing server used as the dlna media server for the sony tv and apparently depends on the ssdp and upnp services

431624
ubuntu	linux
and it seems to be what i need but i need something that is both linux in my case ubuntu and osx compatible

431630
folder	directory
if it is there then provided it s in a folder that doesn t appear to have a randomly generated name you should be able to simply install picasa on the new machine copy over the image folder keeping the picture directory structure intact and then copying over the metadata folder as well also keeping the appdata directory structure intact

431646
folder	directory
my current directory is templates. i am finding this error odd since i can cd into the folder foldertoremove so it clearly exists

431668
ubuntu	linux
as for apps you can read ext3 in windows using this utility but you are better working from a linux live-cd like ubuntu or gparted the ext3 support will be much better and ntfs works well for read-only use

nas	qnap
after having replaced the drive i have noticed that the sd a b c.. 3 drives are the ones in the qnap nas which are displayed as 1 2

431835
mp3	flac
i would convert the wave flac and ape to mp3 256 cbr you can leave the other mp3s alone since converting to another bit rate is not recommended

i only seem to be able to control the filesystems personality journaled hfs+ in disk utility

432007
put	get
this will essentially put the vms directly on the lan so they will get 192.168.1.0 24 addresses and can be accessed directly from other machines on the lan

432010
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu uses the debian packaging format and so you cannot sensibly install rpms on a deb based distribution

432041
ffmpeg	libav
ffmpeg is actively developed but the ubuntu packages are outdated and they switched to libav

432041
mp4	h.264
h.264 video can reside in almost any container from avi to mp4 mov and mkv

also watch out for ram usage cpu usage disk usage and network usage during and just after startup

432222
put	get	ssd	sata
i m referring to usb flash sticks in this answer since if you are okay with something larger you could get a sata ssd and put it into a usb3+sata enclosure

432231
bash	zsh
i m not sure you can do the same thing in bash but in zsh i d put the following somewhere in .zshrc

432237
minimum	max
they are unlikely to conform to atx 2.0 and not only do they not have the atx12v connector but they max out at around 160w which is almost half of the minimum needed for a board and cpu like this

432252
macbook	bootcamp
so here s my situation i have a macbook running windows 7 on bootcamp

432257

if you need just this time then either use one of other answers to connect and copy or upload to temporary file connect with normal user account and sudo mv home user uploadedfile.cnf to here mysql.cnf and sudo chown root root to here mysql.cnf to give it right user group

432277

folder	directory
note that the my documents folder is the default for saving files but obviously the user is free to save any directory that they have permissions to

432289
folder	directory
you can change and physically move the my documents folder automatically by opening the properties dialogue for it and changing the target directory

432291
filtering	grouping
if i filtering the date column by blanks then clear the contents of all those cells then the pivot table does grouping by date ok

432303

a better organization of git repositories is to have one repo per client project ie many repo within your client folder one .git within each client folder subdirectories which match a project root directory

432306

i have posted a bug report with hp about this i will edit this post if i get feedback

432340
folder	directory
what you will be doing is basically the same one line command over and over depending on how many main directory folder you want to move

432351
robocopy	xcopy
avoid xcopy and robocopy or equivalent as that will spin your disk harder than you want and try to go into the disk then using right-click copy paste or its equivalent instead

432379
mp4	h.264
mkv mov mp4 h.264 aac audio although mkv really takes anything here the limitation is on the playback device side

winpcap	wireshark
winpcap was installed during installation of wireshark and i have rebooted

432448

monitor mode is not supported by winpcap and thus not by wireshark or tshark on windows

432448
freebsd	netbsd	freebsd	linux	openbsd	freebsd	openbsd	netbsd	openbsd	linux
it is supported for at least some interfaces on some versions of linux freebsd netbsd openbsd dragonfly bsd and mac os x

432448
libpcap	wireshark
if you are running wireshark 1.4 or later on a bsd linux or mac os x system and it s built with libpcap 1.0 or later for interfaces that support monitor mode there will be a monitor mode checkbox in the capture options window in wireshark and a command line -i to dumpcap tshark and wireshark

a dialog pop-up asking for super user password for the full privileges

432555

-delete users temp to axe the account info much shorter and easier to remember but apparently the dscl command doesn t work in single-user mode even when you follow the instructional prompt to start local directory services -- oh well

432555
sudo	passwd
i also discovered something interesting if you give your temporary account or any admin account no passwd you ll find that when you boot up and try to run sudo from a shell bash at least it won t work -- it just dumps back to the main user prompt

432563
bash	subshell
but you can change bash s default behavior to make it do case-insensitive expansions of file patterns add the command shopt -s nocaseglob to your .bashrc and .bash_profile files it s needed in both so the option is set in both login shells and subshell

432568
pop-up	dialog
you can enforce a check for available updates using wuauclt detectnow reference is here - you will however still need to open the dialog but the notice will pop-up short after you run the command if there are updates available

you can choose which icons to see hide in the notification area but the presence of a taskbar icon is only definable in the application options or through a third party app - not sure if any exists for windows7 but apps like taskbar shuffle and power menu have show that it is possible

ethernet	wireless
because the 802.11 spec does not allow normal wireless clients to transparently bridge traffic the radio in the airport express has to do extra work in this mode to sort of clone the mac addresses of any wired ethernet devices it sees connected to its ethernet port and fool the upstream ap into thinking those mac addresses are all separate wireless clients that have all joined the upstream ap that is it has to perform the 802.11 sta role on behalf of those non-802.11 devices thus proxy sta

if the issue is fairly reproducible i.e. you can turn off the light and you know something will happen with 10 minutes then i d try and narrow it down by disconnecting your keyboard and mouse

additionally if you re using ps 2 keyboard or mouse then swap them to usb and see if that helps

if this is your reason you choose the wrong solution you can easily configure sudo not to ask for a passwd

width	height
one hack solution appears to be to replace the formulas that are baked into a table shape s height and width by default

434050
width	height
in the shape transform section replace the formulas for width and height with some arbitrary values like 1 in

434050
width	height
when multiple tables are selected only the first table s height and width formulas are replaced which means the other tables selected are still not resizable

the blanking might be explained by the whole app having been swapped out of ram so before you can switch to it it has to reload from disk

if you have enough ram the other possibility is that you have a program which has a memory leak meaning it s demanding ever more ram from the system which will eventually mean things get pushed onto disk

however you can do rudimentary isolation by plugging the ethernet cable from the first router s lan port to the second router s wan port set the ip of the second router to a different subnet eg 192.168.2.1 - plus one to third octet if using 255.255.255.0 as subnet mask and leave dhcp enabled on the second router

what is the difference between a tunnel a vpn tunnel and an ssh tunnel

udp	tcp	tunnel	vpn	tunnel	packets
a ssh tunnel mostly used as a socks proxy is only working for tcp packets as a vpn like openvpn or pptp will also be able to work with udp packets

436488
udp	tcp
browsing the web is only tcp however most games are using udp aswell

436488
tunnel	vpn
also if using a vpn you don t need to configure each application to use the vpn since your os will do this but a socks proxy for a ssh tunnel do require some configuration

sometimes you want to redirect both stdout and stderr to the same location this is when is used â it points one file descriptor to another

436594
stdout	stderr
for example if you want to write both stdout and stderr to the same file be it dev null or output.txt you can redirect them separately with

436594
stdout	stderr
this often happens when using process expansion the or operators which normally only captures stdout but you may want to include stderr in it

436594
stdout	stderr
in this case you would also use to point stderr to stdout

436594
stdout	stderr
another common example is a pager or grep or similar utility since the pipe | normally only works on stdout you would redirect stderr to stdout before using the pipe

you should edit etc sudoers using the visudo command and add a line for the user john

sudo	passwd
then you can issue commands using sudo running as john and if desired disable the root user or at least use a very strong passwd for it - this would be my choice

in this case the sudo command still requires the user passwd so it adds an extra layer of security unattended laptop etc.

make sure the account still has a passwd set - passwd logins should be prevented in the sshd configuration and not by setting users to disabled passwd if you want to be able to use sudo securely

as far as i can remember cpu is equivalent to core and processors are the hardware that bundle up cpus and attach them onto one socket

439140

if you are feeling confidant that you did not get a virus trojan bundled in with your hacked copy of windows you can attempt a upgrade repair install with the official iso that should install all of the tools needed to activate windows

439141
processors	hyperthreading
likewise the same setup with quadcores would have 8 processors with 32 physical cores and with hyperthreading run up to 64 logical cores which is the maximum in the windows server enterprise would be able to run

is there a way for me to force the lync client to use the ethernet or wireless network adapter instead of the juniper vpn virtual network adapter

440125
disk	ram
i could imagine that the host os caches writes to the virtual disk image in ram and therefore the many small writes of a journalling system like ext4 may be batched together into one single large write to the file causing less damage than running on a raw disk

440209
sudo	passwd
if webmin is actually using the root passwd as stored in etc shadow then you can sudo to root and change root s passwd

440213
google-chrome	firefox
windows can utilize it as well though many third-party apps like firefox and google-chrome are at least i couldn t figure it out ignoring the high-dpi settings so the text in firefox google-chrome is still tiny unreadable

440251
unix	bsd
i suspect only apple know how much licensed at t unix code if any remains in osx via it s bsd and other origins

440265
mp4	h.264
flash media server and flash player can both stream or play back any h.264 file in virtually any format so either the f4v or mp4 container would work

440269
google-chrome	firefox	opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome
today i just found out the root of this problem.â it doesn t come from 32bit or 64bit because all the browsers like opera firefox google-chrome even internet explorer 64bit really work fine except for internet explorer 32bit

the bsd variant of unix made several important additions to what s called unix including the virtual memory model bsd sockets think tcp ip vi and csh - the first shell designed for interactive use

440283
unix	bsd
bsd unix had started as patches to the at t unix code

440283
freebsd	netbsd	openbsd	freebsd	openbsd	netbsd
this spawned 386bsd which then spawned netbsd freebsd openbsd and fireflybsd and others

440283
unix	bsd
eventually the at t and bsd code bases were pulled into official unix and this was called svr4

440283
freebsd	netbsd
the macos x darwin kernel is based on elements of netbsd and freebsd and also some mach code

vmdk is developed by and for vmware but sun xvm qemu virtualbox suse studio and .net discutils also support it

440384

judging from looking at this site parallels is a mac os x product and probably isn t suitable for you especially considering that virtualbox only supports an old version of the hdd format

440426
stdout	stderr
as geekosaur s answer says time prints to stderr and your command prints to stdout

440426

but the problem comes when you are using an external mouse as well and this scroll setting turns out to be slow for the ext mouse.windows does not provide separate settings for trackpad and mouse in the control panel as mac does

440609
folder	directory
if you have a song sitting on the windows xp machine in what is now the shared music directory you would browse to that computer in the network connections available in explorer on the windows 7 machine browse to that folder select the song copy it and then paste it wherever you wanted it to be on the windows 7 machine

ubuntu	linux
i m playing around with various linux distros and have so far tested ubuntu briefly on my desktop dual booting alongside windows 7

440765
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu removed this package from the latest release because of the bugs in most cases the user was detected but nothing was copied from the windows partition into the linux partition

usb devices total 0 drive 1 keyboard 1 mouse 2 hubs

440794
ethernet	wireless
no devices connected via wireless laptop iphone ipad had any connectivity issues but two ethernet connected devices had issues

440865
debian	linux
you can do this with any proper linux distro - not sure about android though the debian chroot method may work but everything the raspberry pi supports will allow you to do this

440945
mtu	icmp
icmp is necessary for mtu discovery to work correctly

440945
icmp	tcp
icmp must not be disabled for tcp to function properly

440954
x86	64bit
you can also check for the existence of the x86 version of the program files directory or the environment variable that points to it since it would only exist on a 64bit system

440956
disk	ram
this is why your computer is getting really slow because the disk drive is waaaay slower than ram even if you re on a ssd and it s also the reason your program can go on without any main memory left

441017
vlc	mkv
i downloaded some mkv mp4 files with my new router i can download directly from it using transmission and all of them seem to be corrupted lags strange artifacts when using vlc crashes with mp4 etc

441268
hfs+	ntfs
what i am asking is whether you d recommend using hfs+ for this data partition and macdrive to access it on windows or format it as ntfs and use tuxera ntfs for mac to write to the ntfs disc

441271
hfs+	ntfs
and linux read write support for ntfs is more omnipresent than for hfs+ â linux still can t write to hfs+ formatted volumes with journaling enabled

441281
cpu	hyperthreading
my expectation that the cpu usage be 100 for each process is that when i run just one of these simulations the cpu column is maxed at about 100 added to the fact that the cores have hyperthreading

441285

well all drives are supposedly the same size as in height width depth

441321
direct3d	directdraw
can i disable directdraw but have direct3d still active

441321
direct3d	directdraw
i read the wikipedia articles about directdraw and direct3d but do not know if i understand them correctly

441321
direct3d	directdraw
however since version 8 direct3d has superseded the old directdraw framework and also taken responsibility for the rendering of 2d graphics

441321
direct3d	directdraw
does that mean directdraw is now a part of direct3d

441321
direct3d	directdraw
because i cannot disable directdraw without disabling direct3d but it works the other way around

441328
hide	show
there also seems to be a tool available but it looks like that it only permits to hide show navigation entries but not to re-order them

441339
ubuntu	freebsd
i would like this to either work using freebsd 9 or ubuntu 12.04

441393
debian	linux
i guess the problem is related with mk-auth debian linux v4

441415
width	height
there is autofit column width and row height

441427
folder	directory
this says to search the current directory recursively for files which do not contain .php in the path and copy them into destination folder

441460
direct3d	directdraw
given that directdraw is now implemented in direct3d that would now make it a subset of direct3d

441460
direct3d	directdraw
so by disabling the directdraw interface in your direct3d runtime your other direct3d rendering capabilities should not be affected

441462
skype	voicemail
is there any software that makes it possible to send voicemail from a specific cell phone or skype number to a specific email address

441469
mouse	keyboard	hid	keyboard
no it s not possible to change this behaviour until you reprogram your hid a4tech mouse using the software it tries to make you download using super+r runâ pasting download page like a4tech.com driver uri and hitting return key using virtual hid keyboard controller embedded into the mouse

441485
xming	xorg
for font size it might be necessary to add -dpi 96 to the xming command line since that s what xorg uses by default while xming defaults to 100 dpi

441511
disk	ram
using big buffers means that your system spends more time between the ram and cpu and only dumps to disk the slow bit at 50mb intervals

441529
folder	directory
the tilde sign represents your home directory that s why .trash is translated to the .trash sub-directory in your home folder

441537
vpn	lan
have you added a route for vpn network on the router that all the clients are on that lan are using for a default gateway

441567

i don t use skype much and don t know about its support for voicemail

441570
versioning	upgrade

441931
decoder	encoder
the encoder decoder setup only streams 8mbps total so it seems like the switches we have should not be stressed out unless they are causing sufficient latency to degrade the performance of the encoder decoder

441932
pop-up	dialog
in order to open an encoded text file with the correct encoding in oo writer the user goes through file open then selects text encoded from a long list of file types which causes a dialog to pop-up with another list of encoding filters

easy and fast note entry with your keyboard mouse or midi keyboard

441969
directx	directdraw
the wikipedia page for directdraw and the other directx components is pretty clear about the situation

441969
direct3d	directdraw
3 1 microsoft seeing that directdraw was lonely and worked too hard to create 3d graphics by itself took pity on it and using parts of directdraw created direct3d

441969
direct3d	directdraw
3 2 directdraw and direct3d lived happily together for a time

441969
direct3d	directdraw	direct3d	directx	directx	directdraw
4 1 with the help of their neighbors directdraw and direct3d begat directx

441969
direct3d	directdraw
7 2 they did not like the incestuous overlap between the functions of directdraw and direct3d

441969
direct3d	directdraw	direct3d	directx	directx	directdraw
8 1 for directx 8 he left directdraw behind and started over with just direct3d who had survived because it followed instructions and did not look back as directdraw officially died

441969
direct3d	directdraw
8 2 direct3d complained not of the loss of its beloved directdraw and seeing this loyalty microsoft gave it a new and even better partner

441969
direct3d	directdraw	direct3d	directx	directx	directdraw
8 3 he took the surviving still pure 2d functions of directdraw and created directx graphics so that direct3d may be happy and fully functional

441969
direct3d	directx
9 1 directx 8 son of direct3d and directx graphics and their neighbors begat directx 9 which was a fine child

441969
directx	direct2d
10 1 later on directx 10 begat direct2d which was like directdraw++ and it was so-so

441969
directx	directdraw
so basically unless you are using directx 7 or lower which youâ re not you will not be able to disable just directdraw as a whole since it no longer exists as a standalone framework

441969
directx	directdraw
instead you can only disable the directdraw functions from directx

441969
direct3d	directdraw
that is if you disable directdraw then direct3d goes down too because it is built and relies upon 2d

441969
direct3d	directdraw
all that said you are not actually disabling either directdraw or direct3d

442031
hfs+	ntfs	xfs	ntfs
you can either make a logical copy using the copy cp command which means you can copy the contents of your drive to a drive which will be accessible to your main computer ntfs for windows or hfs+ for mac or you can perform a physical device image as per the other answer which suggests utility dd-rescue which will preserve all content in unallocated space but will still be in xfs

442083
daemons	systemd
the software is printnett a print production systemd it runs as a service daemons processing job requests creating directories+files keeping them locked for the duration of the batch creating them

442134
subnet	vlan
the arp -a method will only work after pinging the remote device and if it is located on the same vlan or broadcast domain subnet

442145
ati	nvidia
to do so would require a technology like amd ati s crossfire or nvidia s sli

442180
versioning	upgrade
windows preview versioning can never be upgrade to the rtm versioning

442197
gif	png
when you set a jpeg gif png etc

442202
disk	ram
using the pagefile at all will mean disk access which of course is slower than physical ram but the amount of pagefile use does not make it slower

442238
traceroute	nmap
greppable -og or .gnmap output is deprecated and so does not include helpful information from newer features of nmap such as traceroute and nse scripts

442246
x86	64bit
i know that on a 64bit version of windows the program files folder is for 64bit programs and the program files x86 folder is for 32-bit programs but why is this even necessary

442251
x86	64bit	windows	wow64
programs that runs on program files x86 use the wow64 subsystem windows 32-bit on windows 64bit is a set of drivers and apis intented to run x32 applications over a x64 architecture system

442273
x86	64bit
you can also check for the existence of the x86 version of the program files directory or the environment variable that points to it since it would only exist on a 64bit system

442280
x86	64bit
they just check c program files and when running under 32-bit mode this automatically gets changed to c program files x86 by 64bit windows

442290
16-bit	64bit	windows	wow64
it is called wow64 wow64 stands for windows on windows 64bit and is similar to how 16-bit apps would be run in xp using the ntvdm

442303
post	get
i would check the disk size from within windows run diskmgmt.msc from the run prompt windows key + r and see what it shows as the size of those partitions if its showing what you are seeing in windows then thats probably all you are going to get have a look and post what you can see so we can see whats going on

442358
pull	push
from the tortoise side everything is working i can clone pull push etc

442390
ssd	sata

442390
mouse	keyboard
i also experience a jumpy underresponsive mouse and keyboard and extremely slow disk performance 14 min

wan	lan
if so would i need a program to control the nics as to which is going to the wan and which is going to the lan

442414
ubuntu	linux
i use firefox under linux ubuntu with a lot of anti-ad extension like adblock noscript ghosty etc

442437
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome both glow or highlight a pinned tab when the title changes

442437
google-chrome	firefox
is there a way in google-chrome to make the tab stay glowing like in firefox

442438
daemons	systemd
stop spin only is productive if the systemd software s can stay operating only in memory cache for a long period in the actual systemd multi-processes daemons services rx s this usually only occurs if you control tweak largely your systemd

442441
google-chrome	firefox
instead of opening in my default browser i want them to use the metro ie10 or eventually metro google-chrome or firefox

442442
ethernet	wireless
i am permanently connected to two networks one over ethernet and one over wireless

442450
mouse	keyboard
i had the same problem as the poster and it was solved by removing all but my mouse keyboard and usb dvd drive and moving my dvd drive to a usb2 port

442457
disk	ram
it does however use ram to cache disk access so whatever you configure it with is what s going to disappear from available memory and perhaps windows is reporting this backwards somehow

442466
pull	push
commit push pull and merge

442507
vim	notepad++
to see if this method works you may try to open any file still open with a decent text editor like visual studio notepad++ or vim

442509
pop-up	dialog
i was hoping for the same thing but since it is a microsoft product of course it doesn t have this option and pop-up its message at the most inopportune time possible in the worst way a yes no dialog box

442514
ati	nvidia
this solution is similar to ati s offering execpt you must have two nvidia compatible cards

442545
udp	tcp
on top of that if the answer is a vpn is there likely to be any benefit to using udp over tcp or vice versa

442567
mp4	h.264

442579
min	max
manually set the min max major minor values

442585
hfs+	ntfs	filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	hfs+
in my experience linux just has better support for filesystems including hfs+ and in many cases will open ntfs drives that won t open in windows

442588
direct3d	directdraw
for example running dxdiag in 32 bit might show no acceleration for directdraw or direct3d

442602
disk	ram
you need to know that readyboost does not boost disk performance but ram performance so in this case it will boost both partitions of your system..

442603
installshield	msiexec
what seems to happen is that the msiexec service stops running randomly windows xp and 2003 only 7 is fine and it seems that office and .net updates use the installshield framework

442660
versioning	upgrade
i ve just got a really old macbook and i want to upgrade it to the latest os versioning

442662
versioning	upgrade
the macbook1 1 versioning has a core duo processor with a 32-bit architecture therefore you won t ever get to upgrade it to lion

442674
portrait	landscape
the document is oriented portrait style and i want to print two portrait style copies of this document on one landscape oriented page

442674
portrait	landscape
the problem i am having is that there seems to be another set of margins for the landscape page that surrounds the two copies of the portrait document

442687
folder	directory
there are over 700 folder in this directory i want it to go into each execute those four commands and then go to the next execute the commands and repeat

442694
x86	64bit
to help make the transition easier microsoft has designated that all 32-bit application should by default be loaded into the program files x86 folder rather than getting mixed in with true 64bit applications in the regular program files folder

442694
x86	64bit
but you can install a 32-bit program in program files and a 64bit program in program files x86 and nothing will happen the program will run the same

442709
antivirus	mcafee
it seems like i m experiencing some trouble when mcafee antivirus tries to update

442713
ati	nvidia
it is near to impossible to compare any nvidia card to any given amd ati card on the merit of how many cores they each have or the clock speed of each component

442743
cpu	processors
it s important to note that you won t see system-wide 100 cpu usage unless you have only one processors

442785
sudo	passwd
i agree with above this is a horrible to connect as a user and give an account full root access without issuing a passwd or locking it down with sudo

442800
ethernet	wireless
i would suggest combining a wireless solution for convenience with a wired solution for times when you require it if wiring is is going to be a significant problem then powerline ethernet over mains electricity would probably present an easy and convenient middle ground solution

442815
afp	smb
have you considered bypassing smb entirely and setting up afp sharing on the servers

442849
bash	zsh
i m setting up a new dev macbook pro and trying to replace bash with zsh

442980
midi	osc
iannix is not an audio sequencer it is an osc midi â sequencer

442989

the difference between and is then that makes a file get attached in the post as a file upload while the makes a text field and just get the contents for that text field from a file

442995
udp	tcp	icmp	udp	icmp	tcp
the ping program being the implementation of icmp protocol and it being based on raw sockets instead of tcp or udp sockets i m not sure if it is supposed to work via a program like proxychains

442997
udp	tcp
if you have a look at it explicitly states it supports tcp and dns which actually can be udp or tcp

daemons	systemd
jeff atwood actually blogged about netflix s work in making their systemd impervious to single points of failure including a daemons that randomly takes down services instances that they use for testing

443166
debian	linux
there is a way to do it in debian with the linux kernel cpufreq subsystem

443167
daemons	systemd
even better it also works in thin client mode that allows you to use the native gtk desktop gui on a linux windows mac systemd but connect it to another systemd daemons backend turn on classic mode in the options

443203
x86	64bit
check if the module is compatible with an x86 32-bit or x64 64bit version of regsvr32.exe

you can run an x86 version of android on a spare pc or on a virtual machine with virtualization software like virtualbox or vmware

443291
ubuntu	linux
however in linux android fedora ubuntu it connects to the wifi network but i am not able to use internet

i know this can be happened with bluetooth but with usb cable i don t know

now the directory it downloads to is mapped differently on the nas itself because the path that sabnzbd knows about starts in it s own folder

443377
vim	notepad++
usually i use vim for this but i think both wordpad and notepad++ also work

443386
x86	64bit
the one in x86 has the update tab in windows 7 64bit

filesystems	ntfs
ntfs is well supported by ms windows but while ntfs-3g can mount it under linux or macos x only in userspace it is a proprietary undocumented filesystems so there are no guarantees

445754
filesystems	hfs+
hfs+ surely the best filesystems to use in a macos-only environment is surely a non starter as well

445754
filesystems	fat
and you don t really want to put all of your important files on a fat filesystems

445754
filesystems	fat
so you re probably better off with big filesystems in each os of an appropriate type for that os and small shared fat filesystems in a separate partition

my guess is that the zoom toggle on the keyboard is acting like a joystick axis somehow

another way for me to put this issue to bed is to figure out how to get the igp to correctly spool up under windows

i then input the series error max and min into their respective boxes

446103
bluetooth	usb
think about it this way bluetooth isn t wireless usb

446103
bluetooth	usb
there isn t any bluetooth profile for passing usb through and the mouse or whatever doesn t implement any bluetooth profile

446103
bluetooth	usb
what you are missing from this setup is a component which unwraps the hid protocol data from usb wraps it in the bluetooth protocol using the hid profile which is similar to what a ps3 controller transmits and does the same in reverse on the other end

446103
bluetooth	usb
usb bluetooth adapters will do the hid unwrapping for the os and sometimes encapsulate it in a virtual usb but they won t do the encoding

446103
bluetooth	usb
to make a thing like that happen you would need to create a device i know of nothing currently produced that does this to act as a usb host adapter extract the hid protocol data re-encode it in bluetooth and transmit it

446103
mouse	keyboard	hid	keyboard
if the device isn t a hid like a keyboard or mouse this becomes a lot more complicated

446103
bluetooth	usb
for instance there are a few bluetooth audio protocols but none of them correspond directly to how you would transmit audio over usb

lack of these two features is really stopping me from switching to another web browser such as google-chrome or firefox

446258
ssd	sata
the only reason to buy a larger ssd and not two smaller ones is if your mobo doesn t have enough sata connections

446294
ssd	sata
if you are going into the boot screen not bios and changing to the correct boot drive and it still doesn t work then you may need to connect that ssd s sata cord to the number 0 or 1 sata cluster on the mobo

446294
ssd	sata
you can also try to disconnect all the sata connections to the mobo except for the correct ssd

i m partial to fedora given that i ve worked with centos for years and have little experience with any other linux distro

446458
min	max
note that the actual efficiency of a psu will typically vary according to the percentage of its maximum rating the actual load versus its max rating and tend toward zero efficiency at low or min wattage

446458
range	max
the psu has to be sized to be more than the pc s max power draw but the psu should not have too much capacity so that the pc s draw at idle is still within 20 of the psu s rated max the guaranteed range of 80plus certification

446463
16-bit	64bit
it can also break the 64bit in 4 16-bit 2 32 bits or just use all 64bit as a single variable

446755
cpu	processors
if you pause the vm at the post or enter the bios configuration tool you will see the cpu load on the host being high 100 on a single-core processors 50 on a dual-core threaded etc. if you boot into dos in the vm the hostâ s cpu load remains high until you execute idle.com at which point it drops to 0

google-chrome	firefox
vista machine problem happens in firefox and google-chrome but not in ie etc. but i think a more practical stopgap solution would be to block the download of the webfonts

447175
google-chrome	firefox
is there a way i can set the path of the stylish addon for .sqlite file for firefox and google-chrome to the same location

447175
google-chrome	firefox
in firefox i know it s in the extensions.stylish.dbfile config but i have no idea where it is in google-chrome

447175
google-chrome	firefox
my goal is to use the same styles for both firefox and google-chrome

447241
disk	ram
an important note even if your vm is thrashing that does not mean that the ram is not getting used by windows caching the disk that the vm is using and thus the thrashing is having little no impact

447247
width	height
if you want to know why this isn t possible in the general case then consider this problem design me a machine that without any human intervention aside from physically moving the device within reasonable distance will perfectly prune any tree of any height or width or species to an appropriate size

447267
disk	ram
linux solves this issue with either an initial ram disk or by building in the filesystem code as part of the kernel

447270
disk	ram
it s like a really nasty memory leak that eats your disk instead of your ram

447294
google-chrome	firefox
a hard link would do the trick but the databases have different structures in firefox and google-chrome so it will do you no good

447307

447323
rss	feed
is there a freely accessible rss feed such that

447331
rss	feed
you may be able to get the info you want from distrowatch s rss feed

447346
mp3	ogg
if you have music in a lossy format already such as mp3 or ogg vorbis converting it to a lossless format will only eat up a lot of disk space and will not -- absolutely will not -- improve the quality of the audio whatsoever

447346
decoder	encoder
bit width and depth are subtly different and there s also little-endian big-endian which does not affect quality and signed or unsigned which also does not affect quality but does affect how the encoder decoder deals with the data

447346
wav	flac	16-bit	64bit
so the answer to your question of whether using flac makes sense depends on the source data if you have 64bit wav files that were originally recorded at that sample format with 192000 hz a.k.a 192khz and you convert them to a standard flac sample format of 16-bit and 44.1 khz you are going to lose a ton of data

447346
wav	flac
but if your wav file is 8-bit with only 22100 samples per second and you convert it to a 16-bit flac with 44100 samples per second you are not going to lose data

447346
mp3	flac
but neither will you notice an improvement if you convert an mp3 to flac

447346
wav	flac
but assuming that the sample format is the same then the only difference between your flac and wav files will be the file size the wav files will be substantially larger

447363
ethernet	wireless
what wireless adapters hardware do i need if such hardware exists so that i can connect my phone to my network wireless as opposed to physically running an ethernet cable

the linux vfs is an internal api that abstracts access to different filesystems types ext4 fat32 ntfs etc. ibm has a great explanation of vfs that you should consider reading

447533
disk	ram
as far as i ve understood it the computer only goes into s3 sleep and after a while the bios will swap the active part of the ram out to a separate partition on the ssd disk and turn off the power completely

447565
filesystems	ntfs
check it here computer configuration administrative templates system ntfs filesystems selectively allow the evaluation of a symboliclink

447590

disk	ram
windows will detect too many hardware changes cpu ram motherboard graphics card disk everything and flag it as requiring re-activation over the internet or phone

447643

447670
redhat	fedora

447709
width	height
i am not sure how this would work with your page layout but you might try setting the height and or width of them which essentially makes them hidden

447717
vmware	virtualbox
if you re a gamer you should consider running a desktop virtualization solution such as vmware workstation or virtualbox so that you can game on the host os and have the highest possible performance from your games

447717
vmware	virtualbox	folder	directory
if you want to share data between your guest oses you can either create a vm specifically for this purpose or use features of the various virtualization solutions to provide access to folder on the host s hard drive virtualbox and vmware workstation provide shared folder which maps a directory on the host hard drive to a virtual hard drive or virtual network share in the guest

447746
put	get
when you have a pbx system you put it in the middle in between the exchange and the caller so -- remember that the ports are named based on where they go to -- we get this

447755
put	get
this put me on a new desktop from where i was able to get my system under control again although it took time i didn t lose any of my work

447757
disk	ram
this would provide performance comparable to a ram disk without having to modify the application at all

447831

if you could post exactly what you were doing application file type etc i think you would get a better response from the community here

447837

447911
cpu	processors
i could design a very simplistic processors that processes one stage of one risc instruction every cycle and if this were the basis of my cpu i could probably achieve a very very high cycles per second due to the reduced complexity of what constitutes a cycle

447974
udp	tcp
officially according to iana the internet assigned numbers authority port 1023 is reserved whether being used for tcp or udp

have you tried mounting your disk using using sata on a windows system and then updating the firmware for your samsung 830 ssd as was suggested in one of the comments

448219
sudo	passwd
the difference between su and sudo su is that the former would ask you for the passwd of the target user â root in that case â while the latter will ask you for your passwd and then change to the target user

448219
sudo	passwd
i m not too sure about opensuse and whether it requires you to set a root passwd at all â â others please feel free to correct me â but in either case you might want to stay with sudo su

ubuntu	linux
i d like to run linux ubuntu which is installed on hard disk ext4 inside windows7

448602
wan	lan
additionally i realised that my machine had a different lan wan and card reader adapters than the other ones which were ok so probably it is happening due to the fact that all these devices don t have proprietary drivers yet they are running with windows 8 default ones

448626
mouse	trackpad
first i noticed my usb wireless mouse getting sluggish i checked mba trackpad and it seemed fine

448627

448717
versioning	upgrade
tiger 10.4.x and all major releases before that were 129 each and could upgrade any supported mac from any versioning of mac os

i d like the home network to be based on the new switch and the packets to be routed to the time capsule and eventually the adsl router in case they cross the subnet boundaries

448925

449126
ssd	sata
i also have a mid-2010 macbook pro and i m about to upgrade to an ssd agility 4 with sata iii

449126
ssd	sata

449147
ubuntu	linux
currently the netbook has ubuntu linux installed

449163
post	put
i have seen some post where people mention that they had compiled it and put it into usr local lib but oddly enough i cannot seem to find any text on how to compile libcache

449185
folder	directory
create a c folder under the root directory of the macs and the linux computers

449190
mp4	h.264
then again you get best compatibility with mp4 if you encode to h.264 aac audio which would be something like this

ssd	sata
this situation is different because i have other sata drives working on the computer in question and i have tried my ssd successfully on other computers

449385
versioning	upgrade
i have already added to etc zypp zypp.conf so it should not care which repository the latest versioning are in and just upgrade to it

versioning	upgrade
your only real option is to run a virtual machine and install a newer versioning of windows in there if you are unable to upgrade your current system

i use ubuntu and windows 7 dual boot and having an external keyboard mouse which just runs on one os would be quite useless

449495
vim	emacs
like vim emacs perl sed regexp

449503
ubuntu	linux
although the maker may not support the use of the product with linux it might work without problems - however it would be wise to find out first or at least inform the seller that you intend to use it with ubuntu linux and expect to return for a refund if it doesn t work with linux

449508
ubuntu	linux
i plan to do this in ubuntu linux 12.04 x86_64

449566
ssid	wlan
but according to the dmesg output it is a wireless driver so you need to configure your wlan ssid + key somewhere see for details

udp	tcp	arp	udp	arp	tcp	arp	snmp	arp	icmp	icmp	udp	icmp	tcp	icmp	snmp
when people say tcp ip they are usually including udp over ip in which udp is used instead of tcp and a great many other protocols such as arp icmp dns snmp and other application layer protocols

449747
udp	tcp
these sit on one of two transport layer protocols - tcp and udp

449747
udp	tcp
a few application layer protocols will use either or both of udp and tcp but most are used with only one transport layer protocol

udp	tcp
tcp and udp are two transport layer protocols used in the internet protocol suite

449759
centos	linux
the manpage for the linux centos 6 ip tool requires you to specify the address you d like to add

449778
udp	tcp
to further diagnose the problem i will do bandwith tests mostly comparing udp and tcp as udp doesn t have this mechanisms for controling congestion

449788
mouse	keyboard
i was wondering how the computer determine the connected hardware -through usb- whether it is a mouse a keyboard or a camera etc.

449807
ubuntu	debian
i have encountered this problem on vim 6.3 7.0 7.1 running on debian redhat and ubuntu respectively

449890
sudo	passwd
so in terminal just type sudo nano private etc paths and enter your root passwd

449891
udp	tcp	sctp	udp	sctp	tcp
the reason why tcp ip is such a common abbreviation as opposed to say udp ip or sctp ip is because the two protocols were designed together and in the original paper by vint cerf and bob kahn the two concepts were combined together into a single protocol

449891
udp	tcp
it wasn t until six years later that udp was introduced to provide a lightweight multiplexing layer without the rest of the overhead involved with tcp

449901
versioning	upgrade
i would like to upgrade to latest versioning

449952
emacs	aquamacs
aquamacs puts the mac in emacs

449979
notepad++	sublimetext
if you want something similar in style and power to notepad++ try using sublimetext 2

449990
dropbox	skydrive
i ve lost countless files like this to both dropbox and skydrive

450000
switching	screens
for instance if i have safari open and sitting in my laptop screens and quicktime running on the external monitor is there any thing that would allow me to push and a button and switching the displays so that quicktime is in the laptop screens and safari is in the external monitor

450018
srt	subtitle
i also want to embed a srt subtitle file into it

450025
folder	directory
with that i can follow the instructions of and create a html tree of my dropbox public folder and in that way share a directory tree very easy

450030
versioning	upgrade
mountain lion hmmm well not sure most probably will fix it as it is an upgrade for lion there is a chance for it to have latest versioning of the system files which you have deleted

450041
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari
this happens on all my browsers firefox safari google-chrome and opera all latest version on mac os lion

450076
kde	gnome
it lists different utilities for gnome kde or other environments

450094
filesystems	xfs
for instance on linux you might want the reiserfs filesystems to be used for your smaller root partition due to its fast read performance and efficient use of space on small files but you might want the xfs filesystems on your large home partition due to its higher scalability with large amounts of data

450107
disk	ram
hard disk transfer rate gb s vs amount of memory accepted by ram in one go

450114
disk	ram
for example as you type up a word document or a post in a web browser immediately storing every character to the hard disk or tape would be very slow so instead they are stored in ram until you save the file

450114
disk	ram
there are many programs and operating system subsystems that cache data in ram which means they temporarily store it in ram or in the processor cache for short periods until you decide to either throw the data away or save it permanently to disk

450114
disk	ram
so as you go from having the media around archived on dvd to immediately accessible on hard disk to currently playing in ram it moves up the pyramid

450117
throttling	throttle
the end goal of this would be so that i can throttle external traffic without throttling internal traffic as well

450163
min	max
seq read max seq read min seq read avg

450163
min	max
seq write max seq write min seq write avg

450185
switching	screens
now since i upgraded to windows 7 when i switching from my linux back to my windows which is my main unit with 2 monitors i have to always to go to screens resolution and detect for it to find the second monitor

450191
min	max
there is not a quick way to accomplish his goal without using vba and without having to type in the fixed min max values

450212
udp	tcp
so you ve got tcp implemented in top of udp advantage you use a single port on the server side or you can embed it over an existing connection transporting various multiplexed channels

450212
udp	tcp
an example of use is gogo6.net which implements its ipv6 transport channel over a tcp session using a reimplementation of tcp over udp v4 it works on most home acccess routers that still only have an ipv4 address and not always suppporting the upnp method

450225
rss	feed
it will produce a nice list of the rss feed urls

450225
rss	feed
this will produce a list with rss feed name and its url

450263
udp	tcp
almost tcp over udp atou

450263
udp	tcp
as part of our net100 and probe efforts in improving bulk transfers over high speed high latency networks we have developed an instrumented and tunable version of tcp that runs over udp

450263
udp	tcp
and iproxy running tcp services over udp which is more fun

450263
client-side	server-side
iproxy comprises of a client-side proxy and a server-side proxy that

450263
udp	tcp
so you see tcp on unicast udp and even tcp on broadcast or multicast udp

450269
chown	passwd
chown means change ownership you will need to type your passwd to allow the command to succeed

450273
google-chrome	firefox
i have not found a resolution for google-chrome it seems to have gotten more clunky so i just went back to firefox

450284
folder	directory
the combined total of all the visible folder in the root directory of my c drive is 16gb including the windows folder but my system tells me that i have only 1.13gb of free space

450330
ubuntu	opensuse
i have opensuse 12.1 x64 host and i m running ubuntu 10.04 x86 as guest

450336
ubuntu	debian
specifically this each time you give a new mac address in vbox guest settings debian and ubuntu guests udev assigns a new eth number

450351
move	drag
just to be clear i want to heighten the amount of pixels a mouse pointer is allowed to move while pressed without triggering the drag behavior

450360

including cpu motherboard ram graphics cards hard disk optical drives audio support

450392
ssd	sata
get 64-128gb sata ii ssd

450410
disk	ram
the page file is virtual memory that works like your ram but on your hard disk drive

450429
tunnel	vpn
basically pppoe works like tunnel vpn software as wyzard says

450429
mtu	pppoe
one thing to keep in mind is that since ethernet s mtu is 1500 but 8 bytes of room needs to be made for the pppoe header so the mtu of the pppoe interface becomes 1492

450467
cpu	processors
there s obviously a limit to the voltage you can run through a processors however and this is dictated by the design of the cpu itself - mainly the current-carrying capacity of the internal electrical pathways

450473
debian	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	linux
use apache on ubuntu or debian linux as this is the simplest to set up with the best community support

450473
ubuntu	debian
if using ubuntu or debian apache and php are in the software repositories apt-get install apache2 php5 should do the necessary

450532
versioning	upgrade
when users upgrade to a new versioning of firefox only the add-ons that are actually incompatible should be disabled and the rest are assumed to be compatible

450573
ftp	smb
smb windows file sharing is much slower than ftp for example

450584
opensuse	linux
i have spend more than 2 months configuring my opensuse 12.1 linux as ultimate development environment with manual installs of many tools and packages

450602
mouse	keyboard
another issue was that when i connected the laptop to the docking station and wake up the laptop from sleep mode then the wireless keyboard and mouse were not detected

450610
vpn	lan
i want to configure the firewall to route the default non-local traffic of a specific host on the home lan to the vpn rather than the internet connection of the firewall which is shared by all other local hosts

450633
tunnel	packets
tunnel ip data using icmp packets

450633
udp	tcp	sctp	udp	sctp	tcp
this ip datagram may be a udp packet part of a tcp segment part of an sctp gre mpls protocol data unit or any other protocol higher than layer 2

450633
icmp	tcp
tunneling tcp data via icmp

450633
icmp	tcp
icmp packets are used to encapsulate tcp segments or ip datagrams that consist only of tcp segments

450633
icmp	tcp
a hack of icmp could for example exploit this fact and put a tcp packet in the payload

450634
folder	directory
symlink my home directory to a folder within dropbox

450634
folder	directory
symlink my home directory to a folder within dropbox

450634
folder	dir	folder	directory
symlink my home directory to the dropbox folder of my home dir

450638
ethernet	wireless
since you don t have the problem on your wireless router connected to the same router and you changed the ethernet cable i think you re right in assuming that the problem is inside your machine

450638
ethernet	wireless
the fact that you tried a wireless adapter on the desktop makes me doubt it is a problem with the ethernet card however i still want you to try and removing the ethernet card drivers and let windows automatically find and install new ones

450641
daemons	systemd
i ve seen this behavior on systemd where you connect in and for some reason your profile or your login ssh daemons feels the urge to do a dns lookup of some sort eg reverse lookup the source ip and it sits there like a lemon for 40 seconds

450663
folder	directory
i then deleted these folder files from my home directory located at

450663
folder	directory
i then symlinked all of the folder files above from my dropbox folder to my home directory

450673
ubuntu	linux
i wonder whether there is a way to make my ubuntu read-only when i mount it on another linux system

450673
ubuntu	linux
however i should add this information that i am not able to make any changes on the linux system onto where i plugged my ubuntu usb stick

450709
windows	winpe
windows 7 winpe environment after selecting repair cmd prompt type bootrec.exe fixmbr

450718
vpn	lan
wifi client -- router -- lan -- vpn access -- vpn access -- proxy server internet

if you are trying to access it from other programs or from a text editor you can use ramdisk which is free software that allows you to create a virtual disk in your ram while your computer is booted

450739
portrait	landscape
or if i change the page layout to landscape how can i preserve a portrait header and footer

450747

the windows.old directory contains all your previous data from the windows program files program files x86 where applicable programdata and program files folder

450752
folder	dir
to check for this type dir c ad and see if you see the above mentioned folder

450752
folder	directory
once you have the folder moved move the other folder back to the root directory

450752
robocopy	xcopy
the reason i don t use xcopy or robocopy on the folders are because there are reminents of the old system that should not be copied to a new system

450753
switching	screens
i d like to use vmware unity function which all screens in same place so i don t need to switching between vmware and windows

450759
centos	linux
i m running centos linux

450768
mouse	keyboard
perhaps you can only have one app with a mouse keyboard hook running at the same time

450778
filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	fat
so if you happen to install a guest os to a vhd you can still get at the data with windows and no instance of virtual box either also assuming the filesystems in use is fat or ntfs since that s all windows knows

450826
windows	winpe
winpe is different from a windows xp machine because as i wrote on my first post i have installed the disk on a secondâ xp machine i have all my files from the second partition but i cannot access the first one as it seems that is empty

450881
exif	jfif
most jpeg images probably still use the 1992 jpeg codec and the exif and jfif file formats

450891

since filtering supports multiple columns but it is not what you are looking for here is how to add sorting to multiple columns without using the toolbar ribbon

450941
vpn	lan
on some lan configurations clients from the vpn connection can not access servers that are on the dmz in such configuration your request is not possible

450986
versioning	upgrade
operating systems don t just magically change from one versioning to another nor do linux oses split into two versioning although i m guessing the reason you see two instances of linux is that you upgrade the kernel so both the old and new versioning of the kernel are present

450987
trojan	virus
does not mean that a virus is using port 1111 but that a trojan or

450987

i want to restore windows 7 to hdd without re-partitioning the hard-drive

450996
ubuntu	debian
i m concretely interested in ubuntu debian if that matters.

451000
disk	ram
so what you re getting with compressed ram in lieu of hdd swap is that the long delay and lots of audible disk grinding is avoided when you bring that background program to the foreground

451001
stdout	stderr
for custom completions like --option completion you may override the completion function with output to stdout stderr to display something like ls -l along with the completion suggestions

you need to obtain the correct version of bootsect.exe 64bit x64 or 32-bit x86

451069
filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	fat
if a bootloader supports chainloading you can basically direct it to load any file it can read on a fat ntfs filesystems in the case of windows bootloaders and execute it as if the file was the original bootloader

451091
google-chrome	firefox
links aren t clickable in mac preview or pdf.js inside firefox however google-chrome apparently creates links where it thinks they should exist because it s built-in reader will show the url as a link

451094
google-chrome	firefox
i ve noticed that my fonts seemed jagged on google-chrome but not firefox it seemed strange so i decided to configure cleartype again

451094

otherwise you can achieve this by simply creating the page with the table as a landscape page but treating it as portrait when it s printed

451253
portrait	landscape
when the document is printed turn the landscape page in your hands back up to portrait and the table and text will appear rotated but the footer text appears straight

451264
ubuntu	linux
i have been looking into damn small linux but i also modify the normal ubuntu installation and i have no idea to make the both available to boot in the menu

451279
fflush	gets
the main reason why it saves both of those is that at closing both ram and vm gets fflush ram gets fflush because if there is no power in it it does t retain memory and vm is fflush by the os

451323
versioning	upgrade
yesterday i upgrade my firefox to firefox versioning 14.1

mouse	trackpad	mouse	keyboard
that s why it s important to make sure that you optimize your keyboard mouse or trackpad

451504

and now i want to access the pc b in the local lan of pc a a is in vpn net with my macbook i can access pc a with my macbook so vpn works i just need some way to route the traffic from the macbook over pc a i guess to reach pc b in the lan of pc a i cant add pc b to the vpn net because i dont have physical access to it

451826
vpn	lan
also the first internet between macbook en vpn server probably should be lan

451841
16-bit	64bit
it should be noted that 64bit versions of windows have completely dropped support of 16-bit programs and so do not include command at all so neither dos nor windows 16-bit programs will run and instead will throw a misleading error message

451872
post	get
anyhow the machine didn t boot up after that i couldn t even get the post screen for a while

451880
google-chrome	firefox
i just switched to google-chrome from firefox and one of the things i really liked about firefox was pinned tabs

they usually have an entry for tmp and temp

451932
folder	directory
on linux many programs use folder files in the users home directory to store their configuration

451998
cpu	processors
if you pause the vm at the post or enter the bios configuration tool you will see the cpu load on the host being high 100 on a single-core processors 50 on a dual-core threaded etc. if you boot into dos in the vm the hostâ s cpu load remains high until you execute idle.com at which point it drops to 0

452007
16-bit	64bit
yes you can run 16-bit programs in 32-bit windows 7 even if the processor is 64bit

452020
16-bit	64bit
64bit versions of windows do not support 16-bit components 16-bit processes or 16-bit applications

i use sublimetext 2 as my main editor so is it possible to use sublimetext like gedit from terminal

452073
hfs+	ntfs	filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	hfs+
you would think this comes at the cost of wasting some space for 4kb files but that s not so because common ntfs hfs+ filesystems are storing things in 4kb blocks anyway

452085
folder	directory
one folder under cron.d would have all crons associated with say removing certain types of directory

452196
mouse	keyboard
before the change after waking the computer everything would operate normally as far as i could tell but now after waking the computer the receiver has no lights on and the keyboard and mouse are completely unresponsive which is odd considering the mouse woke up the computer

452244
switching	screens
if the list shows a hard block however you cannot change it from within the os â look for a wifi keyboard button an option in the bios uefi setup screens or a physical on off switching

452250
daemons	systemd
if using a cron daemons that doesn t support that as one probably is doing on most linux systemd i would guess i think your best option may be a simple script that takes a tree of config files in say usr local etc local-crons and concatenates them together into single files in etc cron.d

452448
centos	linux
our setup is a virtualised centos linux machine with several linux user accounts where development takes place and the svn central repo is on a separate server authentication is using our ldap login the same corporate login used to login to our windows machines

452448
centos	linux
could there be another place on our centos linux machine that caches the login

452463
mouse	keyboard
the user experience for the mouse screen division algorithm is precisely as you asked in your question but i m 60 sure based on using the program professionally for a total of about 30 hours that there is no way to activate it using only the keyboard

452463
mouse	keyboard
i can t recommend that you use this product nor should i since that d be off topic primarily because i don t think it does what you want it to do namely you can t activate the mouse grid with the keyboard

452463
joystick	keyboard
trackpoint is actually the ibm brand name of a fairly generic device which can be described as a small inertial joystick that sits in the middle of your keyboard with a rubber cap over it and it often has the appearance of a pencil eraser

452463
mouse	keyboard
the use of the trackpoint allows you fine-grained motor control of the mouse left and right-clicking and scrolling without having to take your hands off the keyboard

452463
mouse	keyboard
it s as good as having a key on your keyboard that is the mouse

452463
mouse	keyboard
in fact i can type and mouse at the same time with both hands on the keyboard

452466

452506
pop-up	dialog
when you first start the program it pop-up a process monitor filter dialog box

452521
disk	ram
if you have enough ram that the operating system will load a large chunk or all of your disk cache into memory while chrome is running then surfing static web pages that you often visit is going to be as fast as clicking through an offline .chm html help file p so if you re looking for a place where you can upgrade your hardware to improve performance having more ram not faster ram not a faster hdd etc is the prime mover for performance

452521
disk	ram
keeping lots of available ram low application memory pressure and lots of disk pages cached in ram is the primary way to have a whoa that s uber fast experience

multiplication	modulo	multiplying	multiplication	multiplying	modulo
the way that this can be done there are much faster ways involving repeated squaring and the like is by multiplying and after every multiplication take the modulo

452574
wan	lan
i connected my own router 2 to my landlord s router 1 via an ethernet cable running from one lan port to another not using any wan port and i turned off the dhcp server on router 2

you re trying to put the width in along the original height axis and vice versa

452594
beyondcompare	winmerge	beyondcompare	diffmerge	diffmerge	winmerge
i ve tried diffmerge kdiff beyondcompare and winmerge

452635
cpu	processors
in my experience this is the fastest possible performance mode if your discrete graphics card is faster than the processors graphics because there tends to be some latency if you are driving the display on the motherboard and the gpu is processing shaders and having to send them to the motherboard via the virtu mvp chip on the mobo and then to the cpu for the hd4000 graphics to process.

452637
rar	zip
i was wondering if anyone knows of a way to create some sort of script maybe a batch file that can auto zip or rar folders in a folder and any new folders added to that folder so whole artists albums can be downloaded at once

452640
128bit	64bit
in assembly language it is usually very easy to get the full 64bit result or for a 64bit computer the full 128bit result.

452640
multiplying	multiplication	multiplying	addition	multiplying	subtraction	subtraction	addition	subtraction	multiplication	addition	multiplication
there are actually some faster algorithms around for multiplying wikipedia such as strassen s fast fourier method and some simpler methods which do extra addition and subtraction but less multiplication and so end up faster overall

452642
switching	screens
normally you shouldn t see that much a slowing when switching to a bigger screens with a card that strong

452643
width	height
the number of pixels on the screen increases quadratically if the width and height components increase symmetrically

452645
ethernet	wireless
then i have several devices linked to the lan both through ethernet cables and wireless

452645

452910
ubuntu	linux
i am trying to monitor some usb traffic using wireshark on linux ubuntu

452915
cpu	processors
the scheduler was modified in windows vista with the inclusion of a priority scheduler and also to use the cycle counter register of modern processors to keep track of exactly how many cpu cycles a thread has executed

452917
move	drag
however you can easily move whole folders to your thb archives by simply drag dropping the whole folders to the archives folder

452928
mouse	keyboard
the dock should allow for the support of at least three monitors keyboard and mouse

452933
put	get
as such at the moment i can log in as root or put sudo in front of every command to get things working but this is not ideal and does not help when for example i open up a document for editing in gedit within the gui

452939
mouse	keyboard
not to beg the question but why do you need a separate dock for keyboard and mouse

452939
mouse	keyboard
so essentially for your keyboard mouse all you d need is a usb hub.

452950
udp	tcp
using windows 7 i found that file transfer program was already in my inbound rules list in windows firewall once for tcp and once for udp however it still wasn t working

452961
chown	chmod
in that case change the ownership permission of the files with chown and chmod respectively

452967
debian	linux
the linux distribution that i use is debian 6.0

452987
sudo	passwd
this should be possible with sudo vim etc passwd use whatever file editor you use

452992
ubuntu	linux
currently it only runs on linux so it won t work on your particular setup but would work to boot for example fedora from ubuntu

453001
lotus	sametime
you can switch to the basic client actions-- lotus notes-- switch to lite mode basic and it will use the older style sametime client which has the preference to disable awareness

453033
sudo	passwd
if you did this in theory you would have to sudo shutdown -h now and you would be prompted for the root passwd

sorting	grouping
with a small data set after first sorting it by product similar to grouping by product you could first copy the product column paste it elsewhere then remove duplicates

453143
google-chrome	firefox
i would like to know if itâ s possible to use either of them to provide more accurate location for browsers google-chrome firefox

453152
kde	gnome
thunar was highly responsive which i didn t expect after trying out gnome and kde

453152
xfce	gnome	xfce	kde	kde	gnome
the gnome and kde desktops had a lot of hardware advantages over the xfce desktop

453152
xfce	gnome	xfce	kde	tunnel	lan	kde	gnome
since the weaker xfce desktop far outperformed the much stronger gnome and kde desktops for x tunnel over ssh through lan the results are even more astounding

453174
kde	gnome
the desktop environment may be obnoxiously unresponsive confirmed with both kde and gnome

453178
ssd	sata
what gives speed and responsiveness with an ssd is its random read write speeds and they lie well below the sata 2 threshold with many drives

453179
filtering	grouping
filtering yahoo grouping 1 ignore bad users

453179
filtering	grouping
filtering yahoo grouping 2 keep good posts

453179
filtering	grouping
filtering yahoo grouping 3 kill re

453179
filtering	grouping
optional filtering yahoo grouping 4 move unknown posts to triage folder

453179
filtering	grouping
because one of the filtering stops the filtering process it is very important that these four filtering be placed in order at the bottom of the message filtering list so that they run last -- because the second filtering will prevent any but the yahoo grouping filtering from running after it

453179
filtering	grouping
obviously if any previous filtering might fire a stop filtering execution on a yahoo grouping email then this whole approach will fail

453182
pull	push
watercooling sealed watercooling units extreme pipelines push pull stand up heatsinks 120mm fans single and or dual config these have all made it practically useless to bother with lapping anymore

453229

pop-up	dialog
if you want to create a task that requires admin privileges with a non-admin account then an admin-account holder must either enter their credentials at the command-line when creating the task or else at the credentials dialog that pop-up when the task is executed

453243
ssd	sata
furthermore consumer-level sdds could be much faster than even sata iii for example the pcie ssd ocz revodrive 3 has a maximum reading speed of 975 mb s

453251
tiff	png	gif	png
dupeguru pe supports jpg png tiff gif

453262
folder	directory
i also chown d the folder so that only users in a specific group could read or write to it and i kept the users jailed to their home directory

453265
vim	emacs
terminal application and editors like vim and emacs i think make good use of control codes

453280
tunnel	vpn
if the following link doesn t work you can google configuring a split tunnel vpn on win7

453317
pop-up	dialog
if you manually log in to those servers using putty click the yes button on that dialog putty will cache the server key so those dialog will not pop-up on subsequent connections unless you reinstall ssh on the server or change the server s key

453317
pop-up	dialog
you can use plink a command-line version of putty that should not pop-up these dialog or use openssh i haven t used plink

postgresql	mysql
i know it sounds a bit lazy to save myself manually doing a couple of easy edits in apache conf and the host file but i am planning to add a few extra bits to it creation of a mysql sqllite mssql postgresql template database ability to build a zend framework template etc so it s not just the vhost and host file entries

453378
mouse	keyboard
the easiest way to deal with this is to install vmware tools in the guest so that your system never has to lock the keyboard mouse to the guest in the first place

453399
put	get
in order to get a baseline of how hot my processor runs at stock clock speed 3.6ghz + 3.8ghz turbo boost i was looking for something to put my processor under high load for long time

453407
cpu	processors
tools that have been designed to make your processors work and to benchmark your cpu

453407
cpu	processors
it cranks up your cpu to calculate prime numbers and it will make every core and thread of your processors work really hard

453409
mouse	keyboard
lift hand off the keyboard and put it on the mouse

453409
folder	directory
the window always opens in c windows system32 rather than my users directory as in approved technique 1 or the folder i want to be in as in approved technique 2

453432
execvp	fork
it may be more appropriate to exit cleanly instead of looping - i was trying to minimize resource usage but a fork exec wait for jwm or your favorite wm and then an execvp of sh would be sufficient

453439
folder	directory
the window always opens in c windows system32 rather than my users directory as in approved technique 1 or the folder i want to be in as in approved technique 2

453446
switching	screens
the closest pattern i can think of is that the windows there were on the main screens switching to a the second screens

453455
tunnel	lan
currently i am doing a tunnel via sshuttle tunnelier for every client on my lan

453457
wan	lan
upon changing this in our sonicwall s lan interface our wan connections quit working normally

453484
debian	centos
likely debian 4 or centos 6

453484
folder	directory
my problem is how do i get the linux installer to mount a shared folder on a host ntfs partition during the installation phase so that i may use said folder as my home directory in linux

453484
folder	directory
in other words it is required to use a folder on the host filesystem as my home directory branch with a linux guest it needs to be accessible by windows since that is where data sharing will occur not to create a separate linux partition for home on the virtual disk

453513
unicode	ucs
there are some fonts such as arial unicode ms that are mapped to the universal character set or unicode which allows them to store a glyph for any unicode ucs character

453549
put	get
my short term solution until i get a after market heatsink was to cut an old sata and put it in between the cpu and ram to act as a buffer so the two aren t directly touching

453575
hex	binary
30 gb lba flag which i take to mean it s bootable which therefore could mean it contains the files necessary to boot after pressing the okr button next to the power button contains driver installation files and some sort of binary or hex file from okr which when read appears only to be a log

453598
stdout	stderr
how can i determine if what a process is outputting is stdout or stderr

453601
stdout	stderr
any output here is not from stdout if you see anything it must be stderr output

453604
stdout	stderr
there are only three ways i know of to determine what a program will output to stdout and what to stderr

453604
stdout	stderr
then look at the two output files to see what the program has written to stdout and what it has written to stderr

453610
temp	tmp
is it safe to change the user environment variables temp and tmp to point somewhere else d temp if d is my other disk with more space

453610
temp	tmp
i did find this documentation from microsoft talking about making the change on an exchange server move temp and tmp directories

453619
kde	gnome
you should be able to do it this way add desktop icons to kde and gnome

453627
bios	rootkit
have you considered that you might have a bios rootkit

453678
wan	lan
personally i would forget about the wan port and just plug in to the lan port

453696
mouse	keyboard
lifehacker had a good writeup on it how to control multiple computers with a single keyboard and mouse

453715
wan	lan
it s clear from your wan connection types list that your router has a built-in dsl modem as its wan port and you need something that has an ethernet wan port to connect to your office lan

453715
wan	lan
yes you connect the router s wan port to your office s lan

453715
wan	lan
in your case your office lan is how your router gets its upstream internet connection so plug your router s upstream wan port into your office lan

453718
google-chrome	safari
i have been using safari with clicktoplugin and was wondering if there was anything similar for google-chrome

453729
google-chrome	firefox
hi my webpage doesn t load properly in firefox and google-chrome but it loads perfectly in ie and all the text fields are perfectly working in it .so please could anyone help me it s quite urgent to wind up my project by today

453753
wan	lan
most consumer wireless routers by this i specifically mean home gateways with integrated 802.11 access point functionality take a significant performance hit when doing nat gatewaying instead of simply bridging between wan and lan wlan

453788
google-chrome	firefox
firefox works but google-chrome has that problem

453791
folder	directory
reading writing and deleting folder in the sales directory would be allow by all people in that group

453835
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome both have private browsing modes which don t log you into sites

453835

to access it in firefox press ctrl+shift+p and for google-chrome press ctrl+shift+n

453866
sudo	passwd
type sudo ufw default allow at the command prompt and press enter. type the root passwd on the command line if prompted

453870
debian	linux
its a debian linux distribution that has a full featured web interface for controlling the software

453870
wan	lan
you need one for the internet traffic wan and one for your network traffic lan

453899
udp	tcp
udp scanning is a bit more difficult that tcp scanning as you can not expect to get a response on udp level because that depends on the server protocol using the port

453944
sudo	passwd	sudoers	passwd
i m trying to setup sudo without no passwd but still i get prompted for passwd i m using ubuntu here is the relevant line from the sudoers configuration file

453946
cpu	processors
while it won t be a total waste if you insist on doing it anyway there is a huge disincentive to doing so your processors is so old that it does not have the extended page tables ept cpu instructions

453957
cpu	processors
your graphics card processors cpu hardrive motherboard and memory are drawing more power than the thermaltake can handle supplying according to what you posted

453964
centos	linux
i am in the process of shopping for drives for my linux server centos 6.3

453996
disk	ram
it s also more than very likely the program stores the data in ram in a different format than what it would write to disk

454075
folder	dir
with dir you can list all symlinks and junctions in a specific folder and its subfolders

454079
wan	lan
how will the packets know that the destination of the ip address is to go out to the wan instead of the lan

454085
ubuntu	linux
i m in a strange fun situation with a dual boot windows xp ubuntu linux computer that is only connected to the internet via usb 3g dongle and i need to connect another device that only has a ethernet port

454101
ubuntu	linux
i know on windows if you set the power options to high performance speedstep is disabled but how can i do this on ubuntu linux using a command line application

454103
put	get
basically the solution is to find something to put down on the under the mouse like a piece of printer paper or get a mousepad they still are useful for this purpose

454110
rar	zip
iâ ll leave the answer to whether you can compress archive them as zip rar etc

454115
filesystems	ntfs
i have used ntfs compression for ages now on complete filesystems on several clients and windows versions and never had an issue because of the compressed filesystems

454117
hard-drive	floppy
it also lets you decide what type the mounted drive will be hard-drive optical floppy auto

454120
mouse	trackpad
i thought i could just use synergy disable the links that allow the mouse to go from one screen to another and use a key combination instead but then any mouse input including the internal trackpad will still be redirected to the client when the client screen is switched to with the key combination

454120
mouse	keyboard
alternatively if no such application exists if someone could comment with what the best cheap usb kvm or only keyboard mouse switcher is i d appreciate it

454161
ppp	dhcp
perhaps all isp-operated recursive dns servers could be clustered under a single ip address using anycast as google public dns is but there is no point in doing that as the problem of automatically configuring dns is already solved by protocols like dhcp and ppp

454161
ppp	dhcp
dhcp and ppp allow not only configuring the client s ip address but also its dns server addresses

454186
tunnel	lan
willing to tunnel all lan s outbound traffic through an ssh tunnel

454190
tunnel	lan
to tunnel all outbound lan traffic follow these steps

454195
rpm	yum
especially since yum likes to occasionally clean up its rpm cache so over time you lose old versions of rpms that are obsolete

454205
google-chrome	firefox
the w3c geolocation api is supported for a long time in google-chrome and firefox

454205
google-chrome	firefox
that is i doubt that firefox google-chrome actually has hardware integration support for gps devices

454218
filesystems	fat
if you for some reason actually want to create ._ files just take something like a usb flash drive format it with the fat filesystems os x s disk utility can do this but it calls the format ms-dos note that most flash drives come preformatted in fat and use os x to copy some files to it

454222
dpkg	apt
so i was wondering if it s possible to download the .deb package directly without using apt and install it with dpkg

454227
sudo	passwd
allow all sudo commands to be run without a passwd

454267
put	get
and most importantly i get php segmentation fault error when i put this in functions.php

454275
stdout	stderr
just explained a bit closer redirects sdtout standard output to the black hole and appends stderr standard error output to stdout so it also goes to nirvana

454275
stdout	stderr
not redirecting stdout just suppressing stderr and telling curl to only show the indended content then piping that to grep and finally to sed

454280
folder	directory
is there a functionality in windows or a third party app to have a virtual folder containing links to files from a physical directory and it s sub directory which are not older than say 7 days

454470
mouse	keyboard
a click and button press counter program is possible via writing a cocoa objective-c program that can receive and count mouse and keyboard click events

454472
wan	lan
a lot of routers do not allow connections they had forwarded from the local network to its wan port to traverse back into the lan nat loopback or hairpin

454474
ubuntu	linux
there should be docs on this on the ubuntu site or ask on the forums there or on the stackexchange linux site

454479
ftp	telnet
3 telnet - if you know that your pc is listening on a particular port such as 80 for http 21 for ftp or 20 for smtp you can test it with telnet

if so then you can t hook its dsl wan port to your other dsl router s ethernet lan port because dsl and ethernet are two different technologies even though their connectors may look similar in some countries rj11 for a telephone dsl line wider rj45 for ethernet cable

454649
pppoe	dhcp
since you already have another dsl router plugged into your dsl-enabled telephone line let that router be your pppoe client nat gateway and dhcp server for your home network

454649
pppoe	dhcp
if you want to add the beetel 440txi to the network to provide more ethernet ports or additional wi-fi coverage then turn off the 440txi s pppoe nat and dhcp services and use and ethernet cable to plug one of the 440txi s ethernet lan ports to one of the ethernet lan ports on the other dsl router

init.d	pid
in etc init.d sambad there will be code to keep track of the pid when it s started and signal it when it needs to stop

454911
daemons	systemd
the init scripts are usually more specific to the distribution than to the daemons in question since systemd startup and service administration is one of the main areas that linux distributions use to distinguish themselves

debian	linux	debian	mint
previously i had a working linux mint debian edition partition and a windows xp partition all working and bootable through grub

454931
switching	screens
ips or in plane switching is better - its what the cool kids with snappy monitors use - it has better colour quality viewing angles and many of the disadvantages it had with respect to a traditional tn screens have been worked through - it was expensive until recently there s some good relatively inexpensive panels these days

455085
mouse	keyboard
i would love if there was a way to basically disable the keyboard and mouse - or activate the locked screen once any mouse or keyboard activity is detected and require a login

455087
filesystems	ntfs
ntfs is the best filesystems for windows but os x can only read ntfs not write it unless you install third-party software

455087
hfs+	ntfs
if you want to be able to boot either os and also have a partition where both oses can store files then you need all three volume formats hfs+ fat32 and ntfs

pppoe	dhcp
the windows box is running a pppoe client which acts like a dialup but runs over an ethernet network so it has the ip-layer connection to the isp but it is not providing services like dhcp and nat to the other network clients

455134
pppoe	dhcp
the solution is to get the pppoe client running on the dsl modem and enable its dhcp server and nat if not already enabled

455242
ftp	telnet
telnet and ftp servers usually use linux users for login

455242
ftp	telnet
so if you change root password root passwords for telnet and ftp will also change

455243
ftp	telnet
usually telnet ftp and so on on linux rely on pam

in addition how we can turn off the pop-up dialog boxes which ask for admin permission to run causing the whole screen to go off for 0.5 seconds

455672
ethernet	wireless
so even if you always got the 54 megabits sec signaling rate between one client and the ap you d probably only see somewhere around 23 megabits sec of throughput between the wireless client and something on the wired ethernet on the far side of the ap

robocopy	xcopy
i tried with pscp but it is failing when the size is large so i need to try it with robocopy or xcopy

455737
mouse	keyboard
if it is not possible then you can use a kvm switch to switch your keyboard mouse and monitor between different machines

455741
mouse	keyboard
as soon as i touch the mouse or the keyboard the light goes back to normal

455753
mouse	keyboard
this also means that you will be able to share 1 keyboard and mouse for the 2 computers although if you prefer to keep the 2 a better solution for a mac + pc combo as in your case then you can

and it would take more time to get the mac back to where you left off at as it reloads the contents of ram from disk

455838
disk	ram
1 - hibernation mode with ram contents written to disk system totally shut down while â œsleeping â and slower wake up due to reading the contents of ram off the hard drive

ethernet	wireless
i cannot pull ethernet from the hotspot only wireless

455868
ethernet	wireless
i attempted to pick up the wireless on a mac mini i have then set up internet sharing and feed it out the ethernet port on the mini to the airport extreme router

455868
ethernet	wireless
correctly on the mac mini both wireless and ethernet connections and the airport extreme router

455878
udp	tcp
to directly answer your question tcp is used by dns when the answer doesn t fit in a udp packet and also for various server to server communication

455880
ssd	sata
i was going to pick up an 512 gb ssd to replace the latter and was asked if it was equipped with a sata iii controller

455903
google-chrome	firefox
the userscript you linked is for firefox greasemonkey and will not work on google-chrome

455965
ethernet	wireless
like most laptops it has both ethernet and wireless networking options

455965
ethernet	wireless
the problem is that until i disable the wirelless network adapter windows still uses the wireless connection as opposed the ethernet connection

455990
centos	linux
some linux distros mainly those based on rhel like centos or fedora come with selinux activated by default

456018
ssd	sata
also before entering setup the computer would usually list off the ssd and my cd drive my two sata drives and then list 3rd master hard disk error and prompt me to press f1

456018
ssd	sata
after checking that everything was functioning i decide to put back the screws holding the ssd in place my case is home-built out of wood and noticed that the ssd was upside-down relative to how the case was designed to hold it it sits on its side and when it is upside-down the sata cable is in the way of a screw

456018
ssd	sata
trying different sata connectors on the motherboard sometimes gets it to run but the cd drive seems to work fine from the sata connector the ssd usually uses except that it tries to open my arcade games in itunes

456018

bad sata or power connector on ssd

it happens whether i m connected through ethernet or wireless

456113
ethernet	wireless
when i run a repeated ping test i can see it time out on the ethernet or wireless connection every 4-6 seconds but when i set it to ping google for example there is no timeout

456124
post	get
the guy at the shop was certain i d be able to boot off the ide harddrives using this card but even with the card removed from the system i still can t get the motherboard to post it should beep and complain about not being able to detect any harddrives right

456141
robocopy	xcopy
if you list of 500 000 files are just all the files under c somepath you can just use robocopy instead of xcopy + for statement

456149
sudo	passwd
when you at least have sudo access to the machine you can use sudo bash to aquire a root shell and passwd afterwards

filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	fat
but it s probably safe to assume that your hdd was formatted prepared using an ntfs or fat type filesystems

udp	tcp
this can be achieved by configuring a firewall to allow only connections to the vpn provider s ip and or the tcp port 1723 and the udp port 47

456366
subnet	packets
you might be able to connect the cable modem to a lan port in the router shut off dhcp in the router give the router a static ip that s on the same subnet as the modem but not taking the modem s ip and see if it will route packets appropriately between your computer and the cable modem

456388

for our college-owned computers at least i would like to disable the warnings in ie firefox safari and google-chrome for just that specific insecure content and in just those specific pages where we ve included it

456411
rss	feed
before if i go to a rss feed .xml file chrome displays it

456411
rss	feed
however now chrome forces me to view the feed using a rss reader

456430
move	drag
the solution i came up with in case it benefits anyone else in the same situation was similar to lee s suggestion thanks to drag the folder s in question into a newly created folder within local folders called archived mails i think this copied over rather than move it i don t remember for sure but if it copies it you just have to delete the original once you re sure it s all move

456430
folder	directory
so the solution to that comes from going to tools account settings local folder and changing the local directory field there to somewhere outside your profile

456451
mouse	keyboard
a kvm switch would be preferable to this scenario as you could have audio video and keyboard mouse input change from vm to vm with a simple keybinding

456469
textmate	sublimetext
a quick review shows no existing sublimetext or textmate sublimetext supports the use of textmate bundles highlighters for cobol

456469
notepad++	sublimetext
my only suggestion is to examine the cobol highlighter file for notepad++ and manually convert it to sublimetext s xml format

456471
onenote	ms-office
if you are a ms-office user see if you have access to microsoft onenote which includes a quick screen-grab shortcut

456482
unix	bsd
hard and symbolic links are also found in many other filing systems including all of the unix like os s linux bsd mac etc.

456489
cpu	processors
cpu is synonymous for most with multi-core processors which i suspect you are more likely to be asking about

456489
cpu	processors
a bad core is effectively marked unusable and its responsibilities are distributed to other cores less cores means your processors has fewer total cpu cycles available and therefore it will be slower to perform work

456496
cpu	irq
interrupt controller has an internal data structure - interrupt dispatch table that contains a pointer to a routine that is supposed to be executed by the cpu for a particular irq

456500
cpu	processors
you did not mention beeps so post beep codes are not helpful but this means that it cannot run at all and since you are not even sure about the cpu the processors may not even be compatible with that motherboard causing it to do absolutely nothing

456507
mouse	keyboard
the only problem is if i go to the server room and try to login into the terminal server via the keyboard and mouse they do not work so the actual mouse physically connected to the server

456507
mouse	keyboard
it s only as soon as windows 2003 starts up and you get to the login screen there is no mouse or keyboard working

456507
mouse	keyboard
uninstall reinstall keyboard mouse

456524
titlebar	window
over the titlebar of a window closes the window can be made more sensitive to specific window areas - see shimanov s post

456531
wan	lan
tech support knew that it had two addresses one for lan and one for wan

456531
wan	lan
but it doesn t make sense that the lan address would change to the wan

456539
google-chrome	firefox
i ve tried firefox google-chrome ie even booted ubuntu and tried opening them

456559
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
for our college-owned computers at least i would like to disable the warnings in ie firefox safari and google-chrome for just that specific insecure content and in just those specific pages where we ve included it

456559
google-chrome	firefox
as far as i know there s no way to do this in firefox or google-chrome

456585
post	get
recently my pc just randomly crashed and upon restart would not barely get past post screen and get stuck on detecting ide drives...

456591
debian	linux
that s a disaster waiting to happen - debian already has an extraordinarily long support cycle by linux standards well beyond the individual support cycles of many of the packages in debian and maintaining security in such an environment is no small task

456643
debian	linux
take a look at the disk throughput of this two disk software raid 1 array in a linux 2.6.26-2-686 debian system

456681

how did it get removed from the path and how should i put it back

456689
xfce	gnome
the only problem in this case is that you will have to re-add your key when logging on again into gnome or xfce

456736
installation	upgrade
how often do you guys upgrade your debian testing installation

456749
freebsd	linux
neither the gnu linux version nor the version from freebsd ports will work

456749
vmware	bootcamp
use bootcamp and run vmware from the other os

456749
virtualbox	parallels
use other products such as a href rel noreferrer virtualbox or a href rel noreferrer parallels

456749
vmware	virtualbox
virtualbox can use virtual hard disks in vmware s vmdk format like so

456776
sudo	passwd
sudo this command impersonates a user and executes a command but you need to know the invoking user s passwd and the invoking user must have sudo privileges

456776
kde	gnome
grawity adds that most kde and gnome applications use polkit to manage authorization which usually uses the wheel group for administrator privileges

456784
hide	show
however in the â œ show hide â tab itâ s not grey but the check box for thumbnails just canâ t â œholdâ my selection

456789
mouse	keyboard
the problem with this is that the display turns on when i move my mouse or type something in the keyboard like controlling spotify

456801
cpu	processors
this is different for each cpu or family of cpus so you will want to find the datasheet for your particular processors before changing anything

456801
cpu	processors
i m lucky that my cpu fan keeps the processors

456803
disk	ram
i am using a command like so to create a ram disk

456803
disk	ram
this works succesfully and i get a volumes ram disk mounted on my system that i can use that is mounted from dev disk5 or some such place

456810
macbook	bootcamp
a macbook pro late 2011 wtih bootcamp running in win 7 the bootcamp partition started to give problems corrupted data i recon so i tried running several programs hd regenerator windows 7 installing cd for repairing knoppix 7 testdisk stellar data recovery mac utility disk...etc etc... but most of them didnâ t work since macbooks dont have bios therefore couldnâ t access the bootcamp partition

456810
macbook	bootcamp
to my surprise it would never restart again not in macos neither in bootcamp instead i had the interrogation mark while booting the macbook pro

456873
kde	gnome
if you add x kde gnome then you want a lot more

456879
debian	linux
the best way would be to use a lightweight linux distro which still has support arch linux slackware a basic debian install etc... and lightweight apps a window manager like openbox with mostly terminal text-only applications

456924
apache	nginx
this can be done using either a dedicated proxy tool or via mod_proxy in apache other web servers such as nginx can also do it

456935
google-chrome	firefox
you can do this if your browser supports user scripts such as google-chrome or firefox via a plugin

456937
ubuntu	centos	put	get
here s a write up that i put together explaining how to get tinc working on ubuntu windows 7 and centos

457029
mp3	wav
first i would recommend you convert it to mp3 or wma but these courses seem to think that wav is the holy codec and will accept nothing else been there done that

457030
mp3	wav
i would suggest compressing your wav as an mp3 instead

457030
mp3	wav
even though compression for mp3 is lossy such information loss isn t likely to affect the perceived quality of a voice recording at all provided you compress your wav file at say an mp3 bitrate of 128kbps or higher

457030
mp3	wav
if compressing using mp3 or another audio-specific algorithm isn t acceptable you could reduce the sampling rate or other parameters in your wav recording

457036
udp	tcp
when using a ssh tunnel with remote port forwarding for tcp and udp connections see below i d set it to 13

457036
udp	tcp
this allows outgoing tcp and incoming tcp and udp peer-to-peer connections

457036
udp	tcp
if you install socat on you server apt-get install socat and on your client machine using socat for windows you can transform incoming udp connections to tcp connections forward them through the tunnel and convert them back to udp connections on your client machine

457041
ubuntu	linux
but i like to work on linux ubuntu

if this is the first time you ve done it since you upgrade to mountain lion you may have discovered that apple removed web sharing from the regular client versioning of os x

457149
folder	dir
after some digging around this morning i think that s normal behaviour when you delete something that is on a mounted drive...it goes into a dir .trash folder where dir is the root of the mounted volume

457177
ethernet	wireless
i had this nokia siemens adsl wireless router with 4 ethernet ports

457207
wan	lan
the maximum speed for a router s wan and lan ports should appear prominently in its specifications

457330

plus you can t upgrade a 32-bit installation to 64bit and your new pc probably has more then 4 gb of ram or you at least want to option to upgrade this latter

457340
versioning	upgrade
i recently upgrade to photoshop cs6 and imported my actions from my previous versioning

457350
filesystems	ntfs
you can use ntfs the native filesystems of windows starting around windows nt up through windows 7

457350
filesystems	ntfs
there are filesystems drivers for mac os x to read and write to ntfs volumes

457350
filesystems	fat
i would recommend almost any filesystems over fat fat32 exfat because none of the fat type filesystems have a data journal

457384
mouse	keyboard
can you use xbox360 controller and chat pad messenger pad as a mouse and keyboard

457384

the log shows no signs of starting vpn tunnel when i trying to access the remote network

457569
gif	png
also to address what indrek wrote in the comment on your question i assume you have a typo there and don t mean to download a gif file into a file called .png â just changing the extension will not automatically make it a png

457569
gif	png
gif and png use different encodings and you will have to use any kind of image conversion tool to convert between these formats

457629
ati	nvidia
i have seen a lot of questions on this site asking about updating ati and nvidia graphics for laptops with some very good solutions for them however i have not seen any questions answers for people only have intel integrated graphics

457629
ati	nvidia
is there any way to use tweaked or replacement drivers with intel like you can with ati and nvidia

457630
ati	nvidia
nvidia ati and intel may all have the ability to redirect or hard set certain outputs by tweaking the video driver of newer hardware at least

457635
disk	ram
- re-seating the ram got the pc to boot from usb windows 7 boot disk

457651
ati	nvidia
fyi intel makes graphics chips just like nvidia and ati do

457665
ubuntu	linux
and in case you didn t know you can boot to a fully functioning although somewhat sluggish system when booting from a live linux distribution such as ubuntu

457699

457870
sudoers	passwd
anyway you can modify the sudoers file in such a way that it won t require a passwd for one command

457870
sudo	passwd
now the user username can run the command with sudo path to command and doesn t need to enter a passwd to do that

457872
backgrounding	multitasking
i don t need any multitasking capability and am fine closing out of other apps if it s needed to preserve video playback but backgrounding os tasks aforementioned av updating and whatnot should not hang playback

457884
subnet	packets	arp	dhcp
putting the network interface in promiscuous mode will allow you to pick up arp broadcasts which will tell you which ip addresses are used but the subnet mask will still be hit-or-miss since only dhcp packets would contain information about that

457890
versioning	upgrade
i ve upgrade the oem versioning of xp to windows 7 with the cheaper upgrade edition before without any problem and unless microsoft s said otherwise i would think that it would be the same way for windows 8

457890
versioning	upgrade
windows xp vista and 7 are all available in oem versioning and since oem versioning make up the majority of windows sales i think microsoft would ve found a few words to say that oem versioning weren t eligible for the upgrade if that s what they were planning

457912
folder	directory
check for application folder in your program files directory

457936
versioning	upgrade
will it be possible to upgrade from windows 8 rc to the rtm versioning

457988
ethernet	wireless
i noticed that no network interfaces were available but since the wireless card requires a specific driver and i wasn t attached to the ethernet i thought nothing of it

457988
ethernet	wireless
now the flags are going up because i know for a fact that the ethernet eth0 and the wireless wlan0 were at least listed if not operational before

458005
ubuntu	linux
out of curiosity why is it a lot faster to delete a folder folders in linux i m using ubuntu over ssh by calling rm -rf somefolder than deleting the folder from the gui right-click then move to trash

458054
yacc	bison
spend some time learning lex flex and yacc bison or some similar parser toolkit

458059
bash	zsh
change start up shell from default usr bin login to bin bash -l or usr bin zsh if you use zsh

458060
wan	lan
if all you did was disable the dhcp server but not set it to bridge mode then you left the nat gateway code running so the router considers its wan port to be a different network than its lan and wlan ports

458084
arp	dhcp
i can t access the failing router as this only respond on his default address which is obscured by the master dhcp and at the same time i cannot change the arp entry of computer from the central to the rouge router as this link is required for remote session to work

458085
chown	sudo
unfortunately for now the only way to gain access to this device is to sudo chown user it to your current user each time you insert the device however this is not recommended unless you really understand what you re doing

this will recursively search through all the folder in your current directory

458186
ethernet	wireless
for example i m trying to connect to my works wireless network there is currently no ethernet drvier installed so this is a no no and i m logging in under the local administrator account and it keeps saying validating.. then it ll switch to authenticating user but obviously this isn t going to work because it s a local user account and not one on the network

458205
udp	tcp	udp	tftp	tftp	tcp
ftp also uses tcp only tftp uses udp ports

458229
vpn	lan
most probably your default network interface your nic has the lowest metric so the games broadcast on your 192.168.1.0 24 lan instead of the vpn

458229
vpn	lan
this will get games like warcraft iii or anno 1404 to broadcast to the vpn instead of to the local lan successfully tested with a debian openvpn server and several windows 7 clients

xxd -r will convert the hex bytes back to binary format which gives you this

458341
filesystems	ntfs
the latter is a user-space filesystems which has been around for many years and is very stable which can read and write ntfs reliably

458341
filesystems	ntfs
the ntfs filesystems driver is a kernel module in the linux kernel that is much less mature and afaik does not provide write support nor can it handle volumes that have a dirty journal again afaik

choose the hdd as primary boot device followed by cd-rom floppy

458361
jobs	cron
for cron jobs i usually have it run a bash script instead of specifying the command directly in the crontab

458383
cpu	hyperthreading
i don t know what it looks like when it isn t shared because my computer only has shared caches but i d guess either just a single number or something like 0-0 . for example on my quad-core hyperthreading sandy bridge if i look at the l2 s shared_cpu_list i see 2-3 which tells me that it is shared with cpu2 which is actually the same physical cpu because of hyperthreading so it s not really a shared cache

458393

458422
tunnel	vpn
s1 is connected to pc1 via vpn tunnel and to s2 vie ssh

458586
cifs	smb
if a device presents itself using nas protocols say nfs or cifs smb then where the client is is irrelevant it s ip-based so the client could be right next to the device on the same network or across the other side of the planet

458610
rss	feed
a typical example is new york times through flickr 1 a pipe which takes the new york times rss feed and adds a photo from flickr based on the keywords of each item

458721
debian	linux
i m running debian linux and the file to be patched does not even exist on my system

458764

modern browsers such as firefox and google-chrome are able to shutdown and restore the same group of tabs they had before the next time you open them and even sometimes remember additional tab state such as scroll position within the tab

458816
put	get
of course the directory where you put it has to be in your load-path or you could just add load path to new tex-mode.el to your .emacs which would ensure you don t get the old version

bonjour	avahi
yes ideally you run an ietf zeroconf implementation avahi apple bonjour etc. on each device and each device responds to service discovery requests and hostname-to-ip-address resolution requests itself

459058
bonjour	avahi
avahi implements ietf zeroconf networking which apple calls bonjour

459058

put	get
when you put a screen protector on it it ought to be nice and smooth or at least as smooth as the material can get

daemons	launchd
to replace the auto-launched x11 one would unload the apple x11 plist and load the macports x11 plist which would change who gets to set the display variable and which x11 daemons is launchd

459273
pop-up	dialog
however the old launch agent plist from apple that would launch their x11 does not appear to be there anymore a dialog pop-up to get you to install xquartz and that dialog is intercepting launches of x11 apps

udp	tcp
ip bypassing tcp and udp in doing so

459920
decoder	encoder
in contrast to that if you call -vcodec libx264 or -c v libx264 the syntax you should use because vcodec is deprecated ffmpeg will be forced to decoder the video bitstream from msmpeg4 to a raw format then pipe it into x264 a h.264 encoder

if your network uses only ipv4 the problem could be that debian linux is first trying to connect via ipv6 without success before passing on to ipv4 and succeeding

460171
wan	lan
the packet is received whenever i send from the wan or lan

460171
wan	lan
and i reiterate the packet shows it is being received from the wan with the computer on but the packet only turns on the computer when the packet originates from inside the lan

460180
wan	multicast
this is a common problem if you your router isn t multicast the wol package received by your wan port

460180
packets	multicast
so the solution is configure your router to multicast the magic packets right

bonjour	avahi
is there a windows free libre software analoguous to gnu linux avahi-browse or avahi-discover which would discover avahi bonjour services on the local network and list them

460310
bonjour	avahi
since i have problems with windows and ubuntu 12.04 seeing discovering each other s samba services similar to ubuntu samba server not discovered by windows 7 unable to browse shares on a windows 7 x64 computer i d better not try to solve these problems but better go with more familiar protocols to make and discover services ssh sftp ftp on lan like avahi bonjour

460313
daemons	launchd
sudo apachectl start also enables the launchd daemons

460367

put	get
i know that i can put the information for start up commands in etc rc.local but i don t know how to get the dynamic id

460400
filesystems	ntfs
if you buy another hdd it will be safe from contamination from windows with the exception of maybe a folder if the filesystems is ntfs

460411
versioning	upgrade
see if you can upgrade ffmpeg to a newer versioning

460415
hash	md5
suggestion using md5 hash to compare filetime stamp does it make sense

460423
avisynth	libav
your output indicates that the input file is being decoded as raw instead of using the proper libav avisynth or ffms decoder

460436
ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	linux
for linux try something that will work out of ox like mint ubuntu or knoppix or especially kernel 3.2 and above

460447
ssd	sata
as you state when you reorient the ssd while the system is running and your system freeze bsod your issue sound like a bad sata cable

460447

i must stress actually that although the guide that i put the link to on this post does talk about turning php globally off i haven t done this

i m not much familiar with unix linux platform but i m sure you can use similar hacks with programs like gedit or emacs

460493
folder	directory
what i am trying to do is rename folder that are anywhere in the current tree not neccessarily directly in the working directory

460550
cpu	affinity
some other application on your machine installed an extension that runs inside of explorer and it is setting the cpu affinity

460550
cpu	affinity
i don t believe that there is anything built into windows that saves cpu affinity settings

460559
xfce	gnome
there s no way i will get anywhere close to gnome for this and as i am running xfce on my primary system anyway it seems to be a logical choice for candidacy

460559
xfce	gnome
i remember having heard somewhere that a gui of any sort will prove to be somewhat of a drain on system resources in a server context but i thought i would check if this applies to the very lightweight xfce environment as well as to more bulky options such as gnome

460567
sudo	passwd
sudo passwd

460584
hash	md5
now compare that to the md5 hash on the download page

460592
ethernet	wireless
if possible tell me the ip you get when joining wireless and joining via ethernet

460593
mouse	keyboard
you must use wireless keyboard and mouse such as logitech wireless keyboard and mouse with unified receiver

460593
mouse	keyboard
or microsoft remote desktop wireless keyboard and mouse sets

460593
mouse	keyboard
most of the kvm switch which based on usb keyboard and mouse emulation technology can not emulate the multi-function or special usb wireless communication

460617
sudo	passwd
it doesn t make sense to me that after authorising myself by logging in i then have to separately authorise myself to sudo potentially typing the passwd twice

460617
sudo	passwd
so i would ideally like to configure sudo such that after authorising myself whether via a console login an ssh passwd login or an ssh key login sudo is unlocked for 15 minutes as if i had typed a passwd for the sudo command

460617
sudo	passwd
i suppose the disadvantages are that i unlock sudo on every login regardless of whether i want to use sudo and allowing sudo for ssh key logins could allow someone who compromised a private key to use sudo despite not knowing the passwd which would i suppose delegate the security of the machine to the security of the private key

460631
ubuntu	linux
as a newbie to ubuntu and linux back then i was used to seeing a graphical report of my disk usage in windows

460631

there was a time though that i messed up during installation of an upgrade from 9.10 to 10.04

460652
unix	bsd
i m not hugely knowledgeable with unix bsd file permissions

460655

460665
trojan	virus
finally check for trojan virus that can insidiously take up bandwidth without your knowing it

460669
mtu	pppoe
i will agree that the mtu appears to be the problem however i do not know how to change it for a dynamic connection type which i have since the above instructions were for a pppoe connection which i don t have

460687
mouse	keyboard
the user controls the mouse and keyboard to show us the problem they are having then it controls the mouse and keyboard from the help desk while the user watches to fix the problem

460709
ubuntu	linux
it will work if you are connecting two computers from straight cat 5 and one computer must have linux os ubuntu

i have photoshop and coreldraw on a windows 7 x64 machine if that matters

460763
bash	tcsh
as far as i know neither bash nor tcsh do that either

460806
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu and debian s apt-get like most other package managers will always allow only one instance at a time to run you can t install two things simultaneously

460824

460856
width	height
i want to determine its quality based on bit rate bit depth height width encoding etc

460865
width	height
the one factor that will give you a good idea of video quality regardless of height width framerate depth is bits pixel frame or bpf

460865
width	height
also assuming a similar codec and bpf then the video with a better height width framerate is naturally going to be better if your output screen tv can support that resolution framerate

460872
installation	upgrade
the benefits are ease of installation and you can easily get security updates via apt-get update upgrade

460885
pop-up	dialog
mountain lion has this wonderful feature where running java pop-up a dialog prompting the user to install java if it is not already installed

460908
folder	directory
its executes sucessfully but no . ssh folder is created in my root home directory

460954
put	get
in the builder select the folder with your xp sp3 as source and add the folder where you put _07b-ahci-sata-forpe.reg and iaahci.inf as source for custom files so they get included in the bartpe disc we build

460977
antivirus	norton
go into the lol replay installation directory and find the file before norton 360 grabs it and changes its name to something ambiguous right click it and except it from the antivirus manually that way

460982
switching	screens
i am currently using the default administrator account but since it doesn t show in the welcome screens i want to switching to a new account

460988
windows	winpe	put	get
the long way around is to get a copy of your usb 3.0 drivers and unpack the winpe package and if you want unpack the windows 7 package stick the driver inf files into their driver caches and repackage them and put the updated package back on the install disc

461006

461067
debian	linux	debian	mint
i know that there are configuration files in etc x11 xsession.d because i configured a debian based thinclient s resolution in a file called etc x11 xsession.d 91configure_display but that file doesn t exist in my linux mint vm

461083
daemons	launchd
this can be solved for macs by using launchd to automatically launchd and kill or in some way change the behavior of whatever daemons is used for syncing when the images are mounted and unmounted

461091
folder	directory
names of files might be garbled or useless and directory structure and folder names will be lost but at least everything will be there

461094
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
actually it s probably already too late because browsers such as firefox google-chrome and safari store large cache databases and profile information databases that cause very frequent small writes to the disk

rpm	zypper
zypper rpm are also broken

461117
pull	push
i have configured git so i can pull push via ssh authorization via public key

461119
ubuntu	linux
due to licensing concerns ubuntu does not ship certain chipsets native linux drivers even though they are open source.

461122
ubuntu	opensuse
the safest way to do this is to use the opensuse suse 11.1 live cd as the rescue system and not something weird and old like ubuntu 8.04 or suse 10

461132
min	max
gpu both chips have the same on-chip gpu it has the same min max clock frequency and the same number of execution units

461132
disk	ram
lots of ram allows the system s page cache to load most all of the file into ram thus reducing disk grinding during encoding and eliminating the disk as a potential bottleneck

461136
traceroute	packets	icmp	udp
a traceroute works by limiting the ttl on a udp most oses traceroute or icmp in the case of windows tracert packets and if a machine is configured to not return the icmp time exceeded message your machine will see this as packets loss

461140
vmware	virtualbox
one last idea since it s usb you could try installing a linux virtual machine using vmware workstation or virtualbox and give the usb scanner over to the guest which lets the guest os fully access the device and use its own driver even if the host os doesn t have a driver

461194
debian	centos
i m using centos 6 right now to attempt to delete the files but most of the files were written using a debian distribution i m not entirely sure which version whatever clonezilla uses

titlebar	window
after installing teamviewer a titlebar button is added to every window

461247
tunnel	vpn
we want only the directories on our intranet to be go through the vpn tunnel and all other traffic to go direct out

461267
wan	lan
for the ones that do you probably have to use the wan port to connect the two routers as the lan ports are behind a switch chip and cannot be configured individually which means you ll have no access to an external network unless you do a more complicated configuration

461293

under the general tab click the accessibility button and then check the checkbox labeled format documents using my style sheet

if you have a mac share your wireless connection with your ethernet connection and connect you slingbox to the ethernet port

macbook	bootcamp
i am trying to find the bios boot manager for my windows vista bootcamp partition of my macbook

another way may be to save the file as a gif or bmp with compression

i will have to put together a slave desktop to test this further but since i can get into load screen for the os and the bios sees the hdd and see files under linux i don t think this is the problem

opensuse	mint	opensuse	linux	ubuntu	opensuse	ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	linux
my recommendation is to go with the latest stable release of ubuntu linux mint opensuse or fedora

461539
cpu	processors
but they lack a dedicated processors to do the calculations and depend on software within the operating system to tell the cpu to do them which is why you still have to tell linux about your bios raid

461539
put	get
it s at this point when you get down to the last remaining disk that i would recommend having an expert or do it yourself if you re good at hardware remove the platters from the original disk buy a new disk of identical make model put the platters in there and read off the data using the new disk

461586
versioning	upgrade
when we upgrade to our new versioning of office it said our communciator contacts will be nuked

461614
ethernet	wireless
also consumer home gateway products that happen to have a usb file sharing port thrown in as an afterthought don t always contain a fast enough embedded cpu to really handle the work of file sharing at the same time as everything else especially handling the wireless interface which tends to be a cpu-intensive interface compared to ethernet on most designs

originally it seemed as if it was not possible to use hotmail with thunderbird in an imap or imap like fashion without some hacks the webmail plugin etc. and it seemed the best method was to use a gmail account configured as imap and read in the hotmail account as a pop3

461813
hash	md5
of course you must always check the md5 or sha1 or other hash to verify the true accuracy of the downloaded file

461813
hash	md5
according to tails linux tails.boum.org recommendation you should if absolutely paranoid about it download same file repeatedly to make sure you are able to generate same md5 sha1 hash to trust the servers from where you have downloaded the torrent action file

461814

if you want to upgrade the current windows from which you started the installation then you may have to do it by booting directly from the dvd

to upgrade your windows installation you must boot into windows and install from there

461904
installation	upgrade
to perform an upgrade you can t start or boot your computer from the windows 7 installation media

but to my understanding it will always be an upgrade installation when performed from a booted windows installation

but if you can get all the requisite apache modules loaded into a single instance of apache sufficient to run both apps then yes you just have to put each application in a separate path within the document root var www airtime and var www cast and it ll just work

462067
cpu	processors
cpu and processors bus

462080
cpu	processors
looks to me like the cpu needs to go through the processors bus northbridge and pci bus to get to southbridge

462081
cpu	processors
for instance intel s new processors with the qpi bus talk to a chip that is similar to a traditional northbridge except that it lacks a memory controller and talks to the cpu over the qpi bus which replaces the traditional front side bus fsb

in general though your eclipse instances will probably use relatively fewer resources cpu ram disk than either the database or jboss instances

462540

assuming the developers are physically located in the vicinity of the server would it be feasible to set up a multi-seat box with multiple display keyboard mouse sets and assign a guest keyboard mouse and display head to each user

462540
mouse	keyboard
the upside is that you don t have to have desktop pcs for each person just a monitor keyboard mouse

462540
mouse	keyboard
so if you decide later on to bring in another developer who works in another part of the world they won t be able to easily join your existing setup by just pulling up a chair and bringing a keyboard mouse monitor

462541
disk	ram
i m really annoyed by not being able to do a few jobs at a time even if i have plenty of ram and cpu left to utilise - so it s the disk usage for example when i am extracting big archives using winrar or other disk-write-hungry stuff

as part of a recent windows update the irritating and intrusive intellipoint microsoft mouse software now seems to have been replaced by the even more irritating and intrusive microsoft mouse and keyboard center sic

the option to do this has disappeared from the mouse control panel to be replaced by a link which opens up said mouse and keyboard center

the md5 hash or checksum functions as a compact digital fingerprint of a file

462895
hash	md5
as with all such hashing algorithms there is theoretically an unlimited number of files that will have any given md5 hash

463908
hash	md5
one thing you can do to troubleshoot what s going on is to use md5 or sha-1 hash of that zip file

463908
hash	md5
using cygwin you can compute a sha-1 or md5 hash of your zip file then publish the result

463908
hash	md5
publishing an md5 or sha-1 hash is a very common thing to do in the software development world since it s a very good way to ensure that you re files aren t corrupted

463908
hash	md5
after publishing the md5 sha-1 hash you could have your customers take a hash of the zip to see if it s actually corrupted or not

463908
hash	md5
there are plenty of utilities out there for windows linux and mac that will generate md5 and sha-1 hash

463933
parallels	bootcamp
one positive is that bootcamp is much better with battery life running windows 7 then parallels or fusion which i typically thought was terrible

463952
filesystems	ntfs
using gpt is my fall-back option but it creates a partition that is slightly smaller than the ntfs partition so i wouldn t be able to just dd the filesystems on the partition

disk	ram
i think the problem is that my system is using ram as write cache i got 32 gb ram instead of memory on the card and when i close the system it do not have enough time to write to the disk

464073
ftp	telnet
if i connect with telnet to the router i see it already has in bin folder httpd and ftpd ftp binaries

464076
disk	ram
if all the drivers are working correctly and programs are calling the appropriate functions when data important to them needs to be written to disk then it is fairly difficult to lose data by having it hang around in system ram

464076
filesystems	ntfs
so even if a program misbehaves and writes important data without explicitly telling the operating system to flush it to disk ntfs the filesystems will catch it in a short period of time and push it out to the media anyway

464076
disk	ram
if a driver is not behaving properly or a program is inducing a driver to misbehave and you get a bluescreen right before shutting down it may be failing to flush all the pages from ram to the disk controller or the controller may think that it needs to throw out the writes rather than flushing them to disk

464081
putty	winscp
you can download a copy on your pc modify it and then ssh it back to the router via sftp see putty or winscp if you re a windows user

i have 8 gb of ram and would like to allocate about 1.5 gb for a ram disk mainly to use for chrome and possibly some other things later

464083
disk	ram
what differences are there between fat16 fat32 and ntfs for a ram disk

464086
filesystems	ntfs
or dev disk by-uuid foo to select by the filesystems s unique id for ntfs it looks like a 16-letter hash

464104
disk	ram
let s consider the file systems applicability to a ram disk by attributes

464104
disk	ram
if you are meaning to cause your ram disk to eventually persist back to disk you would need your ram disk software to periodically write any changes back to a hard disk backup file so that if you reboot you don t lose too much data

464104
disk	ram
if you were to cause the ram disk backup file to be constantly overwritten you d be totally defeating the purpose of the ram disk because that would be the same as just writing the files straight to the hdd in the first place

464104
disk	ram
so in other words any data stored in the ram disk should be considered expendable if your system turned off right now the data would be gone for any writes to the ram disk which occur between the synchronization point s to the persistent media your hard disk

464104
disk	ram
if you don t want your ram disk to be file-backed at all and can afford to lose the data whenever then disregard data safety entirely

464104
filesystems	ntfs
ntfs it has a feature called journaling which basically means that the filesystems is always in a consistent state

464104
disk	ram
this is great for non-volatile media like hard disk and ssds but it is useless for ram disk

464104
disk	ram
ntfs performance of ntfs is probably quite competitive as a ram disk compared to fat16 or fat32 due to the use of more advanced algorithms for data accounting and indexing

464104
disk	ram
even though ntfs does have a journal which slows it down somewhat the cost of the journal is even lower in ram than it is on the hard disk

464104
filesystems	ntfs
however the filesystems uses fairly naive algorithms for managing and indexing data compared to ntfs so the performance-due-to-simplicity may be partially or completely offset by the lack of performance due to the absence of robust algorithms

464104
filesystems	ntfs
some programs that use very special features of the filesystems may not work unless you are using ntfs

my os is windows xp and filesystems is fat

468136
put	get
you can get the current terminal with the tty command so you can put something like this in the user s .bash_profile file

468147
udp	tcp
if you don t know if your http server is tcp and or udp you should drop udp too

468179
versioning	upgrade
as of this morning i upgrade my firefox to versioning 15.0

468181
rpm	yum
yum rpm and several other commands are not there anymore

468181
rpm	yum
i have no idea on how to re-install yum and rpm

468181
rpm	yum
i feel like if i could get rpm or yum back everything will start setting itself in place

468191
ati	nvidia
i m pretty sure that some old video drivers ati nvidia used to support this feature natively years ago but i can t seem to find anything about it anymore

468192
children	parent
one is a full list of parent and their associated children

468203
folder	directory
using active directory i want a specific user to only have read write access to a specific sub-folder of a parent folder

468247
portrait	landscape
dragging files to desktop printer causes them to print out in portrait when they should be landscape and they therefore don t fit on the page

468293
filesystems	hfs+
the mac os x hfs+ native filesystems would work fine since your volume is definitely capable of discretionary access controls and any other filesystems features that os x relies on

468294
pop-up	dialog
i used to be able to type in powershell and windows explorer would pop-up with a login dialog

468324
debian	linux	debian	mint	ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	linux
although jmreicha s solution will work if you want to install from source the easiest way to install most programs on any debian derived system including ubuntu and linux mint is to use apt-get

468326
centos	linux
i moved a perl cgi script from an old redhat linux box to a more recent centos linux box and certain system commands no longer work

468330
udp	tcp
the ports for bit torrent traffic are tcp 6881-6889 6969 and 8080 and to insure blocking it make sure that udp 1024-65534 are also blocked

468348
gentoo	debian	gentoo	linux	debian	linux
comparison with other distros doesn t speak about installing a local .deb in debian or whatever is gentoo s equivalent or alpine linux s .apk

468348
debian	linux
simple more-or-less obvious searches such as how to install apk on alpine linux returns something weird or android stuff making alpine linux look like it doesn t exist in the first place -or- doesn t support installing a downloaded package like you can do in debian with dpkg

468349
chown	sudo
i would start with sudo chown -r root bin sbin lib usr sys boot etc dev from inside the chroot - this should get you a bootable system but i m not 100 sure

468349
chgrp	chmod	chown	chgrp	chown	chmod
note if you simply chown d the files you re in a much better position than someone who chmod d or chgrp d their system

468349
chown	sudo
try sudo chown root var run tmp note the lack of -r for those directories

468355
multiplying	add
this will take all the rows in the name1 column that equal 1 add up their corresponding counter values and multiplying by the variable

468358
folder	directory
is there a way to make word use a different directory as the current folder in the insert hyperlink dialog so i don t have to go through this

468359
min	max
such as min assigned max and virtual cpu definitions of an lpar

468382
srt	subtitle
but not all subtitle formats are usually supported srt etc and this varies from vendor to vendor

468409
ubuntu	centos
that s how i ve done it with centos and ubuntu server

468414
textmate	bbedit
as i don t have bbedit here s my applescript solution for passing files on to textmate

468456
hex	binary	octal	binary	octal	decimal	octal	hex
to know what is actually in the file i would like to look at the binary contents of the file or at least a couple thousand bytes of the file preferablely in hex though i could work with decimal or octal

468458
hex	binary
fc b ie file compare in binary mode to compare this file with another completely different file and it will show you the hex values of each byte that is different

468515
google-chrome	firefox
it syncs between ie google-chrome and firefox

468525
ubuntu	linux
i m new to linux and just installed ubuntu 12.04 amd64 this month

468618
asterisk	pbx
ps it is a asterisk server pbx

468642
packets	pcap
i have a pcap which contains only tcp packets

468662
vbscript	jscript
it would be best if it either is a built-in solution like a jscript or vbscript snippet or something that does not require installation

468663
ftp	smb
how to install mc midnight commander with samba support smb link like ftp

468668
centos	linux	debian	linux	debian	centos
osx is like the kdc is nowhere to be found and at the same time my test machines with windows 7 and some linux centos 6 debian 6 machines have no problems whatsoever

468672
ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	linux
so i downloaded it on my linux ubuntu 12.04 machine in case unetbootin doesn t run on mint for some reason and am getting the same results

468681
ssd	sata
once-and-only-once copy off photos videos to an internal sata solid state drive ssd

468693
folder	directory
replace the cache folder moved in the recovered files directory back in their original location replace a couple of missing userchrome.css files with some others from a previous backup and delete that sessionstore-1.js

468695
irc	xmpp
its aim is to provide a good integration in this text-based irc client and a good support of xmpp the jabber protocol

468697
ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	linux
edit - i m on linux mint and or linux ubuntu i m in front of 2 machines right now so a solution for either of those oses would suffice

468700
tunnel	vpn
break out the vpn and enable split tunnel of data

468700
tunnel	vpn
how to force split tunnel routing on mac to a cisco vpn

468715
filesystems	ntfs
ntfs supports metadata journaling which although not completely failsafe does mitigate certain types of potential filesystems errors

468716
disk	ram
by redirecting all write requests to either a separate disk partition or ram ewf allows the run-time image to maintain the appearance of a writeable run-time image

468730
vim	bbedit
my main holdup is that i can t open a directory like a project in vim which bbedit mac does so wonderfully

468777
nerdtree	netrw
however neither vim nor netrw nor nerdtree really have the concept of project so you may be interested in project.vim which goes a few steps further

468777
ctrlp	fuzzyfinder
i find plugins like fuzzyfinder lustyexplorer command-t or ctrlp my favorite a lot more useful

468787
mouse	keyboard
there are one type of kvm switch technology usb ddm - dynamic device mapping can pair multi unifying receivers and share unifying keyboard or mouse to many systems

468797
stdout	stderr
similarly error messages should not be mixed with normal stdout but written to stderr fd #2 instead using the redirection operator see the above example

468799
mouse	trackpad
i plugged a real mouse instead of using my laptop trackpad into the server and it started working

468816
google-chrome	firefox
this happens in both google-chrome and firefox

468821
mouse	keyboard
the weird thing is that synergy to use mouse and keyboard over the network works just by using the ips assigned to both pcs

468836
ssl	https
the same is true for any protocol other than http or https ssl

468859
mouse	keyboard
eventually i noticed that i can power on the pc by pressing keyboard or mouse and even moving mouse

468861
ethernet	wireless
you may encounter a device called a wireless bridge which is used to convert something like a game console s wired ethernet into wireless ethernet

468865
udp	tcp
you probably need to use netcat s -u option which tells it to work over udp instead of tcp

468876
ubuntu	linux
three computers are connected to the router two wired windows 7 boxes and a ubuntu linux box over wifi

468889
width	height
it will work for any height and width and also for any number of pages

468889
width	height
you only need to alter the first few parameters in this command to specify the height and width and orig_file_path

468893
versioning	upgrade
i know that the developer and consumer previews can t be upgrade to the final release versioning of windows 8 but i was under the impression that the release preview is the same as the rtm versioning

468893
versioning	upgrade
would it be appropriate to begin using it right away as my primary os and upgrade it to the final versioning on release day

468896
versioning	upgrade
to answer my own initial question yes you can upgrade from the release preview to the final versioning at a cost of 40 as long as your release preview was installed on top of an existing windows license not a clean install

468896
versioning	upgrade
so the question for me as a dreamspark user became is the versioning of windows 8 that s currently on dreamspark the release preview or is it the rtm final versioning requiring no 40 upgrade in the future

468896
versioning	upgrade
the answer to this appears to be that the dreamspark download is the rtm versioning and no upgrade will be required on retail release day

468899
installation	upgrade
in any upgrade scenario you can run the disk cleanup wizard to remove the previous installation in order to free up disk space

468913
google-chrome	firefox
some kind of google-chrome firefox add-on might do the trick but i couldn t find one for this purpose

468918
google-chrome	firefox
flash in firefox produces sound but google-chrome s flash doesn t work

468946
tunnel	vlan
the best scenario for me would be some sort of tunnel possibly vlan

468948
fflush	gets
if in that moment some other device already got the same ip the collision happens and the router fflush the connection so that each device gets its own ip

469009
ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	linux
note in my case i m using linux mint 13 iso but in picture is ubuntu it s depend...

469072
cpu	processors
if you pause the vm at the post or enter the bios configuration tool you will see the cpu load on the host being high 100 on a single-core processors 50 on a dual-core threaded etc. if you boot into dos in the vm the hostâ s cpu load remains high until you execute idle.com at which point it drops to 0

469100
google-chrome	firefox
unfortunately in both firefox and google-chrome shortcut ctrl + t does not work but others shortcuts work well

469113
spaces	delimiter
surely there must be a way to use a spaces without making it a parameter delimiter

469170
opera	google-chrome
normally i use opera but a certain cms i am managing fails to support it and works best in google-chrome due to gratuitous javascript

469176
putty	winscp
for some reason i have gotten the feeling that somehow the program putty could be less secure than the other ssh program i use to remotely connect to my server normally i use winscp

469176
putty	winscp
is putty any less secure than winscp or vice versa

469176
putty	winscp
my university which hosts this server suggests that i use winscp as i am a windows users but winscp does not allow the specific command htpasswd -c .htpasswd path which creates the file at the location replaced by path and then requests my input to create the username password so i used putty instead

469179
putty	winscp
putty and winscp use the same underlying ssh2 protocol the degree of security is mostly determined by this protocol

469179
putty	winscp
the two programs aren t really comparable winscp is a secure copy scp client putty comes with an equivalent called pscp but pscp is a command-line client not a gui client

469179
putty	winscp
there s probably no reason why you can t use both putty and winscp

469179
putty	winscp
i don t know of any current major security issue with putty or with winscp

469181
putty	winscp
winscp is for secure file transfers while putty is for secure remote shell access

469251
disk	ram
i heard something about using the excess ram as a ram disk and formatting that partition as swap but that doesn t seen like it will work

469279
filesystems	ntfs
windows can transparently compress files using a variant of lz77 before storing them to disk if using the ntfs filesystems

469280
folder	directory
i want to configure xampp to show all files and folder in a given directory even index files

469285
ubuntu	linux
master boot record linux bootloader i don t know which one is in ubuntu 12.4 parametrized by ubuntu 12.4

469327
vim	emacs
since my target for this question are folks experienced with emacs and not vim what and do is indent dedent visually selected text

469347
ethernet	wireless
due to the location of the wireless connection sometimes the signal is weak so i normally access one of the computer via the ethernet but my modem has only a single jack

469363
put	get
another example if i put the cursor at the end of 1.1.a and hit enter i should get a new 1.1.b and the original 1.1.b should be renamed to 1.1.c

469381
ethernet	wireless
since you re using physical ethernet the router doesn t have to be wireless though you probably won t save any by buying a wired-only router for a two-computer network

469393
ethernet	wireless
only the windows pc is multi-homed with a wireless nic that connects to the mifi wireless and an ethernet nic with a wired connection to the dlink router

469393
ethernet	wireless
the dlink permits both wired and wireless connections. i don t want to use windows internet connection sharing because i believe it will set up the ethernet nic as a gateway on 192.168.0.1 and a dhcp server

469410
folder	directory
use the mklink command line tool to create a directory link junction from a folder name on ssd to a folder on the microsd and then try to install skydrive sync to the ssd link folder

469494
maple	sage
sage is also great but perhaps closer to maple mathematica

469525
vmware	virtualbox
can i virtualize the arm under a windows environment with vmware or virtualbox or something

469536
cpu	processors
if a cpu temperature of 55 âºc and a gpu temperature of 63 â c is normal or not depends on the exact model fan control and if the processors are under load or not

469538
ubuntu	debian
while that automagically works in ubuntu debian wants me to locate a keymap file

469567
mp4	h.264
most up to date devices have a graphics chip that can handle hardware h.264 typically used in mp4 files decoding up to 1080p resolutions but older tablets and phones will not and so you may have to transcode the files if they are particularly high quality

469589
mouse	keyboard
user friendly text and block selection from keyboard or mouse copy paste text search in console

469636
mouse	keyboard
events can be acpi power button press mouse movements or clicks magic packets wake on lan or keyboard presses

469648
rss	feed
i believe it was envisioned to update media-style remote control displays with rss feed and possibly small attached displays on laptops themselves

469665
udp	tcp
forwarded ports 3074 88 and 53 both tcp and udp to the xbox

469677
versioning	upgrade
this is first time i am trying to upgrade the ram on my toshiba satellite l650 laptop running ubuntu 12.04 64 bit versioning

469677
ethernet	wireless	bluetooth	usb
system was not detecting the cooling fan wireless card ethernet card bluetooth usb ports e-sata in built card reader web camera and possibly many more things i didn t noticed

469707
google-chrome	firefox
the problem occurs in google-chrome mozilla firefox and internet explorer regardless of what java applet i am running

469708
filesystems	ntfs
q320081 you cannot delete a file or a folder on an ntfs filesystems volume

469756
ubuntu	linux
i set up an arch linux vm and a ubuntu vm ubuntu host both sharing the same .vdi like so i had in my mind a dual-boot situation

469762
google-chrome	firefox
i want google-chrome to directly open up transmission not transferring it to firefox

469765
google-chrome	firefox
set firefox or another browser as your default browser then set google-chrome back as the default browser again to have google-chrome re-register its file-types including magnet links

469806
ethernet	wireless
if i look in windows 8 s network connections page i can see it s created a virtual ethernet adapter and a network bridge and my wireless adapter is now bridged

469840
google-chrome	firefox
i assume that you are referring to a browser firefox google-chrome internet explorer etc where you typed 192.168.1.1 and configured your router

469886
mouse	keyboard
synergy lets you share the keyboard and mouse between desktops workspaces not screens

469898
google-chrome	firefox
so if you re viewing a site in firefox and keep seeing the old site trying google-chrome might solve the problem

469907
versioning	upgrade
if iâ m performing a an upgrade to windows 8 do i have to have the previous versioning installed or is just having the key enough

469907
versioning	upgrade
is it ossible to clean install the upgrade versioning of windows 8

469911
filesystems	ntfs
the type of the filesystems is ntfs

469917
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and firefox work fine as well however if i use the 32bit ie9 i am not able to run any javascript what so ever and adobe flash player states it is not installed even though i believe it is with the latest version of 11.4 integrating both 32bit and 64bit

469920
debian	linux
i use it to run 64-bit debian guest on a windows 7 host to be able to code for linux systems

469929
udp	tcp
the only protocol option is tcp udp create game or app link so i have set port forwarding up as protocol tcp port no 8080 i also experimented with port nos 80 port 7976

469932
ip-address	lan
if you configured the router to forward port 8080 to port 80 the url you have to use from outside your own lan would be something like where 123.45.67.89 would be replaced by the external ip-address of your router as shown by services such as whatsmyip.com

469936
youtube	vimeo
the purpose of this would be to stream specific parts of already uploaded videos from youtube or vimeo in a website

469951
afp	smb
windows speaks smb for file sharing not afp

469960
vbscript	jscript
if you want to do a built-in solution using jscript or vbscript then what you want to look for is file system monitoring using wmi event subscriptions

470002
ethernet	wireless
most wireless router have four downstream ports - you can use an ethernet cable to connect your computer with the router and also the laptop and mobile can connect over wireless from the same router

470014
ubuntu	debian
i haven t tried this using the ubuntu graphical installer but if you use the alternative iso which uses the debian text-mode installer it should be the same process

470016
folder	dir
use the rsync -e ssh switch to sync over ssh for example rsync -ave ssh src dir user hostname folder

470097

470147
tunnel	vpn
if you have a linux box at home and can deal with the bit of hassle of setting it up set up java etc. adito being renamed to openvpn als is a web-accessible ssl vpn relying on a java applet to do port-forwarding based tunnel to your home network

470148
google-chrome	firefox
here s the closest thing i ve found it s for firefox not google-chrome

470165
folder	directory
assumes that you changed directory into the extracted folder

470169
udp	tcp
so i guess my question is could i increase performance by using udp instead of tcp and by using an extra server to keep track of lost packets

470179
vmware	virtualbox
is there a light linux distro like puppylinux slitaz etc but which supports guest support software like vmware tools virtualbox additions

470189
vmware	virtualbox
any distribution that runs with xfce or lxce desktop managers will be very much light weighted and you will be able to use virtualbox and vmware with ease

470194
folder	dir
the dir command two lines down that pipes out to the file is just using the default dir which includes non-hidden non-system files and folder in the current folder

470200

i have recently installed a ocz vertex plus r2 vtxplr2-25sat2-120gb 2.5 120gb sata ii mlc internal solid state drive ssd 120 gb ssd

470250
debian	centos
if you take a minimal debian or centos installation you end up with an extremely small footprint system that you can then add things to like a desktop environment as you please

470274
mouse	keyboard
some time after booting up mouse stops working any keyboard key opens the right click context menu it becomes impossible for me to type anything

470275

i want to convert it to mp3 or ogg

470302

the microsoft file checksum integrity verifier tool is an unsupported command line utility that computes md5 or sha1 cryptographic hash for files

470314

however i can t seem to find any definite information that says i can t perform a upgrade installation

470352

opensuse	mint	opensuse	debian	opensuse	linux	debian	linux	debian	mint
problems both in linux debian gnu linux opensuse 12.1 linux mint 13 and windows windows xp windows 7 with various driver versions

470533
google-chrome	firefox
it actually runs smooth and takes less memory including windows to run than having firefox or google-chrome for that matter run standalone

470538
disk	ram
it would make it much nicer to recover from your crashes if your ram was written to disk periodically

470545
put	get
but note that in order to get the prompt for language you need to put the value in place of the language line that is in fact the language of the windows you are running the install from

470546
disk	ram
but i am not sure if this can work reliably since hibernation only stores information kept in ram but not the current disk filesystem state

470570
width	height
afterwards if customization is enabled the primary monitorâ s screen height and width are retrieved via calls to getsystemmetrics

470570
width	height
these values are used in the computation of the screen width w height h ratio

470588
google-chrome	firefox
saving passwords for pages that redirect on login google-chrome and firefox

470596
ubuntu	linux
other options would be an lts version of ubuntu but replacing unity with xfce or fluxbox for example or arch linux

470639
mouse	keyboard
wakeup is only enabled from the keyboard wake on mouse and wake-on-lan are both disabled

470664

acrobat	indesign
so when creating a pdf ideally using adobe indesign or acrobat but if other software or hacking is needed that s fine... is there a way to configure the pdf file itself so that when printed double-sided with default settings it flips on the short edge

470921
udp	tcp
and select protocl tcp udp

470926
debian	linux
my intent in a very near future is to set up a dual boot system with windows 8 and debian linux for testing purposes on a lenovo ideapad 205 that has uefi bios

470938
udp	tcp
the reason for this is that tcp connections use various methods for error detection while udp does not

470946
mouse	keyboard
what you share is just a mouse and a keyboard

471069
vpn	lan
but this will work only if vpn- lan is either routed or bridged not nated by win7 otherwise the router will see vpn clients with same source ip as the windows 7 desktop and can t forward dns separately

471069
vpn	lan
if you want vpn clients to receive an off-site dns server they won t be able to resolve local hostnames on your network and they can only address lan resources by ips

471069
vpn	lan
so i m afraid you ll have to manually configure the vpn clients properly as well no matter what you do on the lan side

471081
mouse	keyboard
input method editor ime is an input method in an operating system or an individual program that allows various data such as keyboard strokes or mouse actions to be received as input

471114
switching	screens
i m aware of the settings change that fixes this problem if you don t switching screens within a session but each screens doesn t maintain its own separate history like tabs in terminal

471114
switching	screens
obviously in order to do this screens would have to store a ton of data and pipe it over your connection every time you switching

471127
ubuntu	linux
long story short i have a linux ubuntu 10.04 lts server with a 4 disks configured as a 2 tb raid 5 set up with intel matrix storage manager v8.0.0.1038 in bios

mp4	h.264	mp4	h.265	h.264	h.265
note that this only works if the audio and video codecs are supported in the mp4 container which is the case for h.264 h.265 and aac for example but not for many others

472435
mp4	h.264
so if you load your mkv video into handbrake and re-encode it with x264 the h.264 encoder handbrake uses store it in an mp4 container you are going to lose quality no matter what unless you set the bitrate or quality factor so high that you won t really see the difference

what else do i need to change to get port 4 to be wan and wired ports 2-3 to be lan onto 192.168.1

478714
wan	vlan
apparently i need to add another vlan for local ethernet ports other then the new wan port #4

478714
wan	lan
that s because pc gets an ip over ethernet directly from wan and i need pc to be on lan 192

478717
cinnamon	gnome
i would recommend that you create a script that changes the brightness and sets up gnome keyboard shortcuts assuming that you are using gnome cinnamon that will activate that script for you

478717
for-loop	loops
these for loops could be called by the 1 parameter that inside a switch case will redirect to the for-loop that increase or decrease the brightness going from 0 to 15 and 15 to 0

apache	nginx
a more transparent solution would be to run a web server such as apache or nginx on your local machine then use the ip of your server in the dnsmasq section of dd-wrt

479000
cifs	smb
i know that windows acts as an smb cifs server by default

479000
cifs	smb
the way i figure is that windows simply lacks the smb cifs client component

479003
cifs	smb
windows uses smb as its primary file sharing protocol and includes smb cifs client capabilities in almost all windows versions since windows for workgroups 3.1

physx with ati + nvidia cards in same computer

479339
ati	nvidia
the questions - would this arrangement ati for rendering nvidia for physx work and which card should i buy

479339
ati	nvidia
the other question the one of which this is supposedly a duplicate is relatively old 2011 august maybe nvidia changed again and now allows ati cards and does not answer which card would be best for physx - an older one like 8800gt or a newer low end one say gt610

479503
ubuntu	debian
i m using ubuntu 12.04 but i see this also on my debian server

479512
tunnel	vpn
note that since you don t have root access on the box you probably can t manipulate tun or tap devices unless the sysadmin has given you privileges so you probably won t be able to create a useful vpn tunnel without root anyway even if you compile openvpn

479513
firefox	safari
it connects to ethernet wifi and has internet but when i open safari or firefox nothing happens

disk	ram
a tablet has no hard disk to begin with and the mobile ram in it is specifically designed for low idle power usage

479598
google-chrome	firefox
you didn t say you use google-chrome exclusively so for firefox you can use the old default image style add-on

479609
udp	tcp
the game runs predominately over udp so i believe most low ping services are out of the question as they rely on tcp traffic

479612

481380
ssl	spdy
through my empirical tests it appears that spdy is not actually the problem but rather the ssl layer that chrome uses has some non-standard attributes that get mistaken by traffic shaping and throttling techniques

481380

from my tests spdy made almost no difference and the system ssl flag had a very significant difference

i bet these are used to track where the file came from for windows to pop-up the are you sure you want to open this dialog when you try to open a downloaded .zip or .exe

481891
folder	directory
instead of extending the home folder you could source the home directory out to an extra partition

481891
folder	directory
copy everything from your home folder to the new partition and then tell your system to mount the new partition in your home directory during startup by adding a corresponding line to etc fstab

481901

ethernet	wireless
the airport express will create a wireless network or you can get another router and set up a wireless network or a wired network using your existing ethernet connections

481922

vmware	virtualbox
based on what i saw for i o virtualbox vs vmware vmware wins hands down for basic operation looks like its losing out on heavy graphics computation - but could be due to configuration

481955
vmware	virtualbox
i d suggest first trying out the free vmware instead of virtualbox and see how your performance is

481955
google-chrome	firefox
for your vm guest os i suggest trying lubuntu to for a lightweight linux x ready loaded and ephiphany browser google-chrome firefox too runs nicely

486683
pop-up	dialog
clicked ok in the pop-up dialog asking whether to create a directory structure

486689
udp	tcp
in general for an arbitrary protocol running inside of tcp or udp because other protocols that run on top of ip don t necessarily have any concept of ports you cannot do what you want to do because there is no guarantee that there is any information inside the traffic stream to allow such routing to take place

486696
ubuntu	linux
both the host and guest will be running ubuntu linux

mouse	keyboard
now this selection dialog has no default entry and keyboard selection doesn t work meaning that i have to use my mouse every time i need a new console which is kind of tedious

486759

486763
ubuntu	debian
it seems that x is a child-process of the desktop manager in debian ubuntu

486763

486904
octal	binary
192.168.072 fits the a.b.c pattern so the 072 after parsing as an octal number was interpreted as a 16-bit value that defines the rightmost 2 bytes of the binary address equivalent to 0.58

486936
octal	decimal
you can use flat or dotted-quad or dotted-triple dotted-double or even dotted-single format and for each one you can use or even mix and match decimal octal and hexadecimal

486936
octal	decimal
further because you have a leading zero on the last part it is treated as octal which in decimal is 58

486936
octal	decimal
some programs may force you to provide all four parts of a dotted-quad others may not allow mixing and matching decimal and octal and so on

487190
google-chrome	firefox
typing the following string there will make firefox s address bar behaviour look a bit more closer to google-chrome s

487190

to make firefox look even closer to google-chrome you might also consider downloading the theme as well as putting the downloads on the bottom bar just like google-chrome does
