debian	linux
i don t know if debian has the tools to do it but using arch linux you can create a disk layout like this

1139576
disk	ram
grub will ask for a password to unlock boot initial ram disk will ask for a password again cause for him boot is locked and probably while mounting your root partition this will happen once more

1139577
debian	linux
i have the newest openssh 7.3p1 debian client and server side running with the newest linux kernel 4.7.0 also from the debian repository

1139577
tunnel	packets
the tunnel is not working it means packets are able to see with tcpdump server side from the client but no one packets is sent from the server back to the client

1139604
tunnel	vpn
i disabled the firewall for the vpn tunnel

1139624
debian	linux
i want to detect if buttons on my usb scanner hp scanjet 8250 are pressed using debian linux

1139638
folder	directory
when i look into the home konrad .thunderbird s3zrpwq3.default mail local folder directory which is supposed to be my default profile directory there are only trash and unsent messages

1139685
apache	nginx
google apache nginx directory listings or something similar to find out exactly how this works

1139694
google-chrome	firefox
update november 2017 this is no longer the best option firefox and google-chrome now support taking full-page screenshots in their developer tools

1139705
folder	directory
i saw the folder and appears in the list of your directory

1139721
opera	google-chrome
google-chrome ie opera browsers start to a blank page at normal speed but going to a https site takes forever

1139736
width	height
disadvantage is that the x y coordinates do not appear to be able to reference the text width and height so you have to manually provide appropriate values in the move tag

1139775
put	get
if you put a table like the following in you could just use and get the same result

1139779
vpn	lan
so i setup my home computer and my work computer under the same lan via vpn both of which have my microsoft account as login

1139833
mouse	keyboard
i want them to be displayed using vimperator as i don t usually use the mouse or may not have one relying solely on keyboard

1139882
mouse	keyboard
when i try to boot from cd or usb my mouse and keyboard stops working

1139882
mouse	keyboard
at this time i could finally use my mouse and keyboard

1139944
versioning	upgrade
assuming the server setup is sane and you are upgrading within a stable release upgrading to a new major versioning or following a development release is a different thing then apt-get upgrade should not normally be a problem and needs to be done to get security fixes

1139957
wan	lan
i configured lan to wan network and everything is working.

1139957
wan	lan
as routers are wired from lan port on main router to wan port on second router

1139959
folder	directory
uninstall the postgresql and delete the data directory in the installation folder

1139984
google-chrome	firefox
browsers google-chrome 54.0.2840.71 or firefox 49.0.1

1140014
ubuntu	linux
i ve installed windows subsystem for linux wsl in order to bash on ubuntu on windows in the following abbreviated to â œbashâ . in cmd.exe i can run bash -c gcc --version as well as i can use cmd -k bash -c gcc --version from the start menu

1140014
atom-editor	sublimetext
however i noticed that i cannot run the same command from third-party applications sublimetext or atom-editor

1140022
msg	eml
i ve used imapsync in the past to sync two imap accounts but these msg are just sitting on a file system as eml files they are not in an existing imap account where i can sync them

1140022
msg	eml
the eml files are all named via msg id

1140032
vim	notepad++
you re using vim like notepad++

1140032
move	drag	mouse	keyboard
everytime you move your hand from the keyboard to the mouse drag your mouse cursor up the menu button scroll down click the right button browse through your files click to open the right file you have stopped using vim

1140032
vim	notepad++
you are now using notepad++ inside of vim

1140033
folder	directory
to turn a directory into a maildir folder supported by nearly all programs first create subdirectories cur new tmp then move all message files under new

1140033
folder	directory
now that the directory is a valid maildir folder you can use offlineimap or imapsync to transfer its contents somewhere else

1140033
folder	directory
or run mutt -f account.manager to open the directory as a mail folder in mutt

1140041
cpu	processors
a 13 macbook pro 2014 does not support 4k 60 hz because of the cpu is a u-type processors

1140076
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome just stops without any message firefox tells me the source cannot be read

1140092
post	get
i tried a straight copy of the files but once the post screen loads i get a flashing underscore which seems to indicate the external harddrive isn t bootable

1140104
portrait	landscape
at this point i could see that the videos that didn t play using media player were shot in portrait orientation while the ones that played were shot in landscape orientation

1140124
mouse	keyboard
the keyboard and mouse have power all my fans are running and the lights are on

1140126
pull	push
is the push pull time from the registry the only downside

1140135
notepad++	sublimetext
so i can no longer use notepad++ and i switched to sublimetext 3

1140195
folder	directory
how can i tell chrome to create the crashpad folder under the same user directory in usb disk or do no create crashpad

1140260
udp	tcp
the packets tend to contain tcp segments or udp datagrams which are layer 4 traffic

1140260
icmp	udp
this could be udp port 53 traffic dns but i will instead use icmp ping as an example

1140331
ubuntu	linux
i m trying to understand how a linux client on ubuntu 16.04 if that matters knows to talk to the dhcpv6 server either for an ip address or to get dns servers

1140361
filesystems	fat
junctions and symbolic links are not supported on fat filesystems

1140435
put	get
as neither of the proposed answers worked for me directly i put here the steps i have to do in order to get windows update cleanup option

1140475
mpmath	sympy
i installed mpmath manually via setup.py then installed sympy via pip

1140475
hide	show
hide protected system files is unchecked and show hidden files folders and drives is checked

1140506
cvs	svn
particularly it looks like tortoise cvs svn context menu entries were to blame the most

1140516
ubuntu	linux
i have an external usb hard drive recently i connect it to my laptop while windows through usb windows say say the data corrupted and even can t enter the hard drive through explorer i decided to boot through linux ubuntu and i found out that linux can see all the files and read and it and it s not corrupted i m happy now my data is safe but i want to know what is the root of the problem

1140525
disk	ram
tmp can reside on faster media than root ram disk ssd disk

1140525
disk	ram
tmp can reside on media less prone to wearing i.e root on flash disk tmp on regular disk or ram disk

1140535
filesystems	fat
resizing fat partitions is unreliable in my experience and sometimes results in the filesystems becoming unreadable to some or all oses

1140549
vmware	virtualbox
the safest approach to installing linux in a way that won t disrupt windows is to use virtualization -- virtualbox vmware etc

1140552
folder	dir
therefore i ran a dir on that folder getting the following output

1140562
disk	ram
however it looks like there is some caching still going on between the disk and the ram when reading files stored in the ramfs which i think should not happen

1140586
filesystems	fat
so from what i gather the proper way to do with is to create the bootable usb with the settings in rufus as partition scheme gpt partition for uefi and filesystems fat 32 default

1140659
margin	height	width	height	width	margin
position the cursor at the beginning of the paragraph and insert a rectangle shape with white fill and a 1-1 2 pt black border set the height to absolute 36 pt and the width to relative 100 relative to margin

1140672
filesystems	ntfs
i can only assume you re using the ntfs filesystems which doesn t support multiple systems access the same disk at the same time outside of special use cases such as failover clustering

1140687
disk	ram
most os s will see unused ram and use it to cache recent disk requests eating up free ram which can be released at a moments notice to give you a possible io speed increase

1140861
opera	google-chrome
recently i have noticed that when watching youtube on google-chrome the video is motion interpolated the soap opera effect

1140870
hide	show
as suggested you can hide the true false column or move it to the last column and make the text white so that it does not show

1140883
ubuntu	linux
is it possible to change the pixel format in any amd driver on linux currently ubuntu mate

1140888
post	get
more specifically i didn t even get to the point of checking how things ran in an os - the post was so painfully slow that i cancelled all attempts to move forward with the install and simply replaced it with an older core 2

1140888
post	get
you may get issues about it during post though

1140901
ethernet	wireless
my home network is set up with the usual wireless ethernet router talking to the isp handling dhcp and i think forwarding dns requests to the isp s dns servers

1140901
ubuntu	linux
there s also a wireless card in the ubuntu machine so i set the linux box to act as a wireless access point with create_ap

1140905
gentoo	opensuse
if you re using fedora gentoo opensuse or something else some details may differ and you may want to track down relevant documentation for your specific distribution

1140913
filesystems	ntfs
there are plenty of filesystems extensions you can install on the mac to get ext3 4 and ntfs compatibility but ideally i want to be able to sit down at anyone s computer and just use the drive with no installations on the host os

1140917
vmware	virtualbox
you might consider using virtualization virtualbox vmware etc. rather than a dual boot so as to avoid the hybrid mbr and its dangers

1140920
min	max
wants at least min bits at most max bits and preferably n bits then

1140930
versioning	upgrade
i ve upgrade the windows versioning immediately using my enterprise license so i did run windows 10 enterprise insider before everything went south

1140930
debian	linux
i needed a linux build environment on the go and since wsl is only available on 64bit windows i installed debian 64bit

1140943
google-chrome	firefox
the issue happens in late versions of google-chrome firefox and edge

1140962
wan	lan
this bottlenecks my lan and wlan speeds to 100 mbps and my wan speed to 80 20

1141003
google-chrome	firefox
when i try to open the page in firefox or google-chrome in the normal mode then i get back a 500 internal server error

1141003
google-chrome	firefox
however when i open this page in the private browsing of firefox or incognito of google-chrome the the page opens without any problem

1141014
folder	directory
the downloads folder located in c users has essentially replaced my home directory

1141014
folder	directory
the directory jeff does not even exist in the c users folder

1141014
folder	directory
as in make the downloads folder located in this pc to map to c users jeff downloads where c users jeff actually exists as a distinct directory

1141025
portrait	landscape
this display supports multi-stream transport mst in both landscape and portrait viewing modes and yes your mac also supports mst at 60 hz

1141033
versioning	upgrade
if your pro versioning that you purchased from the windows store was a retail versioning and not just an upgrade from the oem versioning that came on your laptop then yes your key is transferable to another pc but it will invalidate the first pc

unless the benchmark is some usb-to-usb system that is controlling the ui of another computer emulating being a mouse keyboard the execution paths will be entirely different

1141113
wan	lan
i only need 1 wan and max 5 lan outputs

1141119
filesystems	xfs
i can ssh in all my filesystems are mounted correctly ext4 xfs cifs all my data seems fine and there is no hint of problems in the logs

1141125
bash	zsh
i m not sure all unix shells react well to this but at least bash and zsh do

1141170
traceroute	packets
i understand that times listed on row each are the round trip time from the my machine to the target host traceroute sends 3 separate packets

1141217
post	get
for research purposes qualitative i would like to load see all the post of a 6-month facebook group but after a few days of post are loaded i get an out of memory error and the web page or browser crashes

1141217

i installed roger-router on my linux mint debian edition 64bit

1141319
wan	lan
switching function of lan and wan ports

1141361
mouse	keyboard
emulating such direct hardware accesses would require some kind of virtualization dosbox or a vm or that the actual hardware has built-in support for emulation modern chipsets typically can do this to allow to redirect ps 2 keyboard mouse accesses to usb but not for anything else

1141363
tunnel	vpn
can someone describe to me or point me in the right direction how i can allow this remote user access to my network and allow to them connect through to the vpn tunnel established on my regular workstation

1141390
disk	ram
no combination of plugged-in ram units helps and neither does disconnecting all peripherals and disk

1141416
libpcap	wireshark
does wireshark libpcap capture packets when they are still in the nic or when they have been passed to the kernel

1141433
folder	directory
i also trie to enable it in runtime by executing as suggested by archwiki but it tells me that sys module zswap parameters enabled no such file or directory folder parameters contains only max_pool_percent

1141485
sudo	passwd
as an alternative you can prevent sudo from requiring a passwd at all as mentioned in several answers here

1141485
sudo	passwd	passwd	visudo	sudoers	visudo	sudoers	passwd
to prevent sudo from asking a passwd at all you can add the following line at the end of your etc sudoers file use visudo as root to edit the file

1141485
sudo	passwd
be advised this will cause sudo to no longer ask for a passwd at all when executing any sudo command

1141492
winpcap	wireshark
i have installed wireshark and winpcap on the server and i have installed winpcap on the target

1141518

nevertheless legacy mode was able to do so and hence i decided to install debian windows 10 and freebsd in bios mode

1141532
trojan	virus
much more than virus trojan malware etc.

1141535

cpu coolers are typically designed to work with a specific few models of cpu usually within a specific processors family

1141631
folder	directory
i don t like how windows displays a mix of drop down menus seen in the left column and standard folder and i don t like how i can t see all the folder and files in the directory above mine--only in the topmost directory seen in the lefthand column

1141636
mouse	keyboard
occasionally my keyboard and mouse suddenly go into some unresponsive state

1141636

1141729
vim	gedit
edit the etc wpa_supplicant.conf file using gedit or vim or what ever you prefer

1141741
put	get
if you put a set usb as the last line you would get only with a leading space

1141743
put	get
if you really need to bridge that distance get 2 cables of 5 meters and a usb hub with a separate power-supply to put in the middle

1141781

1141955
vb6	vba
adssecurity would do the job nicely but i cannot seem to find any examples for anything other than vbs or vb6 certainly nothing for vba

1141967
versioning	upgrade
how can i upgrade update it to the latest versioning since i didn t installed it via chocolatey

1141979
wan	lan
assuming your connection from router 1 to the switch is using the wan port of the router and you are not sharing wan and lan in openwrt meaning you did not change the default settings and did the cabling as you would when connected directly to the modem you are mostly fine

1142032
post	get
i m assuming the last row is always 2500 as per your post if not this post shows how to get the last row

1142034
folder	directory
so i have the project folder from both clouds synced to my synology in two separate directory trees

1142039
folder	directory
i have downloaded from my ftp server a directory tree using wget and forcing ascii encoding so now i hve a lot of folder and files names something like foo c3 bc some of the files folder already have correct names because they only had ascii characters

1142052
google-chrome	firefox
manually entering 129.186.1.99 in my browser google-chrome firefox

1142096
mp4	webm
though if i was to take that mp4 and convert it to a webm with similar commands as stated above it renders both audio and video but the video bitrate is absolutely atrocious and is very pixelated compared to the avi or mp4

1142184
folder	directory
place the admin folder which u extract from that install into the directory with the installation of the office version and then run from the command line setup.exe admin

1142197
disk	ram
i think make background writeback not suck will help avoid some issues where a process hogging ram causes another swap out write to disk and the bulk write to disk stalls anything else wanting io

1142204
wan	lan
resolved my inability to print to a wan side printer from the lan side of a tp-link archer c7

1142204

postfix	dovecot
so i undertand that the configuration on the server side possibly on dovecot or postfix files point a connection to the db-email trought root but i want that it will be a my-user

1142322
rpm	yum
one thing i might be able to do is to build empty rpm for git and add it to yum

1142340
ssd	sata
searching for the type gives me this kingston suv400s37 240g 240gb sata ssd

1142379
processors	hyperthreading
all 6th generation core-i7 processors have 4 cores with hyperthreading this means they can theoretically execute 8 concurrent operations

1142405
folder	directory
secondly no such temporary directory exists when i look after the failed install so either there is some sort of automatic cleanup on error or there is a previous error of not creating the temporary folder in the first place not being caught by the install process might also be a permissions error

1142451
mouse	keyboard
i don t want to just take the laptop add an external screen mouse and keyboard i want to do more

1142462
notepad++	sublimetext
if notepad++ cannot do that you can try using sublimetext

1142510
folder	directory
this happens only when the search reaches a particular folder in the directory which contains so many files and folder

1142526
versioning	upgrade
in case you can not upgrade your libav you can force firefox to use the old versioning by changing this setting - about config

1142568
background-color	outline
since background-color formatting hides cell gridlines one additional thing i like to do in the format cells dialog is to click the border tab select white background 1 darker 15 in the color dropdown and then apply that color to the outline borders

1142611
client-side	server-side
after trying countless combinations of client-side and server-side variations of tcpkeepalive serveraliveinterval serveralivecountmax clientaliveinterval and clientalivecountmax i synchronized both client and server to these settings

1142675
filesystems	fat
add an empty primary partition which will hold a fat filesystems later

1142675
filesystems	fat
create a fat filesystems on the dev sdc1 partition by formatting the partition

1142689
mouse	keyboard
once you have control of the mouse and keyboard don t follow any menus

1142695
filesystems	btrfs
this ability in my understanding would be achievable only if the backing filesystems is a cow filesystems such as btrfs

1142760
trojan	virus
a virus trojan horse worm or other malicious program that manages to infect a computer on your local network can use upnp just like legitimate programs can

1142797
centos	linux
centos linux release 7.2.1511

1142820

i am a linux enthusiast and newbie whom since yesterday is trying unsuccessfully to install an ubuntu 16.04 alongside windows 10 on a acer laptop

1142839
ubuntu	debian
on ubuntu debian sudo apt-get install okular

1142941
filesystems	btrfs
this filesystems can continue to host mysql and other software whose performance could adversely be affected by btrfs

1142974
ethernet	wireless
after restarting my pc today i saw the ethernet symbol in the task bar with the wireless symbol gone

1142979
put	get
you might have to put that drive in another pc that is not going to get confused about which drive is the boot drive

1142989
post	get
so i assume the post parameters did not get passed correctly

1142992
google-chrome	firefox
i ve personally tested it with ie google-chrome and firefox

1143043
google-chrome	firefox
this only happens when rightclicking on the firefox pinned icon - all other pinned icons have their relevant icon when rightclicking them including of google-chrome browser

1143055
ssd	sata
check this ssd if it ever works using a different computer with either sata or with usb external enclosure at least

1143101
cinnamon	gnome
i know that cinnamon has multiple issues that seem to be similar to gnome

1143105
centos	linux
i have a stock-standard lamp stack running on a centos 7 linux 3.10.0 machine

1143143
cpu	hyperthreading
the old cpu is faster because it is a quad core i7 with hyperthreading so that you get 8 logical cores while the i7 6500u is only a dual core cpu with hyperthreading so you have 4 logical cores

1143151
pulseaudio	dbus
you can get notifications from pulseaudio via dbus

1143163
put	get
to get have git branch show in prompt copy the file that git folks put their prompt into and source it in your .bashrc .git-prompt.sh

1143196
subnet	vlan	put	get
i also plan in the near future to get a managed switch to do vlan subnetting and put vms in different subnet based on whether they should be reachable from the internet or not

1143200
versioning	upgrade
if the portrait mode is relevant in the issue you should upgrade your bios driver and gpu firmware just to make sure you re at the latest versioning

1143202
postfix	dovecot
i think that i have made the correct steps with cpanel but i dont have a clue on how can i set postfix and dovecot to receive mails from my external server

1143268
wan	lan
i was wondering if i could send the wan connection into one of the rooms and then have the lan connection come back through the same wire

1143268
wan	lan
but then the eop will transfer both lan and wan connections

1143274
wan	lan
for example if your router uses pure dhcp on its wan side this varies between isps and you loop back its lan side into a wan switch well you now have two dhcp servers on the same broadcast domain and the router fighting with a bunch of dhcp clients

1143274
wan	lan
or the router might end up assigning a wan address from its own lan pool

1143274
wan	vlan
the wan port would belong to vlan 10 device ports to vlan 20 eop port trunked

1143278
folder	directory
and now i m not able to grand them anymore for this folder or directory

cpu	hyperthreading
a couple of years ago i built myself a franken-mac using some hardware from imacs and a few mac compatible parts namely i needed hyperthreading so it uses an i3-4330 rather than an i5-2500 and i needed business level graphics but couldn t afford the horrifyingly expensive quadro 4000 for mac yes i know 500 isn t that expensive relative to other gcs especially other quadros however the most i am willing to pay for a piece of graphics hardware is about 150 especially seeing as my cpu already has an integrated gpu with as much vram and only barely less support for opengl shaders

1143426
hfs+	ntfs
i am trying to recover files from an ntfs volume onto my main hfs+ drive using ddrescue

1143431
cpu	processors
when i went to install it the pc kept turning off i moved the heat sink to get better cooling by spreading the paste even more then it wouldn t turn on kinda everything powered on but the power buttons wouldn t work and the ports didn t work i fitted my old cpu powered everything on made sure the bios was up to date then refitted the 630 but windows said something about how i m trying to use a 32 bit processors in a 64 bit operating system

1143470
put	get
the easiest method would probably be to simply get a desktop pc and put multiple graphics cards in

1143477
vim	emacs
by default terminal maps shift - home and shift - end to â œgo to start end of lineâ and if the program youâ re using is showing the alternate screen most full-screen applications like vim emacs top etc

1143501
cinnamon	gnome
my problem is basically the same as this guy s logind.conf not working closing lid will not suspend laptop but i m on cinnamon and he was on gnome

1143501
cinnamon	gnome
my dconf-editor doesn t have the right location and there s no add key like in regedit and gnome things don t apply to cinnamon right

wan	lan
after doing some research on double nat i found the following simple fix that worked for me previously i had been plugging in the cable that went from att modem s lan ethernet slot into the tp-link router s wan slot

1143511
wan	lan
an article suggested leaving the wan slot alone and instead plugging the cord into the 2nd router s lan slot

1143515
google-chrome	firefox
i want to keep my google-chrome and firefox browsing data filled in forms history addons etc available on a mounted network drive windows 10 mounted as z

1143516
folder	directory
i find a .dirstate-xxxx folder in servers .hg directory

1143517
google-chrome	firefox
i can t speak regarding first-hand experience with google-chrome but firefox has a very well-known portable version that should be able to do what you want

1143531
folder	directory
i have below command to find any folder file by name zero1 or zero1 case insensitive in the whole directory structure from public_html after i login to remote terminal through ssh

1143575
tunnel	vpn	tunnel	packets
that a device was connected to its wi-fi interface and that does not update this information when packets with the same mac address come from another interface in your case the vpn tunnel s tap interface

1143575
tunnel	vpn
connected to 10.0.0.1 again your device macbook sends arp requests who has 10.0.0.5 which go through the vpn tunnel to 10.0.0.5 but which don t get answered or don t get forwarded to the correct now tap interface

1143582
disk	ram
if it were not out of ram it would have a disk cache that was smaller than it could have resulting in needless i o operations

1143603
x86	64bit
my advice is you install notepad++ x86 if your system x64 64bit

1143607
rpm	yum
one possibility could be to reset permissions using yum or rpm by running a verify with yum

1143608
range	max
but i cannot figure out how to do those two things at once in one formula subset by part code and check whether the date is the max in the range

1143615
ubuntu	debian
i m using debian 8.6 on my vps server and on my virtual machine on laptop i m using ubuntu 14.04.5

1143615
ubuntu	debian
here are files and logs from my debian ubuntu and files content i don t know what s wrong

1143719
filesystems	fat
also some tools like gparted in linux seem to be more likely to damage a fat partition when resizing it than to damage other filesystems types

1143719
fat	hfs+
in theory you should be able to store the boot.wim file on an hfs+ partition since apple s efi can read hfs+ just as well as it can read fat

1143719
hfs+	ntfs
some of the same caveats from an hfs+ location apply but windows would be able to read ntfs

1143815
tar	gunzip
tar stands for tarball and archives hence ball makes multiple files into one and gz stands for gunzip and compresses or zips reduces the size of the file

1143819
rar	zip
rar and arj lha zip and others are way more modern and compress files in place

1143824
versioning	upgrade
i want to upgrade it to a more modern versioning since i cannot upgrade certain browsers without a newer os

1143832

folder	dir	folder	directory
in dir a d b this gets the list of directory of the target folder

1143843
portrait	landscape
my hope was to discover how to keep page numbering in a footer progressing on multiple pages and formatted to fit left and right margins when going from portrait to landscape then back to portrait again

1143843
portrait	landscape
one can have all footers be the same width say 6 1 2 inches on portrait pages with 1 margins but that looks odd on a landscape sheet

1143844
short	base
long story short the internet at my squadron s home base is garbage

1143853
ubuntu	linux
wsl translates the linux system calls into windows ones so the ubuntu network data flows through the exact same tcp ip stack as the windows data

1143873
pull	push	put	get
a quick way to get it back to normal is to put your right thumb on the right part of the keyboard and your left thumb on the left side and then push them together to pull the keyboard apart simply pull your thumbs apart

i put the user-defined service name ssh protocol tcp wan and lan open port 22 and lan ip address y the private ip address of my notebook running centos 24 7 with this ip address i can successfully ssh if i m using a device inside my lan

1144065
udp	tcp
if the port uses the tcp and udp protocols create a rule for each protocol

1144065
wan	lan
keep in mind that this router may not probably doesn t support hairpin nat so you won t be able to access the forwarded lan resources from inside the lan by using the wan ip address

bluetooth	usb
i will be using the usb bluetooth stereo music receiver 3.5mm adapter dongle for speakers car mp3 for connected my phone to car music system which is not wireless

characters such as in maybe being expanded by bash and so the passwd that is sent to sudo would not be what you expect it to be

1144259
put	get
so my question is how do i get the first cell value in column a that has a value in column b to put in a cell and then the next value in column a that has a value in column b in another cell that totally random but the process is automatic

1144298
cpu	processors
it the past before multi-core cpus came up multi cpu desktop computers were used when the was reasonable need for more than one processors core - for extensive computation which could be parallelized

trojan	virus
i updated the nvidia driver i used avg and windows security essentials to remove malware and a trojan virus i uninstalled most of my programs and cleaned up the registry a bit

notepad++	sublimetext
does sublimetext 3 or notepad++ two applications i commonly use have the ability to find all instances regardless of case sensitivity but preserve the case when replacing

1144339
mouse	keyboard
my guess is that for such a program to work it would need to run in ring0 above pretty much everything else as to not get caught in the freeze but that s a bet i m not sure if the freezes won t impact the ring0 but the freezes i target still allow for inputs to work like mouse and keyboard so i guess ring0 might work too

1144339
mouse	keyboard
i do not expect to fix every kinds of freezes using only a software solution but i hope to at least workaround the type of partial freezes where the mouse and keyboard still work

tunnel	vpn
double check your interfaces in my case en1 is the wifi and uten1 the vpn tunnel

1144489
filesystems	ntfs
you need a tool that speaks ntfs the filesystems used by windows

1144489
ubuntu	linux
for this reason stop using windows now and boot your pc using a linux live dvd or usb basically any modern version will do no matter if it is ubuntu fedora or anything else

1144489
ubuntu	linux
moreover the following part is based on my previous answers posted here on unix linux stack exchange and here on ask ubuntu

1144489
debian-based	ubuntu
if you are running a debian-based os including ubuntu you can install it with the following command

1144489

processors	hyperthreading
some processors have simultaneous multithreading functionality referred to by intel as hyperthreading technology that allows each core to work on more than one thread at a time by taking advantage of unused execution resources within each core

1144568
cpu	processors
cpu all motherboards will have a socket for connecting a cpu with a particular configuration of pins which will accept a range of models of cpus designated by socket type eg amd s am2+ standard and any given socket type will feature a range of processors with various different levels of performance

1144598

put	get
i would never put a virtual machine on a ssd in two or three years the ssd can get damaged erase cicles reached max

1144694
put	get
i see with windows guests that the vdi files normally does not get bigger than 10gib remember i have them with default installation and only windows no apps etc and if i put all windows updates after cleanmgr etc and clonevdi passed it grows to 13gib or 15gib and grow is top limited to 20gib since i defined 20gib for system partition

1144708
google-chrome	firefox
also from the screenshot i d be tempted to suggest you use firefox exclusively so this might be worth mentioning since google-chrome really uses up lots of ram

1144737
hide	show
take care that windows will not install an update bij running the tool show and hide windows update from

1144756
mouse	keyboard
i am trying to prepare to image a copy of windows 7 from a virtual machine to a real one and need to put the usb 3 drivers on so i can use the mouse keyboard once the image is copied over

i am primarily interested in linux systems with xfs filesystems but i ask this as a general os independent question as i am asking for a general structured standardized approach

1144789
swt	swing
so if you code a regular old java app using swing or swt it will not work on android as android does not provide those apis to my knowledge to leverage

1144827
gentoo	debian
i dual-boot debian and gentoo but as this would be a matter of configuration i suppose that doesn t matter

1144900
wan	lan
the problem was that the wan router would require a reboot and in the meantime lost connection to the internet so there was no way of remotely accessing it from outside my lan having a machine on the local lan run a script everyday assures that my router wont be down for longer than 24 hours ever

1144905
openvpn	iptables
the iptables rule i made on the openvpn server

1144907
hash	md5
after an archive was created i did a md5 checksum on it transferred the archive to another drive then used the md5 to verify files were transferred correctly and stored the md5 hash with the archives for future verification

1144907
hash	md5
storing the md5 hash only allows someone to know whether the current data matches the original data or not

1144946
email	dkim
email servers also use many other checks such as spf dkim and many more to identify what is spam

1144949

if i put in alt+1 for â º would i be able to put the same code in on macos and linux and get the same output

1144973
jobs	cron
cron uses a specific notation for scheduled jobs

1144979
wan	lan
i suspect your error stems from the fact that you are confusing the wan and lan addresses

1144979
wan	lan
your local dhcp server is for your lan not the wan and it needs to assign your router s lan address as the gateway to your hosts

1145000
filesystems	fat
could i mount it as a probably fat filesystems

1145119
folder	directory
after installing the os if you haven t deleted moved anything to trash from gui then the trash folder under user s directory wont get created at all

ubuntu	linux
before the install i had a windows 7 and ubuntu linux dual boot with 3 drives ssd for linux boot drive 2tb mechanical for linux home folder and 500gb mechanical for windows 10

1145137
folder	directory
from your comments it looks like the archive contains the contents of the .git directory in which case i m guessing that the tarball also contains folder like info and refs in addition to objects

1145138
wav	flac
how can i convert a wav file to an flac file with ffmpeg

1145166

1145198

my virtual os won t react to volume control keys even if i disable the global hotkeys in kubuntu kde

1145198
mouse	keyboard
to test this you may run the virtual os in a window attach the keyboard to it as you did before and switch to another host application by mouse clicking

1145200
dpkg	apt
you should probably go with something like ps fauxww | less then start searching for apt dpkg and especially dialog references

1145374
udp	tcp
i guess i need to link an udp and tcp servers over tun but how do i redirect the client to the server s internet connection

1145376
udp	tcp
assuming you did configure your router to forward tcp or udp port 443 to your openvpn server then your client configuration would include

1145376
udp	tcp
usually running openvpn you would only need udp or tcp

what i d like to have happen is when say a php script runs it can write to that folder since it d be running as www-data but an external user trying to access anything in the directory would be treated as other and unable to access

1145726
nas	qnap
running zfs on top of soho nas is doable - i still have mfsbsd on some qnap works as a charm - although you ld probably have better cpus and or more ram on your commodity hardware

my mouse and keyboard would work just fine with the hub

1145851

the mouse would light up the keyboard num-lock would not

1145882
bluetooth	usb
my usb hub is not recognized neither is my bluetooth adapter

1145886
folder	directory
i believe the normal fix is to keep messing round with folder properties and the security tab waiting a while for windows to individually change permissions while recursing into every single directory on the entire disk

however at least in the game starcraft broodwar where your speed can often surpass 10 actions per second in short bursts at competitive level it is important to have both the keyboard and the mouse on interrupt based actions other way they overlap in incorrect orders

traceroute	lan
this is evident in your successful traceroute from the lan perspective where the hop occurs between 192.168.1.254 to 162.201.40.3

1147368
wan	lan
since hosts on your lan are using the actual address of the router 192.168.1.254 as a gateway and not your expired wan gateway see assumption 1 outbound packets originating from the lan requiring routing will eventually pass through the routing table of your router which at this time will have the appropriate dynamic default wan gateway needed to reach the internet through your isp

i assume you have a http service also known as a webserver that runs inside your lan and you want to show it on a public ip which you call wan ip

1148908
wan	lan
you could for example try lan ip lan port 80 forwarded from wan ip wan port 14876

1148918

you connect your isps cable to the wan port and every computer that should be part of the network to one of the available lan ports

if it says outlook mail you are running on the new office 365 servers and therefore in theory you can setup your outlook desktop client to connect to your hotmail outlook.com account as a full exchange account type to clarify this is more fully featured than the exchange active sync type using the automatic method in the add account dialog

currently the script is working letting me hold down space alt and e or d consecutively in order to add or subtract multiple times but it has the problems that i have to press first space then alt otherwise it won t work also this whole peace of script must be placed at the very end of my ahk script cuz otherwise it will interfere with other subroutines

every so often the default grub option worked but while i got through language selection i found i needed to leave the gui alone for quite a while - perhaps scanning the disk - before the it recognised the keyboard or mouse clicks

installation	upgrade
you can download the latest windows 10 iso directly from microsoft and use that to either try to upgrade your current windows 10 installation or better do a complete installation wiping out the current os which would of course wipe out your files so back them up first

1150128
ubuntu	linux
another choice would be a linux distro such as ubuntu

1150136

1150204
mouse	keyboard
they do not do anything to the signal so probably the keyboard or mouse should know and adapt their signal accordingly

1150204
mouse	keyboard
and another question is there any latency added when connecting a usb keyboard or mouse to a ps 2 port using an adapter

1150204
mouse	keyboard
i suppose the adapter itself does not add latency since it only connects some pins to some others but inside the mouse or keyboard something has to change

1150217
mouse	keyboard
so yes the mouse keyboard needs to do ps 2 by itself

1150228

in the setup guides they demonstrate being able to plug an ethernet port from the wireless range extender into one of your devices that needs a wired connection

1150228
ethernet	wireless
my quesiton is do wireless range extenders let you plug one end of the ethernet cable into the wall and the other into the extender

1150228
ethernet	wireless
my theory is that doing so would enable me to get a wireless connection in my room that s as fast as if i plugged the computer directly into the ethernet plug in the wall

1150231

most of them if not all of them bridge the wireless with the ethernet interface

ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	linux
ubuntu and linux mint also have large user bases because they make things easy for beginners

1150693
sudo	passwd	sudoers	passwd
the default mint install makes the first account a sudoers and sudo requires the same passwd as the account

1150693
sudo	passwd	sudoers	passwd
i have discovered that putting the line defaults rootpw in sudoers makes sudo require the root passwd rather than the user passwd

1150693
sudo	passwd
one ubuntu site says that if you have accidentally enabled root to disable it again using sudo passwd -dl root

1150693
sudoers	passwd
which sounds good except wouldn t this then remove the root passwd that defaults rootpw now requires improving root account security but degrading the user sudoers account back to requiring only one passwd

1150732
freebsd	linux
for as long as i can remember on both mint other linux distros as well as freebsd the usual practice is to log in as a normal user then sudo or su to use the root account

windows 10 home can be upgrade to a pro versioning but requires a different key

1151591
versioning	upgrade
since you activated windows 10 professional before the free upgrade offer deadline you can simply install the current versioning of windows 10 1607 and it will automatically activate

1151591
installation	upgrade
you will need to upgrade your installation to windows 10 home

1151591

of course once you upgrade the installation from windows 10 home to windows 10 professional you will have reached the point where you cannot return to windows 7 home

our main product resides on amazon-web-services beanstalk which includes backend services as well as a portal on mean stack

1151701
beanstalk	amazon-web-services
now the question is that can i use the same domain name and ssl certificate on our portal deployed on amazon-web-services beanstalk while also being used on our godaddy site

1151704
beanstalk	amazon-web-services
the first way to to do this would be to deploy a reverse proxy on your amazon-web-services beanstalk to pull some content off the godaddy site - in that way everything would go to the single ip address and be proxied on so you could use a single ssl cert

1151704
beanstalk	amazon-web-services
another way would be to take advantage of the way that most ssl certs are signed for both the base domain and www domain so assuming your site was called example.com you could bind www.domain.com to the amazon-web-services beanstalk and domain.com to the godaddy site

1151709
switching	screens
i wanted to clear my terminal when exiting vim because i kept switching through screens terminals and seeing old exited vim windows

1151730
folder	directory
it looked strange and i maked some test with other files and directory and it turned out the system don t make any difference between files and folder which is reasonable since they re both inode but even stranger it don t care about the case of the names

1151759
folder	directory
i would like to apply specific permissions to any folder named _source automatically no matter where it appears in the directory structure

1151844
hide	show
toggle between show hide hidden files

1151844
hide	show
also a way to toggle between show hide system files from the command line would be great

1151850
hide	show
the property to show hide hidden files is managed in the registry so you would simply need a .reg file that simply toggles this property

1151905
versioning	upgrade
if it s an oem machine look for the windows license that came with the computer it s usually on a sticker right on the computer case otherwise you re getting a dummy key that says yo i m upgrade from an earlier versioning of windows

as far as i know there is no way to do this on a filesystems level directly as the access control lists of ntfs are limited to single objects

1152099

the centrino duo processors came with a 800mhz front-side bus and cpu clock speeds up to 2.4ghz

1152099

it is possible that the keyboard driver crashes and causes the keyboard to stop responding while the mouse still works

1152203
folder	directory
dropbox manages a certain folder on any device and i can t imagine it d take full control of the emulated camera directory so that s likely why you re not finding all of your pictures copied over

so all that you have to do is to install the cpu in the motherboard then install the cpu cooler on top of the processors

1152398
udp	tcp
the router takes a routed protocol tcp or udp and passes it to the provider network directly

1152482
wan	lan
again some of the newer routers when in access point mode will repurpose that wan port as an extra lan port but not all do

1152490
tunnel	packets
because the ssh tunnel does not transport ip packets but only their contents they arenâ t unmodified

1152509
folder	directory
you fix that by deleting whatever the checks are done against - temporary files and any msis in the directory you re downloading to or just download to an empty folder

1152534
wan	subnet
for example if your router r uses the 200.20.2.24 29 subnet for wan 1 then router r1 must use the same .24 29 subnet for its wan 1 -facing interface as well

1152551

1152726
notepad++	sublimetext
there are some applications like sublimetext notepad++ or netbeans on which the touch-pad scrolling of the laptop doesn t work effectively

1152758

therefore the timeout for udp connections is much shorter than that for tcp connections

1152764
ubuntu	debian
if there is suggest it but i m mainly thinking about arch ubuntu or debian

1152772
vmware	virtualbox	ubuntu	linux
if you can still use windows you can try wubi to perform a guided ubuntu dual-boot or if you wanted linux inside windows you could try virtualbox or vmware

1152774
mouse	keyboard
i had my wireless mouse keyboard usb dongle plugged into a slot on at the back of my computer

1152783
disk	ram
the script is busy messages simply indicate that a script is running for too long this could indicate one of a few things the script could be too cpu intensive either because of the script or because something in the way adds such scripts to the pages you load which could be a proxy or a malware the cpu could be too weak for the scripts or most likely - you are using more ram than the machine have could be caused too many open tabs application malware ram heavy pages or most likely too little ram on your machine this causes the os to swap memory to disk which causes a significant slowdown this case would be improved by using ssd because the swapping will be faster but adding ram would probably generate more improvement by rendering the swapping unnecessary

1152796

ffmpeg	libvpx
but if you have a recent build july 16 of ffmpeg with libvpx compiled then you can use

1153275
wan	lan
on most consumer home wi-fi gateways this means disabling the dhcp service and connecting the ethernet cable to a lan port instead of the wan port

1153275
wan	lan
some wi-fi routers let you disable nat and dhcp service which makes the wan port automatically become a lan port so if that s the case with your product do that.

there s a very nice open source app called karabiner which will do this and a whole lot more keyboard and mouse remapping etc

1153637
mouse	keyboard
as mentioned in the comments below that whilst a new version of karabiner elements has been released for macos sierra 10.12 onwards it only provides for keyboard based remapping so far - so currently mouse remapping can t be done with it

1153637

wan	lan
i decided to go with a setup where the routers are connected via lan ports instead of connecting router 1. s lan to router 2. s wan

1155590
wan	lan
what you tried to configure is doable but inconsistent with your drawing and your requirements to use router 2 as a boundary separating your lan from wan

1155590
wan	lan
take a simple approach and consider each of the two routers as having lan and wan interfaces

1155590
wan	lan
router 1 lan is connected to router 2 wan only

1155590
wan	lan
router 2 wan is connected to router 1 lan only

1155590

now you must configure a new network for the connection between your router 1 wan and router 2 lan

but that said when i had to upgrade my own vagrant stuff from ubuntu 12 to ubuntu 14 i had to adjust my provisioning scripts to account for new items such as new file system locations new versioning of core software and suchâ meaning itâ s not always a straightforward process and is highly dependent on what software you are using and what your specific configuration of that software is

the solution to both of these problems would be to convince windows 10 to separate the stylus input and mouse input and to calibrate the stylus to only reach as far as the tablet input screens

1157505
screens	tablet
i understand that this should be done through the tablet pc settings screens in the settings interface in windows 10 the screens that looks like this

mouse	keyboard
however on many websites i see mouse usb to ps 2 listed separately than keyboard usb to ps 2 adapters i wonder if they are internally identical or if they are different i.e they map some usb pins to some different ps 2 pins

1157815
mouse	keyboard
the converter contains a small chip that talks ps 2 either the keyboard or the mouse version to 1 connector and that acts as a usb device which involves being able to correctly respond to various usb commands to the other connector

1157815
mouse	keyboard	hid	keyboard
this usb device must among other things identify itself to the computer as either a usb hid mouse of a usb hid keyboard as appropriate

1157815
mouse	keyboard
there are converters that have 2 ps 2 connectors so you can connect both a mouse and a keyboard to 1 usb port

1157815

rpm	dnf
because in this case dnf will download the rpm packages and install them for you from the copr repository you already enabled

standard delimiter is spaces

1158450
vlan	packets
you could use vlans and give each cable a vlan number that way computers set to a particular vlan will only see packets tagged with that vlan number using a standard unmanaged switch to split the cable into multiple ports

1158450
vlan	packets
you could also use a managed business-grade switch that could handle the vlans by itself and assign each vlan to a particular port that way the computers don t need any configuration and it s a bit more secure as the machines don t receive the packets of the adjacent vlan where as in the first situation the packets still reach both machines so if any are evil they could still listen into the adjacent vlan s traffic

if i understand correctly if i want to run windows off of a raw disk with kvm as my host i must install ntfs drivers on the host and that will eliminate the need for two layers of filesystems one for the volume holding the vm and one for the partition inside the vm

1158865
filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	fat
the second is actually defined only for ntfs and fat filesystems

i ve tried most of the suggestions in those post except for swapping out the psu or motherboard which i ll attempt next but in the meantime i was hoping that my specific scenario of having the pc turned off for a year then having it up boot up successfully and turning it off after letting run for a few hours then experience the power cycling might lend some additional insight that could help me narrow down the problem further

the only time you have to pay additional money is if you upgrade as opposed to update from one versioning to the next like from versioning 10 to versioning 11

1159404
versioning	upgrade
currently you can upgrade from a versioning to a newer versioning like from 10 to 11 or 10 to 12 for some discount off the price of the versioning you are buying

folder	dir
once you are in the folder before the one you want to copy you can type dir x to find out the short name

1159944
wan	lan
it turns out that the wan port the internet feed port on router2 linksys cannot be configured to hold traffic with dhcp disabled - meaning the internet feed ethernet cable must be plugged into one of the 4 lan ports not the internet feed port also known by everyone but me as the wan port

1159944
wan	lan
as soon as i plugged the internet feed ethernet cable into one of the 4 lan ports on router2 instead of the wan port the router2 automatically configured itself as a access point bridge switch idk and allowed router1 to assign the ip addresses 192.168.0.x and now all the computers can successfully see each other on the network

1159944
wan	lan
kinda weak if you ask me the wan port should be able to be used as a lan or wan whatever i choose

1159944
wan	lan
concerning this i went ahead and bought a netgear n300 which does allow you to put the internet feed into the wan port and configure it as an access point which i guess intern treats the wan port as a lan port instead

1160023
mouse	keyboard
getting single session multi seat is oddly trivial with each keyboard and mouse paired though you can t pick two different spots on a file and start typing at once - i suspect this is a limitation of whatever software you run rather than the system

1160023
mouse	keyboard
i m testing this with lubuntu - i ve gotten two pointers which look the same with their own keyboard and mouse support

1160028

this only happens only with firefox but not google-chrome because google-chrome redirects it automatically

1161167

wan	lan
the understanding i have is that even though during data transfer in lan you are not uploading downloading from the internet wan you are still using the same wires and hence you will affect the downloading uploading speed of internet access

1165229
wan	lan
your wan use may be impacted because the traffic from a host to the wan needs to traverse the lan and if the lan is too busy then frames may get dropped

1165874
cpu	processors
due to the high cpu demand of h.264 video it is also quite likely that they chose not to enable cpu decoding above certain resolutions because a lot of the systems that have xp will be those that have old and slow processors that simply cannot decode it without assistance

move	drag
at the time of writing this i wondered if drag and drop would work but then i found this since one of the commenters said that dragging and dropping would move the actual music and not just copy that shot down the idea i had of doing that in combination with imgburn which can take a folder of music files and turn them into n .iso file

in the windows api a word is an unsigned short at least 2 bytes and thus depends on how shorts are implemented

1166747

kde	gnome
if your system uses systemd s localectl you might try setting that to what you d want and gnome kde might be able to pick it up from there

1167067
disk	ram
having read articles and watched many videos about virtualization i question for the possibility of installing bare metal type 1 hypervisors on each machine then creating a virtual machine which spread across the physical machines so i could install an operational system like windows on top to run softwares that need much resources like cpu ram hard disk etc

1167067
cpu	processors
using this way we could install an op and run for instance adobe after effects or adobe premiere which needs an outstanding parallel processing or cpu power in order to make previews in real time or to run complex software which could benefit from multiple processors

1167078
mouse	keyboard
the symptom after a random period of time a few days on average either the keyboard or the mouse on the system will stop responding

multiple computers multiple usb adapters using different drivers and multiple bluetooth headsets

1167195
filesystems	ntfs
since this is the second hard disk which fails after being cloned filled with an ext4 filesystems the previous one that i ve tried was a smaller sata hdd i ask myself if the ahci drive recognition routine needs additional information from the hard disk in order to give the ok to boot and if there is no ntfs fat32 it stalls

1167215
google-chrome	firefox
of course microsoft edge firefox and google-chrome are useless in this case

1167232
16-bit	64bit
windows 98-era apps that no longer work in windows 7 include 16-bit apps which do not run on 64bit windows but sometimes run on 32-bit windows and apps that rely on either hacks or arcane legacy os services

1167234
x86	64bit
since both win9x and nt including win7 use the win32 api and the x86 instruction set amd s 64bit extensions to intel s x86 instruction set are backward compatible

1167234
filesystems	fat
of course this whole write to the directory you re running from thing is easy i did say the devs were being lazy... and yes it also makes software portable in the sense that you can put it on a flashdrive which is usually also completely lacking access controls as they use variants of the fat filesystems and fat doesn t support file permissions

1167234
x86	64bit
this is actually a really stupid convention because some software breaks if you install it to a location with spaces in its path but maybe ms wanted to ensure developers weren t being quite that lazy... the only special thing about program files is that on 64bit systems when 32-bit processes ask for the program files folder they actually get directed to the program files x86 folder

apache	nginx
you can run apache and nginx on the same instance so long as they attach to different ports

1167375
apache	nginx
apache nginx either of these two seem like a viable solution

1167375

the other hurdle before me with either the apache or nginx options is that most of the guides and tutorials assume i already know everything there is to know about apache or nginx

1167405

lftp	duplicity
the problem is that i am using this ftp server set up with vsftpd as destination for other server s backup a windows server where the backup is managed with cobian and it hasn t any problem and a linux server where the backup is managed by duplicity that uses lftp to transfer data that is locked on opening connection because it try to ls the server since i can ls the server with the ftp command and the windows server can put the backup files without problems i guess that the problem is related to lftp not to the vsftpd server

i m using kde as the ati proprietary doc states gnome is not supported

1169562
ubuntu	linux
this is problem i have repeatedly on several different computers and version of linux mostly ubuntu now 16.04 lts

the issue stopped when i used a separate mouse and a separate keyboard instead of using the touchpad and the keyboard of the laptop

1169596

i remember having encountered such issue with mint and i m currently encountering it with ubuntu version 16.04 the installer is tyrannical enough to not allow any other choice than dev sda as the location for grub

1169596
debian	centos
other distributions are much more flexible in this regard like centos and probably also debian although i cannot remember well

1169596

ssd	sata
is it possible to make linux recognize two sata devices one is the ssd and one is the hdd and use them independently

1169672
ssd	sata
this is not possible the hd and ssd parts of the firecuda are interwoven at the firmware level to appear as a single device to the sata bus

1169674

1174189
x86	64bit
honestly neither are correct both fail to recgonize that all 64bit processors are x86 processors

1174189
x86	64bit
you have to fall back to the fact that all 64bit processors are x86 processors this means that all 64bit processors support 32-bit software

1174189
x86	64bit
windows will identify itself as x86 or x64 depending if it s a 32-bit or 64bit installation

1174326
packets	multicast
for example this blocks all multicast packets exiting via atheros wireless interfaces

1174326

google-chrome	safari
also when i try directly accessing the file in safari on a macbook it won t load but it will in google-chrome

1174957
dns	spf
you still need to get all the lines in a single dns response to parse the spf record

1174957
dns	spf
but what you can do is reference other spf records from a single spf record and thus spread it over multiple dns responses which of course affects the performance

1174967

1174987

1176536
post	get
if i get to the bottom of it before you i ll post it here

1176573
udp	tcp
and that s really not a linux issue it s because networking protocols are the way they are for historical reasons both tcp and udp don t support fail-over multihoming having several interfaces with different ip addresses at one end that can all be used equivalently

1176573
udp	tcp	sctp	udp	sctp	tcp
1 instead of tcp and udp use a protocol that allows fail-over multihoming for example sctp

1176573
sctp	tcp
edit i found there is a wrapper command called withsctp that makes the wrapped application use sctp instead of tcp

1176576
put	get
but isn t there a simpler saner way to get this window to pop up that i could put in to run after login

for example you move the campaigns into the column headers and move the weeks to the row labels drag data into the data section again and then customize it to show percentage of parent subtotals change the titles of the fields add conditional formatting to highlight the per campaign with the highest subtotal go into the pivottable tools design ribbon and change the style etc

1176746
folder	directory
the profile.ini tells thunderbird which of the folder in that directory to use as profile folder when starting thunderbird

1177013
google-chrome	firefox
my internet connection does not work on edge and google-chrome it only works on firefox

1177030
wan	lan
to help keep those addresses straight the main detail to keep track of here is that the addresses starting with 192.168.1 are for ip addresses on the lan while the addresses starting with 203.0.113 are addresses for the wan connection where the router connects to the isp

1177030
wan	lan	wan	subnet
if your computer at 192.168.1.200 tries to communicate with 203.0.113.6 you router s wan port then your router will receive traffic on you router s lan port maybe at 192.168.1.15 and the router will realize traffic should communicate using subnet that contains 203.0.113.5 and 203.0.113.6

1177103

1177211
tunnel	vpn
macos has a sophisticated system for dns request routing scoped queries in order to handle cases like vpn where you might want requests for your work s domain name to go down your vpn tunnel so that you get answers from your work s internal dns servers which may have more different information than your work s external dns servers

1177352
filesystems	ntfs
i had a file that was encrypted using windows efs on an ntfs filesystems

1177362
put	get
now about the other part only wipe luks headers as you can imagine and as i told you it is not enough to avoid others with infinite time money and resources to get such data if you let them put theirs hands on it

1177362
cpu	processors
pre-boot code runs in 16 bit mode and also can jump to 32 bits mode but not to 64 128 bit modes actually there are very little 128bit processors most are only prototypes so it runs a lot of times slower and since you need to do random maths or patterns cpu is highly used

1177364
google-chrome	firefox
looking for some command line shortcut which launches google-chrome firefox and ie simultaneously with specific address

1177364
google-chrome	firefox
i.e should be launched in google-chrome ie and firefox at same time

basically you can run a virtualbox vmware appliance called archiveteam warrior but i decided to go with the linux scripts

1177420
ubuntu	debian
another option is virtualbox with a debian or ubuntu guest

1177432
wan	lan
do note that not all routers are capable of loopback traffic meaning they expect connections on the nat with public ip address to be coming from the wan port not any of the lan port so it may not be possible to test the forward rules on your router from inside the network

1177491
traceroute	packets
traceroute packets aren t going out either

1177510
pppoe	dhcp
if the tplink wasn t configured via dhcp then you probably need to set up pppoe

1177519
hex	binary
- this would help me in the reversing of the binary hex data in the files

1177521
google-chrome	firefox
by the way you can also use the method described here to set google-chrome or firefox as the default browser

1177534
hex	binary
while it s far from the best thing out there for editing binary files it s certainly suitable for browsing a hex file and jumping to specific addresses

1177548
min	max
the problem is that if i want to set the first vp0 hotkey in ahk i would set lshift should be space vp0 tool max size but since when pressing lshift to set vp0 tool max size it sets vp0 tool min size cuz ahk detects that shift is been pressed

1177548
min	max
i also have tried this bellow but i would like to avoid using loops cuz it switchs rapidly between set brush max size n set brush min size

1177550
hide	show
then just hide your column with the numbers and only your months will show

1177566
min	max
however i cannot seem to get values for just those rows but rather get the max min value for all of the column

1177606
wan	lan	wan	multicast
so if this device has to be connected to an ethernet lan make sure there are no multicast broadcasts on that lan or put the ap in nat gateway mode so it won t bridge multicast broadcasts from the wan or lan to the wlan

1177625
mouse	keyboard
one of them it works properly and the other the mouse and keyboard are very slow and turned to not working

1177669
cpu	processors
on windows 10 my processors typically idles around 8 cpu usage and runs about 45 degrees celsius

1177745
tunnel	vpn
i believe i can do this by either configuring a vpn setting up my home pc as an ftp server or even with ssh tunnel

1177751
filesystems	ntfs
i use ntfs filesystems

1177814
tunnel	vpn
if you canâ t set up port forwards host services or do not have a public ipv4 address due to cgnat ds-lite whatever you could look into a vpn service that allows hosting services or rent a vps to play tunnel broker yourself

1177839
installation	upgrade
i find chocolatey very useful for windows installation management new upgrade and removal and cygwin is no exception

1177851

1177952
mp3	flac
many people can t tell the difference between high bitrate mp3 and flac i can on my home listening gear but even then its not a massive difference

1177952
wav	flac
practically speaking at the same given sample rate without any other bottlenecks flac will sound exactly the the same as the wav file

1177953
wav	flac	mp3	wav	mp3	flac
wav can contain audio in any format including mp3 and ...why flac

1177953
wav	flac
wav is comparable to flac only and only when it contains uncompressed audio or audio compressed with a lossless codec

1177955
wav	flac
pcm wav is also a lossless codec and therefore has identical quality to flac and every other lossless codec

1177958
filesystems	ntfs
you probably formatted your flash drive as ntfs filesystems

1177989

udp	tcp	tunnel	packets
to establish a tunnel between server 1 and server 2 you ll need a connection between server 1 and server 2 that works realiably for tcp or udp packets

1178023
tunnel	packets
then you can tunnel packets directly over this connection

1178023
udp	tcp
exception your router blocks tcp packets but not udp packets then you could use udp to encapsulate tcp

1178039
tunnel	vpn
your vpn i assume when activated overrides this default route and sends all traffic into the vpn tunnel

1178039
tunnel	vpn
you must be able to reach it in order to set up a vpn tunnel

1178058
arp	udp
so first you set a port forwarding mapping for port 9 udp to the static unicast ip address of the target device and then you set a static arp mapping to map that ip address to the target device s mac address

1178066

given the image path as an uri of the kind file c my_directory subdir image.xcf take the hex-form of the md5 hash of this path and save the thumbnail as a png file named in a .cache folder on the user home directory

1178085
wan	lan
many wireless routers don t let you turn off nat so you just have to turn off their dhcp server feature and plug their lan port into your home lan and leave their wan port empty

1178095
mouse	keyboard
i want to use a 3rd party wii u pro controller as an xbox controller or mapped to my keyboard mouse

recently i ve been learning how to use vim and i m getting comfortable enabling the vintage mode in sublimetext

1181802
vim	sublimetext
as for sublimetext with vim mode enabled it will display command mode or insert mode in the status bar not in the title bar

1181802
vim	sublimetext
so autohotkey is unable to tell whether sublimetext s vim is currently on command or insert mode

eeaa s answer is good but i would recommend md5 hash because it would be faster and in this case you don t care about security

1182571
ubuntu	centos
that still doesn t account for the 10x slow-down you mentioned in your answer as a comment in which you mentioned 10x slower for ubuntu 16.04 and 20x slower than centos 7.3 both on a gen2 xeon server and which i guess the moderators have unfortunately removed

openvpn	iptables
i am familiar with iptables and recently i wanted to build a statefull firewall which is connected to a openvpn server

1182674
wan	lan	vpn	lan
if someone is willing to explain how for example eth0 wan eth1 lan and tun0 vpn pass the packets between each other

1182690
cpu	processors
i ve tried to dig deeper and used processors explorer to get more information which strangely enough shows that system interrupts uses up more of the cpu than the system process

1182695

and to get the name field to show up on the original sales receipt screen under the donor box it shows their name and address i added their name to the customer address field and in the ship to box i put the customer name only

there are two independent packet flows â one for the original packets from lan and another for encapsulated packets towards wan

1182698
vpn	lan
for example a lan client tries to reach a remote host via the vpn

1182698

debian	linux
so i ve set up nginx to serve static websites per user on gnu linux debian 8 using the following naming convention username

each user s public web folder is located in their respective home directory and that s also where they will be expected to keep their node.js projects

1182736
mouse	keyboard
right now we do have a monitor keyboard and mouse in order to set things up but at the competition we are not allowed to use any of these devices

1182737

examining those script will give you all the details you need about the changes performed to your system upon package installation upgrade removal

1182775
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and ie both use windows internet options but firefox does not

1182786
ubuntu	linux
to ensure this you can boot a live linux usb disk ubuntu fedora etc using the gnome disks utility you can perform extended s.m.a.r.t

for the macbook aluminum unibody it s bootcamp 4.0.4033

1182935
wan	lan	wan	subnet
i suggest you change the lan and wan subnet of r2 to something like 192.168.2.0 24 wan and 192.168.3.0 24 lan and assign the computer c1 a static ip address in the new lan range

1182960
put	get
the way i am doing it right now is make a graph of the column put a trend line that is always exponential get the formula and use it to get the extrapolated value

versioning	upgrade
cb current branch â this is the latest versioning of windows and is called current branch this versioning receives all upgrade new versioning and updates patches from microsoft within a few days of their release

1183006
sudo	passwd
as for logging in if you want this automated you re best bet may be to make it so that the sudo or su commands simply don t ask for a passwd

1183006
sudoers	passwd
you can typically see an example in most default etc sudoers files so just copy the example except remove the comment character that is disabling the example. the easy way to do that is to remove the passwd entry requirement for everybody all the time

1183015
ubuntu	linux
for example on ubuntu or any other gnu linux system you can write a very basic script like this for details see the cli documentation page

1183026
minix	linux
where minix pre-dated linux history link and whose shortcomings

1183044
folder	directory
recently i m not certain exactly when the home directory used by this combination changed from my windows user folder to which is causing minor havoc for me

1183052
filesystems	ntfs
remove all of the partition that you have in the drive and format it completely to ntfs filesystems

1183089
udp	tcp	sctp	udp	sctp	tcp
port forwarding typically has to do with the router receiving traffic from the internet on a specific port typically tcp or udp although i know at least sctp also uses ports and then your router knows what internal device the traffic should be sent to

1183089
tunnel	vpn
vpn traffic tends to use tunnel although the p in vpn refers to private as vpns include encryption which may be more than what you need

antivirus	norton

1183181
disk	ram
the delete it self can go so fast since the host is a linux that speed is caused just because linux caches all writes to the fixed size file that is used as the disk on the virtual machine 24gib and since i have 64gib of ram and i let to the windows 16gib it does not need to use swap neither pagefile.sys

1183181
disk	ram
yes if i put the virtual disk totally on ram cleanmgr time does not drop but if i manaully delete the files that time drops down just a little linux write cache is great when you have 64gib of ram on it

1183181
disk	ram

1183232
udp	tcp
first thing to note â each tcp and udp socket has two ports source and destination

1183239
put	get
this method should get all of the files out of the recycle bin but be aware you will have to put them back where they belong yourself if you need them to be in a specific directory

bash	zsh	bash	tcsh	ash	tcsh	zsh	tcsh	tcsh	dash
the shell can of course be customized ash bash dash and sh are included by default but just run the cygwin installer and you can add your choice of zsh mksh tcsh or posh

1183401
ubuntu	linux
i m looking for a linux tool i m running ubuntu script etc

1183480
sudo	passwd
for me sudo -v and sudo -l did not work in a script because sometimes interactive asking me for a passwd like mentioned above

1183480
sudo	passwd
sudo -n -l did also not work it gave the exit code 1 although i have sudo permissions because of the missing passwd

1183488
stdout	stderr
behavior like that generally indicates that the output is going to stderr rather than stdout

1183515
disk	ram
i would recommend being familiar with safe and usual working cpu ram disk and gpu temperatures before setting new limits it sounds like you are but this advice is for anyone else reading also

1183584
folder	directory
any modification made to this sync folder under google drive directory will also be updated and synced automatically

1183597
tunnel	vpn
also if you don t use vpn tunnel

i am actually having this trouble with all cron jobs on the server but am focusing on one process in this question for simplicity s sake.

1183695
centos	linux
linux distro for server failing cron centos release 6.8

1183703
ubuntu	debian
even though it says debian the dhcp server should be the same in arch as it is in debian ubuntu

1183723
daemon	cron
between rh5.2 and rh6.8 to say nothing of centos there are quite a lot of differences which i wish i had a source for right now including i think a change to the cron daemon from cron to cronie i think

1183723
jobs	cron
you say this is happening for all cron jobs so i would check selinux first

1183729
folder	directory
since you say your using tax software i would imagine you could create a save location somewhere in your home directory using an auto mounted folder

1183882
des	aes
if i were to receive the same file but had no clue what algorithm was used des aes blowfish etc. then more investigation would have to occur before i could attempt to crack it properly or i could throw it to the various crackers while i m investigating knowing that it might be a waste of computational time

1183906
mouse	keyboard
of course you could do that with your mouse or cmd-q on your keyboard too so i m not sure what that really saves you

1183941
for-loop	loops
you could loops over the a variable in a for-loop

1183941

br it s simple if a does not contain other delimiter s like spaces tab comma or equals sign

1183941
spaces	delimiter
otherwise if a contains some other delimiter s like spaces tab comma or equals sign

1183949
mouse	keyboard
however i noticed that when i was sitting in front of the pc at my office i cannot type any input with the physical keyboard and the mouse does not work either

1183949
mouse	keyboard
the keyboard and mouse gets electricity from usb ports and they work during the system bootup and self test procedures but when the control is handed over to windows login manager they fail and do not seem to receive electricity from the ports

1183955
pscx	import-module
but then when i run import-module pscx i get the error

1183955
pscx	import-module
my final attempt was in the admin prompt to remove the module and install it again with -scope allusers but this still gives the same error when i try to import-module pscx in a non-admin prompt

1183986
put	get
i would probably get an image of the floorplan put it into a form and overlay it with buttons or links for each pc tag them with the pc name and have it launch a script to retrieve and display the desired information

1183999
tunnel	vpn
since your vpn is acting as an intermediary they ll be able to send and receive the data through that protected ip or tunnel - though in some instances you ll have to forward your ports to enable this data processing

whether or not your provided allows inbound traffic is another matter but keep in mind torrenting generally uses udp where the notion of stateful is a little more complicated than for tcp

1184018

steamos is a debian-based linux operating system by valve corporation and is the primary operating system for valve s steam machine video game console

1184267

amusingly modern consoles are often x86 or at least general purpose systems running variants of powerpc or i guess arm or mips they do run cut-down specialized versions of standard oses - sony uses freebsd ms uses a windows varient and so on

1184267
debian	linux
you need an underlying os to run steam linux or windows - and even steamos is debian running steam as its main ui

even dumber the natural 7000 mouse works fine with mmkc 2.8 and the natural 7000 mouse and keyboard come as a set that use the same dongle

so if you have the 7000 desktop your mouse will work but your keyboard won t

if you ve already been tinkering with trying to install nginx it might also be a good idea to go ahead and re-install the latest firmware just to get everything back to a good base point careful if you ve put any tweaks customizations outside of the usual cli configure or web interface options - you might lose them

1184321
nginx	lighttpd
i personally prefer to use a non-standard port 553 in the example config below for the lighttpd service gui provided by default on the router and then use the nginx listening on standard ports 80 443 as a reverse proxy for lighttpd

not sure if this holds true for freebsd but on linux you could check for tcp retransmits potentially as a percentage of overall packets seen in a given time frame

1184377
sudoers	visudo
you can edit the sudoers file at etc sudoers using visudo

1184380
icmp	tcp
you can use mtr program with -u option that use datagrams instead of icmp echo or option -t that using tcp syn packets

1184425
mouse	keyboard
edit to simplify for future reference what i was searching for was a keyboard mouse sharing software

1184425
switching	screens
this way i would be able to switching from my monitor to my laptop s screens seemingly as if the laptop was a second monitor and keep my internet connection good on the computer

1184430
filesystems	hfs+
i feel this is filesystems dependent and hope hfs+ filesystems has some superior features here..but i know nothing about it

1184432
macports	homebrew
also consider linux-like repositories that contain a lot of applications ported directly for macos like homebrew or macports if you only want some tools gnu versions of grep awk etc... but don t really care what os they run on

1184452
traceroute	packets
the answer by iwaseatenbyagrue is a good answer i upvoted it but it suffers from a simple defect it returns global packets loss statistics while ping and mtr a combined traceroute ping tool are local to communications in other words they will detail packets loss on a specific communication not on the average of all communications you entertained in the past

1184452
udp	tcp
the basis of this is the fact that tcp packets but not udp packets carry a sequential sequence number though the number of the first packet is determined in a roundabout way to circumvent a certain class of attacks which makes it possible to ask for a repeat send whenever a packet is dropped before reaching the intended destination

1184470

keeping in mind sql server on linux i want to install ubuntu linux os on above two machines

1192740
cpu	processors
i am at a bit of a loss to what could be causing the issue the only difference between the stock cooler and the new cooler is that the stock cooler has a latch that you pull down once it s hocked onto the brackets around the processors which secures it in place where as the new cooler just hooks onto the bracket and is just secured into place by tightening the screws on the bridge that hooks onto the bracket maybe it s not fully connected onto the cpu even though it doesn t appear to have a gap between the heatsink and the processors and when you remove it the processors appears to be covered in the thermal paste from the heatsink which would suggest it s touching

the 64bit or 128bit designation for your video card has to do with its internal architecture specifically the interface between the gpu and the card s onboard memory not the slot it plugs into

1193436
wan	lan
it would be quite hard but if i was on a budget i d make sure the routers spoke openwrt and convert each router so it had 3 lan ports and 2 wan ports

1193436
wan	lan
the lan ports for each router would feed the local building with 1 wan port feeding the wifi bridge and the second one feeding the internet connection

installation	upgrade
i assumed that the best way to fix it as it s a boot problem as it says was to repair it with the windows 10 installation disk and after repairing it windows started normal but every now and then i get the bootmgr is missing press ctrl+alt+del to restart message i think it is because although i upgrade to win10 it kept the win7 boot manager and when i repaired it with win10 something got messed up

folder	directory
i m not even entirely sure how this happened but in one of our sub directory there is a folder where the name is just a dot i think

1193715
folder	directory
it also appears that maybe rsync is treating this like a dot also and so it copies the directory into itself infinitely once it gets to this folder all i see in there terminal is an ever growing number of slashes at the end of the directory

it affect several programs not just one as reloading the page neither works in safari or google-chrome until i restart the machine - something which is often not an option when i am in the middle of work

1193871
wan	lan	wan	vlan
it is now wirelessly connected to the main router as a client with 192.168.0.7 as ip which is now the wan address and is rebroadcasting that as a new lan or actually a vlan i think as a new seperate wifi connection

this happens with both bash and zsh

1193885
ubuntu	linux
the times git bash goes slow i start using bash on ubuntu on windows the linux subsystem in windows

1194423
mouse	keyboard
i m using a jelly comb mk09 wireless keyboard and mouse

1194424
folder	directory
this question here describes how to find the total number of items in firefox s bookmarks menu with the caveat that it only counts folder and files in the top-level directory - meaning that folder containing other files or folder will be counted as single items resulting in a skewed bookmark count when you rely on folder to keep your bookmarks organised

1194441
filesystems	ntfs
since i will copy the files from an ext4 filesystems to a ntfs filesystems and i may want to recover some info back to ext4 i am suspecting that i will lose some specific control information like permissions ownership etc.

1194455
tvos	ios
configuring advanced networking things like socks proxies on tvos is done like it s done on ios by creating a special configuration profile .mobileconfig file and installing it on the device

google-chrome	safari
i don t want to participate in google analytics so i want my browser mostly google-chrome but also safari - solutions for both platforms are appreciated to simply remove the last part of any link that ends in

1194529
sudoers	passwd
then add this line to the sudoers file this is optional it will make it so you don t have to input your passwd when you try to use the namespace we created

1194541
folder	directory
if i try to write by explicit reference the folder eg computer drive folder subfolder filename it seems to work but its cumbersome and it would be easier if the user could select his own directory but use a standard sharename

1194547
ubuntu	linux
i m using zfs 0.6.5.8 on ubuntu 16.10 with linux 4.8.0

1194625

i ve been successful in making a line graphing or xy scatter plot to graphing our conductivity test foam has to be tested at 2 concentration 3 concentration and 4 concentration

1194793
ssd	sata
another solution would be to replace the hdd with an ssd if your computer uses sata for hdd connectivity

1194807
i2c	spi
if you go for old mechanical style many usb-to-serial bridges on the market usb to uart spi or i2c frequently have additional gpios both input and outputs with all tools software and hardware demo modules available

1194810
folder	directory
by default it will create a new folder called nppbackup in the working directory of the file your are editing

1194819
ubuntu	linux
i m not sure if this helps but i had issues with iommu and usb 3.0 when i switched from using windows as my main os to ubuntu linux

1194855
folder	dir
if i try to check the folder though cmd it does not show when i type dir but appears if i do dir a

1194872
ssid	wlan
if you want now to extend the wlan signal with the same ssid what you have to do is configure both routers with the same ssids same encryption wpa2-psk both for example same password and broadcast on different channels

1194879
ethernet	wireless	wan	lan
the goal connect an existing wireless lan to an existing wireless wan without an ethernet drop

1194879
ethernet	wireless
in the past when i had this portable wireless subnet setup i had an ethernet drop i could plug into my router thereby serving its original purpose as a router

1194879

in the current configuration i have no ethernet drop but only access to the wireless wan

1194879
ethernet	wireless
router b a wireless router that connects to router a via ethernet and to the wan wireless flashed with dd-wrt

h.265	hevc
numbered 15.36.14.4080 this update imbues haswell and broadwell processors with hardware acceleration support for two next-gen video formats hevc also known as h.265 and google s vp9

1194915
h.265	hevc
on the 970 the video decoder is slightly older and as such does not support h.265 hevc at all while the decoder in the 960 is newer and apparently should support both main and main10 profiles

1194939
nas	qnap	ssd	sata
the nas doesn t have pci-e sata for a small ssd disk on module seems to be what qnap used though they don t seem readily available to consumers

mouse	keyboard
is it possible on mac os x or linux to have two sets of keyboard and mouse working simultaneously and independently on one computer

1194953
ftp	smb
i tried sftp smb ftp also made no difference

1194965

pop-up	dialog
i was recently exposed to a new type of pop-up ad in order to avoid being closed quickly by the user a htaccess login dialog box is displayed while a video or any other sound-based ad is playing in the background

1194990
pop-up	dialog
this kind of pop-up windows are particularly difficult to close as the login dialog is opening again and again each time you click the cancel button at least on firefox

1194990
pop-up	dialog
note the login box is indeed an htaccess login dialog and not only a regular javascript alert as the problematic pop-up also displays a js alert

1195019
chown	chmod
you can change the permissions with chmod and chown

1195087
packets	pcap
edit for example when receiving a file via ftp or http if the file is divided into say 10 packets i want all packets and the headers to be in the same dump file.it would also be helpful if i could dump each flow in pcap format in a single file

1195096
ubuntu	opensuse
my college system are various pcs running ubuntu 14.04 x64 and some version of opensuse

1195097
bluetooth	usb
i have no usb devices connected to the system so it is unclear what this unknown usb device is above - perhaps it could be the bluetooth adapter but i don t seem to be able to get that unknown device to find a driver update online

1195121
opensuse	linux	ubuntu	opensuse	ubuntu	linux
major linux distributions like ubuntu fedora and opensuse all support secure boot

1195131
wan	lan
is there a way that i can block incoming and outgoing connections both lan and wan to from a program in macos

1195143
jobs	cron
another possible avenue is to review your cron tables to see which cron jobs are run immediately before the files are nuked

1195151
restrict	shared
how do i limit access to my wired wireless network printers for just my users and restrict others on shared network without having to setup private subnet

1195154
ubuntu	linux
on ubuntu and other linux distributions

1195174
wan	subnet
yes it may be much easier to use a dedicated wifi extender to do this but if you have a couple wireless routers lying around or want to connect an existing wireless subnet to a wan wirelessly this may be just the thing

1195174
wan	multicast
under block wan requests uncheck everything block anon wan filter multicast and filter ident are checked

1195197
filesystems	ntfs
i would also use either ntfs or exfat for the filesystems

1195198
debian	linux
iâ ve tried to create a new linux bridge in proxmox that i give to the pfsense as a secondary lan card and give the new card only to the debian computer but iâ ve couldnâ t set it up in any way

1195233
h.264	hevc
for some reason ffmpeg doesn t support vp9 encoding on intel s quicksync hardware encoder even though they support h.264 and hevc

1195233
cpu	processors
as you can see the number of threads used goes up with the number of tiles which means that depending on the number of cpu cores available your processors might not be fully saturated while encoding sub-hd-resolution video

1195233
ffmpeg	libvpx
if you want to try it out before the next release you need to compile recent git versions of libvpx and ffmpeg from source

1195235
ssd	sata
if both the ssd and hdd no matter the size have the same interface which is probably sata in your case

1195237
minimum	max
changing the plan to high performance let the processor achieve the max speed and further changing the advanced power settings entry for minimum processor state to the lowest possible value 5 allowed it to use lower frequencies when idle

1195276
folder	directory
i have a folder contain a directory symbolic link with its structure as following

1195280
ubuntu	linux
that issue occurs when linux and windows are installed for dual boot.try running ubuntu first and enable wifi incase it is switched off.then run windows and it would work fine

1195307
filesystems	btrfs
remount the root filesystems ext4 or btrfs with nobarrier so linux doesn t hang while trying to go into s3 then sync

1195307
filesystems	btrfs
if you use another filesystems not ext4 or btrfs then you might experience issues with barrier so you ll need to modify the script too

1195309
sorting	grouping
it takes care of lots of things like showing memory in mb sorting on memory and mainly grouping by command

1195310
udp	tcp	packets	multicast
does an ipv6 router need to use neighbor solicitation with the solicited-node multicast address when returning replies to ping requests or other tcp udp packets

1195316
gif	png
you could track the output file size while adjusting image quality parameters the file type it offered jpeg png and gif and seeing a preview of the result

1195317
post	get
that s all i know for now i ll be happy to hear of real solutions or post one if i get there

1195326
udp	tcp	packets	multicast
does an ipv6 router need to use neighbor solicitation with the solicited-node multicast address when returning replies to ping requests or other tcp udp packets

1195326
packets	multicast
additionally if the ap does deliver the ns packets to the client you might get different results if it supports multicast-to-unicast which is more reliable but sometimes confuses the receiving device vs when it uses actual wi-fi multicast

1195337
rss	feed
a has a special rss feed folder and b is the new main account also in outloo settings and i want to move the special rss folder in b

1195420

1195444
mediainfo	mkv
here s some info about the mkv file by using mediainfo

1195459
folder	directory
this is not a fool proof answer because users can override the umask but you can set the umask of your public folder to be inherited by other users so that any directory they make will have 777 permission too

1195490
sip	sdp
sip-alg allows a nat router to re-write information within the sip messages sip headers and sdp body

1195490
voip	sip
this make signaling and audio traffic between the client behind nat a voip phone for example and the sip endpoint possible

1195490
sip	sdp
breaking sip signalling many of the actual common routers with inbuilt sip alg modify sip headers and the sdp body incorrectly

1195508
centos	linux
googling centos bcm43228 linux finds this the bcm43228 and some other drivers are not natively supported by centos and you have to download and compile the broadcom driver from the broadcom official website as described in the link

1195530
putty	winscp
just in case it matters i have been making quite some relevant use of ssh scp on both cygwin and ubuntu bash on windows using winscp putty also opening ports for running remote python notebooks tensorboard using vpns to the extent that i don t know but sometimes my internet stop working and also can t connect to vpn anymore

1195532
ssd	sata
a buddy s computer has an ssd on sata 0 which can be used to boot into windows

1195532

move	drag
i can t drag and there s no move option when i right click the taskbar

vmware	virtualbox
remember i m running my dev envrionment in vmware workstation while docker uses virtualbox

1195683
vmware	virtualbox
port binding may be a bit tricky though because you ll have to somehow connect your dev-env vm in vmware with docker vm in virtualbox

1195691
jobs	cron
the server itself is able to send email both local like from cron jobs and domain users

1195691
lan	localhost
may be a dumb question but why is it trying to connect to localhost instead of example.com on the lan

1195730
ubuntu	debian
on my debian ubuntu a quick search

1195793
portrait	landscape
once printed and bound the section with the huge table in landscape orientation would have the header and footer on the sides as opposed to top and bottom because the document as a whole is bound in portrait mode

1195793
portrait	landscape
guys do you have any ideas how to achieve landscape table in portrait oriented page please

1195822
theano	tensorflow
for my work it would be ideal if i can run gpu-accelerated neural network frameworks on it particularly theano or tensorflow

1195822
theano	tensorflow
will i be able to run either theano or tensorflow on this gpu

1195822
theano	tensorflow
i believe theano and tensorflow both use require cuda to work

1195831
vim	emacs
in vim and emacs documentation c- and m- stand for ctrl and meta alt respectively

1195840
subtract	add
im trying to subtract todays date cell a from an original incident date cell b to come up with days outstanding but when the original incident date sunday i used the weekday function to come up with #7 cell c i need to add 1 day to the outstanding total.

1195879
width	height
first you have to remove the merged cells you can increase the row height and column width instead your data will become 6 rows only and 16 columns

1195884
rpm	yum
so my issue basically cannot use rpm right now or even yum update because getting this error message

1195898
move	drag
row a2 to have the smallest nth row for index to move when you drag it down

1195901

you could try downloading a copy of linux mint or ubuntu etc then burn it to a cd dvd or create a usb bootable flash stick

1195920
ethernet	wireless
a netcomm wireless modem router model nf12 acts as a modem as a wifi router covering one side of the house and as an ethernet router routeing internet data to from a second d-link wifi router model dir-615 via the home ethernet network the slave router

1195929
folder	directory
manually add a shared folder in virtualbox with name vagrant and path to the directory of your vagrantfile

1195934
debian	centos
iâ ve actually never seen this file before i run debian not centos but it appears to be basically a broader form of etc hostname that lets you set more options

1195946
google-chrome	firefox
it has extensions to allow use from firefox v44.0+ only or google-chrome

1195953
put	get
to get the first line of each set to align with the others put a tab between the index and the equation and use move the tab marker to an appropriate spot

1195971
vmware	virtualbox
after some searching i found decided to use virtualbox inside ubuntu which is still inside vmware

1195971
vmware	virtualbox
the problem is when i read t 49636 it encourages me not to use the ovf but rather use the vmware .vmdk files while creating what seems to be a virtualbox shell around those .vmdk files

1196009
google-chrome	firefox	opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome
i would like to allow only one web browser firefox google-chrome or opera

1196010
hex	binary
you will need a hex editor for two reasons one many text editors will alter the file in some way you are not expecting and that will kill a binary file

1196011
filesystems	ntfs
only fat32 or ntfs filesystems provided by windows os

1196030
client-side	server-side
turns out that if a client-side rule has the stop processing more rules command then any following server-side rules are not executed - i guess because the server gets the message first and doesn t know whether the client-side rules will be triggered so it assumes that it will

1196042
chgrp	chmod
the classical way to do it is to create a new group make all user who should have access to the shared directory members of this group make a directory directly under home home groupx use chgrp to set the new group for this directory and use chmod g+rw and chmod g+s to set the setgid bit on this directory

1196065
vmware	virtualbox
don t install virtualbox on the same computer as vmware

1196066
pci	iommu

1196146
mouse	keyboard
i don t need the keyboard mouse headphones or the monitor to be on working during this only firefox and websites

1196170
post	get
http proxy allows regular methods like get post etc

1196196
vmware	virtualbox	virtualbox	parallels
clearly parallels management don t care as they didn t change this in parallels 12 so if you have the same problem as me either don t upgrade or dump parallels for virtualbox or vmware or something else..

1196197
vmware	virtualbox
virtualization -- you can install a 32-bit windows in a virtual machine virtualbox vmware etc.

1196200
16-bit	64bit
so what happens is that with the arrival of 64bit cpus which internally can run in either 16 32 or 64bit mode microsoft created a bios bootloader that switches from 32-bit 16-bit execution mode the mode a 64bit cpu is in after leaving the bios to 64bit execution mode just like it has a bootloader that switches from 16 to 32-bit mode for 32-bit windows

filesystems	fat
i haven t checked recently creates a hybrid mbr if you put a fat or exfat filesystems on a partition

1196283
ssd	sata
i d recommend that you install your ssd in your laptop sata slot because the bandwidth of sata 3 is twice than odd bandwidth for example the theoretical speed of your ssd is approx

1196283
ssd	sata
450mb s in sata slot and if you install your ssd in the hdd caddy the theoretical speed of your ssd is approx 250ish mb s thus your ssd capabilities isn t utilized well i think the bandwidth of odd is 3gbps

the vpn server needs at least one public ip and dns resolving to a public ip in order to allow vpn software to create the tunnel but once the tunnel is up it s perfectly fine for hosts behind the vpn can have private ip addresses that are accessible on a network only available through the vpn

i discovered this problem while using a microcontroller board that supports a tiny fat filesystems containing python code

1197909
filesystems	btrfs
on a cow filesystems like btrfs you can achieve this by using subvolumes + snapshots or cp with --reflink always this will effectively result in as many files as you want which would consume the same amount of space as one + some overhead but without an insane number of copies or snapshots especially combined with tiny file sizes this should not be noticeable until they are modified in which case only the parts that have been changed are stored separately and the rest is still shared

cpu	processors
for example if you think that by cpu it means processors that it means processors then it d be saying that the processors contains a processors

1198036
cpu	processors
and the definition that people are more familiar with nowadays which is cpu as processors

1198036
cpu	processors
but if it refers to processors or cpu in the sense of processors then no that s not true

1198036
cpu	processors
but in terms of choosing definitions that are accepted and agreed upon by people in this interconnected age of the internet modern times no cpu should really just be defined as processors because it s easier that way and people get confused otherwise

1198044
cpu	processors
the most important item of hardware is the cpu central processing unit ....it contains the processors and the main memory

1198044
cpu	processors
traditionally the term cpu refers to a processors more specifically to its processing unit and control unit cu distinguishing these core elements of a computer from external components such as main memory and i o circuitry

modern processors now also include cpu cache

filesystems	fat
before proceeding though you should understand that cds generally boot with the help of an el torito image which is a fat filesystems stored on the cd alongside its normal iso-9660 or udf filesystems

1198410
filesystems	fat
thus you must prepare both an el torito fat filesystems and an iso-9660 or udf filesystems

1198410
filesystems	fat
create a bootable fat filesystems image

1198410
filesystems	fat
prepare the disc storing the fat filesystems image as an el torito alternate image and the rest of the files if any in the main iso-9660 or udf filesystems

1198412

now you have to use indirect in countif to reflect the sheet named

1198413
vpn	lan
windows does not let me access lan resources while the vpn is active presumably because of a networking conflict of some kind

1198420
vpn	lan
in most cases the vpn client software intentionally enforces this blockade to prevent your computer becoming a bridge between the vpn network and the local lan

1198420
vpn	lan
the vpn client in such cases firewalls the local lan off and gives itself the lowest metric value in the routing table so it becomes the sink for all traffic

1198453

1199350

xfs	ntfs
is it possible to use dd to copy data from an ntfs drive to an xfs formatted drive

1199366
xfs	ntfs
however from your description it s not clear that what you re asking can you store data from ntfs onto xfs will do exactly what you want

1199366
filesystems	ntfs
this stores the entire ntfs partition including the metadata like the internal structures of the filesystems into a file called ntfscopy

1199366
xfs	ntfs
this shows a useful example of having data copied from an ntfs drive to an xfs drive and that works

1199366
filesystems	ntfs
now what if you just wanted the files copied from an ntfs drive and not the entire ntfs partition including the internal filesystems structure which is what makes the partition use ntfs formatting

1199366
filesystems	ntfs
by using a different tool you can avoid unnecessarily reading copying all of the ntfs internal filesystems structures

1203687
ubuntu	linux
many standard linux installs including ubuntu allow you to select full disk encryption on boot and don t require a grub password as part of the gui

1203687
disk	ram
it does this buy loading the pre-boot environment from a ram disk and using this and luks to unlock the partition

1203696
tunnel	vpn
you can tunnel your internet connection via a vpn to another computer with a static ip address so a dynamic ip change won t be noticed by the game but it will increase latency and it will cost money

1203760
disk	ram
i unplugged everything and reseated the ram gpu and hard disk drives

1203781
filesystems	fat
ms happens to include the fat filesystems driver in a package of sample driver code

1203781
filesystems	fat
there are several places in that driver where if the filesystems is fat12 the driver will not bother to do something like set the dirty bit maybe there is none for fat12 or flush the fat data

1203781
filesystems	fat
in the last link in cleanup.c the fat is not flushed if the filesystems is fat12

1203967
udp	tcp
uses port 111 for tcp and udp for server and client side

1203967
udp	tcp
it runs on port 2049 for tcp and udp on the nfs server side

1203967
udp	tcp
tcp and udp would need to be opened on the server side

1203967
udp	tcp
the port would be 4003 for tcp and udp on the server

1203991
centos	linux
why people say amazon linux is centos

1204043
redhat	fedora
looks like fedora redhat centos are almost the same thing

1204043

ubuntu	linux
on the same network i have a number of machines ubuntu linux desktops configured with static ips 192.168.10.101 - 192.168.10.1xx all of which can potentially handle these messages

1204089
openvpn	iptables
for a solution that uses iptables and ip iproute2 it is assumed that the default gateway interface before openvpn is started is eth0

1204102
ethernet	wireless	wan	lan
in both cases you will need to disable dhcp on your wireless router and connect an ethernet cable from either pc above to one of the lan not internet or wan ports on your wireless router

1204113
put	get
i can t figure out how to get windows to directly put these characters in when i type rather than me having to type it in romaji

1204121
filesystems	ntfs
i accidentally formatted an ext4 partition to ntfs in my ubuntu 16.04 recently and was able to recover the full partition successfully by running a filesystems check

1204122
disk	ram
it does not particularly matter other than that specific linux versions come with a sane set of settings for disk space and ram usage - which can be handy when running a popular distro or a derivative of it

1204160
wan	lan
that said the correct solution is to get a 3 port router - 1 for each wan interface and 1 for the lan interface

1204160
wan	lan
you can then load balance change configurations on the wan ports without making changes on the lan ports and without fear of dhcp issues

1204180
afp	smb
i have a nas with a public ip x.y.z.10 and a computer with a public ip x.y.z.20 which can connect to it via afp or whatever the heck windows uses when you write server folder smb

however when i try to connect from another computer lan private ip 192.168.1.100 via a router wan public ip x.y.z.30 i can only use ftp or http to access the web interface

i ve unfortunately been using them a lot with recent mint ubuntu versions that are a lot less stable than the slightly older 14.04 - now debian stable - versions

1204411
ubuntu	debian
several are usually disabled in debian ubuntu but they can usually be turned on off with proc sys kernel sysrq

1204421

i m using firefox but a google-chrome solution would also be welcome

a standard 1080p movie is 4 gb or less with h.264 or h.265

1204507
feedback	review
my own solution for now is going to have to be creating a parallel document just for reviewers yuk collecting feedback and then editing the master document but that is then going to mean importing the comments resaving the review copy before sending it out again for any updates

1204521
put	get
note2 i used task manager as an example window it doesn t really matter what i put in the screen if it the size gets a bit bigger than maybe half the screen i get the orange thing

1204532
post	get
during post of the machine i also get nothing via display port connections

the same with bash and zsh

1204810

1204813
mouse	keyboard
when windows has started up again use the mouse to activate on screen keyboard and use that to finish setup

1204865
pull	push
scp essentially works in either a push or pull fashion

1204919
udp	tcp
depending on the way your network works its also possible that the failure is happening because you are not allowing dns to be resolved you should allow udp and tcp to your nameservers on port 53 for this

1204925
vpn	lan
getting a router with vpn server capability is the best way to go from a technical pov because it simplifies routing offers the vpn service at the point where its most beneficial - the edge of the network - and allows additional functionality to access other parts of your lan securely

1204925
nas	qnap	cpu	processors
i also note that most modern cpu s including those in many qnap devices have aes instructions - if your nas does have a processors with support for aes and openvpn uses it - which it probably will - then it would not even use that much processors

1204951
disk	ram
going into hibernation involves saving the machine s state all ram content to a hard disk file

1204970
ubuntu	debian
i am able to boot into 32-bit ubuntu and debian

1205007
opera	firefox
if i change the default browser to opera for example it works correctly so it looks to be something related to the firefox configuration

1205007
debian	linux
linux distro debian jessie

1205029
google-chrome	firefox
i believe it works correctly in other browsers ie google-chrome but am struggling for a universal solution in firefox

1205034
vpn	lan
it certainly is possible to connect to a vpn at the router and have your whole lan tunneled through it without having to do any special configuration on the client devices

1205039
vmware	virtualbox
i inherited an opensuse 13.2 harlequin virtual machine from previous developer and exported disk files from virtualbox vdi to vmware s vmdk

1205046
email	dkim
i am signing outbound email using dkim

1205060
udp	tcp
you need to ensure your firewall router is forwarding requests on udp and tcp port 53 to your nameserver

1205092
hide	show
also it s easy to show hide color categories in outlook so this works fine for the desktop client but obviously there s no option to show hide color categories when you sync to the google calendar android app

1205095
versioning	upgrade
the only difference between the installed versioning of linuxmint and the live versioning is that i ve upgrade the packages to the latest versioning i tried to install the system again but everything still the same

1205098
mp4	h.264
i want to use a minimal build configuration that disables everything except what s needed to transcode a .mov video with h.264 video and aac audio to a different bit rate in an mp4 container

1205116
direct3d	directx
direct3d is the primary graphics handling portion of directx

1205116
direct3d	directx
this means that your directx version matches your direct3d version

1205139
restrict	shared
be aware that shared vms also will be network-accessible but this can be restrict by configuring a firewall on your host and or router

1205175
apache	nginx
i have set up nginx as a reverse proxy to apache but now would like to test whether it s working

1205175
apache	nginx
how i can verify that nginx reverse proxy + apache works correctly

1205175
apache	nginx
but actually i get the response server nginx whether or not i query a file that is served by nginx or apache

1205185
ubuntu	linux
however i am now running firefox 51 on ubuntu linux and i discovered that setting javascript.enabled to false in about config still allows already-running scripts to run until the next page refresh

1205202
apache	nginx
this way any requests being passed on to apache would have the header while requests handled internally by nginx would not

1205204
unix	bsd
this is a posix command only suitable for linux unix bsd systems or for windows 10 using the bash shell but that cannot be combined with cmd shell statements as far as i know

1205244
vpn	lan
are there other options to have the vms accessible remotely even when their network is disconnected through vpn maybe something like using virtualbox in a terminalserver now windows remote desktop services server or perhaps getting around the lan disconnect clients come preconfigured no way to change how to behave on certain address ranges

1205245
google-chrome	firefox
on linux google-chrome chromium is similar in showing multiple processes instead of just one like firefox but they re both comparable in resource usage

1205245
google-chrome	firefox
fyi there s a way to see all firefox s hidden processes too so it s similar to google-chrome i don t know how to do that in windows though

1205285
width	height
if the input height is equal or greater then the full width height is passed through to the scale filter

1205289
mouse	keyboard
the big problem in this point the new motherboard just has usb 3.0 and it doesn t accept mouse + keyboard without the specific usb 3.0 driver

1205289
mouse	keyboard
is there a way to install this driver without having a mouse a keyboard and not the possibility of using another pc to preinstall the driver before switching hardware maybe a bootable tool to boot from usb-stick which auto-add the driver to the available windows installation on my hdd or other solutions

1205291
msg	eml
format raw msg source this will save as eml

1205303

1205352
tunnel	vpn
i have created a vpn tunnel to my remote server

1205411
switching	screens
i would recommend switching back to bios and using --bioslogodisplaytime to adjust the bios splash screens afterward

1205417
robocopy	xcopy
using robocopy xcopy works fine but i d like to fix this issue so that right-click copy and ctrl+c will work keeping timestamps again

1205451
google-chrome	firefox
edit it s worth noting this issue happens in google-chrome firefox and microsoft edge though the symbol looks different in each browser

1205481
filesystems	ntfs
since this question is tagged windows-server-2003 this answer assumes use of the ntfs filesystems

1205481
filesystems	ntfs
there is at least one entry in the mft for every file on an ntfs filesystems volume including the mft itself..

1205481
filesystems	ntfs
when files are deleted from an ntfs filesystems volume their mft entries are marked as free and may be reused

1205534
google-chrome	firefox
i have tried all browsers google-chrome firefox and edge

in addition you could always drag it out if you just need the files within that folder and move it to the correct location after that

1205561
google-chrome	firefox
browser latest versions of google-chrome and mozilla firefox

1205561
google-chrome	firefox
extensions ghostery and adblock plus on both google-chrome and firefox

1205563
diffmerge	winmerge
does anyone know whether p4merge winmerge and diffmerge are independent standalone applications or they use a remote server to execute the diff merge analysis

1205564
folder	directory
more important note this code will create a temporary directory and delete it when it s finished - please check all paths and names in the code to ensure that by some coincidence this isn t an existing folder on your system

1205597
disk	ram
the key is that this type of encryption is always encrypted on disk it s never really decrypted to disk and only decrypted in ram a few blocks at a time as required for reading

1205622
client-side	server-side
keep in mind that outlook client-side rules can do a lot more than server-side rules

1205622
client-side	server-side
for example moving can only be done to a folder inside that mailbox on the server-side while client-side rules can move it to any mailbox accessible by this profile

1205631
fish	bash
there is apparently a problem in how the combo shell fish in my case but this also happens with bash + editor handle line returns

1205719
ethernet	wireless
the computer i m trying to wake up is connected via ethernet while my other computer is wireless

1205719
ethernet	wireless
the ssid for 5g ethernet modem default and 5g custom wireless are different but would that effect anything

1205729
subnet	packets
unless you specifically enabled some form of subnet directed broadcasts the wol packets must be sent by a computer on the same lan subnet

1205767
disk	ram
this will still not get you the disk based system you wanted as the entire filesystem will be in ram â possibly a lot of ram

1205767
disk	ram
load the extensions with the copy-to-fs option which will eat up a lot of ram and then somehow image the running file system â but you still need to figure out how to get it running on disk

1205800
folder	directory
what i m trying to figure out if it is possible to create global shortcut .lnk files using wildcards or regex so that way i could make a portable app place a shortcut on the upper directory and zip it hence the software which is within the folder among a bunch of files don t become a mess to find run

1205802
putty	winscp
now i can connect to my server via putty or winscp as ssh service is on by default in the public zone

javascript is used to show or hide a tab filters map list ...

1205973
packets	pcap
i have a pcap file that has some packets in it created with tcpdump

1205973

the only thing even remotely trustworthy about email contents today are dkim signatures which prove that the email was processed through an email server sanctioned by the domain registrant

1209527

of course many updated servers use extensions like dkim to verify that such an email is authentic but there are still many old mail servers out there that don t care simply because it s tempting to not fix things that are not broken

1209886
ssd	sata
while the laptop technically accepts a 2.5 7mm z-height sata hard drive or ssd that would require disassembling a brand-new system that s not meant to be user-serviceable not to mention that this defeats the purpose of spending 230 on the system so i d rather not do that if at all possible

1210164
wan	lan
3 if you have multiple wans you do the above for every wan but i believe that things get tricky because on your firewall each lan rule that passes traffic should be dealing with a specific wan 4

1210164
wan	lan
in my case when i had 2 wans i splitted the lan ips in even and odd ones and each group was using a specific wan with fail over of course

1210164
wan	lan
packets flowing from the local network into the lan interface will become wan upload and vice versa

1210219
wan	lan
the fact that both both the wan and lan vnics are bridged to the same physical interface could cause a number of issues

1210306

my linux system is running centos 7 which as of today ships samba 4.4.4

installation	downgrade
would it be possible to re-activate the installation of server 2008 standard not r2 within a hyper-v instance on windows server 2016 standard and activate it under the premise of a license downgrade and if so could this possibly cause issues for the datacenter s existing license

as i stand up from my chair my desk might vibrate and my mouse might move slightly or i might accidentally hit a single key on the keyboard as the computer prepares to sleep

1210696

i know i could stop the keyboard mouse from waking the computer via power options but that s more of an inconvenient workaround than a cure

if this works for you you might have to use ethernet connection instead of wireless

i m using hyper-v on a physical windows 2012 r2 server when configuring my virtual switch i specify the nic that has connectivity to the network for external connectivity

upon inspection of the config files in the .ebextensions folder i can see that the config file that mounts the efs creates a symbolic link between the mount directory and the wp-content uploads

if you are prepared to learn some linux configuration magic then any of the linux distributions would do you - i d recommend debian as it is stable simple and well supported

h.264	hevc
libx264 h.264 libx265 hevc and libvpx-vp9 can also be used in lossless mode

1212038
h.264	hevc
vp9 and hevc are more efficient than h.264 in terms of how much space they require but they may take longer to encode

1212038
h.264	hevc
with vp9 hevc and h.264 at least with the encoders available in ffmpeg you can set a crf parameter that gives you the quality you want

1213646
sudo	passwd
you are asked your own passwd because you are using sudo

1213646

1213658
freebsd	linux
it s not clear to me how to proceed further so i d appreciate some pointers on whether this is possible with linux or if it s better to set this up in freebsd

1213664
bash	subshell
assuming myscript is executable and is having a shebang line pointing to the bash binary - there is no difference between running . myscript alone or bash . myscript but running bash -c . myscript is creating one more subshell level - which you can see by checking the shlvl var 3 x bash

1213664
bash	subshell
usually you re in a bash terminal session when executing . myscript the shebang line is calling bash and creating a bash subshell in which it s running the commands

i copy the directory to various drives and backup services so i need the file-paths truncated to beneath the 260 max_path limitation via their actual location in the folder to be reflected across each duplicate location but i need my working directory to include their virtual locations in the folder

tunnel	vpn
in that case you need to set up nat masquerading in the namespace and a tunnel between the default namespace and the vpn namespace

1215799

in this case then tunnel will have static ip addresses that you assign so that will work around the dynamic ip addresses assigned by the vpn

if a family of cpus or a particular socket can support such a wide min max number of lanes e.g from 16-lanes to 64-lanes-or-more then there is no good way for a motherboard manufacturer to really offer a fully functional product for every cpu that could be installed - you might buy a motherboard that supports 4x 16-lane pcie slots but a cpu that only has 16 lanes available.

my ultimate solution was to separate the startup of the daemons and tmux windows into 2 separate processes both automated with systemd

1217822
daemons	systemd
i chose to use a systemd systemd unit to start the daemons and a session unit to start the tmux script

1217822
daemons	systemd
although i haven t tried putting both the daemons and tmux scripts in user session systemd units i believe that could be done without issue

1217842
udp	tcp
dns speaks on tcp and udp port 53 so you would need to add

1217893
sudo	passwd	sudoers	passwd
again i advise strongly not to do that it might be much easier to adapt your sudoers file to allow sudo path to script without a passwd

1217894
processors	hyperthreading
you could also try to disable hyperthreading by limiting the number of available processors to windows run msconfig in boot advanced options

1217936
switching	screens
connect to your windows 10 pc from another computer using remote desktop and then use fast user switching to get to the login prompt so you can grab a screens shot

1217944
filesystems	fat
efi-mode booting involves accessing files on a fat filesystems so a simple file-level backup using cp zip tar or similar tools is perfectly adequate

1217953
mouse	keyboard
no keyboard shortcuts are effective and the mouse pointer can still move but i m unable to click

1217955
mouse	keyboard
foreground application stops receiving keyboard and mouse events

1217979
width	height
also to prevent conflicts such as the aformentioned the script checks the width and height of the rename dialogue window so as to verify that it s a match

1217980
mouse	trackpad	mouse	keyboard
i m using sierra is there a option to while in mission control alternate the selection between apps with keyboard only without using the mouse or trackpad

1217989
bluetooth	usb
if the bluetooth disappears from the device manager and reinstalling the drivers doesn t work use a bluetooth usb dongle you can get one for 3.99-4.99 on amazon

1218015
ffmpeg	avisynth
the way my program is set up is that i need to have a stream in ffmpeg frameserve to an avisynth script and then frameserve back to ffmpeg

1218015
ffmpeg	avisynth
the problem i m having is with jumping from ffmpeg to avisynth

1218015
ffmpeg	avisynth
i saw somewhere that you could open a tcp stream from ffmpeg to avisynth but i couldn t get it to work and that s not that elegant of a solution anyways

1218015
ffmpeg	avisynth
i don t necessarily need to frameserve from just ffmpeg to avisynth but i could also just use some way to frameserve from anything to avisynth

1218089
ssd	sata
it appears that this was an instance of sata saturation this particular controller couldn t handle a ssd and a hdd plugged into the same controller moving the ssd to a different controller fixed the issue for me

1218105
mouse	keyboard
my job lets me work from home often and when i do this currently i move my keyboard off my desk to make room for my work laptop and a 2nd wireless mouse

1218113
versioning	upgrade
this is sort of a continuation of this discussion which i started before i upgrade to os sierra and the current mamp pro versioning

1218188
versioning	upgrade
they would not run unless the os was updated to a versioning the respective upgrade would recognize as valid

1218189
apache	nginx
and do apache and php-fpm work well or nginx and php-fpm is better

1218257
vpn	lan
i ve been able to configure the vpn router so it can take pptp connection from with-in the lan but keep failing when attempting to connect from outside my lan

1218267
wan	lan	vpn	lan
i have a dedicated router running an openvpn client connected via a lan port on the main gateway router to the wan port on the vpn router

1218267
vpn	lan
i normally work from a machine connected to another lan port on the main gateway router but i would like to connect to my raspberrypi via ssh that is connected to a lan port on the vpn router

1218268
post	put
i modded the cpu and put it in but when i power on the machine the board will not post nor will it power any fans connected to it however things like the lights still work on the front panel

1218293
filesystems	ntfs
the filesystems driver keeps a bunch of metadata about the current state of low-level ntfs data structures in ram block pointers to open handles cache data journal rewind position clean vs

1218293
disk	ram
the caveat with that feature however is that any changes made to the file system are silently redirected entirely to a ram disk and are dumped every time the system is powered off effectively making the whole filesystem read-only after that point

1218301
put	get
i put refind on the drive from kali in an attempt to fix the issue but actually it created more problems now i can t get into osx at all

1218309
tunnel	lan
in my network my openvpn server uses the 10.22.4.0 24 subnet to tunnel clients and the lan network which i want them to have access to is 10.22.1.0 24

1218309
vpn	lan
what command should i include in the custom options to allow vpn clients to access the lan

1218326
versioning	upgrade
for me i had to upgrade my browser versioning to the latest and it worked

1218330
vpn	lan
what route should i push to grant vpn clients access to the lan 10.21.1.0 24

1218330
vpn	lan
doing push route 10.21.1.0 255.255.255.0 still doesn t allow my vpn clients to access the lan

1218330
wan	lan
momentarily i added the following rules on the wan and lan interfaces

1218331
vpn	lan
also pfsense will need explicit pass rules on the lan and vpn interfaces for the vpn traffic

1218331
vpn	lan
now we have to create a rule that says lan clients are allowed to talk to vpn clients

1218339
min	max
if you change the function from min to max you get this

1218344
gif	png	gif	bmp	bmp	png
most image formats are supported png gif jpg tif and bmp

1218351
filesystems	fat
fat uses tables in central locations while inodes are spread throughout the filesystems

1218423
mouse	keyboard
i have a lg monitor and sven keyboard and mouse

1218453
openvpn	iptables
that would allow you to circumvent most iptables -related problems because packets would not pass through the usual stack but they would be routed internally to openvpn

1218467
mouse	keyboard
one holds my mouse one my cooling pad which gives an extra port into which i plugged in my keyboard

1218520
versioning	upgrade
asked the kde guys they said upgrade to the latest versioning which isn t possible so filed a bug on bugs.centos.org

1218524
debian	linux
i want to make a debian installer usb drive using the netinst linux and initrd images

1218534
bash	shellcheck
you can use shellcheck to check for errors in your bash scripts

1218538
vpn	ssid
for the other ssid i want to connect my router to vpn and route all client traffics to the vpn

1218570
ubuntu	debian
this way ensures that your package will reach the largest number of users as it will be available in not just debian and ubuntu but all of their derivatives as well

1218570
ubuntu	debian
new packages - the entire document is invaluable for both ubuntu and debian packagers

1218570
ubuntu	debian
for instance debian might be in a freeze making it unlikely that your package will make it into ubuntu in time for the next release

1218682
vmware	virtualbox
the problem is that with all my virtual machines with both virtualbox and vmware no matter what vm i install both new ones and old ones that worked fine before in terms of showing up in scans for ip and ports none of them are showing up any longer for nmap scans

1218682
vmware	virtualbox
beyond that nothing shows up in nmap or any ip scanner from virtualbox vmware or the win 7 host

1218684
udp	tcp
i asked before how to forward log entries received by rsyslog tcp udp port to journald

1218696
hide	show
note that the extended value will hide the context menu and show only when you press shift key and right click

1218716
move	drag
select file s right click drag drop move here

1218754
gmail	hotmail
i am currently using hotmail gmail and yahoo

1218760
stdout	stderr
note that ffmpeg s output is written to stderr and not stdout what is this

1218760
stdout	stderr
if you want to grep ffmpeg s log output you need to first pipe everything from stderr to stdout which in bash you can do with

1218762
filesystems	fat
i discovered now that likely the filesystems of the sdcard in which i directed the output file of dd was a fat one

1218767
ubuntu	mint
i couldn t get the latest ubuntu desktop studio to install and cinamon mint only partially

1218803
move	drag
the frustrating thing for me is that when i grab a scrollbar with the mouse and drag it the window content does not move until i release the mouse button

1218824
tunnel	packets
checking the tunnel interface reveals 0 packets input and i m unsure of how i can troubleshoot this

1218866
ubuntu	linux
my windows installation has contracted a virus and i want to format and replace it with ubuntu linux

1218880
tunnel	lan
with a 64 you can only have one lan and you already configured it on the tunnel itself

1218881
wan	subnet
basically i want a number of wireless devices to connect to a router and the router port forward wach address in the subnet to a port on the router s wan ip 192.168.0.xxx 80 to 192.168.1.1 10xxx

1218881
ethernet	wireless
and then the wireless router s wan port be connected to the ethernet of the pc so that the single pc can communicate with each of the devices using a single ip address and varying port numbers

1218893
robocopy	xcopy
i can clone 1tb of data in under 4 hours but all methods i have tried copy xcopy robocopy that try to move files iteratively take at least 24 hours to copy the same data set

1218936
ethernet	wireless	wan	lan
beware that since the tl-wr802n doesn t have separate ethernet wan and lan ports you ll probably want all of your iot devices to be wireless

1218936
wan	lan
if you need any of the protected iot devices to be connected to ethernet you ll want to pick a router with separate wan and lan ports

1218990
robocopy	xcopy
solution use some third-party-gui-tool like free commander freeware win | total commander shareware win | midnight commander freeware nix or use os-built-in cli-tools like robocopy win | xcopy win | cat nix | .

1218990
robocopy	xcopy
code-sources and additional information robocopy - xcopy - cat

1219023
tunnel	vpn
so what i d like to do is to make it so my chromecast which is my primary streaming client doesn t use the vpn tunnel

1219038
google-chrome	safari
whenever i go to a website on both safari and google-chrome both browsers seem to pause their progress bar for a second or two before loading the site

1219061
fast-forward	merge
finally again assuming that commit h looks good we want to fast-forward master to include our fixed merge

1219090
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
in mac os x 10.6 i unzip the package open the file i tried several browsers firefox safari and google-chrome the browser opens a window with the adobe presenter logo but don t load any other content.

1219119
post	get
i want to log all get and post requests but apart from logs which i can do with this

1219119
post	get
is there an apache extension or another solution that ic an use to log http requests on get and post

1219137
filesystems	btrfs
there s filesystems like btrfs or zfs supporting compression but from my understanding that shouldn t work in a setup using ecryptfs because the filesystems only see random encrypted data and can t compress it anymore

1219137
filesystems	btrfs	lvm	btrfs
additionally i m aware of lower level things like luks but am especially interested in something on top of the filesystems to easier be able to use btrfs and zfs with their lvm possibilities to increase storage and such

1219156
pop-up	dialog
i right click the installer i then select run as administrator and get the usual uac dialog pop-up

1219165
min	max
load watts 700w standard runtime 2.4 min max load

1219182
folder	directory
while working with the github gui tool for windows i did some branch switching that created a new folder in my working directory

1219195
ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	linux
boot the computer using a live linux distribution like ubuntu o linux mint for both distributions i propose the latest version but simpler no-fuzz graphics desktop

1219203
apache	nginx
for example shut down your http server nginx apache .. if you do not use it

1219204
min	max
-advanced settings max smb3 min smb2

1219208
osx	yosemite
running a mac osx yosemite 10.10.5

1219210
ethernet	wireless
semi-direct using a power line adaptor to send ethernet wire thru ur outlet on the main floor and plug the other near ur laptop in the basement to get the signal maybe the best simplest option almost as fast as direct and much better then wireless tp-link is better too bad it wasnt out when i got all my units

1219212
disk	ram
if you can i suggest you to open the computer and re-insert the ram and connect the cables to hard disk properly

1219213
versioning	upgrade
versioning 58 causes graphical glitches on my system so i haven t upgrade yet

1219232
filesystems	fat
now not only can you manually mount any drives on your system weâ ve also added support for other filesystems such as fat as well as mounting network locations

1219241
put	get
corporate usually will put the screws to the people to get the job done right so they dont get bad reviews

1219241
yelp	twitter
if all else fails post bad reviews everywhere yelp angieslist facebook twitter etc after they notice they might change there mind about not fixing your laptop

1219250
cpu	processors
i don t know exactly why that happen but changing it to 100 will make my processors power decreased if i stress my cpu or overheat it which affect the processors speed

1219293
width	height
open the pdf with a text editor notepad look for width and height

1219293
width	height
take the height and width and divide them by the page height and width in inches

1219296
ssl	https
then i installed mod_ssl in the webservers and im able to successfully connect to my webservers using https from my host machine.im using default self signed ssl only

1219303
minimum	max
the power preset is high performace with minimum level of cpu 1 max 100

1219331
arp	dhcp
virtualbox examines arp and dhcp packets in order to learn the ip

1219336
versioning	upgrade
another package requires it and apt upgrade wants to install the older versioning

1219343
versioning	upgrade
upgrade is used to install the newest versioning of all packages currently installed ... under no circumstances are ... packages not already installed retrieved and installed

1219343
versioning	upgrade

i know these programs have randomly closed atom-editor discord steam slack notepad++ sourcetree and devstax

1219428
ethernet	wireless
my pc is connected to via ethernet cable and my macbook is connected to my wireless on the same network.i believe i have done all that was asked of me in order to establish the connection to my remote machine

1219434
folder	dir	folder	directory
this command searches all the text files recursively in the dir folder i want to start the search from dir1 for instance which is a child folder of dir and i am unable to make this work the error was the file does not exist the dir1 folder is present inside d directory .how can i directly find a file in the dir1 folder

1219440
filesystems	btrfs
but if you used a luks container you could then use a compressing filesystems like btrfs or zfs

1219446
elasticsearch	kibana
i am trying to daemonise elasticsearch kibana and logstash processes using supervisor as they shut down at times due to ram issues

1219464
sudo	passwd
if you are really want to create superuser copy of root but with other passwd and home directory and not a sudo user use uid 0 and gid 0 for new user

1219466
google-chrome	firefox
you have to stipulate an user-agent of a common browser firefox google-chrome ...

1219471
opera	google-chrome
i m trying to import my passwords from google-chrome into opera but it s not working it shows that all settings were imported successfully even though the passwords aren t there bookmarks are

1219471
google-chrome	firefox	opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome
i ve also tried to install firefox import the passwords from google-chrome in there and then import the passwords from firefox into opera but that didn t work either

1219485
google-chrome	firefox
copying things like the above from a browser like google-chrome or firefox makes things even slower

1219488
opera	google-chrome
it should work if you export opera google-chrome passwords to a xml file and then import passwords from a xml file to opera google-chrome

1219499
screens	tablet
after installing windows i get all drivers for my laptop and everything works fine except that my touchscreen doesn t work and also the screens doesn t rotate to the appropriate orientation when the notebook is in tablet mode

1219540

there are directory that when a user create modify files or folder the others users has read only permissions

1219616
ubuntu	centos
i am currently testing my solution on an ubuntu 16.04 but plan to deploy the solution on centos 7

1219633
post	put
amazon s3 apis such as put post and copy can create an object

1219645
robocopy	xcopy
programs like robocopy or xcopy will hang or error out

1219652
cpu	processors
i see that the rasberry pi zero has a slightly faster processors than the raspberry pi 3 and wikipedia says that the rp3 can decode h.265 in software using the cpu it lacks dedicated h.265 decoding hardware

1219721
subnet	packets
what i do not understand when the server is running and i listen on the server with netcat nc -ulv -p 9 i can see the packets coming in in both cases both when sending to the subnet ip and when sending to the public ip of the router

1219723
cpu	processors
you can see if the power saver plan helps or you can be even more restrictive and limit the cpu maximim processors state to some low percentage

1219725
arp	dhcp
you have defined static internal ip for the server which connects ip and mac but this is for dhcp server not arp table

1219732
mouse	keyboard
how are you using just a kvm switch for just the keyboard and mouse

1219732
mouse	keyboard
now i am unsure of how to get the mouse and keyboard situated

1219745
ubuntu	mint
note this works on a ubuntu mint system where sudo provides root privileges

1219757
bsd	aix
mklabel msdos valid label types are one of aix amiga bsd dvh gpt mac msdos pc98 sun loop

1219760
redhat	fedora
first i had to install the epel repo for redhat which works on fedora 25

1219786
mouse	keyboard
mouse and keyboard usb 2.0 and 3.0

1219799
debian	linux
since that time i haven t done that used windows and macs usually and lost track of linux except at work with embedded micros that used a particular flavor of debian

1219799
ubuntu	debian
i am thinking ubuntu is the most popular now- a debian like one so different than my experience with fedora- but then i heard of others

1219801
ubuntu	debian
i am thinking ubuntu is the most popular now- a debian like one so different than my experience with fedora- but then i heard of others

1219801
ubuntu	debian
ubuntu has slipped even below debian

1219822
debian	linux
i m running debian linux but i m not sure if that is relevant

1219848
ubuntu	linux
but i ve shifted to gnu linux ubuntu

1219929
folder	directory
there is only one folder inside the working directory

1219929
folder	directory
there are a bunch of folder inside the working directory and need to navigate inside the first available folder sorted alphabetically

1219942
starttls	smtps
the may also block 465 smtps which is considered deprecated now that starttls is available in the protocol

1219957
ubuntu	linux
i mostly use firefox with noscript on linux ubuntu

1219969
tunnel	lan
there s a rule to permit the tunnel network to talk to the lan and vice versa

1219991
folder	directory
the directory utility application is in that folder or in a subfolder

1219995
tunnel	packets
due to client network security requirements i am required to make all connections via an ssh tunnel which only transmits tcp packets

1219995
udp	tcp
i have successfully configured socat to forward udp packets via tcp between a single client and the server

1219995
tunnel	vpn
i realize that there are better ways to achieve this eg a vpn or ssf but due to client requirements i m limited to solutions that run over a ssh tunnel

1220002
folder	directory
you would need to symlink the file and all of its dependent files folder - so in other words you can t simply symlink the file you would likely need to symlink the directory and put that directory on the path which kind of defeats the purpose you are trying to achieve

1220040
opera	google-chrome
these browsers did not work google-chrome on linux and macbook opera on linux

1220040
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
these browsers worked google-chrome on iphone safari on iphone safari on macbook firefox on linux

1220059
mouse	trackpad
we would still be left to using the mouse trackpad to click on the specific bookmark

1220085
ubuntu	mint
so i thought it might be worth having a go at same on ubuntu mint 16.04 with default glade 3.18.3-1 installed

1220086
postfix	dovecot
another option which i ve done when i wanted to do something similar is to actually take delivery on my postfix dovecot mail server and use gmail s service to import email from another account via pop3

1220086
pull	push
that is have gmail pull from your server rather than your server trying to push to gmail

1220095
postfix	dovecot
use lmtp to send from postfix to dovecot

1220109
ubuntu	linux
i have a dual boot windows 10 ubuntu 16.04 lts setup with all of my important programming files split between the two oses so i want to be careful not to mess anything up that i can t easily fix i m fairly inexperienced with linux

1220134
mouse	keyboard
when i get to the first window the usb keyboard and mouse do not respond

1220135
umask	mount
your mount options use an umask that prevent shared files and directories to be created with the group writable attribute

1220167
ati	nvidia
look at the registry to find an entry for nvidia intel ati there were none

1220203
folder	directory
would remove everything folder files in the current directory

1220225
wan	lan
here i disable the dhcp and wan the cables is connected on lan port

1220274
filesystems	fat
in the instructions above it s creating an efi boot partition as a kind of proactive measure against future changes efi boot partitions are fat small-ish fat fat filesystems that chainload drivers basically

one is running ubuntu 16.04 the other is centos 7

1220327
mouse	keyboard
robotjs handles mouse keyboard and screen pixels inputs with js code

1220436
sudo	passwd
what concerns me is that i ve noticed upon opening a shell a few times that sudo su does not ask me for my passwd

1220436
sudo	passwd
if sudo su asks for a passwd to get to root i require no passwd to su nalaurien back

1220447
temp	tmp
i installed ps on c but temp folders are creating on d by the way system tmp and temp paths are in d temp

1220448
administration	activation
but microsoft office refuses to accept the activation key saying the key is for volume licensing something and urged me to contact the administration

1220471
temp	tmp
click on ok and edit the tmp value paste the same thing in its value as you just did for temp

1220471
temp	tmp
in the system variables category find temp and tmp from the list scroll down and change both their values to the below path

1220471
temp	tmp
reboot your computer and delete the temp and tmp folder in d drive

1220522
ubuntu	debian
when this happens on a minimal installation of recent debian ubuntu it s probably because you haven t installed the readline-common package

1220602
mouse	keyboard
i ve noticed on an acer switch alpha 12 and an hp laptop that the keyboard and mouse seem to freeze or crash randomly or intermittently

1220602
mouse	keyboard
at first i thought it was just the microsoft arc mouse with the switch alpha 12 but then i noticed that the keyboard backlight would randomly turn on the same time the mouse started working again

1220619
cpu	processors
up until core 2 intel processors had a 32pin dram bus and 32 registers meaning the cpu had access to 4gb of ram and 4gb of hdd space pagefile

1220623
phpmyadmin	adminer
one solution is to load adminer or phpmyadmin

1220626
folder	directory
after that if i examine my local folder my directory i see

1220749
versioning	upgrade
i have win 10 update to creator versioning originally it s an upgrade from win 7

1220752

i d like to avoid sending hundreds of emails if the service is down for hours at a time which could mean avoiding short term cron jobs

1220756
ubuntu	linux
welcome to ubuntu 14.04.5 lts gnu linux 3.13.0-103-generic x86_64

1220769
openbsd	linux
the recipe the exact revision at a time was this one worked for my thinkpad x2 x 0 with original os upgraded to gnu linux and openbsd with minor changes

1220803
factors	mean
there are other things it can mean too but that s the basic bit and everything else stems from it or varies based on other factors

1220805
punctuation	words
just a few words together with proper capitalization and punctuation will meet the requirements of all but the oddest security setup while still being easy to recall and enter

1220808
udp	tcp
i do know that in general udp port scans take longer than tcp because it s connectionless and there are much more resources used

1220832
cpu	processors
i have a windows 7 64bit laptop intel core 2 cpu processors and i a using safe mode

1220834
x86	64bit

i ve installed a power switching then hooked it up to the power cables of those monitors and i would like to know if there s a software way to make the os change the active displays automatically from the monitors to the tv when i switching the monitors off so i don t have to use windows+p which is buggy in win10 after switching display it stays in the screens and i need to use a mouse to take it off which i m not using it s mostly for steam so i only have a controller

1221086
udp	tcp
e.g. if you wanted to know which process was listening on the standard http port which is well-known port 80 you could issue the command lsof -i tcp 80 tcp is the protocol for http while some other network protocols use udp or alternatively you could use the netstat command netstat -nlp | grep 80

1221168
ethernet	wireless
you also won t get ac rates to the wireless or wired ethernet lan devices connected directly to your thompson tg782 because its lan ports max out at 100mbps which i would consider to be more like an 802.11n rate than an 802.11ac rate

1221168
ethernet	wireless
so traffic between your 802.11ac wireless client through your 802.11ac ap so a machine on gigabit ethernet connected into a lan port of your 802.11ac ap will be able to go at 802.11ac rates regardless of whether you still have a slow old tg782 at the head of your network

1222248
hash-collision	key
supposing you were able to generate such a hash-collision of the tbs portion of a ca root certificate by modifying it to contain a public key for which you know the private key the problem is that your modified ca certificate would contain a different public key than the ca s actual certificate and any clients verifying a certificate signed by the ca will have a locally installed copy of the ca s real certificate

1222248
hash-collision	key
in nearly all imaginable scenarios in which you could accomplish all of these things would have much more efficient attack opportunities that didn t involve needing to first find a sha1 hash-collision of a certificate that contains a private key known to you which also generates an rsa encrypted signature collision which then need to trick the client into using for signature verification instead of using the real root ca s certificate that given the fact the client trusts it will be stored locally on the client

1222248
hash-collision	key
recalling that a client will take the hash of the tbs portion of this intermediary s certificate and then verify the rsa encrypted signature on this certificate was indeed signed using the public key of a locally trusted ca or chain of ca s that leads to a locally trusted ca a successful attack is now simplified to generating a hash-collision of the tbs portion of a valid intermediary s ca s certificate

1222248
hash-collision	key
once one can replace the public key of a verifiable intermediary ca s certificate with a public key for which the private key is known and then modify other bytes as needed to generate a hash-collision with a the verifiable certificate

standby may not be the best word as most computers are in a form of standby when you tell them to shutdown as well - they are just in a deeper form of standby which only listens for network wol packets the power button and possibly the keyboard whereas the sleep also keeps the ram active and listens to the mouse

and use this single file in the subvolume to host a dm-crypt encrypted btrfs filesystems

it appears to me that this would enable me to locally mount the encrypted inner btrfs filesystems and atomically take snapshots of the included data

1223431
filesystems	btrfs
since the virtual block device file contains the whole inner btrfs filesystems including the snapshots of different versions of the included data this single file is basically my time machine

1223431

since this file lives in a subvolume on the outer btrfs filesystems i could take snapshots of this subvolume mount them read only and backup them to the hetzner storage box

then you could do everything directly using pipes to pass the data from one command to the other command substitution to feed the right key to openssl and the commands base64 to handle base64 plus xxd to convert binary data to hex for the key in openssl and finally use sed to remove the 5f padding

disk	ram
windows will allow a program to allocate more virtual memory than there is ram on the machine but only if there is enough free disk space to be able to back the virtual memory requested by the program by disk if necessary

1228049
wan	lan
from here you can do your lan dhcp or use static ip addresses and the nic on the wan should get its ip from the router or use a static ip as well

1228061

in the first command find finds all directory under backup folder including backup folder

1228202

if this sounds too complicated look into hide caption titlebar plus great but some bugs side effects and tab tweaks change fonts width height etc. to squeeze more real estate out of your browser

1228527
rpm	yum
i m assuming you are using yum against a baseurl where rpm are downloaded in background

1228532
mp4	h.264
if you don t have to support really old browsers stick to mp4 h.264

1228568
versioning	upgrade
and if further possible they must even be able to share the installed applications i know after upgrade that my apps work just as fine on both versioning

1228581
ssd	sata
if you plug this into a sata port and cfdisk still tells you it s 1073mb in capacity try updating the ssd firmware if sandisk has one on their site

1228588
udp	tcp
initially i thought this would only work for tcp connections originating from the lan but given the definition of --state new it should work in both directions for both tcp and udp

1228617

first use the page setup dialog to specify a4 paper and choose portrait or landscape mode

in case the problem was a corrupt email on the server used his webmail account to move everything in his inbox to a temp folder

1228663

iperf iperf3 and using time for writing a random file created from dev urandom and read from a ram disk via nc are all in agreement with each other for tcp tests at least give or take

1229247
gentoo	mint	gentoo	linux
i have linux mint 18.1 cinnamon and wanted to dual boot with gentoo latest version amd64 hybrid iso

1229275
ubuntu	linux
the following idea works fine on say a cisco router but linux ubuntu 14.04.5 lts is not happy

1229285
gentoo	mint
for starters you need to put gentoo and mint on separate partitions

1229285
gentoo	mint
you need at least 9gib for the mint partition and you can get away with far less on the gentoo one

1229285
gentoo	mint
though i suggest letting mint do the work of managing it and keep it unmounted in gentoo unless you need to update your gentoo kernel if that sounds like greek to you you ll understand much more what that means when you finish installing gentoo

1229285
gentoo	mint
this is where you will store movies music and the like that you wish to be shared between gentoo and mint

1229285
gentoo	mint
it is possible to share the same swap partition between gentoo and mint if you never use the hibernation features of either.

1229285
gentoo	mint
i d suggest starting with gentoo then installing mint and letting mint detect the presence of the gentoo install when it replaces the gentoo bootloader with its own

1229285
gentoo	mint
this puts mint in the driver s seat when it comes to managing your boot partition and mint is far more reliable and easier in general than gentoo

1229285
gentoo	mint	gentoo	automount
i d advise against making mint s root partition automount under gentoo or gentoo s root partition automount under mint

1229285
gentoo	mint
ext4fs is well supported by both mint and gentoo with minimal fuss

1229291
filesystems	ntfs
but there doesn t seem to be any online info about pointer files in ntfs which makes me wonder if these files don t actually exist on the filesystems but rather get populated by the wof filter driver which stores a list of these virtual files somewhere hidden in some obscure part of the filesystems

1229299
folder	directory
one caveat alt + â does not work in explorer libraries which will instead go to the list of libraries instead of the parent directory of the folder in the library

1229321

if it turns out to be an mtu problem ask your isp why full-size 1500-byte packets aren t working and ask them why they have a path mtu discovery black hole on their network are they blocking icmp destination unreachable fragmentation required but don t fragment bit set messages

the reason is you have 2 settings one for screens and another for sleep the screens setting will switching off the screens after the time specified in the screens settings

filesystems	ntfs
thus you should not use ntfs or any other non-linux filesystems for home

1229614
filesystems	hfs+
you might be able to get away with using hfs+ or something else that provides linux unix-style filesystems features but that s territory that few people have traversed.

1229614
filesystems	ntfs
as a practical matter if your dual-boot computer crashes when running either os it s best to boot it into windows so that windows can repair its shared ntfs filesystems before you boot into linux

1229614
filesystems	fat
windows can also repair fat filesystems at this time

1229660
wan	lan	wan	subnet
depending on the complexity of your network - if you can put the openvpn server on a seperate subnet such that all requests - both internal and external - go through the firewall you may be able to add a line to the firewall to intercept requests from your lan going to ext.ip port 1194 and redirect them to your openvpn box while also port-forwarding pinholing this from your wan interface

modern filesystems like ntfs and ext4fs take steps to prevent this but older ones like fat32 were notorious for it hence why defragging used to be such a big deal

if your printer is wireless the computer needs to look for it on the wireless network not on the ethernet cable which is not connected to the wireless network

udp	tcp
you can toggle openvpn to tcp in the configs do both client and server and maybe ensure your tcp openvpn is secure before or if you disable the udp service

1235259
udp	tcp
if you want your openvpn server to listen on a tcp port instead of a udp port use proto tcp instead of proto udp if you want openvpn to listen on both a udp and tcp port you must run two separate openvpn instances

1235259
udp	tcp	tunnel	packets
this would let udp packets fly as far as possible without having to tcp ack or retransmit for the entire length of your tunnel only the bad part of it

every pane is a tty of course if a window contains only one pane the tty of the pane is the tty of the window there is a builtin variable in tmux called pane_tty it is the tty value of the current pane current here means when you focus on one pane the value pane_tty you get from tmux is the value of output of tty command in the prompt line in that pane i think it is the meaning of dynamically in your post

organization	naming
and that pattern to be repeated x times or until the second number is 0.5 for example the number before the | is not important it s only for organization and or naming i can probably add it in post i did this on a smaller scale manually of 30 numbers and it was tedious enough but i got to a point where i actually need this on a far larger scale

1235818
filesystems	ntfs
since ntfs owner information is stored in the filesystems it s not possible and simply doesn t make sense to use the registry to change a file s owner

i love the fish shell and use it exclusively in macos but i use bash everywhere else because its the only thing installed

1236184
fish	bash
having felt the pain of maintaining configuration files for the two shells i ve decided to stop using fish and fall back to bash instead

1236184
fish	bash
to make it as painless as possible which configuration options plugins etc should i be using with bash to make it as close to fish as possible

1236184

width	height
i have tried every single option that includes the word width height in the official vlc command-line help and the result is the same

1236200
width	height
zoom will not give you the exact size that you are looking for since there is no way to specify width and height with --zoom

1236201
fish	bash	ubuntu	linux
i would finally comment that fish is available in many linux distributions eg it s in the ubuntu repository so you need do these bash customisations only if you are prevented from installing packages

1236211
sctp	tcp
as is well known tcp and sctp are usually used over ip directly

1236211
udp	tcp
protocols like dns will be able to do the tcp handshake faster in case the reply is too long for udp because a udp packet will have already been sent in that case

1236211
udp	tcp	sctp	udp	sctp	tcp
so why weren t tcp and sctp designed to be used over udp

1236211
sctp	tcp
the application which uses tcp and sctp wants a reliable channel

1236211
udp	tcp	sctp	udp	sctp	tcp
i tried to think about the disadvantages of tcp and sctp being over udp

1236211
sctp	tcp
i only came up with that then the server will have to distinguish when tcp or sctp is being used

1236212

1236227
kerberos	ldap
how can i synchronize account lock in ldap and kerberos

1236228
udp	tcp
there are difficulties implementing tcp over udp mainly

1236228
udp	tcp
tcp packets and udp packets have an incompatible format

1236228
udp	tcp
tcp and udp have different protocol numbers seen in the ip header

1236228
udp	tcp
meaning that tcp packets for a udp port would not be passed to the correct

1236228
udp	tcp
nevertheless protocols which implements tcp algorithms on top of udp

1236228
udp	tcp
because nat traversal for tcp is more complicated than for udp

the wi-fi alliance had originally called themselves weca the wireless ethernet compatibility alliance before they created the wi-fi trademark

1236340
bluetooth	usb
oh hey you could make sure each person has the data tethering sometimes called personal hotspot feature enabled on their smartphone s wireless plan and tether via usb or bluetooth instead of wi-fi

1236343

1236428
folder	dir
2 download all the files in a dir to a folder on local linux server

1236451
arp	icmp
the icmp message no route to host means that arp cannot find the layer-2 address for the destination host

1236462
mouse	keyboard
updating the drivers would be among the first steps to try out start by locating the keyboard the mouse and the bluetooth dongle in the device manager and clicking on update driver

1236468
bluetooth	usb	mouse	keyboard
in my experience bluetooth is considerably trickier to set up than a dedicated wireless transceiver which in most cases just worksâ so i would advise to buy a wireless keyboard mouse and only consider bluetooth if you have an actual use case for it like using the keyboard with your phone or tablet which doesn t have usb or not having enough usb sockets on the laptop

1236479
google-chrome	firefox
for example cvim is the one that s currently most powerful for google-chrome while vimperator is the one for firefox

robocopy	xcopy
robocopy is advertised as the replacement for xcopy but if it s unable to do something simple as what i want then it s truly a terrible replacement

1236521
versioning	upgrade
some bugs are annoying me in my samba 4.4.5 installed by building from source and i want to upgrade it to 4.6.6 the current last versioning

1236521

1236538
filesystems	fat
these boot loaders normally reside on fat filesystems which are case-insensitive. this file will normally hold a duplicate of grub the windows boot loader an efi shell or some other efi tool

1236538
filesystems	fat
the easiest is likely to copy the program to a fat filesystems on a usb flash drive as efi boot bootx64.efi

1236552
bluetooth	usb	mouse	keyboard
i have had similar issues with microsoft keyboard and mouse when the bluetooth dongle reciever was plugged into a usb 3.0 port

1236570
cygwin	cmder
on windows i d go with cygwin but you might consider cmder git-for-windows wsl and more.

1236583
versioning	upgrade
the simple answer is yes and i noticed the same thing after my desktop was upgrade to versioning 1703 last friday

1236596

when i plug in a wireless keyboard and mouse via a 2.4ghz usb key i lose the ability to access web pages

1236917
google-chrome	firefox	opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome
using firefox google-chrome opera everything works fine and as it should

1236950
chown	sudo	chown	chmod
note that for the latest versions of htop to function correctly on os x it is not sufficient to bless htop with chmod 6555 htop and sudo chown htop - while htop will run the output will differ between htop and sudo htop

1236950
sudo	passwd
for command line users typing in the passwd at the prompt is second nature and i think for most of us it s forgetting to launch htop as sudo that is the problem rather than being required to type in the passwd

1236950
sudo	passwd
i highly advise against allowing sudo htop to run without a passwd prompt but if you do wish to do so the best approach is to allow a single named user to launch htop and only htop without a passwd though this is a huge vulnerability since htop is powerful and extensible and can run external commands which means whoever runs htop as sudo can do anything

1236955
tunnel	vpn
and ip rule like this i do this mean to control who can use vpn tunnel

1236963
udp	tcp
i use the command below when i want to see everything that s on a specific port for either tcp or udp

1237003
folder	directory
dropbox caches partial downloads and deleted files in hidden directory in the dropbox folder so that should not cause the c drive to fill up if the dropbox folder is on another drive

1237022
ssl	https
a server providing a tls ssl connection as in a https web-server should send the client all certificates in the chain

1237028
fish	subshell
when they reference a subshell being used it seems to work in fish which i somewhat understand has a different architecture and design pattern although at some parts i would expect similarly functioning layers at least from a use case perspective

1237028
bash	subshell
the main point being highlighted here is not to store standard input into simple variables by piping in bash and continue along normally in a script as that runs in a subshell according to sharuzzaman ahmat raslan and dave_thompson_085

1237036
textwrangler	bbedit
it turns out that both bbedit and textwrangler have a preferences setting that automatically adds an additional line-break when you save

1237042
winpcap	wireshark
for troubleshooting purposes i have downloaded and installed wireshark 64bits with winpcap

1237061
udp	tcp
using firewall rules i drop all the traffic to dst 53 port of udp and tcp for input and forward chains allowing only udp requests from local subnet to my router through input chain

1237072
filesystems	ntfs
so i formatted that drive and it worked find but when i tried later to use an external hdd with ntfs as filesystems i noticed that is doesn t show up in this pc as well

1237092
jobs	cron
i am trying to check the status of two newly-added cron jobs

1237092
jobs	cron
i added two cron jobs in orange boxes and i think i did correctly in terms of timing and putting correct folder location and name

1237099
udp	tcp	udp	tftp	tftp	tcp
the tftp server listens on udp port 69 but it appears using the -r option to ssh only forwards tcp

1237099
udp	tcp
this and this provided one way to proceed setting up pipes around the tunnel to translate the udp traffic to tcp before the tunnel and tcp back to udp after the tunnel but comments indicated this isn t the best way

1237099
udp	tftp
the tftp server was listening on udp port 69

1237099
udp	tftp
so i ran wireshark on both the .7 and the .252 boxes looking at udp traffic and in particular tftp traffic

1237099
udp	tftp
it turns out the tftp server sends udp packets back over this port from another port

1237099
tunnel	packets
if i can monitor the first packets to port 69 i can see this and i m expecting that i can quickly set up another tunnel similarly on this port before it times out so the process will be a bit manual but i might be able to pull it off

1237099
tunnel	packets
when i have no tunnel i m seeing the initial packets on port 69 with no problem

1237099
tunnel	packets
when i instead set up a direct socat with no ssh tunnel as follows i see no packets

1237099
udp	tftp	tunnel	packets
i m getting the read request packets captured in wireshark along with the first data packets that can t get anywhere since there s no tunnel back over the source port but at least i m getting the udp packets over the tunnel to the tftp server

1237099
udp	mtu	udp	tftp	mtu	tftp
remember the caveat for this is that the udp packets stay below the size of the mtu which i believe i read somewhere that they will be for tftp

1237100
move	drag
i want to place the pasted layer somewhere in the area that i am working on bottom right of image but the only way i can get the pasted layer is to move to the top left of the image and drag it all the way across

1237106
tunnel	packets
the tftp request over port 69 will enter the port opened by the ssh tunnel sending that packets out onto 127.0.0.1 69 on your local laptop

1237118
subnet	packets
i have also allowed inbound traffic via the public subnet options and disabled relevant firewall options and disabled all packets restrictions

1237123

memory means ram not the hard disk

ubuntu	centos
i have installed centos on the same disk before and booted with refind no problem but i didn t like centos too much since i couldn t easily port ubuntu packages over and i wanted ubuntu back so i tried installing ubuntu to replace centos and this is my story

1237223
stdout	stderr
the error message is printed to stderr so you need to redirect it to stdout instead in order for grep to find it

1237253
chown	chgrp
and you can always get things to work by some creative use of chown and chgrp

1237258
folder	directory
the other end of the vpn vpnclient side are not in the domain but have accounts in the active directory so i assume that if i mount the folder this way they will authenticate with their ad accounts

1237268
bluetooth	usb
i have a usb bluetooth module that is connected to my computer that has windows 10 on it

1237275

public	protected
a private key stores a full copy of the public key but that copy only gets used in case you import the private key without already having a corresponding public key.a key signature will be added to the public key and the public key will be added to the private key.so you either need to update and back up your private key or you need to make extra copies of your public key which usually is the preferred option because a public key backup doesn t need to be protected like a private key backup

1237952
pop-up	dialog
point 1 means you watch the registry key s accessed by the respective office application as you try to do whatever it takes to pop-up the undesired dialog and then set the checkbox do not show this again

1237952
pop-up	dialog
unfortunately there are tons of pop-up dialog which cannot be suppressed with a checkbox because they are meant to have you decide on something so it s more down to a yes-or-no reply or something else

1237964
sudoers	visudo
i know it s quite dumb to edit the etc sudoers file with nano and not visudo but i did it and got an syntax error

ubuntu	opensuse
you can do anything with ubuntu or fedora opensuse or other distributions that you can do with kali -- it s just a matter of installing and configuring the right software

1237994
filesystems	hfs+
first hfs+ is a non-native filesystems from a linux perspective so some amount of oddity with it is expected

1237994
fat	hfs+
otoh fat is also very limited compared to hfs+ so it may not be adequate such as if you need to store large files

1238035
subtract	add
i want users to have the ability to add subtract tables but never delete the first one

1238038

wan	lan
so i turned to gateway mode on the repeater and connected its wan port to the router s lan port

1238251
udp	tcp
a typical napt setup only has a single public ip address so it only has 64ki tcp ports and 64ki udp ports to use

1238251
udp	tcp
even if the nat is smart about reusing the same source tcp or udp port for a lot of connection 4-tuples the sheer volume of connections that masscan can create could overwhelm the nat s ability to keep track of all the parallel open connections

i make sure default caching policy is lowest latency and live555 stream transport is rtp over rtsp

1239138

suggestion differentiate for udp and tcp since tcp connections have a status column

1239259
tunnel	vpn
despite 2 days of reading i m struggling i have a vps running openvpn which i am hoping to use to setup a vpn reverse tunnel

1239259
tunnel	lan
my lan router inside the firewall is running openwrt i am thinking i need to setup openvpn on this to tunnel out to the vps then connect the client to the vps to access the lan is that correct

1239267
tunnel	packets
6to4 is an internet transition mechanism for migrating from internet protocol version 4 ipv4 to version 6 ipv6 a system that allows ipv6 packets to be transmitted over an ipv4 network generally the ipv4 internet without the need to configure explicit tunnel

1239282
folder	directory
is there any way to add a network user s user directory to the c users folder prior to them having signed in

1239283
vpn	lan
on your home lan you should configure your router with the routes to vpn address block instead of configuring each device separately

1239318
macports	homebrew
my new job supports homebrew for installing packages and not macports so i am trying to make the transition from using macports to using homebrew

1239318
macports	homebrew
the idea i had was to delete macports following the guide and then install with homebrew as needed mainly python and related stuffs

1239318
macports	homebrew
i can restore python s functionality by restoring opt local not deleting it as described in link 1 but then i am left with what appears to be a tangle of competing python installs os x 10.12.5 default macports and what i want to add from homebrew

1239332
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu 14.04 linux desktop machine with home david mounted as an nfs share from a file server

1239337
range	min
every next interval would be between 60-80 min or at random range of times of day eg

1239341
put	get
have your it department put up a 100 wireless access point or get one yourself and do it with their blessing

1239345
switching	screens
one of the vm s is for the ethical hacker class so each time a kali linux vm instance goes live it would need to automatically create a virtual switching and a second vm as a vulnerable machine for them to practice hacking counter hacking in an ideal world i d like that visible on a second screens so they can also practice securing patching faults - don t know how possible that is on a single machine

1239407
udp	tcp	icmp	udp	icmp	tcp
it prints only icmp packets which is a protocol on top of ip not udp or tcp

1239407
icmp	tcp
since i know the icmp packets i want are never inside tcp i tried these

1239445
daemons	systemd
also there is no need to install yet another daemons rsync on either systemd

1239456
ubuntu	linux
i am using linux ubuntu 16.04 and i normally use the command history a lot

1239509
vpn	lan

1239509
wan	lan	vpn	lan
all the devices inside the tp-link lan are able to ping all of the devices in the cisco lan as well as in their own as well as my regular wan ip of the cisco router my isp gave me so not the vpn

1239510
daemons	systemd
i will use the rsyslog.conf example from now on but your systemd might use the old syslog daemons with the old syslog.conf file

1239510
daemon	cron
and new entries for your cron daemon should go there too

1239515
mouse	keyboard
keyboard alt + l i b can get you to crosshair cursor and then you need a mouse click to place the control in this case button

1239522
keydown	keyup
why this works any press of a key sends keydown and keyup events

1239531
cpu	processors
cpu usage is a flat 50 since there are eight processors and each vba instance takes 100 of the one processors it has access to

1239604
switching	screens
i ve tried switching screens modes via the f key which didn t work

1239616
mouse	keyboard
then i could not open my start menu or task manager but my mouse never stopped working and the keyboard never froze i could still toggle caps num lock

1239622
inherited	properties
in the advanced security settings window click advanced on the security tab of the folder properties first disable inherited and do not copy the inherited entries

1239631
tunnel	vpn
instead if you are running windows server 2008 or newer you can set up an sstp secure socket tunnel protocol vpn which uses the standard tcp 443 port

1239635
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
both safari and google-chrome do echo the whole string to the console but not firefox and i need to do this on firefox because here is where that specific value is stored

nas	qnap
i m trying to setup a vpn connection on bell fibe to my qnap nas to allow me to access the local network and files when i m working remotely but i haven t been able to do so successfully

1239671
vpn	lan
when mobiledevice connects to externalserver s vpn and tries to reach home lan the server will route that via homedevice

1239678
daemons	launchd
even though i have turned it off it started its daemons every time i was launchd service bind9 restart

1239686
width	height
i would like to modify this code to be able to choose the resolution of the scan image resolution its width height and position but i cannot find how to do it

1239687
folder	directory
under your installation directory c isc bind 9 you should have two folder as mentioned previously bin and etc

1239687
folder	directory
under this same directory manually create a third folder called zones

1239687
udp	tcp
for network access make sure that ports 53 and 953 both tcp and udp are open on your dns server firewall for inbound and outbound traffic

1239687
google-chrome	firefox	opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome
in chrome-based browsers google-chrome firefox opera etc. make sure to use

1239689
arp	icmp
-pr uses arp requests instead of icmp echo_request s to determine what s online

1239689
arp	icmp
this is a slight performance optimization you need to send the arp request anyway and will also properly detect hosts that block icmp echo_request s as online

1239689
udp	tcp
-su similar to -ss but for udp instead of tcp

1239689
udp	tcp
it s actually pretty accurate as long as the remote system has a couple of tcp and udp ports open

1239713
subnet	packets
so the worry is that i enable feature and only put in one rule for example which says to change the dscp value on all packets from subnet x.x.x.x for snmp traffic say for example

1239742
folder	directory
the emails are then exported to the directory with subfolders etc according to the folder structure in the pst file

1239742
folder	directory
then you could use beyond compare to identify the emails that do not appear in both pst files and use the copy to folder function in beyond compare to collect those emails in a separate directory or directory

1239743
google-chrome	firefox
netflix.com can stream video on google-chrome firefox and chromium with chromium-widevine package installed

1239744
google-chrome	safari
linux x86_64 applewebkit 537.36 khtml like gecko google-chrome 60.0.3112.90 safari 537.36

1239748
ubuntu	linux
you could use other formats such as exfat that would require adding a package to linux or ext n which requires a third-party tool such as diskinternals linux reader for read-only access but ntfs should work with ubuntu 16.04 lts as installed

1239764
mouse	keyboard
i m having a peculiar issue where if i leave my computer unattended and i m using the system at an above normal pace the performance will drop to almost 0 stuttering to refresh output every 5 or 6 seconds until i input with the mouse or keyboard

1239812
wan	lan	wan	subnet
the lan ip should not be on the same subnet with the wan ip

1239817
mouse	keyboard
some sophisticated spying hardware can also be embedded in usb connectors say for input devices such as a mouse or keyboard or in devices such as keyboards themselves

1239818
sudoers	visudo
second way is if i edit the sudoers file using command visudo and add a line

1239855
ubuntu	debian
basically unlike ubuntu 16.04 server has a lot of stuff installed by default there are servers like debian with only very limited softwares

1239887
sudo	passwd
tried sudo ls var root but it just asks for the passwd and does nothing

1239897
folder	directory
when it upload the files to remote server it uploads whole directory tree and instead of having a list of files inside web folder on remote server the files are uploaded with all directory from source server

1239953
udp	tcp
you can list tcp or udp connections exclusively with -t or -u switches

1240000
daemons	systemd
that s because my script didn t leave any trace of itself for systemd to look at so next systemd step was always to call execstop to stop this strange script that doesn t leave a daemons behind

docx	xlsx
say asd files are zipped files like docx xlsx files and those can get openeing in .7z and show 4-5 individual files in which one file worddocument is the biggest meaning that has the full text

1240285
docx	xlsx
i wonder if other office brands star office libreoffice use the same technique and can open that i have not tried but as they are already able to convert docx xlsx files to their own formats that is a possibility

debian	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	linux
the other answers are quite good enough about the difference between ubuntu debian and arch linux but they are not really technically oriented .

1240463
ubuntu	debian
as i m not a full time ubuntu debian user this answer may have some lack around debian ubuntu explanation

1240463
ubuntu	debian
let s compare debian ubuntu layout with arch layout

1240463
ubuntu	debian
so this explains almost everything about the difference between arch and ubuntu debian apache package

1240894
disk	ram
in computer jargon is it correct to call drives of various types hard disk ssd dvd a type of random access memory ram

1240894
disk	ram
according to this definition hard disk drives floppy disk drives and solid state drives are also ram

1240914
disk	ram
so a hard disk drive may not be considered a ram device but an ssd can in theory be considered a form of random access memory

1240937
put	get
so i took the 5tb drive out of the enclosure and put it where the 2tb drive use to be to get it prepped

1240939
folder	directory
one way i could accomplish this is by creating a real directory srcview that has a list of symlinks one for each of the folder i want

1240943
disk	ram
one this to remember is if you have a lot of ram such as 32gb you need to have your paging file in windows at least twice that size and do not put it on the c drive as you can run into disk contention issues

1240952
google-chrome	firefox
i ve noticed that for some reason website elements display in google-chrome as much larger than in firefox

the sorts of information you d get in a wireless frame won t make it onto the ethernet connection

1240967

you can however use a wifi router + ethernet to get onto a wifi network just not to sniff wireless packets afaik

1240984

1241122
spotify	last.fm
spotlistr can generate a spotify playlist based on your top-listens on last.fm within a customizable time period for you

1241122
spotify	last.fm
in my opinion this really should have been a default feature in spotify or at least last.fm

1241156
tunnel	vpn
the one exception to this is my vpn tunnel to my work pc which continues to work as a full remote desktop connection

1241167
udp	tcp
if your vpn runs over udp instead of tcp that may be another explanation for what you re seeing but without more information this seems less likely

1241167
tunnel	vpn	tunnel	packets
but for applications tunnelled through your vpn your vpn s tunnel interface maintains the same vpn ip address and just experienced some packets loss even though the entire vpn had to reconnect to the other side

1241228

you should never convert from mp3 to another audio format such as aac aiff alac or flac as all you will be doing is making the file bigger

i suggest you use symlinks or junction directory for your program files directory or downloads or any other folder that s taking a lot of space

mouse	keyboard
it freezes whatever is on the screen the mouse and keyboard

1241344
mouse	keyboard
i normally use an external keyboard and mouse and running without them does not fix this

1241354
mouse	keyboard
so i can use one mouse and one keyboard to control two pcs

1241354
mouse	keyboard
but if run a particular program that is a game i will lose pc-b s mouse and keyboard control

1241354
mouse	keyboard
i guess this is because that game for prevent someone steal account or make cheat so prohibit any simulator input other than real mouse and keyboard

1241354
mouse	keyboard
i do not know if my guess is correct but i real can not use mouse and keyboard after that game start

1241392
move	drag
i wanted to move the window so that its fully visible on desktop but i see no way to drag it

1241441
versioning	upgrade
i would like to upgrade to a newer versioning but i am struggling to

1241443
scons	toolchain
i believe this is because scons is still using the old toolchain installed with apt-get gcc-4.9.2 instead of using the openiboot-toolchain that i had compiled and i believe is necessary for compiling this program

1241443
scons	toolchain
so the question is how do i change which toolchain scons uses to compile code

blank screen on monitor keyboard and mouse are not getting signals from cpu

1241569
ubuntu	linux
i run ubuntu linux 16.04x64 so i know nvidia drivers can often be a problem

chown	chmod
i tried many chown -r chmod -r 7777 without success could you help me to make readable by apache the files created by tomcat

on my home lan i have setup a open vpn server running on raspberry pi 3

setup on my linux box i ve set up github to work with ssh to the point were i can pull and push without entering passwords using ssh agent

1241629
folder	directory
can i configure lynx to show me files folder starting with dot when browsing a local directory

1241632
subtraction	addition
if for example you re trying to test whether either f17 or e17 is blank and then perform either an addition or a subtraction based on that test it should be written like this

1241637
apache	nginx
apache nginx or similar running on linux is preferred

1241645
vpn	lan
that way if for instance device on lan #2 was running a web server a client connected to the vpn can type into a web browser and it will connect

1241645
vpn	lan
also clients of the vpn can ping each other and devices on lan

1241691
ubuntu	linux
in any case with windows and ubuntu linux having them installed on separate hard drives is recommended though not required

1241708
packets	multicast
the only possibly low power device that is connected to the ap is my macbook to properly sniff the packets but is is not subscribed to the multicast net

1241708
packets	multicast
my question is will the ap wait for beacon interval packets to send udp multicast data when a receiver on the multicast net is on low power mode or will it wait if any receiver irrespective of whether it s on the multicast net or not is on low power mode

1241712
debian-based	linux
i am running a debian-based linux container under proxmox 4.4

1241716
afp	smb
smb afp have bulkier encryption and actually do more than just show you an index of the files

1241716
afp	smb
afp apple file protocol is no better i have been working with afp and smb since 2008 using both windows and mac it s evident that i found more freedom with linux especially since they ve really improved laptop wifi capabilities and the economy is popping things like c.h.i.p

1241716
afp	smb	ftp	smb
but the point is smb afp nfs and ftp all have their downsides

1241716
afp	smb
smb can be improved if you remove some of the security features and same goes for afp

1241716
afp	smb	ftp	smb
nfs locks files and similar to ftp isn t made for opening copying from the host machine to your memory and editing files unlike smb and afp which are designed to act as though you re browsing the host machine

1241728
cpu	processors
processors are and have been made of such components as the algorithmic unit and the control unit etc etc since they began in fact i have a book explaining the architecture of the cpu that came before the commodore 64

1241740
arp	icmp
edit 2 after a little more research i ve been able to determine that nmap is defaulting to arp pings rather than icmp echoes what people often refer to as ping

1241740
arp	icmp
disabling arp pings via the --disable-arp-ping flag now forces the icmp echoes and i m only seeing hosts being marked as up for ips that literally do have a physical virtual machine attached

1241746
ftp	smb
simply put nfs ftp and http are leaner protocols than the earlier versions of smb

1241746
ftp	smb
though i would always advocate against using ftp for file transfer because where it might be leaner than smb it lacks many of the features that makes remote storage safe

1241746
filesystems	xfs
this will be less noticeable on pcs -and ntfs3g is pretty well written too which helps- however on a lower footprint device like the raspberry pi that extra cpu and memory overhead will have a knock on your performance versus streaming data from a linux-native filesystems like ext3 4 or xfs

1241770
centos	mint	centos	linux	ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	linux
most versions of linux i know ubuntu and centos - so i assume mint as well set the default value of vm.swappiness to 60

if i removed --no-autoscale window becomes 1024x1024 regardless of width height settings

1241783
filesystems	ntfs
host is both windows server 2016 as well as 2012r2 and the filesystems is never compressed also it is not refs so it is uncompressed unencrypted ntfs

what this does is inherited all properties of an existing wireless network and act as if it is effectively your router

1241898
wan	lan
if you want to connect two routers with an ethernet cable so that all devices connected to either of them can communicate with each other plug an ethernet cable into the lan not wan port of each router set the ip to the second router to the same lan ip address as the first router plus one eg

i have a h.264 video file in mp4 container that is in full color range and by that i mean the value of a channel is from 0 to 255 instead of the tv range 16--235

1242081
google-chrome	firefox
it only shows firefox google-chrome and internet explorer

1242115
subnet	vlan
depending on your network there are a number of ways of accomplishing this - one common way would be to run a second wifi network - or better - a virtual wifi network - which is on a different subnet and vlan and then use a firewall to limit access based on ip and or vlan address

1242138
versioning	upgrade
just upgrade to vs2017 15.3 the latest versioning released this week

switching to vga on the surface works fine and the screens even works with hdmi on the xbox one but fails to connect to the surface

1242284
tunnel	lan
the question is how do i make all traffic from clients on the lan redirect through the openvpn tunnel

1242311
versioning	upgrade
the developers still have to build test and debug the 64-bit versioning separately and test corner-cases as what if the user already has the 32-bit versioning and tries to install the 64-bit as upgrade on top of it

1242364

1242454
ethernet	wireless
i know that 802.11x protocol is used in wireless connection and ethernet protocol is used in wired connection

1242454

the question is that why do i see ethernet ii protocol at layer 2 in wireshark when wireless connection is used

1242459
udp	tcp
i have set-up my own vpn server using raspberry pi 3 in the uk and it is working like a charm since it has been set-up no problem at all the set-up is tcp ip and i am planing to set another one up with udp

i have in col 1 many rows containing simple expressions addition subtraction multiplication and division with brackets and i need to show the result in another cell

1242481
ethernet	wireless
802.11 was designed to be wireless ethernet and 802.11 interfaces have traditionally presented themselves to the os as ethernet interfaces so the os only sees the packets after they ve been translated back into familiar ethernet ii or 802.3 frames

1242481
ethernet	wireless
depending on your sniffer os and wireless drivers you may be able to tell your sniffer to tell your wireless interface that you want to capture the packets in 802.11 format instead of ethernet format

ssd	sata
my problem is i have a laptop with a single 2.5 sata slot and i want to have a fast interactive workflow needs an ssd and processing and storing of large media files at least 1 tb an ssd is too expensive a hdd is good

1242503
ssd	sata
an sshd in the single sata slot would work but i don t trust the smartness how the sshd firmware decides which blocks to keep on ssd thus the sshd can be slower than an ssd and i also don t trust the failure mode if the ssd or the hdd within the sshd breaks will i lose access to the blocks on the other device as well

1243716
fat	hfs+	filesystems	fat	filesystems	hfs+

you could use the zenity program to pick a directory using zenity --file-selection --directory or any other method you prefer even a separate action for each destination folder or store the destination folder in a file and only change it when desired

1244830
ethernet	wireless
my ethernet connection is much slower than my wireless connection i have no idea why

1244832
udp	tcp
blocking all versions of smb you could achieve that with windows firewall at the network boundary by blocking tcp port 445 with related protocols on udp ports 137-138 and tcp port 139 in your case that rule could be modified to for non-local connections and non-local means you should specify all addresses that not belong to your network

1244856

some of the programs for example the logitech software for my mouse and keyboard didn t ask me where i want to install the software it just installed it in the c drive other programs like steam and battle.net asked me where i want to install

1244923

just take matters into your own hands by buying your own high quality 802.11ac wi-fi ap wireless router and plug it into the ethernet in your apartment

1244981

they could still get subpoena d and hopefully they don t keep logs but if they re forced to start tracking user activity they could still see what sites you re hitting and they know your billing info so they could put it together

1245104
ubuntu	debian
so first of all yes i ve read these answers however i ve also successfully migrated from arch into parabola which might not be same however i think it should be comparable since parabola and arch use the same package manager and so do ubuntu and debian

1245104
ubuntu	debian
the only thing that does not exist is the thing that removes packs that don t exist in debian from ubuntu but that should not be too hard to make

1245104
ubuntu	debian
and also arch and parabola are much closer than debian and ubuntu today

1245117
disk	ram
some of the less recently used data can no longer be in ram but must be left on disk

1245132

we have a small vpc with three subnet wan public lan private dmz private

wan	subnet
i m tasked with setting up a central firewall in the wan subnet that monitors all traffic both to the outside world as well as the traffic between subents

1245132
wan	lan	wan	subnet
i think making wan lan and dmz each a vpc instead of a subnet might lead to a solution but that seems to me a horrible misues of vpcs

1245177
disk	ram
i have i5 6th gen processor with 8gb ram 4tb secondary hard disk and 500gb primary hard disk

1245199
disk	ram
it turned out the file in cache ram was literally a bit different than the same file on disk

1245202
sudo	passwd
i have also noticed that i do not need --ask-become-pass i think the passwd is being cached like sudo does

1245212
filesystems	ntfs
this means network shares wouldn t be accessible even if they were using the ntfs filesystems

1245212
filesystems	fat
also added support for other filesystems such as fat as well as

1245217
filesystems	ntfs
and by using ntfs on linux you are not using the best performing filesystems around

1245219
filesystems	ntfs
if you must do lots of file operations you need to choose a filesystems which scales better on linux than ntfs

1245220
versioning	upgrade
there is a fix coming but for now try to go back to a previous versioning of windows and don t upgrade until the fix reaches the windows insider program

1245225
filesystems	btrfs
i have a btrfs filesystems with redundant metadata in a virtualbox image

1245225
filesystems	btrfs
after a host system crash the btrfs partition experienced some corruption which is counter to the guarantees of the filesystems which suggests that virtualbox is violating those guarantees

1245236
screens	tablet
your pc tablet phone will connect to the victake via wifi and will broadcast your screens on your tv

1245257
wan	lan
also take into consideration ip limitations mine for instance won t get an ip automatically from the hotspot since the wds is linked to the static ip settings of the ethernet unlike wan which also has a dhcp settings hence it has to get a free ip manually set and rebooted as if you d make a static small lan

1245257
wan	subnet
usually routers supply to the ethernet their own ip as it s in the case of a wifi router which gets its internet through a wan cable from the isp and on that subnet the subsequent ip for each port

1245259
openvpn	iptables
ignoring the iptables option which i believe is technically superior you can revoke and reinstate private keys by modifying the revokation file and reloading openvpn

1245264
wan	lan
after a few minutes of utilization both the wan and lan networks slow down to unacceptable speeds making impossible to navigate or control the board through ssh

1245264
wan	lan
the ethernet adapter is connected directly to the wan while the wifi module works as an access point for the lan

1245274
ubuntu	linux
i m a macos user who s recently switched to linux specifically ubuntu 14 for work

1245295
cpu	processors
edit actually i just realized that the cpu speed doesn t seam to be the problem i still get 130 mbps download when the processors is at 1.2 ghz with 25 utilization

1245303
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
my firefox can not use the shadowsocks but my safari and google-chrome can use them

1245311
put	get
a better design for postgres would be to put the postmaster.pid file in the run filesystem so it is guaranteed to get deleted at every reboot

1245314
folder	directory
if there is nothing selected in the window or if the selection is a file not a folder terminal will open the folder directory of the window itself

1245335
switching	screens
the other thing i found handy was making a hot key that locked my mouse to the current device so when i locked it to the 2 vertical screens i can still switching between the two and lock myself out of the center screens a powerful feature for my gaming streaming purpose

1245342
ubuntu	debian
the solution uses perl script rename from rename package available on debian ubuntu

1245400
rsa	dsa
ssh-keygen generating new host keys rsa dsa xxxxx xxxxxxx

1245439
apache	nginx
currently using both nginx and apache depending of the environment...

1245439
post	put
it sends a multipart http post or put request

1245439
apache	nginx
is there something to install configure enable for nginx and apache to do the work

1245458
post	get
typically you get a disk that looks to be a modulo of 2tib so a 3tb disk will appear to be under 1tb in size for instance. problems like this used to be fairly common but i ve seen fewer post about them recently

1245462
bluetooth	usb
modern phones can do this over bluetooth usb or wifi

1245466
ubuntu	linux
if you delete the linux entry ubuntu for ubuntu or re-order the list so that windows comes before ubuntu the system will begin booting normally

1245485
versioning	upgrade
from what i can tell the msi based installer will let you upgrade the minor versioning but not the major

1245492
button	checkbox
and as any other .exe i need to do several things like check checkbox click next button .

1245544
bash	zsh
which is not a bash builtin it is a builtin in some other shells zsh

1245555
ati	nvidia
for intel s hardware designations it refers to the particular gpu core just like the r numbers for older ati amd cards and the letter plus number codes for nvidia cards

1245605
debian	linux
i also dual boot debian on this same computer and have had no problems at all in linux only windows

1245660
google-chrome	safari
i know i m getting lots of requests from websites nowadays in my browser safari google-chrome etc to allow or block notifications

every time i start a skype call if i m inactive doesn t move the mouse or type on the keyboard for 10sec my screen goes black and my session locked and i need to retype my password

1245733
google-chrome	firefox
this worked because we were able to acquire those certificates and add them to firefox google-chrome so they would be trusted

1245737
wan	lan	wan	vlan
port lan 1 in the first vlan works as the wan port using the pppoe protocol to communicate with my dsl modem

1245739
range	max
how do get a range or array of all the rows with 300 as the header so i can use the max function on that range

1245747
mouse	keyboard
those only have one usb but we need one usb for wired keyboard one usb for wired mouse one usb free for usb sticks so we are short 2 usb ports

1245749
ubuntu	linux
on ubuntu i have virtualbox with parrot kali linux and whonix as guest os s

1245749
ubuntu	linux
my question is can i run the windows 10 from my windows partition on my ubuntu virtualbox without installing it on the linux partition thereby saving space on this one

1245775
filtering	grouping
instead they have implemented basic filtering via security grouping that can control inbound and outbound traffic

1245775
filtering	grouping
here you can setup filtering based on protocol ip etc.additionally you can create a network acl which can be layered on top of security grouping for finer grain control for your data flows between subnets

1245775
wan	lan	wan	subnet
at a minimum you ll need a firewall that sits on your three subnet wan lan dmz

1245777
ubuntu	linuxmint	ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	linux
iâ m using version 60.0.3112.113 developer build built on ubuntu running on linuxmint 18 64-bit the latest version in the linux mint 18 repository but since version 60 iâ ve faced the problem that on a lot of websites trello twitter facebook xkcd and many more boxes are displayed strangely as if some vertical margin or padding at the top were missing and the cursor is often invisible in text fields for example the one iâ m typing into right now

1245784
stdout	stderr
my knowledge of all the stdin stdout stderr pipes that are just joins of stdout to sdtin file redirects etc

1245814
disk	ram
i search for the numbers of threads vcpu the amount of ram and disk space and network bandwidth i have to assign to the asterisk server s virtual machine

1245820
filesystems	ntfs
ntfs compressed files are automatically uncompressed by the filesystems as they are accessed

1245833
installation	upgrade
try to upgrade the system it is likely to have an old system with old packages or maybe there is problem with your system installation

1245907
fat	hfs+	hfs+	ntfs
hfs+ on the other hand is sector-size-indifferent much as for example ext2 3 4 is but contrary to fat or ntfs

1245918
mouse	trackpad
this is probably one of the cheapest options you could probably make one with a paperclip though it might scratch your trackpad but you d have to press the mouse button separately making its use a bit awkward

1245923
put	get
so basically i m looking for keys i can put in a reg file so if i logon to a machine i ve never used before i can get the system to this state simply by running the reg file

1245924
versioning	upgrade
basically i haven t reinstalled the computer in ages and just updated through all versioning of windows 8 the upgrade to windows 10 and the windows 10 updates themselves

1245927
wan	lan	vpn	lan
let me start with my goal a dedicated vpn using nordvpn services wireless access point connected via wan - lan of primary router

1245927
vpn	lan	vpn	ssid
following this line of reasoning i tried a lan- lan connection but resulted in vpn wifi ssid disappearing from available networks inaccessible

1245948
debian	linux
i have an embedded device with debian linux running on it

1245963
put	get
if i use the mt switch whether i put a number after it or not and whatever number i use if i do robocopy will get invoked and displays the robocopy statement in the batch file for maybe 5-10 seconds and then executes that s when i finally see text going by to indicate a file transfer

1245971
addition	multiplication
the addition is equivalent to the or operation and the multiplication is equivalent to and

1245978
folder	directory
and it will create a complete directory structure of the current state of the folder you are backing up using hard links to reference the previous backup

1245978
folder	directory
however all my windows tools windows explorer directory opus windirstat report that the second snapshot folder is taking up 1.40 gb on disk

1245994
disk	ram
but the disk utilization and ram utilization totals are bright red because they re at 97 ram and 100 disk

1245994
disk	ram
a look at the â œprocessesâ tab shows nothing using more than 10â mb of ram and there s only maybe two dozen total background processes all using no disk

1245996
folder	directory
you may need to make hidden files and folder visible in the windows file explorer to locate that directory and view its contents if you try to access it from the file explorer

1246038
google-chrome	safari
what you probably want instead is to use the default system proxy settings 3rd option which is also the same as the default behaviour as safari and google-chrome

1246064
google-chrome	firefox
i tested this on google-chrome firefox and ie 10

1246085
mouse	keyboard
i m thinking of a way to use the laptops original windows operating system just to handle the hardware - display keyboard mouse and audio - but limit networking to only some isolated environment inside the machine - a virtual machine or something like that

1246140
google-chrome	firefox
firefox and google-chrome open brokerkf.ru without any problems

1246263
wordpress	joomla
when i tested this i just made an html file called index.html and pointed apache to it which worked fine but once i used wordpress or joomla it died so the problem had to be either in php or mysql

1246275
disk	ram
this is likely to not be your cpu or your ram - but disk latency

1246275
disk	ram
this means that if you have a really fast cpu tonnes of ram and a slow disk - for the most part your computer will only be able to move data as fast as it can read from write to the disk

1246275
disk	ram
i personally have 20gb ram and and an i5-4590 which under most circumstances runs like a rocket with windows 10 - however when i start to thrash the disk the whole machine slows down

1246275
disk	ram
you can see that i m only using 3 cpu 30 ram but 100 disk to do this i did a copy paste of a 20gb file

1246294
mouse	keyboard
both keyboard and mouse are usb

1246331

1246347
disk	ram
i changed the hard disk and ram but the result is the same

1246360
temp	tmp
one possible benefit is if you wanted cmd to be run so that you could refer to an environment variable like userprofile or logonserver or temp tmp but since you re not doing that you re not needing to run cmd c

1246419
ubuntu	linux
you haven t stated the os you re on but multitail is available for linux as an ubuntu package

bash	tcsh
i also tried exec tcsh but the system still running bash

bash	zsh
the problem is that zsh s read function takes different options than bash s

1247651
bash	zsh
also i d make two other recommendations for both bash and zsh first use lowercase or mixed-case variable names

1247651
bash	zsh
there are a large number of all-caps variable names with special meaning to the shell system etc and they re not the same between bash and zsh and it s way to easy to accidentally re-use one of them with weird consequences

1247651
bash	zsh
second building the command in a variable and then eval ing it is not safe in either bash or zsh

arp	dhcp
is there any way i can backtrack a dhcp lease request to a specific access point or send an arp request from an access point only getting arp responses from devices connected to the access point and not from the entire network

after runs this command on working tree folder opens a meld s comparison window without problems but the window open with the head on left and the working directory at the right

1248182
google-chrome	firefox
you can share screen on firefox without downloading any plugin but screen sharing on google-chrome does require plugin download for the presenter

1248207
mouse	keyboard
you can archive this by using mouse and keyboard center

1248207

tunnel	vpn
i have a few problems with operating a vpn tunnel between my two computers

1248209
tunnel	vpn
i have established a vpn tunnel between the two using freelan

1248209
tunnel	vpn	tunnel	packets
computer 2 s tun0 packets has source 9.0.0.2 destination 9.0.0.1 - vpn tunnel - computer 1 s tun0 - through pf firewall which performs nat - .

1248232
robocopy	xcopy
i have several scripts i use daily that utilize copy xcopy and robocopy and they are all working currently except for this one

1248235
chown	chmod
you probably need to chown chmod -r all your data drives are those still mounted in var hda drives

1248243
cpu	processors
intel is well aware that only operating workloads smaller than l2 cache are actually performing at the true speed of the processors and everything else is performing at the speed it takes the cpu to swap bits of it in and out of l2 cache

1248244
switching	screens
whenever i lock my computer i would expect the screens to switching off after a little while at least i think that s how it used to work

1248244
switching	screens
any idea how to make it switching off the screens after the computer is locked after a minute or two for example

1248275
disk	ram
the amount of needed ram you find online is vastly overstated because ram is cheap compared to dozens of disk and ram is critical for performance as it is used for the arc and deduplication

1248275
disk	ram
if you only need to saturate a 1 gbps ethernet link 110 mb s and have mostly streaming workload meaning disk instead of ram is accessed constantly 4 to 8 gb of memory are sufficient even 2 gb might still work

1248301
jobs	cron
this seems like a really simple issue but normally when i have trouble with cron jobs it s actually running and the job is just throwing an error

1248323
put	get
i need to get a listing of shareable urls for all images in all folders and sub-folders to put on a spreadsheet

1248329
filesystems	fat
on gpt disks the partitions that hold fat filesystems have guids which on recent enough linux distributions can be referred to as partuuids in mount and etc fstab

1248329
filesystems	fat
both fat filesystems and on gpt disks the partitions that contain them can also have names which can also be used by mount or in etc fstab

1248329
filesystems	fat
although i don t know of a tool to change fat partitions serial numbers they can be set when the filesystems is created via the -i option to mkdosfs as in

1248334
bmp	png
i m looking for a way to find the connection between extension bmp png mp4 avi etc and the ffmpeg parameter i need to pass in order to encode to that extension

1248363
bash	zsh
i don t know if there s an option to do this in bash but with zsh you can use after turning on the rc_quotes option

1248363
bash	zsh
with bash and still most of the time with zsh i just use because it s easier to read than

1248369
folder	directory
if you re inside the nerdtree buffer you can select the folder and press c to change the nerdtree root directory

1248376
sudoers	visudo
to skip sudo you could add an rm alias in your .bashrc and add yourself to macos s sudoers file with sudo visudo then appending for full sudo access to all commands or to restrict full access to the rm command only

1248380
uninstall	upgrade
if so the only reliable way i know of is to patch the installed product with a msi minor upgrade to eliminate this custom action from running on uninstall

1248380
uninstall	upgrade
in technical terms the minor upgrade will transform the cached msi database on the system so that the uninstall custom action won t run

1248417
folder	directory
you just extract the zipped folder anywhere you want although generally it s a good idea to put it in a folder path set in your environmental variables so you can easily run it from the command line in the future without needing to cd into its specific directory

1248441
bash	tcsh
the reason why my shell keeps going back to bash and even preventing me from using exec to get into tcsh was because in the .cshrc file there was a line that says exec bin bash -l in there

1248442
google-chrome	firefox
update it seems that some nice people are trying to port selenium ide to web extension platform which is supposed to work across google-chrome firefox and edge

1248442
google-chrome	firefox
other answers mentioned selenium ide is a firefox extension but did not explain why there is no port for google-chrome until now

1248449
bluetooth	usb
so i have this gatekeeper bluetooth dongle tag that is used for windows and its use is to unlock your pc when the tag is within a certain range of the usb dongle

1248449
post	get
i have also looked at tutorials for getting the rssi via python itself and tried examples in other post but the scripts have returned that it cant get the rssi value from my tag and even my phone

1248490
mouse	keyboard
what i need to know is which keyboard layout i m using and to see that i need to bring the mouse down and hover over the indicator

1248569
robocopy	xcopy
the solution is to not use robocopy at all but use xcopy

1248569
robocopy	xcopy
i don t know why robocopy didn t work but xcopy with these switches does what needs to be done quickly and efficiently

1248570
folder	directory
folder what you have under alias now as the default directory for an apache virtual host cloud.mycompany.com

the problem i m running into with plink is that i need 2 carriage returns or maybe line feeds to get it to prompt for the id

google-chrome	firefox
on my new chuwi lapbook 15.6 intel cherry trail z8300 quad core 1.44ghz 4gb ram and windows 10 x64 firefox and edge load and scroll quite fast but google-chrome and vivaldi take 1-2 secs to scroll on demanding pages such us facebook and outlook.com

1248596
google-chrome	firefox
i could just start using firefox edge but i need the sync feature of google-chrome

1248605
ubuntu	debian
you can use byobu if on debian like system ubuntu

1248607
folder	dir
will completely sync -fs what is in folder directory_to_compress with the archive.zip file no matter if you created deleted or updated files in that dir

1248618

try to restart the cron daemon

1248622
debian	centos
i have found several articles about this on centos which talk about a startup script for zfs being the fix but thus far i haven t found one on debian

1248622
sysv	systemd
i am also running in sysv init mode instead of systemd

1248651
ethernet	wireless
okay so you re using your little single-board computer as a wi-fi ap and it s currently routing or probably nat gatewaying between wired and wireless which means wireless is on a different lan ip subnet than wired ethernet

1248651
subnet	packets
you d prefer it to just transparently bridge packets between wired and wireless so that everything s on the same lan and ip subnet

1248651
ethernet	wireless
nb don t get confused by what s often referred to as wireless bridging which is a more complicated form of bridging where two boxes use their wireless interfaces to make a point to point wireless link sometimes called a wds link to bridge two wired ethernet networks together

1248685
filesystems	xfs
i highly recommend xfs as a very robust journaled filesystems for video and file storage

1248685
filesystems	ntfs
ntfs is about the only filesystems that is supported for read write on both oses mac needs a third-party paid plugin for write support though the performance and long-term stability won t be there

1248712
filesystems	fat
210mb - some fat filesystems

1248712
filesystems	xfs
1.1gb - some xfs filesystems

1248714
google-chrome	firefox
since firefox is planning on deprecating the vast majority of their add-ons with firefox 57 migrating to an incompatible breaking-change web extensions api is it possible to get google-chrome to do things like tabmixplus ubiquity was able to

1248714
min	max
for example multi-row tabs when too many tabs for one row moves to the next row setting tab min max width switching to a tab by querying all active tabs etc

1248715
google-chrome	firefox
basically google-chrome doesn t let add-on developers manipulate the tab windows window area like firefox did

1248720
chown	sudo	chown	chmod
execute chown root root usr bin sudo chmod 4755 usr bin sudo 3

1248721

i am running zorin os 12 and i am using gnome web epiphany. web integrates perfectly with zorin s themes and starts up much faster than google-chrome and firefox

1248721
google-chrome	firefox
when i go to the new google sites it presents me with a message telling me to upgrade to google-chrome or firefox

1248721
google-chrome	firefox
i have tried setting my user agent to firefox google-chrome chromeos google-chrome and even windows 10 m edge

1248721
google-chrome	firefox
is there a way of fixing this message and editing google sites with web or do i have to use firefox or google-chrome for doing this one task on the internet

1248726
mp4	h.264
ffmpeg by default will use h.264 codec when creating and mp4

1248742
filesystems	ntfs
at one moment i had two partial images created by ddrescue one file on ntfs filesystems and the other on ext4

1248743
tunnel	vpn
now if you run ip route and route -n you should see that the new default route is now pointing to your local network and no traffic should be going through your vpn tunnel by default

1248750
mouse	keyboard
the pc is stuck that both mouse and keyboard is not working

1248753
ubuntu	linux
i am trying to install ubuntu on windows using windows subsystem for linux but on store the button is grey how can i enable it

1248778
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and firefox both have default embedded own plugins for pdf which support searching the doc contents and render results inside the browser window

1248802

check uncheck automatically hide and show the menu bar

1248807
ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	linux
i have triple boot winxp ubuntu 14.04 and linux mint

1248810
cifs	smb
this would explain why net use doesn t show them since it only shows smb cifs mappings

1248838
hide	show
if the only window is a hotkey window then clicking the dock icon show or hide it

1248859
ubuntu	debian
on debian ubuntu use sudo -u www-data php occ

1248897
ubuntu	debian
normally grub2 should autodetect all os with typical scripts as packaged by debian and ubuntu at least when update-grub is run

1248906
debian	linux
i use virtualbox v5.1.2 - host is windows 10 guest is linux debian 6.0.9

1248924

1248927
width	height
the problem was that mpeg does not require the height and width of image to be in even number but mp4 requires it

1248930
folder	directory
the system couldn t read the size of the directory so i figured it was a problem folder so i deleted it emptied the garbage and restarted

1248954
switching	screens
i have tried a lot of things such as switching to a single window and back to full screens

1248962
filesystems	btrfs
the filesystems is btrfs

1248993
hash	md5
followed the troubleshooting guide on permission denied my md5 hash locally matches that of the one in my github account.

1249004
macbook	bootcamp
i recently installed windows 10 on my new macbook via bootcamp

1249008
folder	directory
after you downloaded them either put the files in your current working directory or in the folder you want to execute them from

1249024
openvpn	iptables
on the server side iptables can do everything you want without the need to modify the openvpn server

1249024
tunnel	vpn
this will add noticably overhead and may also cause more fragmentation i don t know how openvpn handles the fragmentation inside the vpn tunnel

1249024
openvpn	iptables
and figure out some solution in kernel space using iptables and possibly multiple openvpn clients and servers if you want some segregation

1249035
rss	feed
using a windows 10 pc i d like to download all mp3 files listed in the enclosure tags of an rss feed

1249038
folder	directory
to prevent myself from accidentally deleting important files i have given some special permissions for my username to certain folder on my hdd in fact those directory are on a server but let s not make things too complicated

1249042
udp	tcp
currports displays the list of all currently opened tcp ip and udp ports

1249062
debian	mint	ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	debian
it is build to work with all ubuntu based distro mint â probably all debian also

1249065
nas	qnap
set up a nas probably an entry-level qnap to share files

1249074
folder	dir	folder	directory
each folder has files inside and this is just a fictional example in the source dir there are more than 20k sub directory so manual rename is impossible

1249076
ubuntu	linux
os ubuntu linux 14.04.4

1249096
width	height
i have an ms excel matrix with width on the rows and height on the columns

1249096
width	height
i also have a list where i have 3 columns a width b height c cell that needs to be populated by the code in the cell with the specified width and height

1249099
ubuntu	linux
so i am trying to install java runtime 8 on ubuntu linux 14.04

1249115
wan	lan
however your lan netmask has absolutely nothing to do with your wan configuration

1249120
width	height
it sounds like you have a lookup table of codes indexed by width and height

1249120
width	height
this finds the position of width a2 in the list of widths in column e and the position of height b2 in the list of height in row 2 and gets the code that is offset that number of rows and columns from e2

1249120
width	height
ps after seeing your pictures it looks like i have width and height switched but you get the idea

1249143
folder	directory
i have a directory containing several folder like that

1249150
ubuntu	centos
i ve got a tftp server hosting ubuntu and centos images

1249165
chown	chmod
i d like to be careful with chmod or chown before i possibly open up the drive to security holes.

1249171
disk	ram
reading 10 gb directly from internal disk to ram

1249188
versioning	upgrade
however the offered solution does not seem to match my case the activation troubleshooter is telling me the activation key i acquired with the free upgrade is not for my surface pro 1 s versioning of windows 10 although in the last two years windows never stated such a thing

1249212
google-chrome	firefox
in edge firefox and google-chrome reports your browser has real working ipv6 address - but is avoiding using it

1249231
rpm	yum
i am seeing this error below when i install my own rpm packages with yum install no matter it is from local or remote

1249231
rpm	yum
both yum and rpm commands are executed with sudo

1249231
rpm	yum
how can i get detailed scriplets execution output from yum like what we have with rpm -vv

1249232
min	max
you can use the following css in a stylish style to get the titlebar and min max close buttons back

1249324
h.265	hevc
there was a request to support hevc h.265 in flv with a somewhat spammy touch to it

1249332
move	drag
sometimes the whole window goes black or it just freezes with drag marks from moving it changes made while it seems stuck can be seen when move back to the right screen so it s just a visual problem

1249354

mouse	trackpad
now i have office 2017 version 15.33 170409 and i can scroll by pixels using mouse as well as laptop trackpad

1249406
installation	upgrade
because it would be a huge plain in the arm re-installing all the packages + local installation outside of apt and doing the package upgrade etc.

1249416
google-chrome	safari	opera	safari	opera	google-chrome
since you are using windows 7 that basically means you are limited to google-chrome opera or safari if you are attempting to avoid installing the windows 7 media pack

1249418
versioning	upgrade
you can use this in windows 7 but you have to upgrade powershell to versioning 4 first

1249498
packets	multicast
if your networking gear doesn t support stp then you ll have created a networking loop and packets at least multicast broadcasts will loop around and around in the network destroying network bandwidth until you break the loop

1249510
chown	sudo
just don t forgot to use sudo when you first create the new folder and chown it

1249524
vmware	virtualbox
they run under virtualbox and vmware

1249589
vmware	bootcamp
i m usually running my bootcamp partition in vmware fusion

1249589
vmware	bootcamp
now the windows 10 partition doesn t boot either in bootcamp mode or in vmware fusion

1249593
installation	upgrade
if it doesn t work perform a in-place upgrade repair using windows 10 installation media

1249597
spyware	antivirus
it definitely sounds like another program has control of the drive like an antivirus spyware backup etc

1249690
udp	tcp
the reality is there are bout 7 ports both tcp and udp that need to be reached but i m sure if i can be shown how to do one i ll figure the rest out

1249690
traceroute	nmap
now i run a port-specific tcp traceroute in nmap with this command

1249718
vpn	lan
in addition there may be firewall rules on the vpn server which may prevent traffic flowing from your lan to the vpn

1249728
stdout	fflush
i tried moving the contents of my tartarusprofile script into the autoprofileswitch script the reason for the unused tartarus_id variable and the commented out lines directly under the call to tartarusprofile but kept receiving a sed couldn t fflush stdout broken pipe error for some reason

1249759
ethernet	wireless
i m able to have each computer wireless connected to the network but my 2 laptops are connected to each other via crossover ethernet so that synergy works for my software kvm

i have an extra router running tomato that i can use if needed but i ve never done any type of linking subnet using vlan or anything like that

1249801
mouse	keyboard
a friend asked me to look at his windows 10 computer when it stopped responding to keyboard and mouse input

1249801
mouse	keyboard
i tried a different keyboard and mouse with no luck but they did work when accessing the bios so i don t think it s a hardware thing

1249801
mouse	keyboard
i figured that the reset had removed some usb device drivers so i should use a ps 2 mouse and keyboard to reinstall them however this computer does not have any ps 2 slots at all

1249827
debian	linux	debian	mint	ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	linux
but i m much more familiar with linux so i d try booting a live linux mint ubuntu debian etc and once it s booted and running

1249857
udp	tcp
if you want your dns server to be the only one people can easily reach set your firewall assuming it really does have traditional firewall features to block egress to port 53 for both tcp and udp

1249868
vmware	virtualbox
i removed vmware workstation and reinstalled virtualbox when i attempted to install thw windows 10 virtual machine i got errors about other virtual software running i dont remember the exact wording

1249884
mouse	keyboard
look for legacy usb or usb keyboard and mouse

1249910
filesystems	btrfs
linux filesystems like ext4 or btrfs support linux-type file permissions and attributes

1249910
filesystems	ntfs
windows filesystems like ntfs or exfat can be used with linux

1249913
mouse	keyboard
i have unplugged all devices and addon cards taken the motherboard off the case disconnected the front panel wires cleared cmos and changed the battery tested the mb with three different psus even tried disconnecting the keyboard and the mouse -- the behavior does not change

1249928
debian	linux
i read that if i want to use the physical installation of linux inside the hyper-v i should put offline the disk 0 where debian is installed but windows 10 refuses to do that

1249968
opensuse	linux	ubuntu	opensuse	ubuntu	linux
now i am searching for the equivalent when working on a linux machine please mostly opensuse leap and some ubuntu in our office

1249995
sudo	passwd
so what s the point in disabling root passwd when i can use sudo or just easily enable it anyway

1249998
screens	tablet
sometimes it helps to just change some start menu settings like making it full screens or changing the mode to tablet mode

1250000
sudo	passwd
in that case even if an attacker can log in he still has to guess the user passwd to execute sudo command

1250010
switching	screens
changing the resolution of the screens or switching cursor type don t solve the problem

1250015
google-chrome	firefox
i ve had mega warn my browser was in an ephemeral session and also behave very slowly for cookies and privacy enabled firefox google-chrome browsers perhaps check your privacy settings

1250107

firewall port 80 tcp and udp

1250118
tunnel	lan
but i m still confused about the tunnel interface tun0 below especially in regards to accessing the remote lan

1250132
filesystems	ntfs
the presence of system volume information suggests the filesystems is ntfs

1250132
chgrp	chmod	chown	chgrp	chown	chmod
note in my kubuntu neither chmod nor chown nor chgrp returns operation not permitted

1250178

prometheus	grafana
have ran prometheus and grafana image on docker

1250202
prometheus	grafana
created prometheus datasource on grafana to store time series data

1250203
vpn	lan
again this only works because the vpn client creates a route when it connects telling the router to find the 192.168.1.0 24 subnet on the br0 interface lan

1250203
wan	lan
packets arriving on port 555 on the vps wan interface will now be routed all the way to the server on my lan

1250222
ftp	telnet
i did some of modification in the script i have a list of ip server which have the same password and i want to telnet the list automatically and sendkey for deactivate or activate the ftp server

1250256
folder	directory
if you want to go into a directory on linux unix you need to set the execute bit for that folder

1250265
packets	multicast
pimd sends packets to multicast peers

1250265
packets	multicast	tunnel	packets
the other side of the tunnel 192.168.0.33 sends multicast packets too but pimd does not see it

1250278
hfs+	ntfs
mac can t write ntfs and the garmin probably can t read or write hfs+

1250282
post	get
according to this post the most specific subnet mask should get priority

1250296

ethernet	wireless
my setup both clients are connected to the router wireless while pi is connected with ethernet

1250371
arp	dhcp
yes a rogue device on your ethernet or wi-fi lan could take up all your dhcp leases and even use arp to make all ip addresses on the network even ones outside of the dhcp pool seem occupied

1250385
mouse	keyboard
i have two computer connected to a single keyboard mouse with a kvm switch an iogear 2-port usb vga

1250385
mouse	keyboard
the keyboard and the mouse are very basic model from microsoft that came with the computer

1250394
put	get
the issue i am coming across is that all of the hyperlinks that i put into this document are giving a full file path and making it impossible for other users of this file to get access to

1250417
google-chrome	firefox
i usually use google-chrome but i can use firefox or any browser that could do it

1250434
move	drag
i m annoyed with win 10 s auto window position when i drag the window it ll move window to strange position

1250468
installation	upgrade
i would like to remove a working drive in a raid-1 array replacing with a new drive in order to hopefully build a test system where i can experiment with os upgrade and migration of an old point-of-sale enterprise software for which we have no original installation disks

1250468
wan	lan
if so i will also duplicate our backupedge set-up with a nas device all of this on a separate lan and wan of course so i can then experiment away as i fully expect to create a few linux pieces that i can keep during the learning process

1250488
centos	linux
now i have a linux server up and running with centos 7 installed

wan	lan
on a conventional lan wan setup i would simply create a fixed ip for the xp machine redirect the necessary ports like port 21 to the xp ip using the router features but how i do it with the iphone setup described above

1250527
pull	push
if there is nothing to update then pull and push work as expected

in the blueetoth other devices i can see two things microsoft wireless transceiver under other devices as well as arc touch mouse under mouse keyboard pen

1250556
mouse	keyboard
tried installing the mouse and keyboard center but that doesn t give you any options to download any drivers which i find strange because there seems to be no ability for you to download drivers for this device

1250556
mouse	keyboard
the official ms page for this only has the link to the mouse and keyboard center 3.0 download but no actual drivers

1250556
mouse	keyboard
without the mouse and keyboard center installed the device manager doesn t show anything other than hid-compliant mouse under mice and other pointing devices

1250556
mouse	keyboard
if i have the mouse and keyboard center installed it shows up as microsoft usb dual receiver wireless mouse mouse and keyboard center

salt	md5
in fairness to wordpress they combine md5 with a salt

1250665
filesystems	ntfs
as a suggestion the formatting for any partitions you wish to merge should be the same filesystems as windows ntfs beforehand if you wish to merge them with a minimum of fuss

1250673
folder	directory
today i was reading up more on unc paths and thought i understood that it didn t matter what the folder was named locally or what directory this folder was placed into as long as the path name still pointed to the endpoint folder

1250673
folder	directory
in my head the original path name shouldn t work because it did not specify enough directory to reach the destination folder

1250720
fat	hfs+	hfs+	ntfs	filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	fat	filesystems	hfs+
filesystem-aware backup -- in this approach you use a tool that understands the filesystems in use on each partition -- that is the tool reads ntfs fat ext4fs hfs+ or whatever filesystems each partition uses

1250785
bluetooth	usb
i connected it via bluetooth and via usb unity and got the same problem

google-chrome	firefox
in addition to this i am also able to use my web browser firefox although i ve tried google-chrome and found the same behavior to access ipv6-only sites.

1250852
findstr	tasklist
because pipe and find â â findstr are not part of tasklist .â

1250866
sudo	passwd

1250992
ethernet	wireless
my laptop has a wireless adapter obviously as well as an ethernet adapter

1250992
ethernet	wireless
is that because my wireless adapter puts me on layer 3 while my ethernet cable puts me on layer 2

1251013
mouse	keyboard
it supports expected keyboard keys like up down enter and escape so you shouldn t ever have to use your mouse

1251016
disk	ram
keep in mind that some of the memory may be stored as virtual memory on a disk instead of ram

1251016
disk	ram
with modern operating systems the computer might decide to do that even if the program hasn t run out of available ram if the computer believes that the memory written onto disk will be left dormant for a while and the available ram could be better used for some other purpose like helping a disk cache cause the computer to run faster

1251028
wan	lan
i m not offhand thinking of an exact definition that specifies what is a lan and what is a wan

1251028
ethernet	wireless
is that because my wireless adapter puts me on layer 3 while my ethernet cable puts me on layer 2

1251028
restrict	shared
unless you re on an active directory domain in which case domain users is often just as good as everyone and slightly more restrictive of access that is probably unwanted. microsoft s recommendations to people training as professionals has been to restrict access using ntfs permissions not shared permissions.

the vpn must allow split tunnel

1251142
udp	tcp
edit i d love to know why does allowing program such as a teamviewer the standard way add outbound rule rule for a program select the program path does not provide access for the program to the internet but adding a custom rule with unblocking tcp udp port for it does work

1251143
cpu	processors
processors intel core i5-4670k cpu 3.40ghz

1251146
16-bit	64bit
64bit versions of either xp or windows 7 are a no-go for compatibility reasons with the 16-bit dune executable as helpfully pointed out by toogam in the comments

1251166
width	margin
greenshot should always use the full width of the page minus some margin on both sides

1251209

tcp udp port 5938 teamviewer prefers to make outbound tcp and udp

1251228

when you use . to run a command you re telling powershell to look only in the current directory for it - the dot means this folder just like in the old command processor

1251258

winhex can also analyze a ntfs partition possibly other filesystems too never tried but it s supposed to or an image of an entire volume provided that you open it by selecting its correct type in the â œopenâ menu â generally â œall types of imagesâ works well and for any given location it will display the name of the associated file or indicate if it s registered as free space

1252209
udp	tcp
4 i set up port forwarding with service type tcp udp external and internal ports set to 22 and it points to my internal ip address

1252394
vpn	lan
the vpn server needs a route to the lan subnet via the raspberry pi s ip address

1252394
vpn	lan
specifically via its vpn address not the lan one since the route is from the perspective of vpn server.

1252394
vpn	lan
your lan s primary router the isp-issued router modem needs a route in the opposite direction â to the vpn subnet via the raspberry pi s lan ip address

1252394
vpn	lan
the raspberry pi itself already has all necessary routes as it s directly attached to both the lan and the vpn

1252394
vpn	lan
finally your vpn server needs to push a route for the lan subnet to all other clients such as your phone so that they ll know they need to go through the vpn to reach it

the standard ubuntu kubuntu ubuntu gnome etc. or even ubuntu mate may work but will poor performance predictably worse than windows 7

1252889
folder	directory
also i wouldn t touch the key that you trying to use i think that it s for internal configuration of explorer the proper key for adding commands to the context menu of a folder is hkey_classes_root directory shell if would be something like this

1252897

udp	tcp	sctp	udp	sctp	tcp
most transport protocols such as tcp udp sctp use two ports source and destination â one on either end of the connection

1253026
icmp	udp
such state is kept even for connectionless protocols such as udp or icmp so the entries expire after some interval of inactivity even though there s no explicit close connection packet

1253027

stdout	stderr
stderr rather than stdout

1253319
stdout	stderr
the redirections or | tee file only redirect stdout but not stderr

1253319
stdout	stderr
it first redirects the error to where stdout is at the moment which is your terminal emulator and then redirects stdout and only stdout not stderr to a file

1253341
udp	tcp	sctp	udp	sctp	tcp
ports are related to tcp udp or the lesser-used sctp

1254865

if these suggestions do not resolve the issue i would suggest taking a packet capture off the lan and wan while restarting the phone

the downside to a proxy and an upside for vpn is that your isp can see your traffic if you don t use bittorrent encryption and can tell that its bittorrent traffic but not what the content is more clearly than they can if you are passing your traffic through a tunnel which they can still identify but less explicitly

vlan	packets
while in principle your switch should figure out from the macs of nic1 and nic2 which do need different addresses of course which path the packets should go and shouldn t send it to the along the other path to make absolutely sure and as you want to learn new things i d set up vlan s to totally separate the data paths

1260234
vlan	packets
roughly speaking a vlan packets is like a normal ethernet packets but with an additional tag field so you can setup your switch that it acts like several superimposed virtual switches

1260234
vlan	packets
the router is probably not be able to handled tagged vlan packets

1260234

i wanted to upgrade glibc on my wheezy dist since i need to use tensorflow which doesn t accept stable versioning glibc_2.13

1262134
filesystems	btrfs
the first few gbs of my 300 gb btrfs partition were overwritten by another filesystems so i lost that data

1262218
pull	push
i can pull push clone via ssh by running git clone keeyan example.com git my_repo

1262226
ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	linux
would i have better luck with vanilla ubuntu as opposed to linux mint or even a completely different distro

1262265
subtract	add
with this system excel can add subtract or compare dates and times just like any other numbers and all dates are manipulated by using this system

1262265
integer	fractions
the date integers and time decimal fractions can be combined to create numbers that have a decimal and an integer portion

1262279
x86	64bit
actually on 64bit windows machines the 32-bit applications install to c program files x86 folder so you ll find the 32-bit internet explorer in c program files x86 internet explorer folder

1262350
wan	lan
so how can i enable lan devices access to the wan

1262371
factors	mean
are there any important factors i need to consider here that i haven t mentioned that would mean i shouldn t use one or either of these configurations

1262403
switching	screens
then by changing the switching s input selector you could switching back and forth between all the screens to see who s doing what

1262436
width	height
for each even column set its width to some smaller value for example equal to rows height so you will get a squared checkbox at the end

1262440
stdout	stderr
by default you only get the standard output that way error message still go directly to the terminal if you want to catch the error messages as well reroute the stderr stream to stdout

1262451
debian	linux
system setup debian 9 stretch on haswell hardware its igp handled by the i915 driver in linux now supporting kvm and dri drm for quite a while

1262472
filesystems	ntfs
i understand that ntfs is a proprietary filesystems so the details may be only known by microsoft themselves but i was wondering whether they had published any documentation on this or whether anyone else had picked windows cmd apart enough to find out

1262477
filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	fat
windows convert command is able to convert fat filesystems to ntfs non-destructively

1262477
filesystems	ntfs
similarly fstransform is a linux utility that is capable of doing this - calling it an in-place filesystems conversion - from and to a few more filesystems including ntfs and ext3

1262478
tunnel	vpn
thank god for that i was afraid i d have to pay for a dedicated ip address or resort to vpn ssh tunnel

1262553
mouse	keyboard
keyboard mouse key mappings

1262601
tunnel	lan	tunnel	vpn	vpn	lan
as mentioned in the comments by dotvotdot the lan on which your computer is present won t be routed through the vpn tunnel

1262601
tunnel	lan
if you want to reach local subnets that is i guess networks which are not your lan and not accessible through the tunnel itself you might want to use the net_gateway keyword which represents your local gateway

1262601
tunnel	vpn
see the example below where the traffic for the 10.59.0.0 16 network should not go through the vpn tunnel

1262644
mouse	keyboard
we re those programming language able to do simple steps like recording just keyboard pressing and mouse movements

1262717

1262720
ethernet	wireless
i can access any page with any of the other items connected to my net wireless and thorugh ethernet

1262724
mtu	ppp	mtu	pppoe
the most common mtu restriction is caused by pppoe which uses 8 bytes for ppp headers leaving a 1492-byte mtu

1262724
mtu	icmp
good routers should also support path mtu discovery by honoring the â œdonâ t fragmentâ bit and sending the appropriate icmp message when fragmentation is required

1262730
xlsx	xlsm
ok i have created a xlsm workbook that i need to deactivate some tabs and then i only need to save as a xlsx to my desktop

1262730
xlsx	xlsm
it all works well except i have to close the xlsx and reopen the xlsm manually and when i do several dozens a day it gets tedious

1262733
versioning	upgrade
and i didn t do anything on the computer except upgrade windowsâ 10 to versioning 1709

1262737
margin	height	width	height	width	margin
if you see a dotted line - this means that somewhere in the project there is a page with that width usable area of hard + margin and possibly others with that height

1262743
fink	homebrew	fink	macports	macports	homebrew
macports and homebrew and fink are basically just exposing the unix underpinnings that are already there

1262743
macports	homebrew
in fact you can use macports and homebrew together just fine

1262747
margin	height	width	height	width	margin
if you see a dotted line - this means that somewhere in the project there is a page with that width usable area of hard + margin and possibly others with that height

1262750
spaces	delimiter
it works perfect if all the columns are spaces delimiter any number of spaces will work fine

1262778
folder	directory
well by default gnome only indexes files which reside directly in your home directory or in the folder desktop documents downloads music pictures and videos

1262778
folder	directory
for that you need to bind the directory you want indexed to a folder located on home s drive

1262789
vmware	virtualbox
in order to use .vhd azure vm images on local pc you need to use hyper-v instead of virtualbox or vmware

1262789
bluestacks	android-emulator	vmware	virtualbox
note that after enabling vt-x role to hyper-v you are no longer able to use any kind of 3rd party virtual service or even android-emulator such as vmware virtualbox genymotion bluestacks etc.

1262789
vmware	virtualbox
to disable vt-x from hyper-v and enable it to other virtual services vmware virtualbox etc...

1262794
sudo	passwd
if plain sudo won t popup an enter passwd prompt then gksu sounds like the tool you want to use instead of sudo

1262794
sudo	passwd	sudoers	passwd
or modify your sudo sudoers to only run your specific script file without asking for a passwd only for your user something like this but see man sudoers for pages pages of info

1262859
folder	directory
in output directory for result files press use current look in directory for selecting the same folder in which files are located or use browse to select a different one if you want to move renamed files to another folder

1262860
folder	directory
the simplest way to deal with this without breaking windows is to deny your limited user the ntfs create folder append data right on the root directory and specify that the permission applies to this folder only

1262896
ethernet	wireless
connecting these devices via ethernet to the other router the one that provides the wireless network is not an option for me

the strange thing is that in the past i always upgrade to the versioning suggested by the settings gear in the top right corner- and that s where they led me

1263189
filesystems	ntfs
how the implementation of the proprietary convert.exe on windows takes care of this in-place filesystems conversion between fat32 and ntfs

1263189
filesystems	hfs+
in 2017 everyone upgrading an apple ios device to ios 10.3 received an in-place filesystems upgrade from hfs+ to apfs on their idevice s built-in nand

1263189
filesystems	btrfs
for years btrfs has supported upgrading a filesystems in-place from ext4 to btrfs using the btrfs-convert tool

1263189
filesystems	ntfs
the open source fstransform program purports to convert between many different filesystems with some caveats and limitations -- and it includes many most common linux filesystems as well as impressively ntfs

1263189
xfs	ntfs	filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	xfs
meaning the usual atomicity guarantees of a journaled filesystems like ntfs reiserfs xfs zfs etc. are not available

1263189
filesystems	hfs+
for more insight into how this can be done safer with the knowing cooperation of two filesystems that are designed to convert between one to the other which was as i understand it the case with the hfs+ to apfs conversion on ios this fascinating talk takes a forensic approach to figuring out what the heck is going on with apfs

vmware	virtualbox
this is versatile enough to sync volumes between any 2 os-es not just vmware virtualbox could work too and not even just between vm guest host if we use dropbox or similar for the comm channel file sharing

1263534

vim	emacs	ubuntu	linux
use a linux ubuntu app to modify files these files vim emacs nano etc...

1263556
kde	gnome
i can change the settings in gnome or kde in xorg and wayland but it seems it may require some mysterious code or compile-time options to achieve this effect at boot-time -- or are the linux boot video modes too restricted

1263639
wan	lan
i pluged the cable that comes out of the lan port of the modem in the lan port of the router instead of the wan port and disabled dhcp in the router

1263643
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu is similar to steam os in that there both linux based and ubuntu tends to be the most supported linux os but ubuntu is much easier to install than steam os if you have a working computer and will help you with if steam os does what you need or if you want to put windows back on the machine

1263653
wan	subnet
assign a static wan address to the linksys router on 192.168.1 subnet

1263667

1263761
wan	lan
now the page is accessible if the ethernet cord is moved from the wan port to a lan port but there is no connection to the internet doing so

1263770
wan	lan
or configure your router so that the wan port acts as a 5th lan port

1263770
wan	lan
if the h2000 can t act as dhcp server and does have a fixed ip address or needs to receive an ip address from the router then the modem needs to be connected to the wan port and the router needs to be configured to forward between wan and lan ports so the status page can also be accessed from lan

1263770
wan	lan
connect modem to wan port pc to lan port

1263770
wan	lan
so it was an address conflict just between what your isp uses and your lan and not the wan and lan segements in your home

1263776
folder	directory
i just used my home directory as a prefix for everything so i have the folder bin share and lib where all the installations go in

1263780
width	height
i never resized the browser window as these images must all be the same height and width

1263791
wan	lan
if you change your lan to a different network on the router then it will forward traffic destined to the 192.168.0.0 24 network out your wan port as expected

1263843
wan	lan
there is a difference in definitions on your lan the isp wan and your internet address

1263872
wan	lan
connect one of the routersâ s lan ports do not use the wan port to your local network

after looking for solutions on this stack exchange i noticed that it was often recommended to just find the newest windows iso and reinstall on top of the current installation to upgrade

1264143

it can do everything in step 1 at least as well as ansible but requires some overhead effort installing puppet agent and dependencies on each device setting up puppet master allow devices to connect to puppet master through http

1264153

for example you can try to remove the antivirus directory from program files folder

the device is functionally identical to having a regular wireless router which is a type of ap with it s upstream port connected to a regular docsis modem and in fact most such combined modem ap devices are in fact such a combination but using traces on a circuit board instead of a physical ethernet cable

1264597
ethernet	wireless
the tomato v1.28 instructions on learntomato.com most commonly describe the situation in which you have a wired device such xbox that you want to get onto your wifi network so you set up your wifi tomato router as a client to your home wifi network and it bridges the wired device onto your home wifi network either transparently - as in wireless ethernet bridge or with it s own local lan as in wireless client mode

1264597
ethernet	wireless
however i need to do the opposite the primary network is wired via ethernet and i need to create a wireless access point to this wired ethernet lan

1264598
ethernet	wireless
the solution was almost like wireless ethernet bridge except that wireless ethernet bridge sets up the linksys wifi as a client - ie

1264598
wan	lan
optionally set the wan port to be used as an extra lan port

1264614

versioning	upgrade
i was seeing versioning 5.1.8 in the log even though the upgrade took me to 5.1.11 .

1264960

i further suggest you look into some middleware like apache or nginx to wrap your application in something that listens to tradition http requests

1264999
folder	dir
so if your path was a mapped drive like x dir1 dir2 dir3 when you closed it it will query every file and folder in root then every file and folder in dir1 then dir1 dir2 and finally dir dir2 dir3 when you reopen it

cpu	hyperthreading
a common thing that gets overlooked is physical cores versus hyperthreading cores. hyperthreading excels at many short tasks with bottlenecks other than cpu

1265211
cpu	hyperthreading
for tight-looped cpu bottlenecked tasks you are still limited by your physical core count which is generally half your hyperthreading core count

1265228

1265319
folder	dir
then just create a normal user with this restricted shell and set it s home dir to the desired folder

1265322
children	parent
because the sizes of the children is a formula based of the width of the parent master shape any protection doesn t actually work

1265341
bash	zsh
occasionally when pressing an arrow key usually up inside of a shell the terminal or shell fails to output an esc character before the escape sequence so if i press the up arrow to try and see the last command it outputs on bash and oa on zsh instead of the last command

1265350

there s an advanced setting to pop-up a save dialog for any download but i expect this will affect intentional downloads as well

1265544
ethernet	wireless
windows 8.1 has a feature that restricts the values you can set the mac address on a wireless network adapter note this restriction does not apply to ethernet adapters even if your network adapter itself contains no restrictions and gives you the full ability to change the mac address to any value you like which can be confirmed by booting into any other os such as bsd or linux and changing the mac address there

1265558
screens	tablet
anyway when the tablet part is docked to the keyboard part the hinge is very fragile - and even when the whole system was working whenever i d hit the desk by accident even gently the rocking action of the tablet part in the hinge was enough to temporarily disconnect the tablet from the keyboard dock - and this was followed by change of brightness of screens i use ubuntu 14.04 mate desktop

1265558
mouse	keyboard
anything else on the dock-tablet connection still seems to work i can use usb keyboard mouse even when this pulsing occurs

1265600

this application as i understand it locks the user s mac and makes the touch bar keyboard and mouse unresponsive

1265608
disk	ram
even embedded linux can be built for such conditions the root filesystem can exist in an initramfs an improved version of a ram disk but stored in flash

1265636
wan	lan
you would plug the wan interface on your router to the lan interface on the landlords ap and provided you change the lan range on your router it should just work and it will isolate your lan from the landlords lan meaning your devices can share media but no one else can

1265864
filesystems	btrfs
checksums used by zfs and btrfs array filesystems combos can actively find the data corruption yes but it does not necessarily give the answer of what to do about it and you may still need your backups anyways for that particular set of data

i use imdisk toolkit to create a dynamically-allocated ram disk

1266043

i have it set to 6gb of size which is how the os sees it but if there is nothing on the disk such as on boot then it takes about 12mb of ram according to windows 10 task manager i have 8+gb to play with

i want to have a central figures directory and simply simlink to it whenever i create a folder

1266214
folder	directory
it simply means that you need to maintain the central directory or the folder might end up with broken symlinks and the presentations cease working

1266232
asterisk	freeswitch
the best way would be to use asterisk or freeswitch to act as your router and try and co-opt the settings used by your isp into asterisk

what you need to do is move data from that drive any filesystems operations could damage data on a drive and formatting a drive removes all data from it and then format it with the options from screen #1 - as ntfs

1266634
wan	lan
this is a straightforward setup but i ll have to open up a port on the wan side and if not secured properly the pi gives access to the whole lan for hackers

in some advanced cases when you already know the module name but can t reboot nor obtain the correct versioning if the upgrade was only between minor releases 4.13.1 to 4.13.2 there is a chance that you can just insmod the new module file and it ll still work despite the versioning mismatch

vpn	lan
since windows supports per-interface dns servers make sure the vpn interface has higher priority than the lan interface and that bar-technology.local is among the configured per-interface domain suffixes

i ran into this issue when my temp and tmp environment paths were invalid

1267902
temp	tmp
make sure that the paths to the tmp and temp directories are valid or edit them to make them valid

filesystems	ntfs
the mft is a complex and very important part of the filesystems which keeps track of all the meta-data from all the files on an ntfs partition not only their names and attributes but also the precise location of each and every one of the clusters they occupy

1268003
virtualbox	parallels
assuming you have the correct cable either parallels or serial you could install virtualbox on the optiplex install ms-dos as a guest and use the serial or parallels port pass-thru to expose the port on the optiplex to your guest os

1268014
google-chrome	firefox
i would like to know if this behavior is really because of firefox google-chrome or if it depends on the umatrix addon and its version

until ntp daemons service kicks in the systemd clock may be off

1268246
daemons	systemd
if the daemons service fails to do its job the systemd clock may be off

1268246
ubuntu	linux
i guess the time is off also when you start your ubuntu but linux gets the clock right via ntp before you know it

always use wan ip for connecting to your whatever servers you have setup in your lan

1268525
put	get
in this example sample data is in cells a2 c8 put item code in e2 and get the latest sales in f1

1268533
google-chrome	firefox
since google-chrome and firefox don t support java anymore i used ie11

1268543
google-chrome	firefox
yes google should have implemented a proper profile management selection on startup regardless of how google-chrome is called just like firefox has had for ages

1268548
width	height
in the meantime the format often changes when people alter the cell width height and font .

1268584
google-chrome	firefox
correction although the below does work in firefox and google-chrome the snapshot in firefox produces a binary file

1268584
google-chrome	firefox
for both firefox and google-chrome i think a much easier way compared to an actual core dump of a system process is to use developer tools

1268625
ubuntu	debian
you should install libltdl-dev on debian and ubuntu

1268651

the feature updates which are uninstalled should be in the list of pending updates however once they are installed the list of updates is cleared due to windows 10 being upgrade to that new versioning of windows 10

1268827
joystick	keyboard
the joystick buttons are supported by autohotkey as inputs and wouldn t override any other keyboard combos but if the custom software doesn t allow you to map to those combinations then you would be out of luck

1268838
ubuntu	linux
simply install one operating system first usually windows 10 first would be your best choice and then once installed boot into your ubuntu linux installation media and install the linux os onto a separate partition

1268838
vmware	virtualbox
i prefer virtualbox myself since it s free and open-source and simple to use for beginners but you can choose vmware as well - both will work pretty much the same

1268838
ubuntu	linux
after installing your virtualization software in windows start it up and follow the applicable procedure to install a ubuntu linux virtual machine on that platform

1268838
vmware	virtualbox
now if you wanna do the opposite - run a virtual machine containing windows 10 on the linux desktop - you ll just reboot the computer choose to boot into your linux installation from the bios and then just follow the same instructions to install virtualbox or vmware on your linux distro and then install windows inside

1268867

1269078
folder	directory
most likely there are still files in the ramdisk that aren t linked into any directory so you can t see them by looking at the folder

1269078
filesystems	ntfs
as is the case with most modern filesystems ntfs controls when files are deleted internally

1269089

1269253
vlookup	sumifs
basically you want to use sumifs on column b of table b referencing the gender using vlookup

1269253
vlookup	sumifs
alternately you could insert a column between id and a in table b use vlookup to work out the gender and then use sumifs on whether the new second column contains m

1269254
vmware	virtualbox
does the choice of vm client vmware virtualbox make any difference

1269281
ubuntu	linux
i want two connected usb mouses in linux ubuntu 17.10 now

1269293

if the second case best is to move it outside the www directory a designated directory in like moodledata and then set permissions on that directory for apache or put this folder on separate disk or san share or nfs

1269303
ubuntu	linux
i created an ubuntu linux image with packer

1269312
ubuntu	linux
as i acquired a second laptop running linux i was able to remove the ubuntu partition from this laptop

1269320
disk	ram
as to database - single database server separate from application hosted with reasonable ram and disk space can handle a lot of connections and a lot of queries

1269328
put	get
if you put all your access control logic in the share permissions however those get lost when the os instance is replaced with the new build

1269330

on tp-link the cable to main router is in lan port not in the wan port

1269446
ethernet	wireless
the computer notebook is connected via ethernet wired not wireless

1269451

if the drives have ntfs or exfat filesystems you may need to install packages that support these filesystems

1269485
mouse	keyboard
however after the latest 1709 update fall creators edition of windows installed i have been getting the message windows resource protection found corrupt files but was unable to fix some of them... i was also having problems with the mouse and keyboard being completely unresponsive at times i discovered that closing the lid and putting it to sleep and then opening the lid again and waking it up made the mouse and keyboard return to normal and also a blue screen - both problems that i had not had before the 1709 update

1269571
decimal	roundup
reason is simple ceiling considers the whole number but round and roundup considers number after the decimal

1269582
disk	ram
i m pretty sure that in previous versions of windows hibernation and sleep were two different things now it seems that windows saves state on disk everytime in case of losing power source and just still keeps it in ram to instantly turn on

1269609
button	checkbox
if you go to the power options dialog if control panel activate the choose what the power button does link and then on the page that comes up the change settings that are currently unavailable link the checkbox for the four power state tweaks will become accessible

bash	subshell
in bash commands which appear in a process substitution will be invoked in a subshell

1269789
bash	subshell
subshell is also a shell bash

1269789
bash	subshell
so for the command you will get the exactly same result in subshell as you run it straightforward in current shell which means subshell will also perform parameter expansion on just like what a bash does

1269813
jobs	cron
now as the final step of my installation script i have to install cron jobs that call php commands on my site for example like this one

1269813
jobs	cron
it seems the best place to install cron jobs that do not belong to a specific user but to services running in background would be etc cron.d right

1269813
jobs	cron
so i would have to change the permissions of www-data which seems not a good idea or i should create a new user account specifically for my cron jobs such as mysite-jobs

1269813
jobs	cron
also i ve read that environment variables are not automatically available for jobs in cron.d so i have to specify them in my cron file

1269841
folder	directory
im going through a directory and copying the images with the file extensions shown to a new folder

1269849
disk	ram
the problem is the lack of remaining disk space or ram for a tmpfs forcing me to split the archive and download it in chunks

1269858
ethernet	wireless
well i ve disabled both the wireless adapter and ethernet card and i ve updated and rolled back and updated the drivers for both of them to no avail

1269892
mouse	keyboard
mouse and keyboard don t take up the laptop s two usb3 ports

1269912
hide	show
this method does not have a way to hide or show the ui elements via keyboard shortcuts

1269920
ubuntu	linux
if the solution is some kind of program - better it ll be for windows 10 x64 or linux ubuntu

1269937
filesystems	btrfs
some filesystems especially btrfs make df output not as exact as you d like

1269992

1270275
folder	directory
i tested it by moving it to a different folder and it automatically created the folder but none of the sub directory that you are getting

1270302

the wireless router is also not suitable for additional ethernet connections so i can t plug the new laptop directly into its ethernet port

this also makes it very difficult to debug the problem since i cannot even do anything with the keyboard since the mouse clicks take away the focus of whatever i am trying to do

the ideal solution is to run a cable from the lan interface on the upstream router to the wan interface on your c50 router

1271542
wan	lan
if this is not an option i would get another basic wifi device which i could configure as an ap client and then connect the lan interface on that to the wan interface on the c50 as per the ideal solution above - you are effectively using the ap client as a wifi to ethernet converter

1272440
integer	fractions
the fact that you can t use an integer number of bits for a decimal digit is the root cause of why many fractions that are easy to express in the decimal system 1 5 or 0.2 are impossible not hard really impossible to express in binary

1272451
octal	binary
you ve fallen into a bit of a trap by using binary 2 octal 8 and hexadecimal 16 as examples because these are all powers of 2 and thus you can think of them in terms of bits whereas 10 isn t a power of 2 so it just doesn t work very well like that

wan	lan
me and a colleague of mine are trying to connect a arris cable router to a linksys ea38400 and a linksys e3200 utilizing their wan ports rather than cascading them using their lan ports

1274837
wan	lan
a router creates a network for all the lan ports and directs its traffic to the wan port

1274837
wan	lan
if you want the arris modem to do everything then don t use the wan port at all but only the lan ports

1274902
vmware	virtualbox
this would still work for you if you were to move the linux stuff to virtual machines virtualbox or vmware with just the sole windows os as the host

1274903
rpm	dnf
i have installed phpmyadmin after installed mysql 5.7 and php 7.1.12 in fedora 27 all installed using rpm packages via dnf command

1274928
google-chrome	firefox
fwiw i ve tried google-chrome and it doesn t work either but i d rather stick w firefox anyway

1274952
wan	lan
anyway here goes i have two routers- first is the primary router an asus rt-ac87u running asuswrt-merlin 380.68_4 which serves as the firewall between my internet modem wan and what i ll call lan1 lan

1274952
wan	lan
the secondary router an asus rt-ac68p u b1 running tomato 1.28 build 138 which serves as the gateway firewall disabled between lan1 wan and lan2 lan

1274952
tunnel	vpn
the goal is that i want to keep a vpn tunnel open on the secondary router at all times so anything connected physically or wirelessly to lan2 will have its internet traffic vpn tunneled to the internet

1274952
wan	lan
the problem is that while hosts on lan1 can reach everything on lan 2 firewall is off on secondary computer hosts on lan2 cannot route traffic to lan1 or wan aka the internet

1274952
wan	lan
secondary wan ip 192.168.250.254 gateway 192.168.10.1 lan network 192.168.10.0 24 no static routes

1274952
subnet	vlan	tunnel	vpn	tunnel	vlan
also i d consider just using the secondary router as a vlan-capable switch and have everything on a single subnet but i am not sure i can get vpn to work on the vlan level allowing local traffic to other hosts but routing its internet traffic through the tunnel

1274981
mouse	keyboard
i have a microsoft natural wireless ergonomic keyboard 7000 as well as the mouse connected to my laptop via a wireless usb to my laptop

1274981
mouse	keyboard
i was thinking that if i were to use task scheduler to boot up the computer automatically even when the lid is closed at a certain time everyday the computer would automatically go to sleep and then i would be able to wake the computer up with the external keyboard or mouse

1274995
put	get
it s also worth bearing in mind that i haven t put the case s side cover back on since installing the barracuda so i think that means things are going to get hotter still

1275030
folder	directory
anyway i had already checked my windows winsxs directory after reinstalling the c++ redistributable and found that it had a folder with a name that closest matched the parameters in the windows event text

1275045
folder	directory
please note var www folder_path is your project folder path or directory where you want to save file

1275048

press f12 which opened the developer console - inspect the checkbox html element and manually allow it to be unchecked by removing the disabled html attribute - then click save button

1275102

so what i like to see in the destination directory is the same amount of folder and files but then all zipped

note oracle virtualbox is happy to let me assign more than one cpu in its system processors settings

1275252
umount	btrfs
as far as fixing it start by umount the btrfs volume forcibly if you have to and then disconnecting and reconnecting each flash drive in turn

1275254
disk	ram
i allways do this with linux not windows i will tell why not windows later use three disk max that my motherboard can two sata and one pata in raid 0 then i partition the raid 0 for linux root another for swap only 2gib of ram max motherboard can handle and another for my data.

1275254
ssd	sata
now i have two ssd that can write at 500mib s tested on a friends sata iii motherboard the pata part only giving 96 mib s would look like a bottle neck i only get 137 mib s on each sata i port so 137+137+96 would be 370.

1275254
ssd	sata
on raid 0 it would be 3 slowest so 3 96 282 so using only two sata i get 2 137 274 the gain of using that pata ssd using sata to pata adapter of course is very near to 282 so i will stay only using two sata and on bios disable the pata ports.

1275254
disk	ram
1.-data is asked to be written to a file write cache is on data is on ram never goes to disk the bug

1275254

1275316
tunnel	vpn
it claims that if the vpn connection is not established and you have network connection vpn server is not running the client is not yet connected etc. then your client computer will use the local network without tunnel instead of the vpn

1275316
tunnel	vpn
is there a way to prevent that from happening and forcing every app on a client computer to use vpn tunnel only

1275327
versioning	upgrade
fyi i have the same versioning of virtualbox 5.0.40_ubuntu r115130 and upgrade to windows 10 1709

1275357
wan	lan
it apparently supports multiple wan links so you could install pfsense onto a small computer with at least three network ports connect your two routers to the wan ports on the pfsense pc connect the third lan port of the pfsense to your lan and let pfsense combine both connections

1275378
subnet	packets	tunnel	lan	tunnel	vpn	tunnel	packets	vpn	lan
the first method can be implemented by filtering outgoing packets based on their source address as you ll have different addresses for the lan subnet and for the vpn tunnel

if the width is greater than the height it will rotate the image even if you change the paper orientation

1275811

the easy solution is to give it more height than width if you want to print it in portrait mode or the other way around if you want landscape

1275836
d3.js	chart.js
but if you want another more versatile solution you could try to use an excel add-in called funfun it allows you to use javascript directly in excel so that you could use powerful libraries like d3.js or chart.js to make different charts

1275841
hide	show
after turning on show hidden files and turning off hide system files i was able to see it

1275842

1275863
sudo	passwd
it is possible to make sudo ask the passwd of the target user instead of the user that is initially running the command i think suse even has had this as a default setting but in other linux distributions and other unix-style systems that would be unusual

1275863
sudo	passwd	sudoers	passwd
for example to cause sudo to ask the passwd of the target user only when usera uses the sudo command you would set it in etc sudoers like this

packets	multicast
these are multicast packets in particular simple service discovery protocol ssdp and multicast domain name service mdns packets that are used for configurationless discovery in one single lan or wlan segment

1276178
packets	multicast
that s because unicast packets with a destination address of a single ip device 192.168.0.x instead of a multicast address 224.0.0.x are not broadcast by your router to all other wlan devices

there is alot more to usb identification than one mouse one cable hid vs one mouse one keyboard one cable composite.

1276625
hid	keyboard
for example a lone keyboard can be either a hid and or a composite usb device if you ve ever had a gamer keyboard with built in macros and lighting and it s own storage to save those macros for travel that is a composite device because it incorporates multiple device s in the one bus

1276625

in counter point a logitech wireless mouse keyboard combo can be just a hid device because that is the only class present though there may be two devices they are both hid only

1276864
ftp	telnet
for example they removed the command-line ftp and telnet clients from macos as of high sierra 10.13 since those protocols are insecure

1276873
puts	gets
for whatever reason task manager is not exempt from this mechanism and in fact it has a particularly unexpected behavior when windows puts taskmgr.exe into the suspended state its update speed setting also gets altered from whatever you had it set to to paused

1276911
children	parent
this works because the parent of the iexplore children will be another iexplore that is in the pid array and the parent of the first iexplore proces was probably explorer whose pid is not in that array

ubuntu	debian
if that works modify etc resolve.conf on the ubuntu box to match that of the debian box

mouse	keyboard
the screen shows some rectangular grid and the mouse and keyboard become unresponsive

1277257

wan	lan
public wan media server you also want to access on your lan

spaces	delimiter
to solve the problem i then opened up the file as a delimiter file with spaces and tab delimiter checked and checked the box that states treat consecutive delimiter as one

1277604
ubuntu	linux
it looks like this is caused by an interaction between the default vagrant configuration of config.ssh.shell to be bash -l which simulates a login shell thus processing login-related configuration files such as .profile with a line in the root .profile file on at least some distributions of linux including the one in the ubuntu xenial64 vagrant box which has

1277801
next	except
that was until i came across velcro strips which is basically double sided tape except the side that goes outwards is velcro instead of glue the inside part comes covered with paper you just gotta cut it to your specific measurements peel it off and stick one of each to each monitor and voila your monitors will now stay together leveled and next to each other

1277820
google-chrome	firefox
in mozilla firefox and later google-chrome they were npapi plugins

1277820
mp4	h.264
it wasn t just pdfs - your browser would have no idea how to handle a mp4 container or h.264 video no idea how to play a mp3 file etc. etc

1277864
d3.js	chart.js
in here i propose to use a tool called funfun which allows you to use javascript within excel so that you could use powerful javascript libraries like chart.js or d3.js to plot chart

i have a wireless router at point of entry on a property that has hardwired ethernet

1277905
ethernet	wireless
the old router will eventually have to connect to the main one either wireless or through the walls via ethernet

1277932
ssd	sata
i had a hunch this happened because of the sata controller but i went ahead and reformatted a different ssd used a different sata cable reinstalled windows and just used it minimally to see if it would happen again

1277944
wan	lan
connect the dir-655 via a lan port not the wan internet port

disk	ram
if a game take 8 gb then some of the ram that is currently being used for less important purposes like reducing disk i o will instead by used by the game

1278016
disk	ram
if it keeps the ram is use it is saved the effort of having to free it saved the effort of having to make it used again to use it later and if you run task manager again it won t have to read the program from disk

1278023
ubuntu	debian
fyi the xxd command is in the vim-common package on debian ubuntu there s an xxd package but it s not available for oldstable older ubuntus

after logging in i started a putty session from inside winscp

1278159
putty	winscp
by default winscp creates temporary site settings for putty under the name winscp temporary sessionâ

1278159
putty	winscp
if you want to configure your own session-specific options you can save putty site settings with the same name as a winscp site

1278159
putty	winscp
winscp will then instruct putty to open that session it will not export any settings nor a connection options

1278159
putty	winscp
open putty outside of winscp

1278159
putty	winscp
now try again and you should find out both the winscp and the putty connection are terminated as expected

powershell from the root directory of the sub folder

1278472
subnet	packets
i read that wireshark cannot see packets on bridged interfaces and the advice was to use nat however im not sure this would work in the setup as although i could get the three vms to have an ip address in the correct subnet they would all be resolved to the physical cards ip address which would be on a different ip range

1278502
profiling	debugging
i did some debugging profiling prestashop 1.6 with xdebug and culprint was file_exists

1278825
factors	mean
depends on a multitude of factors but the best you can do is look at your specific drives documentation there used to be a mtbf rating which is the mean time between failure rating but seagate has replaced this with afr which is annual failure rate

1278827

1278920
udp	tcp
i can use dig to resolve a hostname by specifying that the query should be made using tcp port 53 rather than the usual udp port 53

1278920
udp	tcp
dig has the +vc+ virtual circuit flag that allows you to tell it to use tcp rather than the usual udp

1278920
udp	tcp
our nameserver the one at 192.168.13.14 is configured to accept normal recursive queries on tcp as well as the usual udp

1278920

google-chrome	firefox
but when i open a directory in any of my browsers google-chrome firefox the directory structure tree is shown instead

1278969
put	get
this means that you can put a sata-iii drive into a sata-ii port and it will work but you would not get the higher sequential read write speeds of sata-iii

1278969
ssd	sata
regardless of which sata version your motherboard supports the ssd will still give you an enormous boost in random read write speeds as opposed to using a hard drive

1278982
x86	64bit

1279011
cpu	hyperthreading
hyperthreading is a cpu feature

1279031
udp	tcp
that s a good thing because the usual internet protocols tcp udp are not multi-homed you can t use them to form a single connection using multiple local and or remote ip address while routing on different paths

1279073
ubuntu	linux
install linux and ubuntu server

1279073
ubuntu	linux
obviously i think iâ ll have to use postgresql i donâ t think sql server express would run on linux since itâ s a microsoft software but i didnâ t find any comment that would say that ubuntu server and postgresql are incompatible

instead of rpm you can use yum with localinstall command

even for filesystems with their own volume management like zfs or btrfs i d be reluctant to use disks that way...

1279143
gmail	outlook.com
zipmail is also available for web browsers in case you use outlook.com gmail or other web mails or web applications

1279173
sorting	filtering
i was trying to find a good way to take data from two tables in excel that have a one to many relationship and display a combined form of them in such a way that filtering and sorting is still possible

1279283
put	get
it may be difficult to get a conclusive answer on this one but i d put my money on it being a hardware limitation or driver issue with the wifi stick

1279287
subnet	vlan
using something like dd-wrt you could set up a separate ssid and subnet for each user with its contingent bandwidth wastage costs and complexity and then do shaping on a per vlan interface

1279287
l2tp	pppoe
another possibility - assuming a purely wifi setup - one which an isp might use - might be to us use the wifi as a base carrier for ppp ie some kind of pppoe or l2tp setup - and then packet shape the underlying ppp connection

1279334
cifs	smb
so an evident bottleneck is the too small block size here in gvfs but the speed tops around 1k block size and it reaches at most 63 of the cifs speed so there must be another unidentified bottleneck in the smb lib

1279346
subnet	packets
from the technical standpoint your computers on the network will use the switch layer 2 addressing - using the mac address instead of ip address to connect to the printer instead of requiring a router to translate the packets to a different subnet and forward it layer 3 addressing and any access to the printer from the outside internet can be controlled by your router and thus potential hackers can be blocked even before they see the printer

ubuntu	debian
i think ubuntu dropped 32bit last lts and debian is one of the few that still supports it because debian supports even dead dying platforms -- which 32bit x86 is.

1279546
x86	64bit
64bit x86 is de facto now and 32bit will become deprecated

1279568

in zsh you can omit the curly brackets but in bash you need them unfortunately

1279568

i am assuming i would put that option in the .opvpn file that i get from my vpn provider

1279668
hfs+	ntfs
iâ d like to wipe out the ntfs partition and format as hfs+

1279670
hfs+	ntfs
it theoretically should be safe to reformat the ntfs partition with gparted or other utility probably run from another drive such as a usb linux iso drive though it may be necessary to first mark the partition as unformatted empty space and then reformat as hfs+

1279677
switching	screens
switching back and forth between full screens and window mode is annoying because of the additional key strokes and therefore not an option for me.

1279681

there are also options for setting view to the image width or image height whether to show all full-screen or only high-resolution photos etc

1279797
x86	64bit
i ran a test-install of the 64bit version msi installer and i even set it to install to the 32-bit path you specified above no problems the correct 64bit path is c program files putty not c program files x86 putty which is the 32-bit path

safari and google-chrome open and the application is responsive but trying to load a web page gives the rainbow wheel of doom

1279804
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	webkit	gecko	firefox	safari
so then i thought maybe it was a webkit issue since safari and google-chrome both use webkit as the rendering engine whereas firefox uses gecko

1279804

if i boot in safe mode google-chrome and the app store work fine whereas safari won t open at all

1279804

1279928
wan	lan
you ll also need to turn off the firewall between wan and lan on the er-x

1279928
subnet	packets
this means within the ubiquiti router software they are treated as a single interface called switch0 and the ports will act as if they all belonged to the same external switch - switched packets that travel within the same subnet will not even be seen by the router s cpu

1279928
subnet	packets
the router will automatically route packets between the different subnet assuming it is assigned as the default gateway for each device which its dhcp server will do by default

1279938
folder	dir	folder	directory
if docs folder exist then it will change the directory then list contents of docs using dir command

1279938
folder	dir	folder	directory
however if docs folder doesn t exist then it will give an error but still dir will run to list the contents of current directory

1279938
folder	directory
so you can interpret the command like - if folder docs exists change the current directory and then list it s contents

i put the thing together and try to start it up only to find that the board is getting stuck on post code 1e which is strange as i cannot find what this means anywhere

1280450
versioning	upgrade
either a the application to detect upgrade is misdetecting the need for an upgrade and a2 the update application isn t detecting that it s not required or b an actual upgrade is required despite apparently matching versioning strings but is failing without giving me any insight into the cause

1280450
versioning	upgrade
what are my diagnostics steps to work out why my machine keeps wanting to upgrade bios 1.2.3 to versioning 1.2.3

1280484
x86	64bit
if your system is a 32bit then 4gb of ram is the useful limit of ram you can utilize there are exceptions such as the thinkpad x200 advertised as x86 but a 64bit cpu in reality

1280489
versioning	upgrade
if your versioning doesn t have the search box you should probably upgrade you could try an extension to manage cookies there appears to be dozens that change frequently so a search checking current reviews trying out some might be another solution

i then reformatted the ubuntu partition and installed mint onto it

i don t use the ethernet port as i have a wifi wireless adaptor

if you don t care about the names in each folder move the files to the target folder renaming them after their md5 hash

1280737
windows	winpe
there is also a third approach to bypass the uefi boot issue by booting into some other environment winpe or even another version of windows that is already installed and running in uefi where windows 7 installation to uefi can be initiated without having to boot the installation media itself

1280739

h.264	h.265
is h.264 h.265 a suitable format for that use case

1280880

i hope that by using h.264 h.265 in combination with the nvidia video codec sdk i can at least lower the hardware and bandwidth usage

1280900
apache	nginx
basically you would set up a web server on your pi or elsewhere such as apache or nginx to listen on port 80 http and have special entries to point to your local service ip ports

1280900
apache	nginx
regardless of choice you should be able to find some tutorials to help you set up either apache or nginx in this capacity for the pi

windows	winpe
booting to winpe would only allow you to format the machine and reinstall windows 10

1281083
installation	upgrade	windows	winpe
booting to winpe does not allow nor has it ever allowed you to upgrade an existing windows installation

1281102
folder	directory
this set of commands should put all files in a directory into the top-level directory - so all files under folder 1 will be put directly into folder 1 and all files under folder 4 will be put directly into folder 4

1281106
mdadm	btrfs
synology uses btrfs and looking at their knowledgebase it looks like they are using mdadm for raid

1281106
mdadm	btrfs
as deltic mentions in their answer btrfs wouldn t know about the raid setup and wouldn t be able to recover from it and i encourage people to follow the links in his comments to about what mdadm is and what it isn t but i believe that you should be able to use mdadm raid 5 or 6 to be able to rebuild after a drive failure

1281112
versioning	upgrade
if you are using an older versioning of debian and you re not willing to upgrade you will have to find a way to install a later versioning of libnss3 yourself

1281174
hive	hdfs
considering that you re doing big data processing and how many years it is after this question was originally asked it s also probably just as easy to copy this 30gb file to hdfs or rather put keep the data there originally and use apache hive to select format the data as desired

1281223
chown	sudo
you can fix it with chown if you have sudo access etc.

1281226
chown	chmod
pmount will not alter the mounted filesystem s permissions - thus you ll need to use chown chmod or similar approach as root to change the owner group permissions of the root or other relevant point of the filesystem

despite i get a could not create keychain item the password is saved as long as i don t close the terminal tab where i put those commands

is there any parameter or argument for passing mode portrait or landscape to the headless-chromium on the command line so that we can print any web page accordingly in either portrait or landscape mode

flattening the spf record to include less dns lookups and substituting them for ips flattening is a way to get around the limit

dpkg	apt
my ui is written in python and thus i m using python-apt to provide the interface for me to control and get status from the apt and dpkg processes

1281319

the only problem is that using airmon-ng commands need to put the wireless interface on your device into monitor mode as a result of which you will get disconnected to any wireless network but the rest of all works perfect for what you need

unfortunately you cannot upgrade a 32-bit versioning of windows to a 64-bit versioning of windows due to how significantly different the 64-bit versioning of windows works from the 32-bit versioning

1284893
vmware	virtualbox
typically vmware or virtualbox are used for this purpose

1284917
switching	screens	mouse	keyboard
based on daniel_andersson s answer this is the script i have bound to my keyboard shortcuts to raise firefox window and bring the mouse over it because i ll easily forget on which screens it was before switching

1284947
range	max
i ve got a laptop with gtx 1060 that regularly runs in the 70 degree celsius range when gaming and even that doesn t cap out the fans at max speed based on some rough math i ve done they should cap out when the gpu s at around 80 degrees celsius so you should be just fine running at 70-71 degrees constantly

1284959
disk	ram
to sums up looks like prefetched cached paged ram reclaiming takes too long so i live in constant fear that the disk makes insane disk readings to the point that the pc hangs and forces me to reboot

1284961
put	get
furthermore you can use the get-netconnectionprofile to get the nic alias names and index numbers to put into the example batch script below for your needs and or systems

1284997
google-chrome	firefox
using the search â œsineâ in both firefox and google-chrome gives me the following difference in results

wan	lan
should i connect dlink on wan port instead of lan port

1285205
udp	rtp
the client is running a software called qgroundcontroll which listens for an rtp stream on a local udp port usually 5000

1285205
udp	rtp
it seems like neither avconv nor ffmpeg is able to detect or connect to an rtp stream using -i udp adress port

1285222
folder	directory
an option could be to do a custom scan this way if you have a directory folder that will give a false positive will be excluded

1285224
wan	subnet
also the default gateway and ip address of the wan connection is the same and subnet mask is 255.255.255.255

1285240
switching	screens
important you will need to ensure the location and task name full path is specified with the tn switching of the schtasks commands to point to the correct task and path location the per hierarchical structure where you saved each with task scheduler â see below to screens shots to further clarify

1285245
post	get
why not post a link to the cable you are looking at so we can get a clearer picture

1285332
rss	feed
i found the rss feed source always is using http protocol

1285332
rss	feed
is rss feed support https protocol

1285332
rss	feed
when i feed a rss source i may write the link

1285346
vmware	virtualbox
i m using vbox because it was a virtualbox virtual machine you need to change it to vmware if you are using vmware

1285382
udp	tcp
it accepts 4 ranges of ports that you can select between udp tcp and both

1285430
wan	lan
instead traffic is filtered by a machine on the network often the outside node the one linking the local lan network where your computer is to the internet wan in your case the web where facebook or google s servers are installed

1285434
ethernet	wireless
to do this i m going to use a wireless to ethernet bridge vs connecting directly to the wireless on the system since it seems more reliable

1285435
ssd	sata
it has a 512 gb crucial mx100 2.5 sata ssd

1285435
ssd	sata
i do not have a spare 2.5 sata ssd to test with

1285508
rss	feed
nevertheless rss feed as kind of data can be served either with http or with https or both depending on the server settings

1285521
versioning	upgrade
therefore since it is easier to upgrade than to try to downgrade the earlier discs are actually more valuable in case you ever want to check out or otherwise use an older versioning

1285531
centos	linux
would like wget to give as result files named in order file1.txt file2.txt file3.txt and so on instead of being saved with their original names while using linux centos 6 64

1285545
wan	lan
then take the cable that is currently running from the actiontec to the nighthawk s wan port and move it to a lan port

1285556
sudo	passwd	sudoers	passwd
that won t be true if you applicably use nopasswd in etc sudoers which is a technique that many people will shun as also being insecure. however when you run sudo and provide a passwd sudo will remember the success for a period of time

1285556
sudo	passwd
so if you ran sudo echo hi typed in your passwd and then ran the script the script would not sudo

1285573
sudo	passwd
once you are logged in test that the sudo works without a passwd to shut down the system

1285585
hide	show
if your data has number formats which are more detailed like # ##0.00 to show two digits and a thousands separator you can hide zero labels with number format like this

1285586
lan	localhost
google searching and checking stackoverflow superuser have been unsuccessful as they all describe situations where the port is bound to the lan ip not localhost

1285588
installation	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
my windows 10 pro installation was automatically upgrade to windows 10 pro versioning 1709 recently and it s since then that my nvidia geforce 9200 on-board graphics card fails with the message

also prior to this upgrade to windows 10 versioning 1709 whatever versioning of windows 10 i had earlier was running just fine

1285596
ubuntu	linux
i have already successfully mounted the hard drive on ubuntu 15.10 so i think it should be generally possible to do this on linux

1285620
vpn	lan
vpn server to connect to the lan

1285621
cpu	processors
it s probably just checking the family and stepping ids from the processors against an internal list of supported cpu types

1285649
vlookup	sumifs
yes vlookup can do this bringing you the single value you need if you need a sum use sumifs

1285672
ssd	sata
be sure to use a new sata standard and usb 3.0 port to match your ssd

1285672
ssd	sata
sata adapters can have conversion problems for optical drives but i am not sure for ssd hdd

1285718
ssd	sata
the 270mib sec was archieved using a fast ssd and using the sata controller build into the ich9 ich10 chipsets

1285725
rss	feed
i cannot find a formal specification of rss 1.0 or 0.9x that define how many channel elements a feed may contain

1285728
stdout	stderr
just print the same message once to stdout and once to stderr and you have your tee .

1285729
filesystems	ntfs
the filesystems was ntfs and the size was between 250 and 500 gb

1285754

afaiu it both windows 10 and any gnu linux say debian can live each happily with each other

1285826
ubuntu	debian
i recently installed a new debian os replacing my old ubuntu and kept the same home directory

1285828
vpn	lan
i tried connecting on my laptop using the vpn virtual network at the moment i am not able to access my desktop and connect via lan

1285835
ubuntu	debian
most likely the user id for your regular user in the debian installation is not the same as your user id for your regular user in the previous ubuntu installation

1285836
range	min	range	max	min	max
to the min and max values currently in the range

1285855
mouse	keyboard
with only two open windows alt-tab pgdn alt-tab would be a somewhat workable keyboard alternative for your mouse actions

1285927
google-chrome	firefox
web browsers firefox google-chrome already do not allow access to any recording devices both video and audio without explicit authorisation

1285961
google-chrome	firefox
i am very sorry to say that but firefox is getting really annoying i ve installed the last version of firefox quantum now that i want to remove it because i made my google-chrome browser the default browser but firefox still opens whenever i click on a link

1285968
ssd	sata
whenever i plug in only one ssd it is found regardless of which drive it is the power connector and the sata port

1286029
portrait	landscape
that absolute width is applied in the subsequent sections so if the first section in the chain is portrait the landscape section uses less than the page width

1286029
portrait	landscape
and if the first section in the chain is landscape the table exceeds the page width in portrait sections

1286048
init.d	pid
the squid service was installed under etc init.d squid and i checked if the pid file under var run squid.pid exists

1286063
openvpn	iptables
ok so im new to all this i setup a protocol called shadowsocks using an auto-setup script because openvpn is now blocked in my country and i used a program called sstap to connect and for browsing it s perfectly fine however in most games i fail to connect or have a strict nat this is telling me there s something wrong with the firewall of the vps it s an normal ovh server not a game one with no hardware firewall i tried to stop firewalld and iptables but they were not loaded as shown in this picture what can i do to fix this or open ports

1286086
ssl	https
i have full access to the devices to install my proxy s root certificate on the device and add it as trusted as to avoid causing ssl verification errors in both safari and in general https requests made in apps

1286093
tunnel	vpn
i also created a vpn local group i connect to it with a vpn client and i can see the 192.168.100.0 but when i am at local pc it should see the 192.168.100.0 without vpn client since i have created the tunnel

1286115
scatter	graphing
next create a blank scatter or line graphing with no data selected choose scatter or line from the graphing menu

1286127
ssd	sata
if it were the sata controller then one would think the ssd would be having problems too unless that s m.2 nvme which doesn t use sata

1286167
passwd	visudo
so by using su and entering the root passwd i used visudo as root

1286167
sudoers	visudo
i have a line visudo reports no errors my user is in group sudo but i still get myname is not in the sudoers file

1286172
subnet	packets
broadcast packets on all subnet will still be broadcast at link-layer and will reach all other subnet on the same link

1286176
matplotlib	scipy
so the simple version of this question is that i ve been trying for several days to get a python 3.4 environment with the following packages installed on a raspberry pi zero jessie image opencv numpy scipy matplotlib tqdm pywavelets pyqtgraph pyside peakutils

1286234
config	ini
in the uwsgi docs it says i can serve it with adding this config to my ini file

1286236
udp	tcp
it runs ufw for firewall and allows tcp udp over port 53

1286238
ubuntu	centos
nginx is very flexible and very nice when you use it with uwsgi so i think your best choice is uwsgi and nginx for serving django this is the for ubuntu setup tutorial and this is for centos 7

1286250
mouse	keyboard
to pair them both you have to unplug the mouse usb receiver then the keyboard receiver then on the mouse hold in turn left button then right button then middle button and keep holding all 3 until the mouse led lights up on top while the led is lit up insert the keyboard usb reciever and the mouse will pair to it and thats it both on the same dongle

1286269
put	get
but say i wanted to get a second computer just to mess around with try risky things potentially even destroy- so that i don t want to put sensitive data on it

1286275
docx	xlsx
check the box you should immediately see docx xlsx and other file types appear

1286292
apache	nginx
you would set up a web server such as apache or nginx or another choice on your local pc and then create at least one corresponding virtual host for the outdated domain s

1286301
wan	lan
your dd-wrt router may have stopped its nat service added its wan interface to the bridge that normally concentrates lan and wi-fi interfaces

1286314
apache	nginx
i m using nginx as a reverse proxy for apache n is processing non-php statics a is for php obviously

1286325
google-chrome	firefox	opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome
at first i thought this was a bug in google-chrome but opera edge and firefox also do the same thing so i assume that the url is perfectly valid

1286367
disk	ram
i know that torrenting can harm your ssd so i decided to create a ram disk where i temporary store my torrents until they are finished

1286367
disk	ram
eventually even the ram disk may be swapped to the ssd and then i will have won nothing maybe just that i will somehow batch writes to ssd

1286370
folder	directory
when using the following batch command all the files get deleted including those located in sub directory but it leaves the folder

1286386
folder	dir
recent releases of cloud sdk for windows come with prepackaged putty executables dir bin sdk folder

1286420
solaris	bsd
for example ufs solaris bsd would overwrite the existing blocks on disk and allocate more if necessary

1286427
disk	ram
since you intend to copy from the ram disk to the ssd anyway i don t see any gain here

1286427
disk	ram
also you mentioned swapping is happening more often since you have starved your system of ram with your ram disk

1286427
disk	ram
so depending very much on the size of your available ram the size of your ram disk and the size of your torrents - even in the best case you have very little to gain here - in all likelihood you ll slow down your system because it has to swap more often which will also unnecessarily increase writes on the ssd

1286451
subtract	add
so basically i want to subtract every cell a-b and add every columns

1286454
mouse	keyboard
starting a few weeks ago at seemingly random intervals 3 of 5 pcs will lag at the same time for a few seconds to the extent where mouse and keyboard input is delayed and voip calls are dropped

1286487
folder	directory
i often cd every time i start terminal to only a couple of directory which have spaces in them and i am looking for an easier way to do this than either typing the whole path and escaping the spaces or finding the right folder in finder typing cd and dragging the folder from finder into terminal

1286499
cpu	processors
however small this may be with an application than managed to use 100 cpu over any number of cores and processors enabling ht resulted in a roughly 2-3 drop in performance

1286509
put	get
put that in a1 and copy down till you get blanks

1286529
hide	show
choose view show hide navigation panes layers

1286529
hide	show
use the layers panel to examine layers and show or hide

1286530
mouse	keyboard
mouse keyboard and or logitech unifying receiver sometimes all for testing

1286530
mouse	keyboard
2 rear low power enhanced for mouse keyboard

1286530
mouse	keyboard
i ve also tried two different logitech unifying receivers and in different ports.â oddly seems that one of the devices either the keyboard or mouse suffers debilitating lag as soon as i connect that second usb 3.0 disk enclosure depending on the port used for the unifying receiver

1286530
mouse	keyboard
seems to only affect wireless mouse and keyboard

1286537
debian	linux
and this answer from unix linux mentions how debian handles shell configs with links that may help

1286538
bash	zsh
as for why path is set in .profile as a recommended way i believe that user s defined path should be set right when he she logins and login can be bash zsh or gui or somewhat else

1286538
vim	emacs
users can set editor as vim in .profile in non-x but change it to emacs in .xinitrc in x

1286538
bash	zsh
interactive settings for bash are places in .bashrc and interactive settings for zsh are placed in .zshrc

1286580
hide	show
update i can disable it if i plug a mouse in and move it up and down on the top of the screen making the icon show and hide right while its booting then the touch to hold or swipe from the top doesnt make it appear

1286597
debian	linux
i had the exact same problem on two servers a linux running debian stretch and on a nas synology ds715

1286648
vim	atom-editor
but if you want to jump to the middle of the sentence in atom-editor there is vim-mode-plus which transform your atom-editor into vim editor and then you can use all vim shortcuts to move around your text

1286655
opera	google-chrome
my system used to freeze up with google-chrome chromium and opera

1286658
debian	linux
while this methods works on debian derivative gnu linux systems it is advisable to stick with the official kali repositories for the most part

1286706
switching	screens
now it always shows a part of the screens so i have to switching to only this pc in the project windows+p menu

1286717
bluetooth	usb
all my usb ports 3.0 along with my integrated bluetooth used to work perfectly on my hp elitebook 840 g3 running linux mint 18

1286717
mouse	keyboard
there is no power in them and they don t recognize anything keyboard mouse etc.

1286717
mouse	keyboard
the weirdest thing is that it still works in the bios keyboard + mouse but once the os loads usb ports drop dead

1286717
ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	linux
booting on live usb key ubuntu 16.04 ubuntu 17.10 linux mint 18.3

1286717
bluetooth	usb
the issue is just about usb and bluetooth

1286719
installation	upgrade
if it cannot resolve the issue using the official iso file to perform an in-place upgrade installation

1286743
robocopy	xcopy
apparently robocopy requires different directory file references than xcopy

1286825
vpn	lan
using your current vpn settings all you need to do to is enable static routes in the lan advanced settings section on the route subtab

1286825
switching	tun
one side effect i ve noticed in making the switching from tap to tun is that host name lookups no longer work however this isn t a deal breaker by any means since the devices i wish to access have static ips

1286859
dmz	was
there was a setting for dmz in my router although i am not very sure about what it does i provided the private ip of my host machine there

1286864
daemons	systemd
after debian systemd upgrade one of my services mpd - music player daemons stopped working - saying that it cannot access the folder with the music

1286893
mouse	keyboard
in general unless you re dealing with 15k rpm enterprise hard drives your fans are going to be noisier than your hard disk if you have no fans though and have a power supply that doesn t make any noise a lot of cheap ones hum it might make the system silent other than the keyboard and mouse

1286901
versioning	upgrade
my only guess is that all of the upgrade left some sort of garbage behind maybe copies of earlier windows versioning or something

1286960
google-chrome	firefox
we have two different pcs running google-chrome 63 firefox 57 and windows 10 fall creators update

1286960
google-chrome	firefox
this behavior is essentially identical in firefox and google-chrome leading me to wonder if this is some os-level setting

1286981
filesystems	xfs
i m trying to use scientific linux s installer but it persists in saying that sda may not have enough space for grub2 to embed core.img when using the xfs filesystems on partition

1286981
centos	linux	ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	linux
should i give up on scientific linux and try centos or fedora or sigh if i absolutely have to ubuntu

1286982
hex	binary
you can use the xattr -p attribute filename command to view the extended attributes for files but it only dumps hex to stdout so you ll need to use a tool like xxd -r -p to convert the hex dump back into a binary plist and then you can use plutil -p to dump the plist

1287003
asterisk	pbx
in most cases asterisk pbx is running by asterisk user and running path can be virtualy anything

1287009
versioning	upgrade
all minor versioning upgrade 3.4.x won t contain new features

1287018
filesystems	ntfs
format windows 10 64-bit into a thumb drive using rufus with partition scheme and target system type set as mbr partition scheme for bios or uefi-csm and filesystems set as ntfs

1287018
installation	upgrade
chose custom installation instead of upgrade

1287023
wan	lan
the default settings in etc config firewall forward everything from lan to wan which results in device 1 being able to ping device 2

1287029
google-chrome	firefox
this switch seems to fail on google-chrome and firefox for 30 to 60 seconds and then reverts to the auto selected one wifi or ethernet

1287117
versioning	upgrade
how do i tell chocolatey to upgrade to the latest versioning of git

1287179
rtsp	rtmp
i want to stream video with ffmpeg and with an authentification like rtsp or rtmp do as well ex but with a secured protocol like rtmp or rtmpts or https badly i didn t find any way to do it properly

1287182

on this link it shows 6 sata connector for odd tbu which looks like a regular sata connector can i use this one for a ssd

1289071

is it possible to connect an external hard disk drive into a vps folder say drive using linux centos 6-64 vps

1289251
filesystems	ntfs
yes but if you tried ntfs in rufus you would have seen that it does allow you to use that filesystems even for gpt uefi boot in which case the issue about the 4gb install.wim goes away

1289251
filesystems	ntfs
plus rufus does have logic to detect the presence of a 4gb file in an iso and select ntfs by default as the filesystems when that is the case

1289251
filesystems	ntfs
the only thing the uefi specs say is that at the very least fat32 should be supported for boot but that doesn t preclude other filesystems from also being bootable or utilities such as rufus to work around the possibility that the uefi firmware s default only includes support for fat32 and expand on the capabilities of that firmware by adding runtime support for ntfs boot if that is missing

i ve never had a problem of this type with a btrfs filesystems on a hdd but i ve had the same on my ssd

1290104
filesystems	btrfs
about the confusing part btrfs as a filesystems can enlarge or shrink itself inside a device or devices assigned to it

1290109
filesystems	btrfs
well your output from btrfs filesystems df shows the following

1290109
filesystems	btrfs
in your case you have 446.32gb of space allocated to data chunks almost the whole disk based on regular df and btrfs filesystems show output but only 133.29gb of that space is actually in use

1290110
folder	directory
the basic process is you make an empty directory you run mklink with the empty folder as the link and the target being the place to actually store the data

1290110
put	get
once done you can copy move delete using the link directory and they will actually get put in the target directory

1290110
folder	directory
for existing directory you would need to mirror-copy the directory to the target location using robocopy confirm the copy and then empty the source folder

if a server is setup to allow 192.168.1.0 24 lan and then 172.16.0.0 16 some other lan or even internet facing ips at another time no 3rd party vpn service is going to help

also note that some common mac-specific graphics image file formats for that era stored important information in the â œresource forkâ which is another place the mac hfs filesystems could store some of a fileâ s data that non-mac filesystems donâ t really have

1290432
vpn	lan
all computers in the lan have fixed ip with the subnet mask 255.255.254.0 the network here also have internet access but has a very strict firewall the motive i want to route connections through vpn all computers and my laptop are in the same subnet my computer is also connected to a wireless network

but however i decided to write a custom function for my shell which happens to be fish-shell however i m sure both bash and zsh both support functions as well

1290466
folder	dir
then i would open up a command prompt shell in that folder and run the dir command

1290531

ubuntu	linux
after ubuntu installation i lost my resolution chooser there is only two option and both doesnot fit my screen.then i install the correct version linux 384.111 or 340.106 version drivers and they didn t work either perhaps after the proprietary use of the graphic card my ubuntu does not open

1290736
ssd	sata
after unplugging the sata cable of the ssd i installed windows 10 uefi on the 2nd hd so if my ssd fails i still have a functioning system i can use in the mean time

1290747
mouse	keyboard
this means that keyboard and mouse interaction is disabled so you need to run any photoshop job that you have in a real-world window disable any pop-ups and only then will you be able to have a successful session

1290749
tunnel	vpn
next i configured a vpn tunnel for that ip address

1290755
switching	screens
as soon as i kill hcontrol.exe everything goes back to normal except i lose important hotkey functionality such as keyboard back-light screens on off switching fn shortcuts etc.

1290837
ubuntu	debian
you can get more debug information from ssh with the -v option as well as looking in the ssh server log for debian ubuntu this is var log auth.log

1290839
mouse	keyboard
now when booting windows 7 it doesn t recognize my mouse nor my keyboard

1290839
mouse	keyboard
windows cd does not recognize mouse or keyboard either

1290839
mouse	keyboard
mouse and keyboard do work with a ubuntu live cd 16.04 lts

1290849
folder	directory
the set command is instructing the applescript to use the value of the expression folder document of home which evaluates to a location reference on the hard drive and assign it to the target property of the front finder window which controls which directory is shown in the window

1290849
folder	directory
this seems like an unlikely desired outcome as applying all of these actions to a single finder window means that the preceding lines are somewhat superfluous there would be no need to open the home folder and set its properties toolbar visible sidebar width current view and bounds only then to change directory and set all of these properties to new values

1290866
google-chrome	firefox
problem while google-chrome or firefox are left open they can easily consume gigabytes of internet data every day if you have tabs open which display often-updated auto-refreshed data

1290879
mouse	keyboard
before the upgrade i could use keyboard shortcuts and largely avoid the mouse switching back to the host when needed with alt+f2

1290892
google-chrome	firefox
it happens in firefox google-chrome both

1290895
installation	upgrade
it looks like you started an upgrade and booted from installation media

1290897
screens	tablet
whenever i use both screens in extended mode the tablet mode button is grayed out

1290897

it would be great to have that whenever i click the tablet mode button the non touch screens becomes blank and i use my touch-screen monitor in tablet mode

1290909

esx in vmware esx server and gsx in vmware gsx server did not officially stand for anything

that looks for coreutils basic commands cp mv dd tar gzip gunzip

1290948
rsa	aes
is there a way to use the raw ciphers such as say aes rsa like you would if you did the encryption signing in say pycrypto

1290950
installation	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
it seems to me that this problem only occurs in a new fresh installation because all the other pcs that has upgrade from an earlier versioning of chrome to 64.0.3282.119 seems to work just fine

1291033

to get the command to run at startup i edited the .bashrc file in home etc and put my command at the very end after all the prewritten code sudo python home usr pymodbus examples common synchronous_client.py

1291033
sudo	passwd	passwd	visudo
finally to bypass the need to type the sudo passwd when i wanted to run the script i ran the command sudo visudo and put the following line at the very end of the file

1291051
mouse	keyboard
i did a few tests and made sure not moving the pc mouse or keyboard accidentally - so these are not responsible for waking up the computer it s clearly due to other separate devices

1291055
folder	directory
1 you want to find all files starting with mysql- in specific folder directory and it s subtree

1291063
move	drag
when i try using gparted or kde-partitionmanager to expand the luks partition into this free space i am unable to drag it to the left in gparted it appears the extended partition has them both separated in individual cells only able to move it to the right

1291096
mouse	keyboard
he commutes a lot for work and his ideal situation is that when he is in the office he can close his laptop and put it on a dock essentially turning it into a desktop with an external keyboard mouse and monitor

1291101
debian	linux
let s compare debian stable as a candidate for point releases and arch linux as a candidate for rolling releases

1291102
ubuntu	linux
now install the linux subsystem again and use ubuntu

1291133
folder	directory
double click on core folder extract all those files in any directory in any partition

1291193
google-chrome	safari
the application loads on safari but gives a err_connection_refused on google-chrome

1291229
tunnel	vpn
so to be clear i want devices like my phone that are connected to the wifi of the raspberry pi to get access to the internet through the vpn tunnel and throught the gateway of the server making the rapsberry a sort of transparent vpn gadget

1291232
udp	tcp
add the protocol tcp or udp and the port number into the next window and click next

1291238
tunnel	vpn
than when the raspi acts as a default gateway for the mobile devices it is just a matter of redirecting all traffic through the vpn tunnel for the raspi of course except the public ip of the vpn server

1291244
fink	homebrew	fink	macports	macports	homebrew
on older macs you could perhaps install openssl via a ports system fink homebrew macports

1291249
hide	show
though it s not show even if you have set not to hide extensions in explorer all link files have the extension .lnk

1291325
screens	tablet
note that while it s not always cost effective even devices with non replaceable batteries can have their batteries replaced - it s just a lot harder to fo exactly how hard depends on the device but generally easier to do in laptops then tablet and in non apple devices tablet and cellphones and apple devices sometimes require the screens to be removed using heat making the process risky and hard - especially waterproof ones most laptops have screws and a case which can be pried open

1291336
google-chrome	firefox
i m concerned about the barcodes specifically as they appear has wavy lines in google-chrome and firefox

1291342
jobs	cron
or does it have nothing to do with my restart and the cron jobs meaning i ll just have to manually delete the unwanted sadd sardd logs

1291355
mouse	keyboard
the contents of var log xorg.0.log show mouse and keyboard disabled

1291376

i am trying to create a universal bios efi bootable usb hdd that can provide me with portable 32-bit 64-bit â windows to goâ environments together with a 64-bit ubuntu-based distro and 64-bit debian-based distro of linux

1291465
tunnel	vpn
using a vpn or other tunnel service to hide your external ip - many free tunnel services exist however be sure of the reputation of any service you use as they can see all your internet traffic

1291475

how do i upgrade a vm copy of windows 10 to versioning 1703 redstone 2 - creators update instead of to versioning 1709 redstone 3 - fall creators update

1291527

i have not been able to find the redistributable update and the update tools explicitly want to upgrade to the latest versioning

1291533

does anyone know of a configuration for emacs and for vim to accomplish this

1291546
ip-address	lan	vpn	lan
i was very glad to find out that this fixes the issue completely as i am now able to access the server on port 80 from my lan and port 80 using my external ip-address since it forwards this to port 8090 which contains the no vpn rules

1291547
google-chrome	firefox	opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome
regarding the trailing slash this is required for local domains by current versions of google-chrome firefox and opera though localhost shouldn t need this treatment

1291557

it happens on different webbrowsers google-chrome internet explorer firefox

1291564
bluetooth	usb
i know it is possible to tether my internet connection through usb or bluetooth to my phone but it is a hassle to enable this every time the adsl internet at home is down

1291566
mouse	trackpad	mouse	keyboard
i currently have a laptop with both a built in pair of a keyboard and trackpad as well as a keyboard and mouse attached via usb

1291566
mouse	keyboard
if i type move my external keyboard mouse the cursor in ms word should move type

1291566
mouse	keyboard
if i do the same on my built-in pair of keyboard mouse the cursor in firefox should move type

1291585
bibtex	latex
you will want this anyway as it runs latex the required number of times and runs biber bibtex as needed until it builds the pdf correctly

1291594
switching	screens
i want to have this take up as little screens real estate as possible and so i m wondering if there s a way to toggle the tab bar using a shortcut because while i would not like this particular document to show the tab bar when i switching to my second desktop i have another document that i keep open all the time using notepad++ and when using it i do want to see the tab bar

1291602
mouse	keyboard
i want to create an equation like what i have below purely from the keyboard not using the mouse and equation editor ui which is much slower than latex

1291656
debian	linux	ssl	https
i encountered the git clone error on a small debian distro voyage linux and it was because the standard root cas weren t installed meaning that git and even simple things like curl couldn t verify the ssl certificates of https sites

1291671
bluetooth	usb
wifi cards with bluetooth still have their bluetooth component interface with the host system via usb

1291690

the only usb devices plugged in are a mouse keyboard and brother printer mfc-j835dw

1291806
bash	zsh
add this alias to your bash zsh profile

1291823
temp	tmp
note that temp can be any folder but tmp and temp often exist on windows already

1291834
wan	lan
pfsense has some default rules for 1 wan + 1 lan to permit all egress from lan but any opt interfaces you add come with a default deny rule

1291834
proxmox	dedicated
unless you need this all in one box for a home setup i d want a dedicated box for the pfsense firewall rather than exposing a proxmox physical interface to the internet

1291834
dmz	was
i have a debian box sitting in a datacenter running kvm qemu with pfsense on a vm running openvpn and a few lan and dmz vms basically it was a client s office lan and they got small enough they closed their brick and mortar and now everyone works from home

1291854
opensuse	linux
after applying meltdown and specter fix for linux my opensuse leap 42.3 server began to reboot unreasonably

1291855
google-chrome	firefox
is it possible to achieve this on a modern desktop browser such as google-chrome or firefox in desktop windows 7 without touch input

1291866
bluetooth	usb
here s a partial solution wmic path win32_pnpentity where caption like bluetooth and deviceid like usb call disable certainly makes the bluetooth on off switch disappear and device manager reports this device is disabled

1291892
wan	lan
i use a pretty simple setup all my vm s should have access to lan and wan

1291894
wan	lan
i didn t even think about it as i never use the wifi i got it for the bluetooth but as soon as i switched it on the newly created external nic i had lan and wan access

1291925
disk	ram
the pool is deduped worth it 4x saving 12tb size on disk and the system has plenty of ram 128gb ecc and fast xeon

1291925
disk	ram
memory is plenty adequate - zdb shows the pool has a total of 121m blocks 544 bytes each on disk 175 bytes each in ram so the entire ddt is only about 20.3 gb about 1.7 gb per tb of data

1291948
stdout	stderr
thus stderr messages get written immediately while the printf calls to stdout will show up...well it depends

1291983
disk	ram
old pc s had firmware that duplicated the functionality of ibm s bios firmware initially designed in the 1980 s for use with pseudo 16-bit cpus with less than 1mb ram and eventually with hard disk which were initially about 5 mb in capacity

1291985
versioning	upgrade
when i upgrade to the latest windows 10 versioning 1803 insider preview update my mic stopped working

1291995
ubuntu	linux
you can possibly also run this from an ubuntu live cd or any linux distro specialized in repairs for instance systemrescuecd

1292002
flac	opus	flac	ogg	opus	ogg
audioshell is a free shell extension for ogg and also includes other formats like opus flac and ape tags

1292038
elf	coff
the reasons are primarily historical and oses tend to stick with their existing native or default format unless there is compelling reason to switch as has happened from the dos mz format to pe in nt 3.1 and from a.out to elf in linux 1.2 and from coff to elf in various unixes over the years

1292091
pop-up	dialog
on the other computer when you access the share it will still pop-up a username password dialog though so technically that is a share protected by a password

1292098
google-chrome	firefox
in that case at least for firefox and google-chrome view the details of the certificate that is being used and choose to save it as a file

1292102
opera	google-chrome
in the worst case scenario you can sync your google-chrome on android with a google-chrome on the desktop and then sync that desktop google-chrome with your desktop opera else you d have to choose between sticking to a single browser on all platforms or giving up synchronization between them

1292143
disk	ram
additionally if there is unused ram then the kernel can use that to cache parts of disk

1292143
disk	ram
if i do end up reading it out of linux s cache the speed i achieve is typically close to the speed of ram and the disk is untouched if you know how to use iostat you will notice that it not reporting any much disk i o when this occurring

1292152
versioning	upgrade
i upgrade my git and my conemu to their latest versioning this weekend

1292152

the issue is that udp traffic the private cloud is limited to rdp and tcp connections

1292263
udp	tcp	tunnel	packets
can i tunnel the udp traffic over a tcp connection and then have the data appear as local udp packets on the client

1292308

that made the psu send more current to the sata output for the 6 risers through molex cable and the ssd fried during this and problably sent much current into my mb that friend its sata circuit as well

1292486
subnet	vlan
but if you do configure multiple vlans linux bsd are capable of this then it would make the tagging decision exactly the same way as a router it would see each configured vlan as a virtual ethernet port with its own subnet and routes

1292512
mouse	keyboard
then if screens are woken back or if screensaver is closed or at least if any keyboard key is presssed then re-enable the mouse

1292549
multiplying	subtract
subtract those will give the number of days between the two datetimes and multiplying by 24 gives the number of hours

1292570
filesystems	ntfs
the problem is ubuntu can read the ntfs filesystems but windows does not natively read the ext4 filesystems

1292570
ubuntu	linux
or you can boot into ubuntu and use something like gparted to resize the linux partition leaving space for a ntfs partition

1292571
versioning	upgrade
it took the program more than a day to upgrade to the latest versioning

1292595
rpm	yum
i can install the ntp rpm as the following by yum

1292610
sudo	passwd
try sudo -i with john passwd instead of su

1292620
tunnel	vpn
traffic goes through the tunnel as expected - external ip is the public ip of vpn server

1292627
folder	directory
this folder might be different if you install one of the other linux distros but all will be under the appdatap directory

1292656
versioning	upgrade
i do not want to delete any previous versioning as some servers will never upgrade and python 2.7 comes in handy

1292673
button	checkbox
dr i need to be able to insert a radio button or a checkbox such that neither their insertion inclusion in the table nor their usage selection by the user will change the value or formatting of a cell but there is tracker cell which counts the total number of positive selections y radio button or checked checkbox in the column

1292673
button	checkbox
i would prefer to do this all with radio button because the interface s options may expand in the future and i want to be able to do this in complete generality but a checkbox would also work if need be

1292695
google-chrome	firefox
nope tried to download it from any browser google-chrome firefox edge with or without each browser s private browsing mode enabled all fail shortly into the download

1292716
hash	md5	pbkdf2	hash	pbkdf2	md5
they use the obsolete md4 and md5 hash algorithms and do not contain anything to limit the speed of hash computation such as the way pbkdf2 requires repeating the same hash process many times to slow down brute-forcing

1292759
width	height
tried -q v and -qscale options but it s just changing the width and height of image

1292777

width	height
beware though since it is not a simple crop based on preset height width it has higher resource requirements

1294355
width	height
i suggest that what you might be seeing as header and footer gaps are rather blank areas remaining after the proportioned image is centered with the maximum width allowed to fill the page and the height being insufficient to do so

1294356

crop the image select part of it paying attention to the aspect ratio shown in irfanview to make it 0.773 1 in portrait mode or the inverse 1.29 in landscape mode

1295913
mouse	keyboard
i inserted a new model in the relevant folder inside program files microsoft mouse and keyboard center see below

1295913
mouse	keyboard
made a zip file containing all the above which you can unzip inside program files microsoft mouse and keyboard center available at

1295932
google-chrome	firefox
my only other suggestion is to rename the icons with a prefix which will auto-arrange them in the order you want them eg 01 google-chrome 02 firefox etc but note that this means that reinstallations and some updates will not remove the old icons and create new icons without the prefix

1295936
ssl	https
i recently renewed the https site certificate on the server i maintain for a cient and while installing tightened up apache ssl settings specifically supported protocols and ciphers i finally removed ssl3 etc.

1295999
put	get
bottom line - if you get a mid-high end router and put dd-wrt or similar on it and you don t need to push more then 50 megabit of traffic and can use an openvpn router it should be more then adequate

1296002
sudo	passwd
on ubuntu command prompt you could do sudo -i and enter root passwd to login as root

1296002
ubuntu	linux
my question is when must you login as this root in ubuntu or linux

1296010
sudo	passwd
there are a number of other ways available from ubuntu including sudo bin bash and enabling a root passwd and logging in as root

1296010
sudoers	passwd
there is also controls and permissions generally set up in etc sudoers or etc sudoers.d which can allow certain users to only run certain things with elevated privileges and or allow access without an additional passwd for some users

1296011
daemons	systemd
when used in tandem with syslogd the systemd log daemons sudo can log all commands to a central host as well as on the local host

1296011
sudo	passwd
when a user invokes sudo and enters their passwd they are granted a ticket for 5 minutes this timeout is configurable at compile-time

1296014
ubuntu	linux
when must you login as this root in ubuntu or linux

1296014

1296218
debian	centos
i ve gotten everything set up and the centos and debian boxes are pulling dhcp addresses from the 172.16.0.0 12 network just fine.

1296218
debian	centos
when i disable the pfsense box the following happens the centos and debian boxes which have their vnics attached to vmbr1 - the unconfigured vswitch pull an ip from 192.168.1.1.

1296218
wan	lan
can not block all wan traffic to lan interface as i need the vms on lan interface network to access 192.16

1296268
filesystems	ntfs
although i only looked at the files from linux didn t make any changes now i get a ntfs filesystems error when trying to boot into windows

1296277
disk	ram
if you want windows 10 64-bit for example you would need to have at least 2 gb of ram 20gb disk space and a processor that supports 64 bit instruction set

1296278
cpu	processors
the terms 32-bit and 64-bit refer to the way a computer s processors also called a cpu handles information

1296281
cpu	processors
if you re going to change to 64-bit windows 8.1 or windows 10 your cpu must support the cmpxchg16b instruction which is a common feature supported by all intel core 2 or later or amd phenom 64 processors so if your computer was bought or assembled in the last 10 years cpu is not something to worry about

1296281
ubuntu	linux
if you re going to run a 64-bit linux like ubuntu or fedora the requirement is much lower

1296293
dedicated	dnsmasq
therefore a dedicated dns server like dnsmasq is not what i m looking for since that would only treat requests from within the lan i guess...

1296294
apache	nginx
it s easier to do with nginx but apache can handle this too using mod_proxy

1296306
versioning	upgrade
for example each new versioning also introduced faster transfer modes and even within sdhc and sdxc there are multiple upgrade to the standard

explanation apache 2 on debian ubuntu sets the user group www-data as the owner of var www

1296525
folder	directory
since i wrapped this variable in quotes when creating the symlink the tilde did not go through bash expansion and so the resulting symlink pointing to the literal path project rather a project folder in my home directory

1296526
mtu	icmp
also make sure you don t block all icmp as this blocks mtu discovery

1296552
mouse	keyboard
i have a long password passphrase and so i often have to check if the i typed it correctly but to do this i have to move my hand from the keyboard to the mouse to click that unhide button

1296553
hide	show
inside of keepass there is a hotkey ctrl+h to show hide the password when adding editing an entry but that doesn t work on startup please feel free to correct me if you have found a direct hotkey for showing hiding the master password when entering into keepass

1296557
packets	multicast
with link-local name resolution the hosts themselves respond to multicast query packets when the host name matches the name in the query

1296577
pull	push
there are however scaling limits to this - push architectures don t scale as well as pull ones

1296592
wan	lan
the server machine has 2 interfaces named ens33 that act as wan and ens34 that act as lan

mouse	keyboard
depending on which usb port is used to plug the keyboard and the mouse both have usb connector the mouse pointer is blocked if i press control or shift buttons

1296726
mouse	keyboard
if i plug the mouse in the same usb port the same happens if i press control or shift buttons so i use to test all the possible combinations changing also the usb port of the keyboard until i find the correct combination not always is the same

1296726
mouse	keyboard
moreover if i plug my wacom tablet both mouse and keyboard stop working

1296732
filtering	grouping
without using grouping options filtering or freezing top rows is there a way to lock freeze rows example 56 137 235 aka header topics to compile at the top of the spreadsheet as your scroll down

ubuntu	linux
running ubuntu linux 16.04 connected by ethernet as 192.168.11.22 with subnet mask 24

google-chrome	safari
this question seems to be just about ios safari rather than google-chrome

1296859
wan	lan
your isp doesn t give you a static ip for your lan only wan if you need that

1296867
centos	linux
how could i translate the following cmd command to a command in linux centos 6 64

1296893
spaces	delimiter
another solution to the problems of selecting data on the basis of spaces as delimiter will be using awk

1296918
move	drag
using the mouse rest the cursor on right side of the column boundary you want to move until it becomes a resize cursor pointer double-headed arrow and then drag the boundary of the column to the required width

1296930
google-chrome	firefox	opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome
how will i be able to see the page size within the search results preferably via for google-chrome opera or firefox

1296962
switching	screens
when i switching users then back again nothing is in the right place and sometimes it swaps the windows from one screens to the other

1297052
ubuntu	linux
i ve tested it using the version of ubuntu bundled with windows 10 known as windows subsystem for linux available for free in the windows store once you have installed the fall creators update which was released in september 2017

1297072
mouse	keyboard
terminal - this is a windowed application that provides a keyboard mouse interface to the shell program

1297095
spaces	delimiter
for example many of the municipalities have names longer than one word so i can t simply use the spaces as a global delimiter

1297132
folder	directory
c a folder can show some images but empty because a hidden file is present in the directory with extension .db that will have some cache data

1297164
google-chrome	firefox	opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome
as you know there s no shortcut for this like you would have in google-chrome or opera and as of this writing early 2018 there are no straightforward ways of customizing firefox s keyboard shortcuts anymore

1297164
hide	show
for these reasons i would encourage you to voice your support and or vote for firefox bug #1328637 personal toolbar lacks a keyboard shortcut to show hide the bar on mozilla s bug tracker

1297175
google-chrome	firefox
i have tried with both latest versions firefox and google-chrome and get the same problems and although i think rdp is causing some of the issues - i am confident it is not the main cause since the python code running on the server itself also runs very slow when automating any browser based tasks

1297200
afp	smb
because there is no standard for remote usb port sharing home gateway router products that support usb disk sharing do so by mounting the disk themselves and sharing it via smb and maybe afp

1297230
opera	firefox
but you can install older versions of opera or firefox wich can still run modern website and with a little effort you can use internet as normal

1297272
rtsp	rtmp
now i have at home two stbs who cannot play the rtmp stream only rtsp

1297273
filesystems	ntfs
in ntfs filesystems there is a concept called reparse point and

1297312
folder	directory
to fix this issue you need to specify the full path of the folder you wish to use as your html root directory when starting tinyweb

1297312
folder	directory
while not explicitly mentioned in the tinyweb installing page it seems that using a relative path folder vs c tinyweb2017 folder for the root html directory causes tinyweb to form a bad path or something similar making any page that isn t labeled index.html return 403 forbidden as well as preventing direct access to all pages localhost 8002 index.html

1297313
width	height
it s very useful but no width height attributes are set and the default size is so small the sliders are hard to use

1297325
windows	wow64
so the wow64 redirection applies to it â when a 32-bit program tries to access c windows system32 it is redirected to a different directory syswow64 so that it finds 32-bit system files instead of 64-bit ones

1297344
udp	tcp
apparently the reason is udp acceleration in which se uses udp connections in addition to the tcp connections it normally uses

1297357
google-chrome	firefox
i have an issue here in my company where the browsers firefox ie google-chrome randomly closes on a few computers

1297370

vbscript	vba
from vbscript vba etc is is indeed possible to resize a window

mouse	keyboard
i m asking this because i assigned a few keys to some mouse side buttons that keep typing although i release them with my finger and i still need the repeating function on my keyboard at least for some keys like the four arrows up down left right

1297797
filtering	grouping
by setting the same policy under user configuration instead you can apply the policy to a grouping of users using security filtering including your non-administrative account

1297804
folder	directory
to use it extract the the provided zip and copy the dll into filetypes folder in paint.net s installation directory don t forget to restart paint.net

1297841
folder	directory
to replicate this behavior to work just as you describe when typing in the folder name into run desktop music etc. and pressing enter to open those up you can simply use mklink and create a directory junction or a symbolic folder link to the folder on the root of the user profile directory

1297841
folder	directory
now from run you can type in the name of the link and press enter and it ll open that folder just as it does for desktop music or any other folder or link on the root of the user profile directory

1297845
wan	lan
hosted on the servers are 3 virtual machines each all share the lan connection and only 1 is connected to the wan connection

i saved the home directory including the .ssh folder with private and public keys

1297868
width	height
for fixed width and height -

1297868
width	height
and if you want to retain aspect ratio just give height as -1 and it will automatically resize based on the width -

1297868
width	height
lets say reduce the width height yo half you can do-

1297880
hash	md5
i was thinking of making an md5 hash for all files

1297889
filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	fat
many commonly used filesystems such as fat ntfs ext2 3 4 do not ensure the integrity of the file data for example with checksums .

1297899
public	protected
but its public no password protected and i can only read the files nothing more

1297917
vpn	lan
that way your work vpn will bind to your wifi adapter and you can continue to connect to the laptop via the lan adapter

1297918
ubuntu	centos
i ve noticed that on ubuntu and friends as well as fedora centos on the other side of the camp

1297935
robocopy	xcopy
i ve tried xcopy robocopy ext

1297973
ubuntu	linux
as far i know debain ubuntu linux systems are easy to fix this part by just using apt and install required library but how to fix this issue on windows

pull	push
when i push or pull the ua s tip into the android however the flash of power indication doesn t happen at the band but it doesn t work that way on the original adapter s tip either

you can not use a modern ssd but the legacy sata based ssds

1297988
mouse	keyboard
usb keyboard mouse and flash drive all seem to work fine

disk	ram
any ram used by the cache that has not been modified since it was read from disk is considered discardable by the memory manager

1298076
wan	vlan
this is not the smart way to do it - you d actually be able to trivially get away with a single network if you can turn off dhcp on the secondary and connect them correctly - since wan s actually on a seperate vlan in many consumer routers connect the main router to a normal port on the secondary

1298087
wan	lan
this is because the old router would end up with identical ip subnetwork configurations on its wan and lan interfaces

this is suggesting to me that there s some problem forwarding packets between the subnet

1298131
clang	llvm
given that i have the latest version of clang installed as of 21 feb 2018 do i still need to install llvm 6.0 separately

1298131
clang	llvm
i m a novice but from what i gathered from the webpages for clang and llvm clang uses llvm as its backend and thus should contain llvm by default.

i get get that performance for free with a ram disk

1298204
disk	ram
taking a slightly contrary approach why am i dedicating ram in the form of a ram disk to tasks that don t require the quickest execution possible

1298204
disk	ram
... os s do there best by using caches - but their best does not imply risking dropping lots of data on the floor because we wrote it to a ram disk and the system died before it got to ssd.

1298211
ubuntu	debian
i read the article about tlds on wikipedia in conclusion it s better to use .test extension for local development and another about localhost addressing use 127.0.0.1 127.0.1.1 is a debian ubuntu standard for mapping the ip of your host_name in case that you have no network

tunnel	vpn
all of my home traffic goes through this vpn tunnel 24 7

1298234
tunnel	vpn
on occasion i would like to have some traffic bypass the vpn tunnel and use my regular un-vpn d connection

1298234
tunnel	lan	tunnel	vpn	vpn	lan
instead i thought i would set up an openvpn server instance on the router available to clients on the lan and then use policy based routing to route all traffic from that vpn subnet of connected clients directly through my internet connection bypassing the tunnel that all other internet traffic goes through

1298234
tunnel	vpn
this way clients on my home network could connect to this internal vpn and reach the internet without going through the router s vpn tunnel

1298234
tunnel	vpn
am i correct in thinking i could use source based routing through a separate routing table to bypass the router s client vpn tunnel

1298245

open source software goes a long way in building trust but unless you re a programmer you probably won t recognize suspicious spying code i trust that a larger group of programmers like most linux debian etc would spot disallow suspicious things

google-chrome	firefox
saka-key is very promising building on the ideas from vimium and cvim and supporting both firefox quantum and google-chrome

1298300
folder	directory
in addition to having cygutils.plugin in the same directory as mobaxterm.exe or mobaxterm_personal_10.5.exe in my case you may need to set your mobaxterm home directory and possibly root directory to windows folder to which you have modify access

1298300
folder	directory
you can do this in mobaxterm by going to settings- configuration- general and setting the persistent home directory and persistent root directory to the folder of your choice

1298322
vpn	lan
my home gateway ip has the same range as a dial in vpn s lan that i need to connect to

1298322
vpn	lan
when i try and connect to some of the devices on that vpn s lan my computer will try to connect to the ip on my local lan rather than the device on the vpn lan with the same ip

1298358
vpn	lan
if you give the local network priority which is likely the case for you now traffic intended for devices on the remote network is being dumped on your own lan instead of going through the vpn

1298363
vpn	lan
if i understand correctly the normal operation of a host on your network is to just use the internet with its dhcp or similarly supplied lan configuration and its default route is out through the vpn service say interface tun0

1298363
tunnel	lan	tunnel	vpn	vpn	lan
rather than turn off the vpn service for your entire network you propose to instead establish a vpn tunnel from the lan host to your linux server say tun1 with its own subnet say subnetb different from the ordinary lan host network say subneta

1298363
tunnel	vpn
you d like to have traffic from subneta be default routed through tun0 but traffic from the local vpn s subnetb to not exit via the tunnel but leave through eth0 untunnelled

1298377
puts	fflush
also know that with windows 10 you have to be careful because the default shutdown puts the ntfs disks to sleep or hibernation rather than the traditional state of being fflush unmounted or whatever it s called

1298410
mouse	keyboard
out of the blue my mouse and usb keyboard stopped working completely without any reboots

1298410
mouse	keyboard
i tried to reboot no way to fix mouse and keyboard are listed in device manager as unknown devices that do not have drivers

1298452
mouse	keyboard
randomly usb mouse and usb keyboard drivers would magically evaporate without doing any updates or restarts in the middle of typing keyboard and mouse would suddenly disappear

1298455
ubuntu	linux
i am new to the world of linux and started with ubuntu

1298455
ubuntu	linux
hence i have created a 66gb unallocated space where the linux has to be installed and also made the ubuntu to boot from usb

1298455
ubuntu	linux
please advise me on this and help me to install the ubuntu linux on the allocated space

1298460
post	put
another solution depending on the cards you want to use judging from post like this you could put them in as separate cards and use them as dedicated cards or physx card

1298516
ssd	sata
when there is only one ssd disk at sata or caddy hibernation works fine

1298518
tunnel	vpn
tunnel mode is used for ipsec-encapsulation of vpn traffic where a remote client accesses one or more nodes in a trusted network via a vpn gateway

1298518
wan	lan
an ip pbx provides services similar to pbx services but over data networks like a lan or wan rather than circuit-switched networks

1298522
cifs	smb
the mac and the windows pc connect to it using the smb cifs network protocol

1298542
daemons	systemd
i adjusted the dhcp daemons on each systemd to serve a different range from the 24 systemd a was .50 - .149 and systemd b was 150 - 249

1298542
daemons	systemd
because the systemd are bridged together all on the same segment any dhcp request turns into a race with both daemons responding

1298577
switching	screens
when i click on switching user there is a black screens shown for a second where i can read my actual password and all the passwords i have entered on logins

1298594
udp	tcp
i know the basics of how a router works but i do not understand how this can be done without a helper server tcp udp punch holing or vpn

1298596
wan	lan
could the firewall dns resolver which binds to all interfaces by default to answer queries be responding to client dns queries on the lan and wan interfaces but only responding with private info

1298626
jobs	cron
the problem was with the environment variables specifically that the path is different for jobs run by cron vs programs called by me in terminal as a logged in user

1298628
width	height
parameters such as bit_rate rate width or height

1298649
filesystems	btrfs
there is a similar situation with compressing filesystems like btrfs a block read from disk is basically useless only after decompression there is content that applications can use and which would make sense to cache

1298654
stdout	stderr
the part is needed to chain together both stdout ans stderr the standard output and the error output

1298660
centos	linux
linux - centos 6 64

1298667
udp	tcp
i have selected internet for interface option and tcp udp for protocol option

1298690
switching	screens
i can access cmd and regedit from the recovery screens so i was wondering if through a combination of basic cmd commands regedit and file manipulation i can access the windows filesystem from a linux installation so at least i haven t lost my files i could switching the driver back to its original configuration

1298692
stdout	stderr
if you search both stdout and stderr using or equivalent you are liable to get random text from the web-site interspersed mid-line with the diagnostics because of buffering unless you turn this off with stdbuf

1298692
stdout	stderr
this copies stderr to stdout and loses the original stdout and the search will work predictably each time

1298694
next	except
i have a zero-byte folder under my user profile named roaming which contains the following string of folders roaming intel wireless settings although each one is empty except for containing the next folder

when that happens my current solution is to use handbrake to transcode the file which will work but that s quite a pita when all i want is for ffmpeg to do what it should in the first place

1298824
ethernet	wireless
is it not better to remove the router wireless part from the cable modem and only use a cable modem which simply converts every signal from the coaxial- ethernet

1298834
for-loop	arrays
i would convert your test into a for-loop over the arguments which remain after assigning the arrays

1298927
appdata	uninstaller
i have uninstaller chrome manually deleting the c program files x86 directory the appdata directory and the registry keys

i know when you move files from one filesystems to another it essentially copies and then removes the file correct me if i m wrong but i shift+delete the file in a hurry from source and moments later discovered that file manager was still moving the file to ntfs filesystems even after i deleted the file from source and it disappeared

this is because vlan-20 is a lan interface not a designated wan interface

1300025

they operate as a switch but instead of link ethernet to ethernet their responsibility is to bridge wireless traffic into ethernet traffic

1300029
robocopy	xcopy
try robocopy it s like xcopy but more advanced

1300054

if you are really shure that you need to delete it then you can use a linux live usb like linux mint or ubuntu linux you can also try using a usb bootable disk select troubleshoot advanced options command prompt and delete the file using the command console

if a client on my home lan wants to access the internet and bypass the vpn d connection that the router normally routes all internal traffic through out to the internet it connects to this internal vpn

this way all my home lan traffic still goes out to the wider internet through the router and its tun0 interface to the router-wide vpn by default

subnet	packets
if the routing table specifies a route with a gateway either default or a subnet route it will look for the ethernet address of the gateway not destination and once again the ip packets with its source and destination ips will be sent inside an ethernet frame with source ethernet ip of your computer and destination ethernet address not of destination computer but of the gateway

1300412
wan	lan
also your typical home router is not a router but typically a switch on the lan side mini-computer-like quasi-router that aside from trivial routing also does nat rewriting of source destination ip addresses and ports on packets it forwards between lan and wan

so with some more programming they could be converted to a series of image files bmp gif or png

1300442
subnet	packets
you ll want to put it in the same subnet as the camera with the same subnet mask â this puts them on the same network so the pc will not try to send packets through its default gateway as it would do for non-lan destinations

my modem has a slot that says lan wan suggesting that it works for both

1300503
wan	lan
does that mean the dsl plug could also go into the lan wan slot and still function properly

1300503

does it mean that i can actually have 2 wans at the same time the dsl connection going to centurylink and the lan wan slot going to another isp
