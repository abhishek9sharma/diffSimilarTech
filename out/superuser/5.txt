sudo	passwd
when i try to open synaptic package manager it starts up and crashes immediately after i give sudo passwd

651418
ati	nvidia
most ati cards do and a few specialized nvidia cards will as well

another approach would be to have windows running in a virtual machine like vmware or virtualbox that way you can just fire up the vm whenever you want to use itunes

651542
daemons	systemd
ssh secure shell is a cryptographic network protocol for secure data communication remote command-line login remote command execution and other secure network services between two networked computers that connects via a secure channel over an insecure network a server and a client.ssh can be used to login to a remote computer given a ssh daemons is running on the remote systemd

651783
filesystems	ntfs
testdisk is the best you re going to get on the cross-platform side of things and while it is awesome for recovering partitions and bootsectors it s really not what you re going to need if you damaged the ntfs filesystems itself

651826
tunnel	vpn
in this case a vpn is possible solution but an even simpler one given that you must already have putty installed on your pc is to set up a reverse tunnel from your work pc to your home pc

652021
screens	tablet
i have a windows 8 tablet and the swiping from the side of the screens is not working

652021
switching	screens	screens	tablet
i believe the w510 iconia tablet that i have has formed a dead zone on the sides of the screens which essentially means that the area that windows uses to figure out if you are trying to switching apps from the left or open the charms bar from the right are not working

652034
opera	firefox
none of the other browsers which i tried opera firefox and ie had this issue but they all seemed to drop a lot of connections

652038
switching	screens
this would be the best solution if windows or any os made an api to allow apps to do this resolution switching easily when an app goes full screens

652077
afp	smb
if you click the options button in the file sharing settings screen it will give you the option to pick between smb and afp

sudo s inbuilt credential caching mechanism will mean you should only need to answer a passwd prompt once unless the shell script runs for a very long time

652411

653235
switching	screens
seeing no option or command to reboot on that blank fedora screens i just flicked the reset switching on my pc

653249
disk	ram
for example instead of running win 7 64 with 2.5gb ram and getting it to do its own caching give it 1gb plus at least 1gb of swap space and switch on caching for the relevant virtual disk controller

653330
x86	64bit
i thought x86 is for 32 bit and x64 is for 64bit but there is also the 3rd version and it confuses me

653351
ubuntu	linux
the shares are definitely working because if i run a virtual linux ubuntu on the laptop it can access the shares

google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
i ve tried print to pdf and save as pdf through safari google-chrome and firefox

653444
google-chrome	firefox
solution if you have windows 7 roll back to ie8 and use google-chrome or firefox as your default browser

653472
put	get
but you re after the from mac to pc direction which puts you at needing a mac ftp client that will put files one of the above or an ftp server running on the mac possibly also one of the above from which you can get files on the pc unless the nas does ftp itself in which case no mac needed and you d be happy.

653496

if you don t want it counted put the temp file somewhere else like maybe in tmp

654081
filesystems	hfs+
use a traditional filesystems forensics tool that supports hfs+ and examine the folder contents

654093
ethernet	wireless
but on wireless ethernet wi-fi multicasts and broadcasts don t get link-layer acknowledgements because that would cause an ack storm for each multicast that would be hard to deal with

654093
packets	multicast
this means that a multicast packets will tend to take up many times more airtime bandwidth than a unicast packets of the same size

654093
packets	multicast
every time a client leaves the group key the one for encrypting multicast broadcast packets must be changed

654111

put	get
these units like most netbooks use standard 2.5 drives so you can remove it and put it into a sata- usb enclosure in order to read off the data or just us it in-place - and you now have a handy external drive that you can use as part of your backup strategy when you get a replacement the machine

654469
stdout	stderr
it appears that service --status-all writes the and results to stdout but the results to stderr

654469
stdout	stderr
therefore to use sort to sort all of them you ll have to combine the stdout and stderr streams like this

654578
google-chrome	firefox
it seems that for both google-chrome and firefox the only solution is to unpin the tabs

654583
rank	max
adding more values will refresh the rank only when the m k is bigger than 5 due to the max function being used

654600
ubuntu	centos
edit after more experimentation i can reproduce this with centos on virtualbox alone and if i change the base-box to an ubuntu one i do not have this problem with no other changes to the vagrantfile

654608
folder	directory
i want to delete all files and sub-directories of parent directory lets say c users desktop new folder

654608

those are for nginx but might be converted to apache

654752
centos	linux
i have a linux centos 6 server in the garage without a monitor or keyboard and it does not hold any sensitive information

disk	ram
i would like to know if it is possible to copy whatever data is in active memory ram to disk and if so would it be readable

654761
tunnel	lan	tunnel	vpn	vpn	lan	dmz	was
my own suggestion was to use option 1 plus the possibility to build a tunnel from there to every pc in dmz lan vpn iptables is active at moment

654764
apache	nginx
reverse proxy like nginx or apache with enabled http authentication

654776
squash	branch
i rebase when i need to clean up my own history squash commits change commit messages etc but only it does not effect anyone else downstream like if i m working on the branch solo

vpn	lan
pro vpn allows secure encrypted connection from internet to your lan

654858
nas	qnap
if you don t have the resources time to invest on vpn - if you have some existing nas box synology qnap or other brand they may have vpn server as a module that you can download for very easy installation and set up this is true for synology that i owned and personally tested

654876
folder	directory
i ve got a directory in my folder that holds log dumps

654890
ubuntu	linux
for example standard ubuntu linux desktop is not very good for older machines nowadays but that s why they support lubuntu

654890
ubuntu	linux
for example linux distro ubuntu has an option to install in windows without partitioning your hard drive which is regarded as a bad idea

654890
ubuntu	linux
you should install your ubuntu linux distribution on a separate partition

654890
ubuntu	linux
also you can set up in some linux distros like ubuntu to install the software automatically without you ever clicking or being bothered -- look for software properties in ubuntu

654899

i can see 3 hid compliant mouse under mice and keyboard but none of them are identified as logitech g700s they are all listed as microsoft drivers.

655253
mtu	dhcp
my router s dhcp server already knows that the mtu is 1492

655253
mtu	dhcp
so it was driving me nuts why the dhcp server isn t telling my windows 7 machine the mtu setting as one of the items it returns in the dhcp offer

655258
mtu	dhcp
i have never come across an instance where dhcp is used to mediate mtu it wouldn t be the right place in most cases because the internal mtu and border mtu often different where you might use jumbo frames internally but need to reduce to normal size for internet traffic

655269

finaly i tried the upgrade versioning of explore2fs virtual volumes

655568
debian	linux
this one is a dedicated server from new provider with linux debian wheezy provided

655574
versioning	upgrade
note that if you re booting with secure boot enabled gummiboot can t work with shim and the versioning of shim that ubuntu uses won t work with either of those boot managers so you ll need to either upgrade to shim 0.2 or later or replace shim with preloader

655600
pop-up	dialog
once i select the program it fails to pop-up as an option in the open with dialog

655618

i would like to be able to just navigate to a folder and activate the service that toggles to the according directory without having to select a file first sometimes there are no files yet

655676
puts	gets
the first command outputs the path of every file modified more than 30 days ago in find s -printf -- at least with the gnu find on my system -- h prints the whole path except for the actual filename then sorts those and gets rid of any duplicates and puts the whole thing into a file called old.txt

655690

ssd	sata
while speed of sata drive is almost constant about 105 mb s the speed of ssd drive fluctuates from 0 to 250 mb s all the time

655831
ubuntu	debian
in this page mention is made of the fact that current ubuntu and debian distros have moved etc dhcp3 dhclient.conf to etc dhcp dhclient.conf which is the appropriate file to modify should you choose this option

655859
portrait	landscape
all these schemes get harder to use if the sections you want to number are not identical to word sections. for example if you need a landscape page in a portrait document you have to insert a break just to achieve that so what you want to think of as a single section then becomes 2 or 3 word sections and the field coding has to take account of that

655868
folder	directory
under bookmark manager- organize export bookmarks to html file into the folder of a newly created directory of your choice

i would upgrade to a later versioning of apache as the final release of 2.0 has been made and no new bugs -- including security holes will be fixed

656154
debian	linux	debian	mint
linux mint being a debian derivative has a debdb instead of a rpmdb

656154
rpm	yum	dpkg	apt
hence you must use dpkg apt and not rpm yum for the system to properly recognize the package

656187
efi	acpi
so these days it s acpi and it s successor efi that keeps something like the bios a necessity of pc s the overarching concept is for acpi to be the interface between things platform or motherboard specific and the os so a separate build of os doesn t have to be made for every different type of motherboard

656202
folder	directory
specifically i can import no libraries whatsoever it works if i place them in the folder with the program but placing it within python s library directory doesn t work

656208
disk	ram
if a cpu had the ability to address a hard drive directly without relying on bios or efi or other code in rom or nvram or what have you then in theory such a cpu could load an os from disk into ram and begin executing it

656223
folder	directory
you could create him his own profile on the pc and then deny that account access to the games directory via the security tab in the folder properties

656463
cpu	processors
processors intel r pentium r cpu b950 2.10ghz 2100 mhz 2

656511
daemons	launchd
i could write my own always-running daemons which extends launchd by this functionality via fsevents or kqueue fam or gamin

656522
folder	directory
i would create a bash shell script that can create new directory in the folder with that owner as the owner

656546

656560
ubuntu	linux
may you should try other linux distros ubuntu and older fedoras

656565
folder	directory
the one thing i rarely find mentioned regarding configuring the .ssh folder is restricting the directory permissions

656565

after excluding just 10 directories i didn t care about microsoft webcache firefox startupcache all of the google-chrome program directory and other things relevant to my system the backup size has varied between 35 and 300mb and i am still fine-tuning

656653

i don t do a lot with huge video files and so on. if i have to reinstall programs such as firefox google-chrome libreoffice it s not a problem

656696

you should leave this default option unless you have created specific routing instructions in your vpn tunnel

656701
children	parent
here are the packages features available in windows 7 that relate to iis presented as a reverse dependency tree children require their parent to be installed because this is how the source presented it and i don t have time to invert it right now

656711
wan	lan
i think you re seeing your wan ip when on your cable modem and a lan ip when you re on your router

656711
wan	lan
a router routes traffic between two networks in a typical setup a wan side and a lan side

656715
google-chrome	firefox
you need uvd2 or later to use gpu decoding feature of google-chrome firefox vlc etc

i have a problem with putty whenever i ssh into a unix computer using putty on my windows pc and i try to browse files everything looks fine but my tab delimiter files appear to have spaces instead of tabs

656849
ssd	sata
the resolution to my problem was to change the sata operation mode of my ssd from raid bios default for some reason to ahci

656855
google-chrome	firefox
the home page of firefox google-chrome and ie will still be pointing to start.qone8.com blahblahblah

656877
lotus	sametime
using lotus lotus sametime 9 i m able to receive a chat message but when i try to start a chat my self the window does not open

656884
vmware	esx
as the licensing agreement allows a similar thing to happen with vmware s esx esxi pdf warning licensing windows server 2012 for use with virtualization technologies i thought that this would not be an issue

656893
ethernet	wireless
it did get me thinking though does can windows send some packets through the wireless connection for increased speed when i am also connected through a wired ethernet cable

656902
cpu	processors
physical id 0 this is the first socket - if you use more than one socket then check the processors and cpu cores for each physical jd - if this is a number greater than 0 you have multiple sockets

656928
subnet	packets
machines that have an ip not within the overlap can only communicate with machines that know the new subnet they could technically communicate to machines in the overlap but the machines there won t understand how to send back packets

656953
ubuntu	linux
i just tried avconv on ubuntu linux but every time i get errors which i am not familiar with them

656968
redhat	fedora
fedora is based on redhat

ubuntu is based on debian

656968
ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	linux
linux mint is based on ubuntu

656971
debian	linux
linux is a kernel debian is a distribution of that kernel and a bunch of software to actually interact with the system

656978
debian	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	linux
ubuntu took the debian base and added code and packages to make it a good first linux distro

656978
ubuntu	mint
mint then went and stripped some of the ubuntu code to make a faster os that is similar to ubuntu but more also more of a traditional desktop when ubuntu changed the desktop manager to unity

656989
button	checkbox
if you want to determine in more detail which permissions the other user should have open up the detailed settings by clicking on the button marked with the circle 3 you will get the additional create change delete checkbox as you can see in the picture

656992
ubuntu	linux
practical linux distribution for this use could be ubuntu as it is easy to use is frequently updated and has a wide user base

656997
debian	linux
most of the gnu versions of classic utilities are often considered basic by many distros and thus is why debian for example calls it gnu linux

657000
gentoo	debian
this is imo a somewhat wrong term stemming from the fact you re technically able to build all the required software by hand and install it on a target machine so these oses distribute the packaged software so you either don t need to build it debian redhat or they facilitate such building gentoo

657000
ubuntu	debian
for instance ubuntu builds upon debian by just importing most packages from it and repackaging only a small subset of them plus packaging their own providing their own artwork default settings documentation etc

657000
freebsd	debian
for instance debian also provide freebsd and hurd kernels

657001
debian	centos	subtract	add	kde	gnome
this is still true today but many of the new distributions don t want to repeat the effort of getting everything to play nice together so they take a base distribution such as debian centos slackware and add or subtract user applications such as gnome kde lxde etc

657001
ubuntu	debian
so when you say for instance ubuntu is based on debian you are technically correct but these days it would be better to say especially in the case of ubuntu that it is derived from debian as changes to debian may or may not find their way into ubuntu

657018
subnet	packets
i don t want this packets to go anywhere outside this subnet

657018

subscript	superscript
the problem is when we extract text most of the math symbols subscript superscript and italicised letters are not getting converted

657059
disk	ram
possibly av scan windows update etc clearly somthing that is scheduled to run daily av would cause slowdowns without showing ram or cpu usage it may very wll be casuing disk i o bottlenek due to reading the disk...just a thought

657064
ssl	https
there are modules which can encapsulate the traffic so that it looks like a regular ssl tls and be almost indistinguishable from https traffic

657065
apache	nginx
question is - is there any way of doing this using apache nginx some other novel solution

657080

google-chrome	firefox
for google-chrome and firefox and probably some others the certificate must be put in the nssdb the backend for the mozilla nss library

starttls	smtps
smtps traffic encryption such as starttls won t protect against a malicious isp because they by definition have to be able to decrypt the traffic being the intended recipient of the data if not the intended final recipient of the e-mail itself

657478
vmware	virtualbox
if you want to test functionality nothing beats a vm -i d suggest virtualbox or vmware workstation since you can do snapshots or clone vms at specific states - which is easier than updating cause you accidentally replaced the old ie6 install you have on xp with ie7

657487
debian	linux
i am beginning to think about porting our program to linux as all these issues seem to go away by using debian as the os

657513

657738
gentoo	linux
i had wordpress installation there powered by apache2 and gentoo linux

657738

657974
chown	chmod
as far as i know the commands like chmod and chown which are used

657974

it does not enumerate any files at all and only enumerates the folder in the current directory plus the remaining ones in the parent directory

660250
folder	directory
if the tree is approximately balanced and assuming an average of about 100 sub-directories per folder then the deepest nested directory would be about four levels downâ actually there would be 101 010 100 sub-folders in the whole tree

661639
redhat	fedora
rpm-based suse opensuse redhat fedora mandriva or mageia although the have a similar way of packaging .rpm packages they don t always share the same features

661639
ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	linux
if you re new to the linux world try linux mint or ubuntu

661639

dropbox and skydrive both - apparently follow links

what i did was to move my main work directory into google-drive s folder and created symbolic link to it in it s original path in c

661709
dropbox	skydrive	folder	directory
however i plan to also keep my work backed up in dropbox or skydrive so i was thinking of creating a symbolic links to the work directory inside google-drive folder in dropbox s folder

661709
folder	directory
this is because i do not want an inadvertent delete of the physical directory inside google-drive folder to invalidate the other 2 symbolic links which would happen given the very nature of those type of links

logmein	hamachi
i ve researched the logmein hamachi help forums and several other related forums and no one seems to have posted a working solution

mouse	keyboard
is it really possible to invoke a context menu using a keyboard shortcut instead of clicking the right alt mouse button in os x

662200
x86	64bit	16-bit	64bit
that s kind of the whole point of having different architectures by the way. the 64bit x86_64 architecture has more instructions than 32-bit x86 had and 32-bit x86 had more instructions than 16-bit

662200
x86	64bit
on the other hand x86_64 still has the same instructions that x86 did it simply adds more of them so it s relatively easy for the os to run 32-bit programs while in 64bit mode

662232
ubuntu	linux
but under linux ubuntu 13.04 64bit the command to watermark

662273

filesystems	ntfs
a filesystems which the windows installer understands ntfs

662416
sshd	xinetd
i am trying to start services vsftpd and sshd using xinetd

662423
sshd	xinetd
this means that whenever a child process stops vsftpd or sshd the parent - xinetd - receives signal 17 which would be ignored by default but in your case it s not

662424
google-chrome	firefox
sends the strict-transport-security header so accessing it over https once will make browsers like google-chrome firefox redirect http requests to https until some specified point in the future

662431

the following seems to be true for modern debian linux but i am missing some bits

662431

662481
kde	gnome
establish a new nx connection to your ubuntu--use the kde gnome and it picks up the highest available resolution from that list supported by your client

662543
wan	lan
so what i have read is that i should plug in the ethernet wire connecting b to a into a lan port instead of the wan port

662549
imagemagick	mogrify
it looks like mogrify from imagemagick 6.9.9.19 writes the result in the same directory as the input file so you can use this command

662557
pppoe	dhcp
in which case router b handles everything pppoe to the internet and internal dhcp

662561
folder	directory
a simpler option would be to create a directory on your second drive then create shortcuts either manually or through an automated means like a batch script or the like for all the files in that folder

662566
google-chrome	firefox
firefox does this automatically but google-chrome keeps reverting to the default downloads location

662677
disk	ram
so i want to know that what is current location of notepad file before saving it means where it is currently present like in ram rom or in cache memory or in hard disk

662693
disk	ram
modern processors may swap portions of precious ram deemed unused or not sufficiently used to disk or other device thereby freeing said fast and precious ram for the use of some needier application

662693
disk	ram
another meaning of the word cache is to indicate a block of otherwise unused physical ram that stores data after it has been read from the disk as well as data that s meant to be written to disk before actually doing so

662693
disk	ram
so after reading a file in notepad that file will surely live also in the ram disk cache for some time unless and until that space is reprioritized and reclaimed for other uses

the issue does not occur with firefox but i need to use google-chrome for work-related reasons so simply switching isn t really an option personally though it is a viable workaround

663369
robocopy	xcopy
the loader can be anything from a simple batch file calling xcopy robocopy up to a dvcs pull or dropbox owncloud sync

663421
google-chrome	firefox	opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome
if you don t actually need internet explorer - say for a web-application or other business need - then google-chrome mozilla firefox and opera make excellent alternatives

663438
mouse	keyboard
for the past couple of months i have been using a large elevated stand that sits on my desk designed expressly for this purpose containing my keyboard and mouse and my monitors have been raised as high as possible and aimed upwards

663438
mouse	keyboard
i can easily place my keyboard and mouse back down under the elevated stand but i have to look up pretty steeply and that is uncomfortable and makes it difficult to see the screens since they are tilted upwards

663510
switching	screens
n the windows xp login screens you can switching between installed keyboard layouts by pressing

663553
debian	linux
the program has been developed especially for debian but it works on linux in general so that its installation should be very easy to you

663635
versioning	upgrade
easy solution would be to temporarly switch to old raring repositories install php 5.4 apache 2.2 etc and lock package versioning so it won t be upgrade anymore

663639
hash	md5
following hours of reading through forum posts related to the problem i re-downloaded the iso and verified it s md5 hash before re-burning the iso to a dvd on lowest burning speed possible - and still had the same output

you basically have to drop these font files into your java environment directory s font folder

663729
folder	directory
phpstorm being a java app utilizes fonts form these directory slightly different than the ones in your system fonts folder

663793
debian	linux
on debian start the server with synergys -f -c synergy.conf because running it from the kde menu makes it give an error option not supported on linux --enable-drag-drop and incidentally i can t find any file that might be telling it to use that option

663817
folder	directory
i know that i could just have a program regularly clone the whole directory to a timestamped folder but that would be very inefficient since the directory is huge and only a small percentage of the files in there actually change from month to month

663825
ssd	sata
the sshd will mostelikely be the seagate stbd1000400 1tb + 8gb ssd 5400 rpm 64mb cache sata 6.0gb s 2.5 internal hybrid hard drive retail kit

i migrated my sata hd to ssd disk copied using ezgigiv

663886
versioning	upgrade
to work around this issue you can use either vs 2012 which can be installed on the same machine side-by-side with vs 2013 or upgrade the tfs 2008 server to a supported versioning tfs 2010 or higher

wan	lan
it looks to me from looking at your diagram that you are connecting to the router from the desktop to the wan port that is not the way to do it hook it to one of the lan ports like the rest of the computers

663962
google-chrome	firefox
i have installed browser addons such as clearly for google-chrome or reader for mozilla firefox but i m unsatisfied with their results article does not span the entire width loading is slow images not always showing up or displayed too small or wrongly positioned

663974
apache	nginx
it just needs to run nginx apache and maybe nodejs

663980
ethernet	wireless
devices like the xbox - with only an ethernet port and no built-in wireless - can be connected to wireless networks using a gaming adapter

663982
ubuntu	linux
that does require an intermediate level of linux experience however so if you are a newbie you would probably be better served with something like xubuntu which is ubuntu but instead of coming with unity comes with xfce

664011
windows	winpe
there are many many walkthrough guides and howtos but imagine trying to rebuild or debug bcd including efi bios variants and recovery hibernate memtest sections and perhaps multiple boot windows winpe winre from scratch using just bcdedit + diskpart and trying to understand rather than just copy pasting commands

664022
tunnel	vpn
this host has to run a sql-server that i can access from the other isp s servers through the vpn tunnel

664166
filesystems	hfs+
this is a known problem with case-insensitive hfs+ filesystems

664179
wan	lan
should this fail do keep in mind that there are also other possibilities like mis-configuration of your lan wan problems with your isp and so on

664210
bluetooth	usb
virtual box does not recognize the mouse as a usb device so i can t just pass it through that way and it doesn t matter whether the mouse is plugged in with a cord or with a bluetooth dongle

as the google mobilizer service works by taking a querystring as an input it can be adapted to work like a search provider in google-chrome opera to simplify its use

664285
freebsd	solaris
i have solaris 10 installed on the first hard disk and freebsd installed on the second hard disk

664313

2 folder with the same name is not possible in the same directory then you need to specify it with the rd like

664346
folder	directory
but when i try to run that command i get an error no such file or directory. sublime text 2 is in my applications folder -- but it looks like there is no bin folder in my home directory

664396
hex	binary
hence when referring to disks by uuid the comparison is done as a file-name comparison on the hex strings rather than a binary comparison on the data represented by said strings

664401
ubuntu	linux
i have the toshiba nb255 that is dual-booted with windows 7 professional and ubuntu linux

664402
versioning	upgrade
better for upgrading but perhaps requiring an upgrade or sidegrade right away to install the x64 versioning

664414
ubuntu	linux
i have a mac os x host and a bunch of guests including ubuntu and arch linux

664472
jobs	cron
a good trick as suggested by vogonpoetlaureate is to capture the standard error of your cron jobs which can help debug them

664477
ubuntu	linux	put	get
it seems that the fantec raid controller has somehow destroyed the partitioning scheme or the file system because when put into a hdd docking station they get recognized by the os ubuntu linux but are not mountable anymore

664492
google-chrome	safari
i recently transitioned to safari because i m really tired of how google-chrome hogs memory and drains my battery like crazy

664493
robocopy	xcopy
in windows ms-dos there are commands xcopy or robocopy which allow recursive copy of files including directories and their content

664494
disk	ram
diskcopy will copy floppy to ram then prompt you to swap floppys till disk is created

664516
postgresql	mysql
i recently setup a mail server following the instructions on linode.com except i am using postgresql instead of mysql

664516

664525
findstr	tasklist
tasklist | findstr i ping

664543
google-chrome	firefox
after switching browsers from firefox to google-chrome i ve tried all the solutions that i know of going into the registry and manually changing the default program there going into the control panel and trying to figure out how to manually change the protocol uninstalling firefox completely restarting my computer downloading default programs editor and running every single one of these in administrator mode

664566
tunnel	vpn
all the vpn clients i ve seen are point-to-point tunnel

664566
tunnel	vpn
rather when you start the vpn a new virtual network interface is being created on your work laptop that is an encrypted tunnel to your employer s internal network and then the laptop s default route is changed to point to the tunneled interface

664566
vpn	lan
so any activity you do on the work laptop over the vpn can be monitored but no other machine on your lan will be affected

664572
wan	lan
i have the wan port of the router go to the wall socket connect the nic to the lan port of the router setup the router in dhcp mode 192.168.0.100 255.255.255.0 to 192.168.0.110 255.255.255.0

664597
stdout	stderr
youâ could also consider adding to your command in order to redirect stderr to stdout since ffmpeg will output debug messages via stderr and you wouldn t see them otherwise

664612
executable	upx
compress your executable using upx install it with sudo apt-get install upx-ucl

664612
executable	upx
unlike standard executable ones compressed with upx cannot share the same cache pages

i dont want the settings manager pop-up dialog to appear but i want the allow permission to be granted always

664756
pop-up	dialog
the dialog pop-up asking if i want to apply the registry changes and i click yes but no changes are made

664758
mongodb	bson
mongodb uses bson binary json format for storage purposes and the mongodb wire protocol for communication between client drivers and the mongodb server

664789
disk	ram
i would like to change some settings not the disk s contents for the snapshot after install for example change the amount of ram from 1gb to 2gb

664800
opensuse	debian
on client side i use opensuse 12.3 and on server debian

664826
ubuntu	linux
i am on linux ubuntu 13.10

664851
ubuntu	linux
i have a linux ubuntu 11.10 box at work on which i open 4 terminals and execute different processes my code

664877
apache	nginx
installments required nginx apache php-5 mysql redis mongodb etc

664877
homebrew	yum
is yum just as good as homebrew on my imac or can i install homebrew on the centos computer

664899
homebrew	yum
however homebrew is trying to emulate something like yum or other package managers aptitude pacman etc. - so as far as is it just as good not in my experience as the recipes are fairly limited - but it does provide some nice functionality on mac since there is no cli package manager

664913
hdd	floppy	disk	ram
how does filesystem fragmentation non-contiguous data blocks differ among mediae ram disk hdd floppy what-have-you

664913
disk	ram
for example if i read and write to my a ram disk the exact same bytes as i do to my hard disk across a period of time will i see a different amount of filesystem fragmentation

664918
disk	ram
if you use a 1gb ram disk with the same filesystem as a 1gb hard disk the fragmentaten will be the same

664918
filesystems	fat
fat filesystems for example is much worse than modern filesystems

664918
disk	ram
and a ram disk probably uses a special filesystem

664918
disk	ram
otoh a ram disk or flash memory don t suffer as much from fragmentation as a spinning disk as they have mostly random access and it doesn t matter much if they access blocks from different areas of the disk or consecutive blocks

664943
fat	hfs+	hfs+	ntfs	filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	fat	filesystems	hfs+
note that a standard efi can read fat but cannot read ntfs ext2 3 4fs hfs+ or any other filesystems

664943
filesystems	fat
a few efis also have iso-9660 filesystems drivers -- but again they re exceptions to the rule. because fat is the only filesystems that s guaranteed to be readable by efi an attempt to build a boot disk that does not include a fat partition is doomed to failure except of course when used on those unusual efis that support additional filesystems

664950
ubuntu	linux
the recent linux distributions such as fedora and ubuntu all use chroot environment to make the build

665011
ubuntu	debian
example ubuntu 12.04 has 5.3 ubuntu 13.10 has 5.5 debian 7 has 5.4

665058
jobs	cron
if you run mandrake suse or any other distros and your computer is not powered up 24 hours a day there are several cron jobs that might be forgotten because they re scheduled for 3 00am-4 00am in the morning

665058
jobs	cron
anacron searches for missed cron jobs and executes them five minutes after you boot your computer

665058
redhat	fedora
note redhat and fedora have anacron pre-installed by default

665069
ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	linux
i am running linux mint 15 though i previously had very similar issues on ubuntu 12.04 pip version 1.4.1

665164
processors	hyperthreading
my processors supports hyperthreading so there are 8 logical cores and 4 physical cores

665226
unix	bsd
depending upon the unix variant linux bsd etc there might be a short option for --null but that s less portable

665227
pop-up	dialog
you can set the git_askpass environment variable either in your shell or better when launching your git client to the path of a helper app which will pop-up a graphical password dialog ssh-askpass ksshaskpass gnome-askpass ssh-askpass for mac cocoa dialog etc

665271
google-chrome	firefox
i wonder if i can setup one browser firefox to use wlan and other browser google-chrome or even better different firefox profile to use bluetooth connection

665272
ubuntu	linux
i wanted to switch to linux but the only distro so far i could even boot from a live usb was ubuntu

665296
folder	directory
the solutions i have found thus far are access only certain directory through ssh and restrict ssh user to one folder

665301
ethernet	wireless
run ipconfig to see which of the first two lines is local ethernet vs wireless connection

665306
subtraction	addition
does it support addition subtraction of compute nodes

665308
ethernet	wireless
i get my internet connection on my server through my wireless adapter from my host but it automatically sees it as an ethernet adapter instead of as a wireless adapter

665316
pull	push
in the script i m taking advantage of the fact that the commands git clone git push and git pull produce on the remote side

665324
ubuntu	debian
if you are running on debian or ubuntu you might have this installed already

665326
folder	directory
which makes the projects folder my starting directory when opening the shell

665326
folder	directory
is there any way for me to retain the projects folder as my starting directory while being able to cd into its parent directory

665369
versioning	upgrade
hours with migration wizard v3.1 taking me in circles - do you want to upgrade to latest versioning v2.5.1

665375
google-chrome	firefox
get google-chrome firefox and install a user agent switcher addon

665399
hide	show
you select to hide the entry and it remains hidden but a new completely different entry is show that is either related to the first one or a newer version of it

665399
hide	show
you select to hide the entry but later when it is updated it is reset and is show again because it is new

665456
vpn	lan
to connect to pcs in the lan vpn

665460
filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	fat
ntfs can store files larger than 4gb so if your flash drive is 4gb or less then choose ntfs anyways because the fat filesystems suffers from worse performance issues due to fragmentation

665478
capitalize	capitalization
is there any way to tell word that i don t want to capitalize internet without turning off capitalization checking altogether

665503
photoshop	fireworks
so i made an illustrator file that contains all the icons in font awesome 4.0.0 as vector paths next to their labels for quickly narrowing in on an icon and copying pasting it to photoshop fireworks sketch etc

665530
sudo	passwd
can t login as sudo gksu root su nor as main super user after removed user passwd via gnome-user-settings

665530
debian	linux
installed debian jessie gnu linux with xfce gui en-us as only os

665530
sudo	passwd
skipped root user passwd in setup to get sudo for superuser

665530
xfce	gnome
logged in as always had with gnome 3.4.x not once with xfce

665530
xfce	gnome
installed xfce only to achieve more control easier management over packages this way to set-up gnome much more by mine likes

665573
versioning	upgrade
volume will block sku upgrade and upgrade to future versioning of

665594
installation	upgrade
after i upgrade to windows 8.1 using store if i retrieved the key using any key finding tools will it be a new key and will it work with new installation of windows 8.1

665603
ati	nvidia
i have been investigating possible options and was thinking in ati radeon hd 7870 another option is nvidia geforce gtx 670 or 680 but they are expensive

665614
filesystems	ntfs
this being said if you are adamant on keeping your disk attached to your pc i would go with ntfs which is a journaled fully posix-compliant filesystems

665623
mp4	h.264
they re both mp4 right click video - stats for nerds so firefox s h.264 support works at least some of the time

665641
ubuntu	debian
yes use a live distro ubuntu and issue the relevant commands lspci lshw hwinfo dmidecode... from there you will get the same info as if running your very own debian etch

665653
processors	hyperthreading
many intel processors come with hyperthreading so each core can support two threads

665656
chown	sudo
finally i created the directory home backups and ran sudo chown backups backups

665658
mouse	keyboard
background i am playing a new game batman arkham origins that has very poor keyboard and mouse support compared to previous games in the series

665670
unix	bsd
there is no program within linux bsd unix to do this automatically so you will probably have to script something to get this to work

665674
youtube	vimeo
there often discussions and many facilities available to download streaming media eg youtube vimeo etc however is there a way it can stream a download link

665679
rar	zip
it s very handy but not cooperating with other systems that handle zip not rar format

665715
folder	directory
then for folder i deleted the skydriveex entry at hkcr directory shellex contextmenuhandlers

665720
google-chrome	firefox
but is there a way to ask the browser preferably google-chrome or firefox

665725
pop-up	dialog
to run the file without having this dialog pop-up you will need to create a .desktop entry for it

665771
folder	directory
don t mess with profile directory s inner structure - remember that it s a system folder and it s easy to break something

665807
ubuntu	linux
worked well for headless ubuntu linux box

665835
for-loop	loops
the for-loop stores every file it finds in every file in the current directory in the variable one by one as it goes through loops

665851
google-chrome	firefox
since the intended solution will be used ubuntu the solution here is for google-chrome or firefox under ubuntu

665855
mouse	keyboard
when i click back to safari keyboard and mouse inputs don t work

665857
ubuntu	centos
i was wondering if anyone has been able to use chroot on osx to run another os ubuntu centos

665862
freebsd	linux
various emulators exist â for example freebsd has linux emulation and wine runs windows programs on unixes and there seems to be an os x emulator for linux â but i couldn t find any that would run linux programs on os x

665862
freebsd	linux
here s a description of how basic linux functions are emulated on freebsd

665881
ubuntu	linux
i understand that linux and windows are completely different but it seems stupid that windows won t load where as ubuntu will load perfectly fine from the same hard drive

665945
versioning	upgrade
my question is a is it because of vmware versioning support it means do i have to downgrade or upgrade versioning

665948
google-chrome	firefox
those sounds come from your google-chrome firefox extension called magic actions for youtubeâ

665961
ubuntu	linux
instead of using freedos you can use something like ubuntus live disk which will able you to run ubuntu linux in memory and not add change anything on your disks

665965
packets	multicast
multicast is a method of network communication where sending device send one packets ethernet frame and that data packets will be delivered to all the devices in a group who are interested in that traffic

665988
folder	directory
i ran diskwarrior from the cd rebuilt the directory checked all folder ran the hardware test

665995
ethernet	wireless
the reason why airmon-ng is coming up empty-handed in the guest is that you do not have control of the wireless card in the guest.the hypervisor sets up a connection that allows you to share your internet connection but it does so by creating a virtual ethernet interface which is bridged with the host extant connection

666006
antivirus	mcafee
if you recently removed mcafee antivirus from your laptop machine and after that you started to face this error message error 2738 could not access vbscript run time for custom action each time you try to use .msi installer

666019
ubuntu	linux
few linux viruses exist in the wild.however you are very unlikely to stumble on and be infected by a linux virus in the same way you would be infected by a piece of malware on windows.with this in mind you do not have to worry about your windows installation infecting a virus from ubuntu

666027
google-chrome	firefox
i should note that i want to use privoxy only in connection with google-chrome i do not want tp set it up as a general proxy for other programs like firefox etc

666043
sorting	filtering
e.g displaying and sorting or filtering

666043
postgresql	mysql
any pre-build app for mysql and postgresql

666045
filesystems	fat
with gdisk you d create a partition of type ef00 but you d then need to create a fat filesystems on it since gdisk is a partitioning-only tool it doesn t handle filesystems

666047
screens	tablet
i want to know if it would be possible to connect my laptop to my tablet with a mini display port to hdmi cable and use the tablet to capture the video stream from the laptop record the screens

666054
ubuntu	linux
if you don t normally use linux you can still use a linux live cd such as an ubuntu live cd or system rescue cd

666060
vpn	lan
a vpn would work well - the virtual network would function just like a lan and systems that are on the vpn can receive incoming connections from any other system on the vpn

666084
google-chrome	firefox
for example the extension has been around since 2006 for firefox and 2010 for google-chrome and hasn t caused security issues since then nor has been ever removed from either program s extension store so it is reasonable to assume that it is trustworthy.

666092
filesystems	ntfs
for example the default filesystems in windows is ntfs which is closed â meaning a linux reimplementation of ntfs basically needs to be done by guessing and reverse-engineering as there are no official specs to read

666092
freebsd	linux
linux cannot read ufs from freebsd and needs a third-party driver to support zfs due to licensing issues again booting linux from zfs is possible but it won t necessarily be as easy as using a linux-native filesystem

666092
filesystems	fat
in general the only widely natively supported filesystems is microsoft s fat fat32 which is quite slow and unreliable compared to everything else above not to mention its limitations file size limited to 2 or 4 gb.

666092
filesystems	fat
there was once a time when one could install linux on a fat partition alongside ms-dos or early windows systems using the special umsdos filesystems driver that would store this additional unix metadata inside special files hidden from both linux and ms-dos

666146
kde	gnome
this problem started when i tried to move from gnome to kde and tried to install kde and uninstall gnome which did not work

666156
wan	lan
then shift its wire from upstairs to a lan port leaving its wan port empty

666180
mouse	keyboard
now the problem is that mouse and keyboard are not working

666180
mouse	keyboard
even though i installed desktop the mouse and keyboard are not working but the mouse and keyboard are enumerating

666180
mouse	keyboard
the lsusb command is showing the usb mouse and keyboard

666219
xfce	gnome	xfce	kde	kde	gnome
to see if the webcam is actually on you can install the package cameramonitor as per package description designed for gnome but should work as well on kde and xfce

666243
dropbox	skydrive
mirroring to dropbox instead of skydrive would be the simplest solution as it keeps past file versions

666248
width	height
frames-per-second height width bits-per-pixel

666287
google-chrome	firefox
be it ie firefox or google-chrome whenever i try to download a media file windows 7 starts streaming it in the browser instead of giving me options about what i want to do with the file i m trying to download

666290
ati	nvidia
also you need to keep in mind that some motherboards are optimized for ati crossfirex if you combine 2 graphics cards together for extreme gpu performance and then some motherboards are optimized for nvidia sli configurations

666290
cpu	processors
intel boxed core i7 2600 processors - 3.40ghz quad core socket 1155 - cpu

666308
ubuntu	debian
simmilar to jamuraa s answer for debian you can also go to for ubuntu

666313
ubuntu	linux
means only user root or someone in group root most linux systems including ubuntu have a root group

666323
ubuntu	debian
i think it must be ubuntu or debian

666323
ubuntu	debian
the vps-admin tool lets me install both ubuntu and debian and there are several versions to choose between for each

666327
stdout	stderr
if you want to see what it is doing specifically just change the output path for stderr and stdout from dev null to a text file home user ldcheck.txt or similar and examine the contents after the script runs

666328
nas	qnap
a qnap nas serves this target directory

666337
firefox	safari
some fonts inside thunderbird + safari + firefox where messed up ..

666346
uninstall	upgrade
personally i had to uninstall all antivirus software to avoid complete freezes during the upgrade process

666354
firefox	safari
on either firefox or safari the behavior is the same i open the wiki change something and press save it says right click here to download the main wiki file

666397
gentoo	linux
i have an x.org server running on my machine gentoo linux without pam policykit etc incoming tcp connections are disabled with -nolisten tcp

666408
macbook	bootcamp
i have a macbook laptop running snow leopard there s absolutely no information on the laptop just a few unimportant files on it i wanted to use bootcamp assistant version 3 to create a partition and install windows on it to run windows alongside mac os

666410
mouse	keyboard
keyboard and mouse input is processed while the screen is off

666412
redhat	fedora
fedora is also supported by redhat so you may find it less different from centos redhat than other distros if that is important to you

666416
mouse	keyboard
when your computer is going into hibernation the screen shuts off immediately but sometimes mouse and keyboard input is still accepted for about 15-30 seconds before it powers off completely

666471
filesystems	fat
until now i was able to mount any external drives usb flash drives which have fat sd cards having ext4 partitions filesystems using usb sd card adapters

666484
debian	linux	debian	mint
hi i am using the linux mint debian version

666501
wan	lan
you want a router that is not only gigabit wan but has gigabit lan ports as well the ports your pc connects to

666533
windows	winpe
i am using this very device to create a bootable medium winpe that will allow me to boot a device that is running windows 8 64-bit and features uefi secure boot

666557
tilemill	mapnik
i m trying to get node.exe to run at the command line to do a tilemill mapnik export

666592
postgresql	mysql
so if you are not sure all your services can work with mysql or postgresql chose ldap

666617
pop-up	dialog
choose somewhere to put it in the dialog which pop-up

666629
kde	gnome
i wonder if the program you used from within kde was actually the one for gnome

666629
kde	gnome
my box is centos6.4 gnome and kde

666641
ethernet	wireless
is there anything preventing us from creating a means to use two different internet connections like two different ethernet cards or an ethernet card and a wireless card and using the two ip addresses at once for more internet speed

666679
logmein	hamachi
i ve recently set up a logmein hamachi vpn in gateway mode

666680
post	get
if that s not the problem try running ssh with ssh -v to get more debug output and post it here

666687
ubuntu	debian
suppose you install a desktop environment say ubuntu or debian

666709
xfce	gnome	xfce	cinnamon	xfce	kde	kde	cinnamon	kde	gnome	cinnamon	gnome
the first part of the answer is that people who design desktop environments like gnome kde xfce mate cinnamon .

666824
google-chrome	firefox
are you logged in in firefox but not in google-chrome or vice versa

666882
disk	ram
this symptom can be improved by installing a solid state disk ssd adding more ram to your system reducing the number of programs you have open or upgrading to a newer system architecture for instance ivy bridge or haswell

666882
disk	ram
when there s significant memory pressure meaning the system doesn t have a lot of free ram if it were to let every program have all the ram it wants it starts putting minimized programs into the page file which means it writes out their contents from ram to disk and then makes that area of ram free

666882
disk	ram
this free ram is also used as page cache which means that when active programs attempt to read data on your hard disk that data might be cached in ram which prevents your hard disk from being accessed to get that data

666882
disk	ram
by using the majority of your ram for page cache and swapping out unused programs to disk windows is trying to improve responsiveness of the program s you are actively using by making ram available to them and caching the files they access in ram instead of the hard disk

666882
disk	ram
the downside of this behavior is that minimized programs can take a while to have their contents copied from the page file on disk back into ram

666882
disk	ram
ram is many times faster than a hard disk depending on the specific hardware it can be up to several orders of magnitude

666882
disk	ram
an ssd is considerably faster than a hard disk but it is still slower than ram by orders of magnitude

666882
disk	ram
you also make available more ram for page cache which will make all programs that access the hard disk run faster

666882
children	parent
the system architecture is generally defined as the generation think generations like children parent grandparents etc. of the motherboard and cpu

666913
ssd	sata
ide mode vs ahci will also cause a considerable speed difference even on the same exact sata version for both hdd and more noticeably on ssd

666916
mouse	keyboard
if your users have access to a keyboard and mouse connected to the machine then they might still be able to bypass your efforts to secure it

666938
vmware	virtualbox
you could use vmware which is free for personal use or you could try virtualbox by oracle which is again free

666941
vmware	virtualbox
lots of vmware fanboys like to rag on hyper-v but its come a long way in recent years if you re using just plain ol win8 not pro you re stuck with virtualbox and or vmware

666962

666996
folder	directory
each unique document will reside in a folder location given by its unique numerical identifier.for example the file directory hierarchy will look something like this

667054
hash	salt
i m talking about the password that gets salt and hash to decrypt the header itself

667132
mouse	keyboard
to be exact i wanted to know what drivers are used by my keyboard mouse hard drive and network card

667135
ubuntu	linux

667146
pull	push
i expected i should do a git push git suggests to do git pull .

667150
firefox	safari
firefox works perfectly i even logged out and back in to make sure the credentials are the same that safari suggests and so they are

667150
firefox	safari
even on this very site i cannot post a thing with safari i m going to switch to firefox to be able to post this question

667180
versioning	upgrade
mavericks upgrade its smb versioning from smb1 to smb2 so perhaps that is related

667202
ffmpeg	libav
but i ve already done uninstalling through apt using sudo apt-get remove ffmpeg libav

667202
ffmpeg	libav
i m using the ffmpeg version not the libav one

667238
vpn	lan
normally you must provide an instruction to forward ipv4 traffic from the lan to the new interface which the vpn provides be it tun0 or tap0

667243
mouse	keyboard
other - i ve tried plugging in the computer to a different and secluded outlet i ve tried it with a different keyboard razer lycosa -- logitech g510s and a different mouse razer naga 2012 -- razer naga 2014 still nothing

667260
installation	upgrade
after i upgrade to windows 8.1 from microsoft store if i retrieved the key using any key finding tools will it be a new key and will it work with new installation of windows 8.1

667277
traceroute	packets
traceroute is a command which can show you the path a packets of information takes from your computer to one you specify

667278
findstr	ipconfig
you should always try to ping default gateway you can discover it by this command ipconfig | findstr gateway

667326
macports	homebrew
first of all i would recommend you to install nginx from homebrew instead of macports

667326
macports	homebrew
macports will pull and install all nginx s dependencies into its own environment while homebrew s nginx will use mac s native

667339
wan	lan
there is a variant of this router tg582n technicolor 582n - fiber - see bottom of linked page that has one of the lan ports set as a dedicated wan port for this purpose but my isp didn t think to tell me this when i upgraded and i am now having to wait for the new router even though i have an active connection

667370
vpn	lan
vpn clients to only access their local lan while tunnelled into a vpn

667374
ubuntu	linux

667401
multiplying	add
additional step if you add or multiplying cell d1 by another value the resulting answer is as if you added or multiplied by 5.2100 not 5.2099

667461
disk	ram
that s because both when you start it and when you maximize it from them taskbar you are reading the application from disk as explained by all the others but an application which ran for a while opening files and doing stuff might have taken more ram space than a newly started one and all that memory was swapped out to disk to make space for active applications again as explained by the others so now that you are maximizing it more data has to be read from disk than for a fresh start

667468
bash	zsh
i m using zsh but i tagged bash in case it s something possible in both shells

667485
debian	linux
normally alternative kernel images for pcs are easy to locate on the web all sorts of keen developers for instance produce debian packages from the newest relases of the linux kernel

667489
debian	linux
try installing debian or arch linux

667499
bash	zsh
i can t speak to zsh but for bash aliases are only used for commands not arguments

667513
versioning	upgrade
so i doubt that adobe cc upgrade to the wrong versioning of photoshop

667540
versioning	upgrade
upgrade microsoft office to versioning 14.3.8

667543
range	max
use the if function to make a logical check for the number 1 then use the max function to find the maximum number in a range if the if finds it to be true

667548
google-chrome	firefox
the odd thing is that if i close google-chrome and opens firefox and enter facebook.com sign in so the page is fully loaded firefox works fine on facebook then open google-chrome then goes to facebook and the page loads fine and works like usual this solves the problem every time facebook is stuck in google-chrome

667550

when i start my pc keyboard and mouse are responding in bios

667777
mouse	keyboard
but when windows shows welcome screen keyboard and mouse are not working

667789
mktime	strftime
this also works in gawk but if you happen to have that then strftime and mktime are a more elegant solution.

667824
antivirus	norton
frequently the issue will be with windows explorer office 2013 chrome or norton antivirus

667831

i m no electrical engineer but i was thinking during the meeting that i spoke up about it that if we simply want all of our tenants to have wifi all of the units have multiple ethernet jacks why can t we just manage the whole system through wired ethernet systems for each metering bandwidth as necessary during peak hours with the typical password-protected wireless component as the last leg of the delivery system

671208
jobs	cron
what happens later is that various cron jobs that run on the server pile up

671208
jobs	cron
an hour later the ps command shows the same apache processes with the same pids but a number of cron jobs running php have been added to the list presumably waiting for mysql

671338
vpn	lan
all this stement does is make the client aware of the existence of a private lan 10.1.0.0 24 behind the vpn server

671338
vpn	lan
this is the reason of your problems in fact your client can connect to the members of the lan but it never receives a reply because the router does not know how to route back its replies to the vpn client

671338
vpn	lan
in this case you do not wish to alter the routing table of the vpn server because this would mean that the other pcs on the lan would not know how to reach the vpn client and you would have to solve that by changing all the routing tables of all pcs to tell them that the gateway to the vpn is the vpn server not the router

671352
wan	lan
our exchange are located in lan not expanding in wan

671361
ethernet	wireless
i have a wireless internet connection that i want to keep as my default gateway for internet access i want to be able to plug in another router via the ethernet port so that i can ssh it but keep my wireless connection as the main internet connection

671361
ethernet	wireless
is it possible to configure a setup whereby i maintain connection to the internet wireless and connect to the other router via ethernet

671367
ethernet	wireless
what you wish is that your wireless router let s call it 192.168.1.1 is your default router while the ethernet router let s call it 192.168.2.1 only generates an extra routing rule not the default gateway

671371
udp	tcp
elsewhere i read that encrypted packets for example tcp udp simply should show up as data

671383
wan	lan	wan	subnet
and the router will be configure to route items on that subnet to your other pc rather than the company wan lan

671383
wan	lan
i m just throwing this idea out there as i don t know your level of competence with networking and this approach may be worthwhile for you it allows you to add all kinds of things to your local lan without visibility to the company wan - your own printer nas etc without having to configure those with much thought

671384
mouse	keyboard
when starting the fans work but there is no display and keyboard and mouse are not working

671393
ssd	sata
you can use a sata cable from several years ago on a sata iii motherboard ssd combo and achieve maximum speed

671440
sudoers	passwd
if you do not want to enter a passwd add to sudoers

671442
folder	directory
i added the local directory to the machine by enabling shared folder in virtual box so that when win7 boots i have access to my local files on osx

671495
pop-up	dialog
select special in the dialog that pop-up

671515
ssd	sata
you can also try plugging the ssd into another sata port on your primary pc s motherboard or try connecting it via a sata usb converter

671517
put	get
then you open the bag and get the motherboard out - which means you don t still have a hand on the chassis unless you have three hands - so before you put the motherboard in the chassis you hold it in one hand and touch the chassis with your other hand before bringing the two into direct contact

671532
required	placeholder
the -i required a defined placeholder

671538
chown	chmod
how can i stop users being able to run this using chmod and chown

671548
put	get
i regularly get cold-called by people who would be happy to sell me a wireless network that costs 3 times as much as the fiber optic network i put in - which makes a dandy backhaul for low-cost reliable waps that are connected by wires to fibers that connect between buildings

671571
folder	directory
i wonder if there is a way to create 3 different cmd shortcuts to access those directory folder individually without changing the default cmd directory location

671586
put	get
to support my question i put the piece of code that i m trying to get it working

671658
put	get
i get prompted with a window on my phone when i first plug it in asking me which mode i want to put the device into charge mode tether mode etc. and even if i select the disk drive function the phone still cannot successfully mount to my computer

i m currently trying to get to preferences in firefox in linux ubuntu

671724

but the problem is i can t get repair my computer it took so long and nothing happened after i waited more than 2h and when i put my windows 7 dvd to boot it charge the files then same thing happened nothing show up so i couldn t use command prompt

671737
ubuntu	opensuse
i m seeing this on ubuntu 13.04 and opensuse 12.3

671745
png	ico
now i have downloaded the package that has the png files inside i know the ico files are there but i want the png files

672788
disk	ram
i have 8gb of ram but it seems to be using 58gb of disk space with about 53 files

672790
sudo	passwd
you may even be able to do this from finder as with sudo it will ask for your passwd by doing a get info on the folder and adjusting permissions in the sharing and permissions box at the bottom you may need to click the lock icon in the lower right first and select apply to enclosed items from the gear icon near the left

672799
vpn	lan
this option is present because one the uses of a vpn by no menas the only one is to allow safe access to the resources present on the vpn server s lan

672799
vpn	lan
if however you are thinking of a commercial vpn server then the option does not exist because no one is interested in accessing the server s lan and the only service of interest is that making your browsing private

673821
put	get
what i think you can do is carefully open your laptop and disconnect the hard drive get another laptop and put it into that one

673850
chown	sudo
sudo chown

google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
zotero works with windows mac linux and firefox google-chrome safari

673924
vmware	virtualbox
try testing out the iso or the actual cd using vmware virtualbox or qemu to make sure it works

673935
debian	linux
so i am going to debian from boss linux and i have 2 questions

673935
debian	linux
if i would be able to remove debian and use boss linux only by using the software grub customizer

673946
sfx	setup.exe
using 7-zip zip the customized core and setup.exe in a top-level .7z archive .7z file zip format and convert it into a .exe setup using 7-zip sfx maker for example

673961
vpn	lan
now you specify that you only want traffic to the remote lan to pass through the vpn nothing else

673961
vpn	lan
where i assumed the lan behind the vpn server is 192.168.50.0 24

673990
sudo	passwd	sudoers	passwd
sudo su tomcat7 works without passwd because i ve added this only command to etc sudoers with nopasswd

673994
ubuntu	linux
the booted os will be ubuntu linux 12.04.3.

674003
folder	directory
lists all folder in current directory as dir1 dir2 dir3

674017
bash	zsh
alternatively you can use zsh instead of bash and take advantage of its glob qualifiers

674030
ffmpeg	libav
the problem is that version 0.8.7-6 0.8.7-1ubuntu2 of ffmpeg is not really ffmpeg but a buggy version of libav shipped under the wrong name

674033
hide	show
this text press any key to continue i don t want this to show up is there a way i could hide this part of the text but i also want the previous to stay thus the pause command

674067
mouse	keyboard
everything on your place should be ergonomic - desk chair position against light keyboard mouse etc

674069
folder	directory
sym link extension i can use this to make the images and assets folder appear as a sub directory of all

674069
folder	directory
however i want the contents of images assets to appear in the all folder i don t want the directory to appear as sub directory because as stated the print hot folder cannot access sub directory

674087
put	get
when you right click the windows 8.1 start button you get some options to quickly perform common tasks to shut down reboot or put the computer to sleep

674094
installation	upgrade
when you reach the which type of installation do you want screen click upgrade to upgrade the system files of windows vista

674095
google-chrome	firefox
here s what worked for me to fix helvetica neue and helvetica neue bold in firefox and google-chrome

674129
firefox	safari
i have a proxy running that i can successfully use with both firefox and safari

674173
filesystems	fat
fifteen or so years ago - when fat filesystems were being widely used fat16 fat32 etc - fragmentation was a really big problem the idea that a block of data on a disk is not always kept in the same place - infact it could be spread across several different areas on the disk

674173
filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	fat
we don t tend to use fat filesystems anymore and instead use ntfs or exfat on modern windows operating systems so fragmentation on drives with large amounts of data is not so much of an issue

674198
macbook	bootcamp
i did a fair bit of research on this when running bootcamp on my mid-2011 macbook air

674220
mouse	keyboard
it all works perfectly keyboard mouse speakers printer apart from the monitor

674298
mouse	keyboard
you can then change the setting in the bios to enable usb support for the mouse and keyboard

674317
ubuntu	linux
my final question is am i able to use one of the existing linux partitions for a backup and install ubuntu 12.04 without removing neither windows nor ubuntu 11.04

674319
ubuntu	linux
particularly i ve got an old partition with a dead linux lying there and i would like to check what was its ubuntu version

674323
nas	qnap
buy a professionally made nas like qnap synology etc

674326
google-chrome	firefox
the same problem happened to my friends laptop but the difference is that it behaved same weather he browse internet or play games and after sometime it went blank.the solution i found was heating up its gpu but its temporary because it goes blank after a month.i am not sure if its your case.also when he uses firefox it happens soon compared to google-chrome

674330
ubuntu	linux
i have a linux ubuntu machine which has an x gb hard disk

674336
put	get
your best bet would likely be to get a network attached storage appliance nas remove your acer hard drive from its chassis and put it into your nas

674390
daemon	cron
i think this might be adequate solution as when the cron daemon starts up most or all relevant kernel boot messages are already printed in the kernel message buffer and sent to syslog too

674390
daemon	cron
of course there is most likely something starting after the cron daemon so if you rotate your log at when the cron daemon starts you probably will have something from this boot going to the next version of the file

674394
ubuntu	linux
a good example of the differences of what comes with linux would be to compare the install process of ubuntu versus arch

674429
disk	ram
what you could do is grab the deb rpm file unpackage it to a ram disk and then symlink all the files to the right locations but that would be a nightmare

674430
bluetooth	usb
basically you can send sms from your mobile connected in the same lan or via usb bluetooth

674449
hfs+	ntfs
i cannot speak to git but i found that cvs was horrendously slow on both osx s hfs+ and on windows s ntfs

674449
hfs+	ntfs	filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	hfs+
lousy filesystems ntfs hfs+ may certainly be one or two orders of magnitude slower for other source control systems

674538
arp	udp
the udp ip port mapping allows your router to know which local private ip address to forward the wol magic packet to but if the target machine has been asleep for more than 2 minutes or so the router won t have its mac address in the router s arp cache anymore so the router won t know which mac address to put on the packet at the link-layer

674543
children	parent
this will indirectly read up on controlling terminal and session leader terminate the shell process which causes its children to either terminate or because their parent is now gone be reparented to init

674547
wan	lan
the netgear points to the xfinity router as the default gateway and i have my patch cable running from one of the lan ports on the xfinity router to the wan port on the netgear router

674567

what can i do in excel for filtering sorting to keep rows 1 and 2 together as category 1 instead of the first row as category 1 and the second as category

674605
udp	tcp	icmp	udp	icmp	tcp
ping packets is a type of icmp packets.is there any relation between icmp with tcp.in other can we guaranty their arrival in the network i want to know icmp packets in the network is tcp or udp or which one or non of them

674607
post	put
it seems very logical to put the original sender to the reply-to header so this is the reason for the question at the beginning of my post

674612
icmp	tcp
is there any relation between icmp with tcp

674612
icmp	tcp
icmp is ip protocol 1 tcp is ip protocol 6

674612
icmp	tcp
typically icmp is not sent within any type of framework that uses acknowledgements and timeouts like tcp does

674612
udp	tcp	icmp	udp	icmp	tcp
i want to know icmp packets in the network is tcp or udp or which one or non of them

674632
folder	directory
this will list all files and directory modified in folder to monitor and all its subdis

674638
tunnel	vpn
vpns can be utilized for loads of cool stuff but for your scenario you only need to be concerned with using a vpn to tunnel your internet traffic

674638
tunnel	vpn
you can instead use a vpn to tunnel your internet traffic through a server in the us and cut out that question ever being asked to the modem

674664
put	get
where you put stuff does not matter so much as documenting where you put stuff preferably to the point that you are not required to decipher it whether you win the lottery or get hit by a truck

674668
skype	hangout
i would like to be able to control say google hangout or skype volume with the chat wheel and all other audio with the other wheel

674680
filesystems	ntfs
ntfs is not alone but it is the most prone of the popular modern filesystems

674712
wan	lan
you re probably in the wan uplink trunk modem ports on the belkin change that to on of the regular lan downstream ports

674714
vmware	virtualbox
instead of using vmware or virtualbox i used the default hyper-v program to do it

674717
put	get
lets put it this way would you get on an airplane whose flight computers had memory errors but looked ok otherwise

674718
post	get
the moment i change the speed of the ethernet post to 10mbps full duplex it starts detecting the cable and i am able to successfully dial up a connection and finally get on to the internet

674722
centos	linux
on a centos linux you can select display options from system- preferences- display

674739
wan	lan
you have to setup your 2nd router as an access point and also disable dhcp and you have to give the 2nd router a static ip and finally you have to use the lan port not the wan

674763
mouse	keyboard
whether you re using a pc with a touch screen or one with a mouse and keyboard knowing some of the basic actions in windows 8.1 and windows rt 8.1 can go a long way toward helping you use your pc quickly and efficiently

674777
mouse	keyboard
the issue would come to the difference in hardware cpu ram hdd wireless bluetooth keyboard mouse and others that i forgot to mention

674828
hide	show
i do not want to hide the icon entirely but rather just not show the green background

674857

674864
quad	shading
the tessellation shading unit gets as an input an arbitrary mesh like a quad triangle line .. and can subdivide it dynamically into multiple primitives

674883
versioning	upgrade
the issue is that virtualisation is enabled in my bios and i also made sure my bios is upgrade to the latest versioning

674890
rpm	yum
i am using centos 6.4 and usually install package through yum or by direct install rpm

674891
windows	winpe
is the error message a grub4dos error message or a windows winpe error message

674906
post	get
also i had to disconnect and reconnect four times just to get to this edit screen- and will likely have to do the same just to post it- it s that bad

674934
xfce	gnome	xfce	kde	kde	gnome
the idea is that typically you either need a server and then this typically mean text mode or a workstation and then this usually means some desktop environment like gnome or kde or xfce or whatever

674950
ubuntu	linux
i have linux installed on my pc along with linux ubuntu

674965
debian-based	ubuntu
my question is since ubuntu is debian-based does that make it consume more resources than its base system

674969
debian	mint	ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	debian
debian is the mother if you like of both ubuntu and mint and is focused more on stability and security than cutting edge features

674969
ubuntu	debian
in terms of system resources from experience debian is lighter weight than ubuntu but that s subjective and i m sure could be argued against - ambiguous enough

674975
postfix	dovecot
i m trying to achieve this fun project of having multiple postfix dovecot instances inside a docker container

674986
robocopy	xcopy
i m rather new to command line usage but ive been enjoying the hell out of it using powershell xcopy and robocopy

674986

in access point ap mode rt-n66u connects to a wireless router through an ethernet cable to extend the wireless signal coverage to other network clients

675004
debian	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	linux
depending on the gnu linux distribution you re using nilfs might be an option available straight out of the box at least debian and ubuntu offer it with apt-get

675013
filesystems	btrfs
another possibility are copy-on-write filesystems like btrfs

675022
versioning	upgrade
i bought a hp pavilion sleekbook three months ago which comes with two gigabytes of memory and i upgrade last week putting one module with 4 gigabytes of crucial and have updated windows 8 to 8.1 versioning

675025
mouse	keyboard
using the last wake command powercfg -lastwake would always produce the last reason for wake noting that it was either wol or usb device mouse keyboard

675025
mouse	keyboard
the only thing connected to the machine is the power and ethernet cable because i rdp in to the machine when i want to use it so i know it isn t a usb device keyboard or mouse that is doing it because none is attached

675047
vim	emacs
also for this purpose a vim mode which is part of the emacs standard library counts as default because you can invoke it on any properly installed emacs via m-x vim-mode ret or similar.

675050
x86	64bit
to fix it just install the latest version of cygwin and either modify the path so that the folder to ssh.exe that comes with cygwin appears before or copy the following files into c program files git bin or program files x86 if youâ re on 64bit

675059
width	height
again look at the docs but these options will print the file name and resolution on an image f prints the file name w and h print the width height in pixels

675064
jobs	cron
this command can easily be scripted inserted in you .bashrc file or in at cron jobs regularly monitoring network access all without the raspberry pi

675106
ubuntu	linux
the installation that was prepared for me was ubuntu 11.10 64 bit ubuntu 11.10 gnu linux 2.6.18-348.4.1.el5.028stab107.1 x86_64

i have already checked the basic components of the pc ram hard disk wlan card are pluged in and working

675129
udp	tcp
transport tcp udp etc.

675129
arp	icmp
for the icmp reply things work in pretty much the same way except that the responding computer doesn t need to send an arp request since it received a packet with an l2 l3 pair it can install that directly to the arp cache instead

675135
put	get
get a piece of aluminum foil and stick it onto a piece of tape then put it on sd

675141

with top running try toggling the display with the i key to show and hide idle tasks

675174
macports	homebrew
it s probably best to install it using macports or homebrew

675194
width	margin
if i copy text from a pdf file or a website that has a narrow width margin those margin settings are preserved when pasted into word or onenote

675195
chown	chmod	chown	mount	777	fstab
chmod mount directory to 777 chown mount directory to user 1001 and group to user will need this for fstab entry if i can get it to mount manually

675204
freebsd	solaris	freebsd	linux
as for sas controllers lsi sas sata controllers seem to be well supported by almost everyone be it windows linux freebsd or solaris variants

675229
ubuntu	linux
is that a fairly common thing to do in linux ubuntu

675288
sudo	passwd
but i can t achieve that with sudo command since it will ask for passwd

675288
sudo	passwd
or is there any way to pass the passwd for sudo commands in the plink itself

675294
sudo	passwd
you can setup sudo to allow the user to use sudo with no passwd and be able to run only that one command

675296
dropbox	skydrive
this approach requires no 3rd-party apps other than dropbox skydrive or similar

675323
jobs	cron
i use - do inquire for a discount and cron jobs

675327
filesystems	fat
is not your home directory on fat filesystems or do not you have noacl in etc fstab or

675332
stdout	stderr
if you want an error output to be expanded in then you have to redirect the descriptor 2 - stderr to the descriptor 1 - stdout

675335
dropbox	imgur
this issue occurs when with any file type .zip .msi .msg .png .url etc of any size from any source dropbox sourceforge imgur even tiny and locally-generated blobs created by my own chrome extension etc

675338

what command should i use to convert a mp3 file to wav whose bitrate is variable

675349

when i had to use firefox i eventually find an extension that can provide the same mechanism that opera provides see that discussion here

675411
rss	feed
i can t seem to find a way to subscribe to rss feed provided by feedburner using ie11

675505
dpkg	aptitude
it will also not help if a user installs a package from source or uses aptitude or dpkg directly

675524
disk	ram
chosing the right mount options for example writing to disk instantly instead of caching it in the ram i don t know how to do this

675587
dropbox	skydrive
use skydrive dropbox and google drive together for uber backup security

675607
nas	qnap
iâ m trying to connect to my samba share in my qnap nas from a windows 8 client

675608
nas	qnap
qnap may have an upgraded firmware for your nas which supports smb 2.24 or newer and the smb signing necessary for native communication with newer windows clients

675611
filesystems	ntfs
the first step i took was to format the hard drive partition on a mac system with windows nt filesystems tuxera ntfs

675614
pull	push
so when you try any action that requires connection to an external repository push pull clone it just hangs

675617
udp	tcp
two exceptions were added when utorrent was installed one for tcp and one for udp

675619
versioning	upgrade
if that s the case why does every major upgrade to the .net framework deprecate some star feature from the previous versioning

675626
udp	tcp
you can also use winpcap www.winpcap.org while you run the utorrent check to verify that indeed udp and tcp packages are being sent to the pc you ll run both utorrent and winpcap from the same pc you re testing

675651
ethernet	wireless
you still need to connected your wired ethernet port to the ap or connect to it from your internal wireless adapter

675653
daemons	systemd
there are options to control the frequency you pool your peers you can set options to send a burst of sync packets when the daemons starts so you daemons can get the determine the correct time quickly but this doesn t mean your systemd clock will be immediately corrected

675658
udp	tcp
select tcp or udp as protocol or select both

675664
disk	ram
it is a ram disk

675664
disk	ram
ram disk and dev in linux

675664
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu as many modern linux distributions uses devtmpfs file system for the dev directory

675680
mouse	keyboard
however if i restart the mouse and keyboard don t work once windows boots mouse and keyboard do work during bios etc

675688
multiplying	division
this is easy to do using integer division divide by the unit and discard the remainder then multiplying by the unit - this will always truncate round down but remember that you already added half a unit

675693
google-chrome	firefox
the replies will be cached by the programs needing them but these programs don t share them - so if you visit a website with both google-chrome and firefox they will both independently look up the address to use

675742
ethernet	wireless
are your ip addresses in the same range ie ethernet range is in 192.168.1.x and so is wireless if so the wireless and its gateway might be stealing the traffic and not knowing how to get it back

675742
ethernet	wireless
if your home network is 192.168.1.x let your wireless grab one of those give the ethernet connections a manual address

675742
mouse	keyboard
then make sure you have the client computer with no keyboard mouse configured to use the server s 2.x address

675744
traceroute	packets
root lab1 # traceroute -n 8.8.8.8 traceroute to 8.8.8.8 8.8.8.8 30 hops max 60 byte packets

rss	feed
how would i go about if i want to create an rss feed of a page that basically is or has no rss feed

675778

puts	gets
if you install a software for all users it gets put in the regular program files folders located in the root of the c drive- and any user on that computer that can access said c drive can run the applications installed onto it unless a user puts a lock onto those folders which is unadvised as the applications themselves often cannot bypass the locks put on their folders

675990

if the cpu was 2.0 ghz does that mean in a time slice for process a that the processors was executing 2 billion steps per second if at 100 cap but would only be executing 200 million steps if at 10 cap

vmware	virtualbox
virtualbox is the only free solution for this that i am aware of and it is a bit tricky to set up i managed to get ubuntu 12.04 w software raid running on a windows 7 host. i haven t purchased vmware workstation edition but supposedly there is support for the same operation

folder	directory
i can connect fine and everything works fine until i try to access a folder with an asterisk in it and then windows will complain with the filename directory name or volume label syntax is incorrect.

676084
ubuntu	linux
i would recommend you look at using ubuntu desktop if you have no prior linux experience and follow either a guide for setting up an l2tp server or a guide for setting up a pptp server

676084
centos	linux	debian	linux	debian	centos
there are plenty of other guides out there for other linux flavors such as debian centos etc also using other vpn protocols such as openvpn - but i am fairly certain openvpn requires a third party application be installed on the client operating system

logmein	hamachi
for some reason when i started up logmein hamachi today i use it to host minecraft servers easily when only a few people will play at a time i could not launch my minecraft server because it threw cannot bind to port

676162
folder	directory
the problem is that any program you install has access to this variable and can create files and folder inside this directory

676172
folder	directory
i tested it with a directory containing multiple nested files and folder and it worked perfectly

676174
rar	zip
also if you are copying compressed files zip rar 7z etc. you can verify them with the builtin crc32 hashes.

676176
filesystems	ntfs
as the name suggests ntfs junction points work only with ntfs filesystems - but who would nowadays format his system drive as fat32

just use ms mouse and keyboard center to reconfigure the behavior triggered when clicking the wheel to close apps

debian	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	linux
i choose linux and it gave me the sub category to choose from a whole bunch of versions such as debian ubuntu other and the 64 bit versions of them

676237

speaking of requirements and compatibility mint should work fine with ubuntu presets

676237
ubuntu	linux
in case of setup failing take notes on what hardware player had assigned for the ubuntu preset then create new vm bit this time choosing other linux 3.x kernel and configure identical hardware

676242
ubuntu	linux
the simplest way to proceed is to use a linux live distribution like ubuntu s

676242
ubuntu	linux
you download to your pc the installation iso file for ubuntu you put it onto a usb stick you can use a utility called unetbootin which exists in both windows and linux versions boot from the usb stick choose the option try ubuntu instead of install ubuntu open a terminal issue the commands

676245
debian	mint	ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	debian
mint is a spin-off of ubuntu which is a spin-off of debian

676245

so first preference is ubuntu 64bit then debian 64bit

there is an ubuntu-based mint and a debian-based mint edition called lmde based on debian-testing

i am aware of this related question however it is three years old and the only response is about firefox how can i add my firefox and google-chrome history to windows search

676306
mouse	keyboard
however unlike other mice where you have to say switch button 13 with button 2 this mouse sends some key press events as if you had typed on the keyboard

676306
mouse	keyboard
it is relatively easy to map a mouse button to a keyboard keycode but is it possible to do the opposite without crippling the system s keyboard

676317
google-chrome	firefox
could have come from a firefox or google-chrome update installation or perhaps it was from when i downloaded and installed netbeans 7.4 a couple of weeks ago

676337

if you use centos not scientific linux then you will have to import their gpg key from here using

for reference these are what i expect the ordinary unable to resolve host pages to look like on firefox and google-chrome

676421
google-chrome	firefox
i ve run firefox in safe mode and google-chrome in an incognito tab and the problem is still present in both ruling out problematic add-ons

676429
folder	directory
so why don t you just move it to a self chosen separate directory and log in a txt file in this separate folder where the file originally was

676450
filesystems	ntfs
filesystems type -- since windows xp windows has favored the new technology filesystems ntfs for storing data

676450
filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	fat
ntfs like other filesystems such as the older fat or various filesystems used by linux and os x is a set of data structures that facilitate naming files locating them on a disk and so on

676450
filesystems	ntfs
any filesystems can be used with either mbr or gpt or other partition table types so your statement that the computer was running on gpt partition and not ntfs conflates partition tables and filesystems

676450
filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	fat
afaik both windows 7 and windows 8 require the use of ntfs for the boot partition but can use fat or via third-party drivers various other filesystems for data partitions

676450
filesystems	ntfs
you must use ntfs as your boot usually c filesystems whether your partition table type is gpt or mbr and if you use additional data partitions you ll probably want to use ntfs on them

676489
folder	directory
also if you re using a network folder to store your user directory in you of course should make sure you have network access to that folder before logging in how you accomplish that is a separate question

676492
mouse	keyboard
also the keyboard controls the computer where the mouse is currently

676492
mouse	keyboard

676511
sudo	passwd
to test this i log in with the new user through ssh and i find that the user can sudo and it prompts for root s passwd and as the new user enters the root passwd the user gets root access

676525
traceroute	packets
if you believe its packets being dropped from a command prompt do a pathping it combines traceroute and ping and can help identify if and where packets loss is occurring

676539
gmail	hotmail
of course this is easy if they use a big email provider like gmail or hotmail but some of my customers have their own websites and email server usually by paying a third party to set them up 2 years ago and are unlikely to have the information necessary understand how to go on the hosting service website and get the email server info

676567
traceroute	packets
a very simple to use free tool - mtr matts traceroute or the windows equivalent win mtr will show the path to a given host along with packets loss and times so anyone can easily see where packets loss is coming in

16-bit	64bit
it would be perfectly possible to make a cpu that works with data in 64bit chunks which would make it a 64bit cpu even though it has a 16-bit address bus

676874
filesystems	ntfs
with modern filesystems such as ntfs ext4 and so on the limits are high enough that you are unlikely to hit them with a single disk although it may be a concern if you have a large storage array

676874
filesystems	ntfs
for example ntfs the filesystems supports file sizes of up to 16 eib although the ntfs implementation in windows is currently artificially limited to a maximum file size of just under 256 tib raised from 16 tib by the release of windows 8 and windows server 2012

dual booting is handled by grub2 the linux distribution i use is debian wheezy which was installed with default options so it overwrote the windows master boot record

676887
width	height
the smallest size of the picture should be exactly 180 no matter if it is the width or height

676925
filesystems	ntfs
windows can t read ext filesystems so you should have a ntfs or fat32 partition with enough space

openpgp does not know a central certificate authority like x509 s mime does so you need to find a trust path from you to the probable key owner in the web of trust yourself

versioning	upgrade
that way you can do a fresh install of fedora to a newer versioning instead of an upgrade while preserving all of your personal data completely unchanged in the home partition

678302
versioning	upgrade
so you will accumulate errors over time if you repeatedly upgrade from one versioning of fedora to another without ever doing a clean install

678302
filesystems	ntfs
ext4 is a journaling filesystems so it better manages the storage of the data on it without needing to be constantly defragmented like the ntfs filesystems does

filesystems	btrfs
for a little more safety you may want to consider using a checksumming filesystems such as zfs or btrfs to help protect against low-level data corruption

ethernet	wireless
when the wireless drops happen does wired ethernet access to the internet still work the whole time

678487
ethernet	wireless
to test leave a machine plugged in via ethernet to a lan port on the e1200 make sure you ve turned off wireless on that machine and leave it doing once-per-second pings of an ip address of a reliable box somewhere at your isp or elsewhere on the internet

678571
arp	dhcp
this makes you less visible you will not be listed in the dhcp client list and you will fall off the arp table quickly when you are silent

after upgrading to a samsung 840 ssd drive i have problems with image backups failing verification when the ssd is plugged into any of the ich9 sata ports in ahci mode

678610

i have already made the registry tweaks to enable ahci when i installed the ssd i changed the sata ports from ide to ahci

678615
ubuntu	linux
you can also run linux as an application within windows an example is andlinux which is based on an old ubuntu

678666
cpu	affinity
furthermore if i set the cpu affinity for the prime95 process to limit it to a single logical cpu then it also reached its max frequency around 2.9ghz higher turbo since the other cores were idle

678666
vmware	virtualbox
but my larger concern is that i experienced the same problem with both virtualbox and vmware workstation 7.1

using microsoft remote desktop on the imac 24 the mouse and keyboard stop responding and i have to kill the remote session - sometimes after a few minutes more often after a few seconds

679105
mouse	keyboard
i can still see activity remotely after the mouse and keyboard fail so i know it s not the connection

679105
mouse	keyboard
on my macbook though the mouse and keyboard work for a whole session and i ve never seen them fail

679105
mouse	keyboard
i ve measures the ping time from the imac to my workstation at work and sometimes it s way up there at 300ms but most often it s around 16ms but apart from lag it doesn t seem to make a difference i m connected on the macbook right now and the ping time is 300-400ms so the connection is very laggy but the keyboard and mouse still work.

679105
mouse	keyboard
i tried today running microsoft remote desktop on the imac with thousands of colours rather than the default of millions and in a window of size 1024x768 - but the mouse and keyboard still stopped responding remotely

679105
bluetooth	usb	mouse	keyboard
the macbook is running oxs lion and has intel gma graphics and the imac is running mavericks and has an ati radeon 2600 with 256mb of ram using a bluetooth magic mouse and a wired usb keyboard

679114
udp	tcp
now that i ve gotten all that out of my system the process we re probably looking at is hole punching and in most cases some flavour of tcp hole punching since udp is an option and i don t see any indication that sync uses another transport mechanism it also has an option for port mapping via upnp - which from experience is faster

679172
fish	bash
so i have set to in both bash and fish

centos	linux	ubuntu	centos	ubuntu	linux
is an internet connection required to install a gui in linux distros like centos 6.4 or ubuntu server from the terminal

679292

nowadays most linux distributions come with a gui gnome kde etc already installed

but this version of windows only support ps 2 input devices keyboard mouse

679373

so is there any methods to use usb based mouse and keyboard as ps 2 standard

679374

by default virtualbox emulates a standard ps 2 keyboard and mouse

679406
filesystems	ntfs
hard disk s filesystems is set to ntfs which in theory should support efs

679441
arp	icmp
all packets use the network and data-link layer and tcpdump can log l2 protocols like arp and non-ip protocols at l3 icmp so yes and no i guess

679470
stdout	stderr
this java commands output does not go to the stdout stream with you can re-direct with but it goes to stderr

679492
filesystems	ntfs
ubuntu however can access windows partitions the ntfs-3g driver provides support for the ntfs filesystems so you could reboot into ubuntu and copy files from it

679559
png	ico
from the shell use the following command to convert png to ico

679564
filesystems	fat
if you are using a fat filesystems you might want to set core.ignorecase to true as well

679586
disk	ram
think of it this way all resources of the virtual machine come from the physical machine ram disk cpu and network

679593
vmware	virtualbox	virtualbox	parallels
are you running any vm software such as vmware parallels virtualbox qemu etc

679598

i know how to use gitbash but i don t know how to get to my network places area within it so that i can create a git repository of a folder within a directory of my ftp site which is in network places

679676
macports	homebrew
alternatively you may prefer to install git the corresponding git bash completion via macports sudo port install git-core +bash_completion or via homebrew following the respective install steps for each

679676
macports	homebrew
the main gotcha for bash completion is that it requires a newer version of bash 4.1 than comes w osx by default so you will want to install use the newer bash that comes with macports homebrew etc

679688
versioning	upgrade
i am trying to upgrade scrapy v 0.18.4 to the latest versioning which i believe is 0.20.0 on a mac

679897
debian	linux
i m using synergy to use the keyboard of my main computer windows 7 for my secondary computer debian linux running on a virtual box under windows 7

679950
disk	ram
problem with using a ram disk is that stuff goes bye bye if there is a power failure - and you need to repopulate the ram disk with files on boot anyway so its probably not worthwhile doing in the general case - unless you have programs which write lots of temporary files which you can point to a ram disk

679952
ethernet	wireless
if you really wanted to make it work with the mac pro being the way the airport express connects to the network you could probably make it work by using internet sharing on the mac pro to make it act as a wi-fi ap and home gateway router but then do something to block it from being a dhcp server on its wireless interface kill bootpd or use ipfw or pf to block bootpd s packets from getting out and then create a bridge device and add the ethernet and the wi-fi interface to the bridge device

679972
mouse	keyboard
the mouse and keyboard randomly stop working for a few seconds and sometimes the system freezes all together

679978
mouse	keyboard
you might be able to configure a keyboard shortcut in windows then bind that to something on linux or to passthrough the mouse to the vm possibly

680007
google-chrome	firefox
note i don t have the ask toolbar installed on any browser ie firefox or google-chrome so if i or one my kids did ever install it by mistake the toolbar itself has been removed

680026
truecrypt	umount
in os x i can umount a truecrypt drive from finder as it gets listed under the devices sidebar

680026
truecrypt	umount
does the umount from finder provide the same protection as dismounting via the truecrypt application

680043
png	ico
to make it easier use xnview context menu to convert a downloaded png foxit icon to ico and put it in the foxit reader folder

680053
google-chrome	firefox
the only downside is that is not free and is buggy it crashed every two-three minutes the entire google-chrome process while in firefox it crashed adobe flash player plugin

680089

ssd	sata
i m going to buy a new desktop pc and i m thinking about buying a 32gb ssd sata iii and a 1tb hdd sata iii hard drive

680172
put	get
so which drive should i put in sata iii so i can get better over all performance

680176
ssd	sata
a modern ssd however can use more than sata ii speeds and will be faster on a sata iii bus

680176
ssd	sata
in practise this means you should put the ssd on the sata iii port and you might see s light speed gain

680181
ubuntu	debian
dd if my file.img of dev sda and use gparted to grow the partition to the new disk s full size afterwards thus having an image as easy to use as the hybrid disk images debian or ubuntu release for their live systems which you can write directly to usb sticks with dd but i only want to use them on plain hard disks

680222
put	get	ssd	sata
put the ssd at the sata iii port to get the best performance and not limit the speed of the ssd

680222
ssd	sata
the hdd will never reach the limit of sata ii but modern ssd currently also hitting the sata iii limit

680258
disk	ram
i want to run tests and create a test database for it the data files being located on a ram disk

680258
sudo	passwd
if sudo is unavoidable is there a way to enter admin passwd only once so that subsequent test runs would not require it

680266
cpu	processors
the host cpu is amd athlon 64 x2 4000+ dual core processors with 2.1 ghz

680287
put	get
hopefully others will have better solutions or be able to point you to a better forum this is a particularly bad hackish solution and i suspect the forum is wrong but one very crude way of doing this might be to get a ups with a serial port and notification software which can launch a program do something you can interface detect in a programming language and then put a switch inline between the ups and wall socket don t connect the ups to the computer of-course so that the loss of power toggles an alarm on the ups software

680289
width	height
if you want to make row column looks square please select all cells those you want to make square and change the height of row to 28.8 and change the width of column to 4.56

680347
pop-up	dialog
i don t know whether you ll find this to be an acceptable workaround but when trying this on windows 7 with internet explorer 9 clicking the ie icon in the taskbar or if multiple windows are open the menu item for the correct window in the pop-up menu seems to bring both the main ie window and the dialog to the top

680387
folder	directory
so to do this i downloaded the specific jdk-1_5_0_22-solaris-sparc.sh but the question is will change the environment this file or only extract to specified folder the lib s directory

680417
folder	directory
if you downloaded it to downloads the download folder in your home directory then first cd there

680423
ethernet	wireless
tl-pa411kit plus a wireless adapter or a wireless router such as tp-link tl-wr702n which would create another wifi access from the ethernet cable in the other part of the house

680455

is there a way to use the operator in tcsh similar to bash

680456

all is fine but i have to delete all sentences what contain file does not exists along with the short numbers between virus name and the md5 hash

680550
folder	dir
dir a showed me the folder which can be safely deleted

680582
vpn	lan
it is a nuisance to have to teach to all machines in your lan how to contact the remote vpn server

680582
vpn	lan
so basically what you want is a machine that acts both as a router to your lan and as a client to the remote vpn server

680582
vpn	lan
alternatively you can set up an old pc if you have one to act as a router vpn client and dhcp server to your lan

680602
switching	screens
the whole idea was to watch a video tutorial in mpc on secondary extended monitor while working on primary screens with active windows and do not bother to switching the windows to make seek backward and seek forward buttons work

680604
ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	linux
i would prefer you to install linux mint in case of ubuntu because it is light and doesn t cause trouble

680612
folder	directory
just create this folder in mercury directory and all will be fine

680641
folder	directory
this isnâ t a problem for most programs because they donâ t normally write to their installation directory after they are installed but some programs are poorly designed or really old and write user settings and such to the program directory instead of to the user folder

680641
folder	directory
what happens is that when a non-admin user runs a program that tries to read or write to the installation directory instead of directly accessing the file-system they access it through a shim which intercepts such file operation requests and redirects them to a directory in the user folder as necessary

680699
google-chrome	firefox
if your computer screen is displaying video ram artifacts then it would show up first in web browsers like internet explorer firefox and google-chrome because these web browsers use a lot of ram

i try to show only the presenter view with speaker notes and to hide the presentation view

680836
ubuntu	debian
you can configure a 6in4 tunnel on debian ubuntu like this

680842
mouse	keyboard
if you don t want to use keyboard shortcuts windows key + arrow left right and or you want to be more flexible 4 windows per screen there are two options to snap-resize through your mouse

680855
udp	tcp
layer 4 just deals with how do i tell one connection from another tell that its intact in the right order and all related to the same conversation tcp udp

680855
put	get
l4 segments need to be passed across the internetwork so they get put l3 packet which in turn gets put in an l2 frame and finally is converted into an electrical signal

680886
filtering	grouping
if you don t have any filtering grouping yet click add filtering grouping

680886
opera	google-chrome
to add this filter in google-chrome or opera

680886
opera	google-chrome
now if you are on google-chrome or opera there is currently no way to do that automatically - you will have to go into adblock plus options and edit the filter manually

680923
subnet	packets
will not work out of the box with a routed solution which may be a hindrance samba like i said or a plus for instance with a routed solution you do not waste precious bandwidth to send icmp packets from one subnet to the other

680951
ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	linux
normally you install software or deb packages on ubuntu mint linux via synaptic ubuntu software center ppa or an apt-get command from the terminal

680951
redhat	fedora
in another hand fedora centos mandriva and redhat support rpm packages

680951
debian	linux	debian	mint	ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	linux
someday you have to install rpm package to your ubuntu mint linux debian box there is a utility called alien alien will converts packages from one format to another with ease

680951
debian	linux	debian	mint	ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	linux
here is how to install rpm packages on ubuntu linux mint or debian

680954
redhat	fedora
to install java runtime environment on fedora oracle linux redhat enterprise linux etc

680954
redhat	fedora

pop-up	dialog
switch user and log out i can still find under in the dialog that pop-up when i press f4 on the desktop but the undock option is missing completely

680976
folder	directory
so i downloaded and extracted the linux kernel 3.8.9 source code and placed the folder in the main directory

680978
hash	salt
are they using salt hash

680989
arp	dhcp
arp has only with this to do because the dhcp gives only the ip-address of the dns to send him packets thus ask the ip-addresses of hostnames from that first an arp resolution is needed

680989
arp	udp
4 windows asks the mac address of your dns and before your first outgoing packet your routers with an arp request which is just broadcasted udp

680999
sudo	passwd
of course you can also configure sudo to not require a passwd but that s really a different question with plenty of answers already available

681024
move	drag
use move copy or drag your page with the formulas into the new spreadsheet

681025
putty	winscp
click ok and then try to launch putty from within winscp

681031
mouse	keyboard
the mouse and a screen are frozen now but the hardware seems to be still working the network and hard disk leds are blinking from time to time but the keyboard is probably not responding

681031
disk	ram
i m thinking about hibernation or getting ram contents to an external hard disk in some way before i reboot if it s possible

681041
disk	ram
also if entirely hopeless one time i heard of some kind of forensics tool that you reboot your computer it boots from usb or cd-drive and it dumps the entire ram to disk using little memory as possible to not overwrite existing contents

681052
versioning	upgrade
i considered installing papers3 but that requires a new versioning of mac os x which i cannot upgrade to since my mac laptop is older

681101
ethernet	wireless
why not bridge the automation network to the home network using a wireless ethernet bridge if necessary

681125
cifs	smb
i believe microsoft added something to the filesystem to implement something similiar but i haven t seen it used and i don t know if the smb cifs protocol even supports them

681131
ubuntu	debian
dsl is debian based so you can add the debian or ubuntu repos and then then just do the normal stuff

681133
ati	nvidia
currently i m using a ati and a nvidia card in my workstation at work with no issues though i m on windows 7

681135
disk	ram
because it recovers after a reboot we know it is a problem with running out of ram not disk space and we know that your computer seems to have less free ram the longer it is left running

681143
ubuntu	linux
i m using chromium version 30.0.1599.114 ubuntu 12.10 under linux

681147
ubuntu	linux
the fact is once disabled fastboot secureboot everything needed i installed ubuntu linux with 13.04 allok but wifi wasn t working

681174
packets	multicast
to make things more complex what if there is another intervlan router between the host and igds and the intervlan router forwards the upnp packets to the igds vlans using multicast routing

681263
mp4	webm
i am encoding these webm and wave files to generate a mp4 file using ffmpeg avconv

681284
disk	ram
this solution is without the ram disk but it most of the solution to start postgresql server in user space is here

681284
disk	ram
to run all this on a ram disk make

681328
opera	google-chrome
google-chrome ie opera are not impacted

681328
pop-up	dialog
i tried my coworker s machine and it has 8000 mb ram the same happens high memory usage and 1 processor reaches 100 when it reaches 4096 mb usage a dialog pop-up asking to kill firefox maybe firefox is hardcoded to use only 4096 mb

681335
sudo	passwd
set up sudo to allow you to run pm-suspend with no passwd

681335
sudoers	visudo
if you re not used to vi you can also edit the file etc sudoers directly but using visudo is safer

681345
udp	tcp
at the very least you would need to deny outgoing tcp and udp packets on port 3306

681345
udp	tcp
but even safer would be to deny all tcp and udp packets on port 3306

681443
disk	ram
prices for ram and disk storage differ by an order of magnitude even today

681447
centos	linux
os is centos linux

681678
mouse	keyboard
i ve unplugged all peripherals to check whether it went away even mouse and keyboard

681696
google-chrome	firefox
i am assuming the easiest way to permanently and automatically bypass it using google-chrome or firefox - without turning off javascript altogether - is to create a simple userscript to remove this string of html code from the page as doing so with developer tools confirms it removes the restriction so in the userscript effectively have it replace this string

681714
ubuntu	linux
apparently linux system can cope with packages meant for different architectures using multiarch ubuntu 11+

681834
folder	directory
something that will be extremely useful if you re going to have problems with drives and drive letters is to makes a liked directory to a folder on the external hard drive

681834
filesystems	ntfs
your computer needs the nt filesystems ntfs and if you have window xp or anything higher it should

681834
folder	directory
this command will make a folder looks like a shortcut but it is not a shortcut inside of c users username documents called virtual machines virtual machines is vmware s default directory for the user s virtual machines and it will hold the files of x my work files vmware which would be your encrypted folder on your encrypted hard drive every program will see it as a standard folder that holds files and when a program like vmware goes to access the files it reads the successfully just off the external hard drive but it still thinks it s going after files in your documents there shouldn t be problems with any programs when using this

681835
filesystems	hfs
i ran a deeper search in testdisk and it found 50 partitions most of which say the filesystems is mac hfs the others are ms data

681859

682059
post	get
i ll post confirmation if i get a freeze free day today

682075
udp	tcp	icmp	udp	icmp	tcp
in this case protocols like tcp behave better than icmp or udp because they re-transmit packets which have not been received by the target giving you the wrong impression of a properly working connection

682092
width	height
but it would be convenient if i could set up a window width height size automatically

682092
width	height
is there a way to resize os windows easily to a stored preferred width and height

682142
jobs	cron
you can check cron jobs list by crontab -l

682144
ubuntu	linux
so the question is does anyone have any experience or knowledge about using ubuntu or at least any linux on this laptop

682205

then when you do get to upgrade you can go to system - change product key to put in your real one

682209
fat	hfs+	hfs+	ntfs	filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	fat	filesystems	hfs+
numerous different filesystems are available such as fat ntfs hfs+ ext4fs and so on

682209
filesystems	ntfs
if the ntfs partition you were trying to shrink shows up as being small in gdisk or another tool that modifies partitions only not filesystems then it might be worth trying to resize the partition

682266
configure	libtool
then when trying to install apache the . configure thing work but when i try to make i get this error libtool link cannot find the library usr local apr lib libapr-1.la or unhandled argument usr local apr lib libapr-1.la

how can i build a vpn from the server to the vps 2nd vpn server and reroute the ports trough the vpn tunnel to access my homeserver from the internet and bypass the provider s blocked network

682293

once you have set up a site-to-site tunnel it could be as simple as just providing the vpn ip address of your web server that hosts your content in apache

682297
mp3	flac
the problem here is that you re trying to burn audio files mp3 flac aac etc. without encoding them into the 16-bit pcm linear 44.1 khz format that is required by the compact disc digital audio device

682673
post	put
also it supports embedding so you can put it on your blog post your project documentation or in your conference talk slides

682758

you should instead connect one of the wireless routers to the other from the one that has is by the modem run the ethernet from one of its lan ports to the wan internet port of the second router

682775
udp	tcp
the discard protocol is the tcp udp equivalent of the unix filesystem node dev null

682775
udp	tcp
such a service is guaranteed to receive what is sent to it and can be used for debugging tcp and or udp code requiring a guaranteed reception of payload sent

682809
filesystems	ntfs
in windows and ntfs filesystems it say 0 bytes which is impossible

682810
switching	screens
it will get you directly to the user selection screens skipping two of the manual actions locking and selecting switching user

682819
folder	directory
the space an empty directory structure occupies depends on the name and folder path

682819
filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	fat
the most used filesystems at current time can be considered arguably as fat file allocation table and ntfs new technology filesystems

682819
filesystems	hfs+
although replaced by other more resilient filesystems such as nfts windows hfs+ osx or ext3 linux it is still widely used in handheld devices or in memory cards or flash drives as it is well supported by most os and above all it s simple

682819
folder	directory
it represents a directory aka folder and any file or folder stored within it has a 32 byte entry in the table

682819
folder	directory
so any folder or directory on a modern drive 512 mb has at least an overhead of 4 kb so as to store the table source

682851

debian	linux	debian	mint
i replaced the default iceweasel with firefox 25.0 from linux mint s debian package repo

682990
vpn	lan
if i have read your message correctly you are not interested in contacting the lan behind your vpn server but only in using it as a springboard to access the internet please correct me if i got this wrong

682990
vpn	lan
if instead you are also interested in reaching the lan behind your vpn router the situation is more complex

682993
disk	ram
i have a toshiba satellite c660 laptop which is having intel core i3 processor 2gb ram 512mb graphics along with 320gb hard disk

683068
folder	dir	folder	directory
it loops through all archives in the current directory .cbr and .cbz files it creates a clean name for each new file unzips the old file to the temp dir creates a new archive from the temp files and saves it with the clean name in the cleaned directory then clears out the temp folder

683073
daemons	launchd
as an aside if you want the web server to be started automatically on reboot you ll need to re-enable the launchd daemons entry for it

683078
debian	linux
i want to continuously write small media files 150-200 kb from a windows 7 desktop machine behind a home lan to a debian linux server in a data center over the internet

683081
versioning	upgrade
oh by the way centos 6.2 was release in june 2012 have you thought about an upgrade to a newer versioning

683132
debian	linux
you could install cygwin on your windows system and use cygwin s scp to copy files via ssh to your debian linux box

683135
folder	directory
if you re in the source directory the files are stored with relative paths so the test folder looks like test file1.txt not c temp test file1.txt

683190
unix	bsd
see here -- file descriptors and sockets are treated very differently in windows than on bsd unix linux

683190

also you should be connecting the connection to the first router into one of the lan ports of the router rather than the wan port

683626
mouse	keyboard
you could use screenly it actually can run in kiosk mode using uzbl and can even be interactive with a keyboard and mouse

i am currently using a computer in a corporate environment which is connected to the intranet through the ethernet adapter and to the internet through the wireless adapter

683841
ethernet	wireless
i am wondering if it is possible to bind for instance internet explorer to the ethernet adapter so i can access to the intranet and chrome and outlook to the wireless adapter so i can both surfer the internet and get emails when the wire is connected

683859
ubuntu	linux
you can install ubuntu or other linux distros on it and from there you have the ability to execute java and many other technologies

683926
put	get
to solve this problem i put a code word in the subject of the e-mails that get sent

683938
vim	emacs
you can use pico emacs or vi vim to do so

683948
mutt	msmtp
not msmtp put mail in sent but mutt

683991
fat	hfs+	hfs+	ntfs
the regulars like ntfs fat ext3fs mac hfs+ and so on don t do anything similar

684008
integer	unsigned
a port number is a 16-bit unsigned integer which means the range of ports available for use is from 1 to 65535 port number 0 is reserved and can t be used

684009

sublimetext	kate
case 2 - kate i tried opening things in kate to see if sublimetext was just being dumb

684040
google-chrome	firefox
i am wondering if there is a way in sublime to save a set of files to be open...sort of like how in google-chrome or firefox i can have a set of web page tabs that i can configured to be open with the click of one button

684058
folder	directory
i got some success on windows 7 creating a directory symbolic link in my desktop folder the one under userprofile

684083
ssd	sata
i d recommend going with a single smaller or two smaller sata ssd drives instead - the speed on that will be better than usb

684103
vmware	virtualbox
i am trying to install windows 8 on virtualbox so i need to turn on no-execute memory protection for it to work according to this article windows 8 on virtualbox and vmware your pc needs to restart fix

684114
folder	directory
create directory file in your packages folder ...packages renamefile rename_file.py

684119
put	get
similar setups with linux are possible or you could get a consumer router setup nat and put it between your instrument and the company network

684120
google-chrome	firefox
it won t be like firefox google-chrome

684137
filesystems	ntfs
ubuntu allows you to create custom partitions when installing so you might i haven t tried be able to make the filesystems ntfs from there and have it work out

684145

pull	push
most effective push or pull the air through the heatsink

684317
mouse	keyboard
at the moment i m using a wireless mouse and keyboard to control it

684317
mouse	keyboard
my question is will this remote be able to replace the mouse keyboard for daily use

684322
pull	push
i dont have an answer re air displacement but regarding push pull - the key is to aim the air out of the box usually towards the rear fan

684322
pull	push
so depending on orientation push the air if you position the fan on the far side of the heatsink pull the air if the fan is positioned between the heatsink and the rear fan or do both for maximum air displacement -

684322
pull	push
if you were asking using a single fan which is more effective - close side with pull or further side with push - then i would say that it matters less than other considerations

684322
width	height
for example in my case the height of the memory sticks their own heatsink combined with the width of the cpu heatsink meant my choices were limited anyway.

684324
pull	push
as for push vs pull - some people have tried experiments

684333
clang	llvm
i cannot find binaries for clang or llvm using cygwin s setup.exe

684336
mouse	keyboard
you can program shortcuts and macros with it but not use a full keyboard unless you display one on the screen and use the mouse to hit each key

684394
mouse	keyboard
the scheduler is invoked after servicing every interrupt keyboard mouse touchscreen network disk-transfer finished ... as well as the timer interrupts

684411
tunnel	vpn
you could try tunnel in with ssh instead of a vpn

684433
mouse	keyboard
i have a unifying receiver for mouse and keyboard

684433
mouse	keyboard
below is the output from lspci and lsusb and right now the wireless mouse and keyboard are not working

684438
spaces	delimiter
the only tricky part is the option -f is used to identify the delimiter between different fields and in this last case the delimiter takes on its default value a spaces

684444
sudo	passwd
when executing sudo -u ossec ssh root targetserver i am prompted to enter the root passwd

684466
vmware	virtualbox
however i am having problems running vmware and or virtualbox

684501
versioning	upgrade
forcibly upgrade i386 libgcc-related packages by installing with explicit versioning specified

684501

why there s no my versioning of a library even though i just upgrade fully

countif	sumifs
you can nest in an if sumifs or countif argument

684569
put	get
to get it to seamlessly work with my other machine i used git to put my project on bitbucket

684597
ubuntu	mint
i was going with mint 16 which i is based of ubuntu 13.04

684602
folder	directory
copying it from your windows pc to a flash drive and then putting it in a hidden folder on your linux pc named .fonts you may have to make the folder0 in your root directory

684619
bonjour	avahi	daemons	systemd
you didn t specify your operating systemd but on linux this is implemented by the avahi daemons and on mac by the bonjour service

684630

clang	llvm
llvm clang is still maintained but currently available only for x86

684669
fink	homebrew	fink	macports	macports	homebrew
it s probably part of a gnu package called fileutils and you can probably install it with homebrew macports or fink

684689
width	height
image width and height must be multiple of four

684689
width	height
what does this meanâ â i need six images side by side and width should equal height

684709
stdout	stderr
but in this way the stderr information will be omitted since only redirect the stdout to logfile

684709
stdout	stderr
so if you care about the error information of the command once it fail to execute then you need to combine stdout with stderr by using which means fold stderr into stdout so the following command line can be written

684761
ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	linux
first faced this problem with linux mint so i tried ubuntu fedora

684767
ubuntu	linux
insert the ubuntu or other linux distro disk exit the bios and shutdown

684797
width	height
image width and height must be multiple of four

684810
vmware	esx
there is a file in esx called etc vmware configrules that specifies in regular expression format rules for which devices can be attached where they can be attached from etc

684812
mouse	keyboard
you don t need to virtualize your keyboard or mouse as the system-level commands they send over the usb interface are passed directly to the driver in vmware

684812
mouse	keyboard
more often than not though you won t have to virtualize things like a keyboard and mouse

684834
dropbox	skydrive
however these highlights deal with standard file attributes including names and date time totally ignoring any metadata from the outside for example mercurial subversion dropbox skydrive

684878
versioning	upgrade
can i buy the windows 8.1 upgrade pack from the microsoft store and upgrade the kms versioning

684900
versioning	upgrade
i will first show the information if you were to first upgrade to a retail versioning of windows 8.0

684900
versioning	upgrade
windows 8.1 core and windows 8.1 professional in both cases the license is full license which means it can be used to upgrade windows 8.0 if you decide to do that but a complete waste of money considering its already free for all versioning of windows 8.0 or to upgrade from a retail vesion of windows 7 where only your personal files are transfered

684900
versioning	upgrade
if we were talking about a retail versioning of windows 7 the advice i would have given would be to upgrade to windows 8.0 fully update the product and install the windows 8.1 update via the windows store

684905
put	get
whatever environment settings you then put into etc bashrc will get into environment for every ssh login

684905
put	get
so either comment out these lines or put everything you want to get evaluated for your non-interactive ssh logins before those lines

684914
versioning	upgrade
there are no separate things like buying the upgrade and buying the full versioning if you are upgrading from windows 7 to windows 8.1

684917
vmware	virtualbox
i know i can partition my hard drive and multi boot and then boot from each partition in vmware virtualbox but triple booting or maybe quadruple booting seems a bit overkill and i don t get to resize delete partitions so easily

685005
bash	zsh
suposly the code avove should kinda work if a correct escape sequence is printed when in tmux and i found this but seems kind of old and looks like it s for bash not zsh

685018
ubuntu	linux
now i don t know much about bootloaders nor linux to be honest but i thought it might have been some ext partition which i didn t format when i reinstalled windows so i went into an ubuntu live cd opened gparted and left everything as unallocated space

685024
bash	zsh
repeat is already a keyword which does exactly the same in csh tcshâ and zsh so with this addition you will add it to bash and it will work exactly the same

685035
folder	directory
i d rather not do the standard public private key thing for ssh - since i m authenticating with ldap there isn t a home directory on the git server which means the public key would have to go into my network home folder which is not good for security

685047
vmware	virtualbox
for example there is a very dangerous incompatibility potential in older versions of vmware and virtualbox that resulted in a blue screen of death because one program would try to use a special virtualization processor instruction after it was already reserved for user by the other product

685047
daemons	systemd
you can also expect to see an installer in the event that the program is a daemons that will be started using a systemd service script in etc init.d

685071
cpu	hyperthreading
try disabling hyperthreading this might help even when the problem is not related to cpu temperature

685071
cpu	hyperthreading
from my experience p4 freezes were most of the time caused by the cpu getting too hot or problems with hyperthreading

685077
vpn	lan
the reason why names are not working properly might be due to the fact that the vpn clients could have the dns settings from their isp so when they try to resolve machine names that are on the lan the external dns does not know what to point to

685111
emacs	aquamacs
i m an emacs user and have determined i want just regular emacs not aquamacs so that i can use my existing configuration from other operating systems

685111
daemons	systemd
if i run emacs.app the systemd reuses the emacs daemons that is running in the background instead of starting a new instance and opening a new window on it

685122
chown	chmod
of course such a user must not be able to change anything in var log with chown or chmod but otherwise it must behave just like the real root user

685352
sudo	passwd
the passwd here asked is for sudo this allows the installation script to execute apt-get

685352
sudoers	passwd
either you should execute it yourself with a user that has root permissions or temporally add the jerkins user to the sudoers and allow it to execute apt-get or give it a temporal passwd

vmware	virtualbox
what ways do i have to get info on what platform virtualization software is used vmware virtualbox hyper-v and so on

685879
disk	ram
your confusion is born out of the fact that what you call finite space directories are not real filesystems on a disk but are instead virtual file systems parts of the common nix filesystem hierarchy which are hosted directly inside the pc ram

685879
disk	ram
the use of ram disk is not limited to the os but is open also to a competent user you can learn how to generate one such filesystem in in this ccessible web page

bash	zsh
you can enable it by command shopt -s extglob in bash or setopt kshglob in zsh

686132
truecrypt	umount
the prevailing answer was that it is better practice to umount it from truecrypt so that truecrypt could finish what it was doing and stop activley using the volume

686132
truecrypt	umount
at the bottom of this page it says to click dismount to eject the volume and encrypt the data so i would concur that the safest bet would be to umount it from within truecrypt

the only reason to go with a mini-dp to duallinkdvi adaptor would be if the monitor does not have displayport or you are doing something like feeding a dvi kvm keyboard video mouse switch to serve two systems with a single display

i have tried both mint and ubuntu

686322
ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	linux
i had both linux mint and ubuntu 12.04 for some time

686322

do such problems occur with partition tools in the ubuntu and linux mint live-boot installers

686383
ssd	sata
if you really do need that kind of speed getting a pcie based ssd like an iodrive or an intel 910 is going to be much faster than a bag of sata ssds in raid-0

686384
disk	ram
also a ram disk does not function quite the same as ram as it is a software construct in the operating system

686386
disk	ram
this is why the ram disk are faster even in very special hardware combinations a very fast ssd was combined with very slow ram

686405

your processor supports visualization so you would be able to run any modern os in vmware workstation player or virtualbox instead

my wife is asking me to just return the ssd and just get a regular sata drive to replace it however i have the feeling like this may just keep happening as this is the first uefi dualbios mobo i ve owned

in order to do disk rotation in a server i need to know the current running time online time of a disk on a linux centos release 6.3 final system

686588
folder	directory
this should work for every folder in your profile directory

686602
wan	lan
disable the dhcp server on your router and plug the modem into one of the lan ports on your router rather than the wan port

686613

the cp command you used may not have copied any hidden folder files that are in your home directory

however when using php s mail function to send an email from this server the dkim headers are not being added

686710
vlan	packets
the switch might not know all the hosts and the default behavior for the switch to do in case it doesn t know which port to send is treat it as bc mc and the switch will flood the packets out of all ports in that vlan

if i switching back to using the default vga drivers that come with windows and i experience no blue screens at all

686730
ubuntu	debian
i have recently removed ubuntu and installed debian on my entire hdd

686760
disk	ram
for simplification let s only talk about hard disk and ram

686762
put	get
the reason why hard drives get thrashed when you don t have enough ram is that the computer has to keep getting data for program a from the swap file partition and putting it into ram but then when program b needs access to its data the computer then has to put the program a s data in the ram back onto the hard drive to make space for program b s data

686764
disk	ram
just ram to disk and back

686770
debian	linux
os esxi 5.0 but am going to install debian linux

686783
udp	tcp
if you want to understand what that pc is doing first you ought to investigate the uses of port 9095 on google the short answer for instance look on wikipedia is that there is no known application using that port tcp or udp

686785
wan	lan
in other words with devfs there was no way to ensure that your leftmost ethernet port would be called eth0 and its rightmost one eth1 making as a pure example the setting up of routers one port to wan one port to lan difficult to implement

686789
disk	ram
so that gives me 2.3gb ram however the problem is that my system is continously after it s up for some hours 12+ usually using 3 6 gb ram and i believe it is swapping the ram to the disk way too often resulting in a very slow laptop especially once i come out of hibernate for the coming 20 minutes

686821
dmz	was
i ve read of articles where a ddwrt router was behind an att 3801hgv gateway and if the ddwrt router was in a dmz zone on the 3801hgv that dmz zone would automatically be issued a 10 minute lease time

686857
bash	zsh
i also tried with bash instead of zsh without success

686862
udp	tcp
i found the relevant settings in the cisco vpn modify transport ipsec over tcp instead of ipsec over udp

686881
disk	ram
virtual memory or the pagefile holds the ram of processes that have been swapped out. modern systems try to swap out processes to disk that haven t been used in a while such as minimized programs you haven t touched in a while or services that have been inactive for a long time

686881
disk	ram
so the system is constantly moving data from disk to ram and back to disk - process a needs something that was in ram but was shunted to the page file so the system retrieves it but if memory is really low it may have to swap another process s memory to disk

686881
disk	ram
so if you have a 3tb hard disk you can t even do this unless you have 3tb of real ram plus what you need to run your programs

686881
disk	ram
plus every time you update the ram you d have to update the hard disk so unless you really need to read 3tb of data very fast it s pointless

686883
mouse	keyboard
these include activity of mouse keyboard or the pressing of power-up buttons

686893

686906
put	get
i have windows xp and vista running on my pc but my computer say i have a corrupt file in windows 32 something i can go to the bios but when i put xp cd in to reboot it will not when i get the screen to say if i want to start vista or windows my keyboard stop it will not go up or down but when i m in bios keyboard work fine

686919
mouse	keyboard
when you say it won t take keyboard input from windows it sounds like windows has crashed at that point the mouse cursor might still be moveable

686919
versioning	upgrade
least painful is to re-install windows versioning as an upgrade

686953
ubuntu	linux
boot-up livecd ubuntu linux from usb or cd

686987
ubuntu	debian
if you want it to install to for example usr bin instead of the default usr local bin in ubuntu debian then instead of . configure type when told to use it in the guide

686996

i did this with a floppy drive which is far less important should it go wrong than a hdd

x86	64bit
64bit for x64 and 32-bit for x86

687089
put	get
sometimes in cygwin package libraries get put in usr lib and usr local lib depending on the setup system involved

687094
bash	subshell
now i have to wonder are the user process limits set in ksh still going to be enforced in bash subshell

687094
bash	subshell
in the top-level bash subshell i ran the following

687094
bash	subshell
another major concern of mine is knowing whether or not the limit set in ksh will include processes created in tmux sessions in bash subshell

687094
bash	subshell
these commands were run from a regular bash prompt -- no subshell or tmux

687103
folder	directory
here we use echo to put the current directory cd into the pipeline and then tell findstr to look for the user s profile folder userprofile - quotes mandatory at the beginning b of the piped data

687108
terminate	timeout
speaking as someone with plenty of experience in both 802.11 and university networking environments if i were setting up a university wi-fi network with 802.1x authentication i d make sure the timeout was at least 24 hours and set to try to renew rather than automatically terminate when the timeout hits

687121
cpu	processors
i have a laptop with an intel i3-3217u cpu which according to the intel s website supports vtx however when i run the intel processors id utility or securable it reports that virtualization technology is not supported on the machine

687165
sorting	filtering
first we builds a list of logged in users with the user command and filtering out duplicates by putting one on each line xargs -n and sorting with uniques filtering sort -u

687177
vmware	virtualbox	virtualbox	parallels
for sure i am fully aware of virtualbox parallels desktop vmware and qemu but all of them seem to offer only a software gpu which redirects to the real gpu and can only go up to opengl 2.x

687183
vmware	virtualbox
you can install it on a separate box but having a pc with a decent cpu with hardware virtualization and plenty of ram will also allow you to install and run it in in a vm for example vmware which i prefer over virtualbox which when i tried it quite some time ago had lots of trouble with usb pass-through - but this might have been fixed since then though

687188
redhat	fedora	debian	centos	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	centos
debian is leaning towards systemd ubuntu developed and has pretty much already transitioned to upstart and like debian redhat centos fedora are moving towards systemd

687189
filesystems	fat
if it tells you that dev sdf is a fat or some other filesystems then my hypothesis is correct

687189
filesystems	fat
this will wipe the existing partitions which are probably just fdisk s desperate attempt to interpret the first sector of a fat filesystems and create a new empty partition table

687208
wan	lan
it ll also set your wan port to being a lan port so you can plug in ethernet to any port

687211
cpu	processors
since you are buying it with an i3 processors which only burns at max computation 55w per lenovo also stuffs the hotter 65w i7 cpu and hotter 7200rpm drives into the same chassis w the same 180w rating as shown here the measured power consumption with only 4gb of ram and a 5400 rpm drive will be significantly less than 180w

687227
toolbar	tabs
the best that you can do is to make the tabs appear below the address bar which you can do by right clicking the title bar and selecting show tabs on a separate row but this will still show the tab bar above the toolbar

687236
disk	ram
i understand that even in a perfect scenario where neither cpu nor ram nor disk have been over-provisioned there will be some effects on sibling vms on the same host

687287
folder	directory
if all files are in a single folder one directory listing per synchronization run and about one small file changes at a time only one file transfer the load would be small

687319
udp	tcp
relevant settings in cisco vpn modify transport ipsec over tcp instead of ipsec over udp

687353
dmz	was
the dmz was set up properly with a static ip assigned to the ps3 and the system log shows that all protocols ports are forwarded to the ps3 s ip

687601
ubuntu	debian
which in debian-family distros debian ubuntu mint...aptosid... can be downloaded by means of

687621
restrict	shared
so you can restrict access to shared from the central server - just when you shared then you specify allowed users like this domain user1 etc

687621
udp	tcp
it would be enough to tell the firewall to drop tcp udp traffic for ports 138 and 139 if requests come from that ip address

687730
vbscript	vba
requires adding a reference to microsoft vbscript regular expressions 5.5 - just go to tools -- references from the vba editor and check the checkbox for that reference.

687777
google-chrome	firefox
i cannot access jetbrains youtrack using google-chrome or internet explorer but i can access it using firefox

687810
opera	google-chrome
you could try the classic tabs extension to bring back some of opera 12 s tab options or if that s not to your liking use the download google-chrome extension which lets you install google-chrome extensions in opera and then try tab activate or tabs to the front

687825

hide	show
how do you hide or show the messages pane in outlook 2010

687867
cpu	processors
yes...this can damage your hardware because high use of processors state will produce more heat as compare to normal state.it will basically harm when your cpu is at 100 for long periods of time

687898
google-chrome	firefox
it is the same in all browsers google-chrome firefox and ie and results are the same even entering in the ip address manually

687950

688115
switching	screens
suppose i don t know anything about computers and likewise i might not even be asking a question here i would think my laptop is broken glitchy because every time i plug or unplug the power adapter the screens goes off for 1 whole second i m oblivious to the fact that gpus are switching

688132
bash	zsh
you have tagged this with both bash and zsh

688132
zsh	subshell
but as per this so post the solution under zsh might be to run f in a subshell

688135

so why don t you just log stdout but not stderr of your script

when i got to the part where i partition my hdd i told it to erase the part with ubuntu and to then use it to install debian

688205
ubuntu	debian
i booted into ubuntu and found that it was on the same partition as debian

688205

also when i checked the disk space with df -h i found that even though ubuntu and debian were on the same partition they reported different amounts of new and used space same total space

688220

i have a headless debian unstable server that i would like to install ubuntu trusty on

i also use a logitech bt keyboard and mouse on the same adapter which is older 2.1 tech and has no problems with the new dongle or csr stack

688263
opensuse	debian
the dd command is rocket science compared to using a graphical application like unetbootin from the debian and fedora repos to make your opensuse live usb

688280
ubuntu	debian
you can replace debian with ubuntu with a little of work.

688280
ubuntu	debian
you can edit the etc apt sources.list and replace the debian with the ubuntu sources

688280
ubuntu	debian
the closer related are the debian and the ubuntu the better

688280
ubuntu	debian
after booting correctly you can remove the old debian partition and expand the ubuntu filesystem and any fine tune you may need

688500
hex	binary
that means that the file has just a scotch over 520 000 bytes in it and going by the encoding used by the compiler assembled used to get executable code for the sega genesis motorola 68000 binary opcodes you can go byte-by-byte in a hex file and edit the values of data instruction encoding used in the game checksum magic number data jump move instructions offsets data entries like lives etc.

wan	lan
firewalls are generally built in such a way that they block communications originating on the wan side while they allow instead communications originating on the lan side

689035

689554
google-chrome	firefox
this happens in google-chrome and firefox but i haven t encountered the problem in explorer

689555
disk	ram
if your game needs more ram than is made available paging parts of that programs data out to disk really is not that much faster than getting them from disk to being with or re-getting them from disk when they are rolled out of memory completly

put	get
most of these are in some form of compressed format but there are ways to get it out squish it down and put it back where it was

689654
width	height
resolution is how many pixels displayed on a screen by height x width

689656
folder	directory
is the hidden folder filesystems use to identify the current directory remember that the way to run a script in your current working directory is . blah

689660
width	height
you are correct in saying that resolution is screen width x height in pixels

689669
folder	directory
the problem is that any program you install has access to this variable and can create files and folder inside this directory

689669
temp	tmp
it lets me keep temporary files in their own partition i also redirect the temp and tmp environment variables to point to that drive g temp temp

689686
tunnel	vpn
my vpn connection forces all internet traffic through the tunnel and that s very slow

689686

689726
disk	ram
no ram or disk activity should happen while the computer is sleep-ing

689756
disk	ram
for example the same file in ram and on hard disk could lose sync at some point if you take out the drive or ram and mess around with some files

689756
disk	ram
checking if ram files match disk files is as slow as simply reading from the disk so it would defeat the purpose

689815
hfs+	ntfs
but sometimes working with third party applications will be rigorous because the third party applications will convert the files from ntfs to hfs+ or hfsx

689823
mouse	keyboard
the idea being that you have a mixture of uefi tpm type functionality in each device that has an arm chipset in it which could be anything from a keyboard mouse to a monitor and printer

689857
google-chrome	firefox
if you are using firefox or google-chrome you will have to type in credentials domain user for the username and whatever password you assigned to this account and it should let you in

i ve installed w7 on the ssd and then partitioned my sata in two parts one 800gb for w7 and another 200gb of empty space to install kali

689918
cpu	processors
in the past the cpu was responsible for most of the rendering done in games and video-editing programs but the increase in demand for graphical complexity has made it impossible for cpus which are general-purposes processors to perform the advanced mathematical calculations required for advanced graphics related operations especially if it already has to do a lot of other processing like handling physics ai etc

689925
post	put
it s a somewhat lengthy process so i won t put the full post here but overall you ll need a mysql server running and configured and then modify the advancedsettings.xml file in xbmc with the following contents

690062
bash	zsh
the example works in sh bash ksh zsh

690090
lan	localhost
but x is part of ground floor lan and so its localhost cannot be viewed on the 4th floor lan

690093
wan	lan
then hook the lan ports up to your pcs and existing infrastructure do not use the wan port

690119
bash	zsh
if you want to cover the files in the whole hierarchy under data all you can enable the globstar option if you are using bash i believe this would just work on zsh and then use to match all files

690153
ssd	sata
that is correct you can cache 1 disk with up to 64gig of the ssd unit and only when in the raid mode for the intel chipset sata controller

690162
unix	solaris
mount the windows file on a linux pc or in my case a solaris unix server

690169
lan	intranet	lan	localhost
localhost is a member of the local intranet zone as should be your local ip address or fqdn within your lan but unfourtunately due to a bug ie treats any url with a dot . in it as in the internet zone instead which has much more stringent security settings

690170
pull	push
if not i read that it s a pull model and not a push model is there some website service free

690245
google-chrome	firefox
you could use google-chrome for your normal browsing and switch over to firefox for youtube

690268
filesystems	ntfs
about the second part of your problems related with ntfs i do not understand the problem ntfs should automatically increase the size of the inode table which is named mft and comes replicated as mftmirr assuming there is enough free space on the filesystems

690280

690948
ubuntu	debian
there are many different distros ubuntu uses the ubuntu debian repositories red hat uses their own

690948

post	get
it should be full disk because otherwise you re basically putting up a big sign post saying the privacy of this stuff is important enough for me to protect with encryption and you also run the risk of data remnants showing up in deleted locations on disk swap space and temporary files that might not even get cleaned up properly after an improper shutdown

691377
h.264	webm
google has little incentive to support h.264 when they have their own competing webm format that they are trying to push

the easiest way to find the vimperator xpi is by installing the super-tiny add-on open profile folder press alt t to open the tools menu choose open profile folder and navigate to the subdirectory extensions

691764
xpi	vimperator
one issue is that if you update vimperator you will need to do this again with the new xpi but you should be able to just replace this section in the new version with your edited version from the old one

if the bluetooth hardware in your pc has bluetooth hard copy cable replacement server capabilities you can use a bluetooth usb hub

692686

it may look as provocative but if you just need to remotely operate audio maybe the best solution is not to use a pc as a pure renderer there are so many cheap android devices available now simple tablet or even an old phone with a broken screens will do

692716

i deleted my linux mint partition not knowing that it would cause me to be unable to acess ubuntu i have found another artial on how to fix it without a live cd usb but i dont know what hdx y to use

692724
wan	lan	wan	subnet
another possible cause of malfunction is if both routers are using a subnet 192.168.1.0 24 which would make it impossible for router 2 to understand whether any given address lies on the lan or on the wan side

692742
bluetooth	usb	mouse	keyboard
i have a bluetooth usb receiver a wireless keyboard and a wireless mouse connected to the same laptop so maybe that s causing interference

692861
filesystems	ntfs
please open a command prompt cmd.exe as admin and run chkdsk to detect and fix ntfs filesystems issues

692873
ssd	sata
internally the ssd would connect through sata

692873
ssd	sata
externally the ssd would be converted from sata to usb

692878
ssd	sata
depending on the ssd it would probably max out between 180 and 550 megabytes per second so definately sata 2

692908
hide	show
for this to work you should go to folder options - view and then uncheck hide protected operating system files recommended and also unhide all the folders from show hidden files and folders

693023
filesystems	xfs
for xfs filesystems you can use xfs_metadump and xfs_mdrestore which will copy the filesystems metadata but not its contents to another filesystems preferably empty

693023
filesystems	xfs
xfs_metadump is a debugging tool that copies the metadata from an xfs filesystems to a file

693023

i already know how to verify the plain text check-sum sha512sums using something like hashslash but i am interested in the rsa dsa signed checksums above right

693041

take what you can get off it get a new disk reinstall and put the stuff back

693053
debian	linux
what i wish to achieve have debian linux on a usb stick and boot from that without touching my hd

693065
disk	ram
since it s software running on the host all that data needs to be shuffled through the disk interface to ram and handled by the software badblocks in our case

693114
versioning	upgrade
this can also happen when you upgrade to a new versioning of debian or if the keys that you have on the current machine have expired

693116
lxml	beautifulsoup
you would need to use urllib2 and cookiejar and then use something like lxml and beautifulsoup to parse out the html

693121
sudoers	visudo
you can do this by modifying the sudoers file using visudo and letting all users in a certain group execute the commands

693122
installation	upgrade
however the error code 0x000000c4 indicates the possibility of this iso being 1 upgrade only installation

693141
ftp	smb
if you try to connect to a tftp server using winscp or windows explorer most likely those applications are trying to establish an authenticated ftp or smb connection with the server

ubuntu	debian
it is true that ubuntu is based on debian but not everything in the ubuntu package repositories can work flawlessly in debian on which kali is based

693261
ubuntu	debian
this line is for saucy ubuntu careful that the correspondence between debian and ubuntu kernel-wise or otherwise is not one to one

693293
ethernet	wireless
in case you also want to bridge on the wired ethernet interface in other words when connecting your computer via a cable to the wl-330 and wish to have an ip address from the same ip range as when connecting directly to the wireless network then you need to disable the dhcp server that is built in to the wl-330

693307
bluetooth	usb
apparently my machine is set up with some internal usb hubs and the bluetooth device attached to it somewhere

wan	lan
is there any way for me to access this lan resource over wan

pressing the activation button produces no feedback on whether the activation process failed or why

693396
wan	lan
just imagine what happens when a packet addressed to say 192.168.0.15 reaches one of the two routers how can the router possibly know whether the packet is destined for its wan side or for its lan side

693430
filesystems	ntfs
ntfs filesystems most windows hard drives support this

693445
nlb	iis
did a test today and iis is not a pre-requisite to ms nlb

693463

eclipse folder eclipse not installed only copied directory

693492
mouse	keyboard
start the computer - you should get login window as username password - where you don t need mouse but keyboard is enough

693505
stdout	stderr
just add 2 1 to the end to redirect stderr to stdout in this case to a file

693524
versioning	upgrade
i use this naming convention for my television shows and xbmc used to work with this just fine until i upgrade to the latest versioning

i m trying to make my own linux distro based on ubuntu i will make .iso with remastersys or similar which i will hopefully put online for others to download

693552
opera	firefox
the thing is that it s only the case on firefox - not on open office not on opera

693552
opera	firefox
for example if i look inside the little box at the bottom of this wikipedia page i have a different outcome with firefox and opera

693554
parallels	bootcamp
until recently i was using bootcamp to use windows but i found parallels actually gave a better experience so i ve been using osx more and more

693555
wan	lan
ip location be it on your lan or even the wan

693577
ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	linux
i have a 500gb hard drive with ubuntu 12.04 linux mint 13 cinnamon or something like that tinycore+ and archlinux and 4mlinux and they all have a 100gb partition and they run fine

693590
put	get
almost all files get put on the external hdd and the other day i wanted to take the external hdd and plug it into my laptop

693591
filesystems	ntfs
easiest way i could think of to do this is to use the exfat filesystems rather than ntfs on the external hard drive

693622
hide	show
afaik the desktop icon order is stored in some desktop.ini but even with all the folder view options set to show rather than hide there s no desktop.ini in h desktop

693623

the characters that are missing on firefox are missing on opera too they are just replaced by various empty rectangles instead of rectangles with hex numbers in them

693639

i was thinking wireless but if you also know of another method via ethernet cable please share how

693663
filesystems	ntfs
currently the microsoft ntfs filesystems can be easily read from written to from a variety of operating systems windows linux mac os

693663
ubuntu	linux
recent linux distributions fedora ubuntu already include the ntfs-3g drivers in order to access those partitions

693684
cpu	processors
the terms 32-bit and 64-bit refer to the way a computer s processors also called a cpu handles information

693684
versioning	upgrade
if you are currently running a 32-bit versioning of windows you can only perform an upgrade to another 32-bit versioning of windows

693684
versioning	upgrade
similarly if you are running a 64-bit versioning of windows you can only perform an upgrade to another 64-bit versioning of windows

693700
udp	tcp
iptables is for firewalling udp tcp traffic

693714
installation	upgrade
as long as you don t intentionally format the d and e drives during the upgrade they will be left untouched by installation process.just make sure windows is installed on the c drive partition

693718
wan	lan
there you will see two direction select lan and wan

693718
wan	lan
you may select any service for lan allowing all features to be enabled for lan ethernet port but disable or untick all service under wan

693746
stdout	stderr
but as the output goes to stderr instead of stdout you will need

693809
nginx	lighttpd	apache	lighttpd	apache	nginx
you do not state which web-server you are using apache nginx lighttpd thttpd ...

693858
filesystems	ntfs
it looks like the access control lists acls for the affected files are getting corrupted which implies corruption of the master file table a critical data structure used in the ntfs filesystems

693885
disk	ram
even when you re using solid state hard drives you still need to load that code from non volatile memory disk drives to volatile system memory ram

693888
folder	dir
i name my work folder clientname.uniquenumber and when i have a new job i use sort via dir oe to check that i don t duplicate numbers superuser reference for that

693888
folder	dir
but when i run dir oe the cli doesn t show the folder with the custom .ico file - why would this be and is there a solution

693907
folder	dir
when you assign an icon to a folder i believe it necessitates setting the system flag on it which dir hides by default

be careful to not shutdown your keyboard and or mouse

694119
tunnel	vpn
you may need to configure a split tunnel policy on your vpn appliance or your vpn service for this

694146
folder	directory
i think that it puts all of your applications for all the users into the root folder directory so all of the different users can access them

694149
debian	linux
i am not sure there is such a tool available on windows but there is an available package in linux debian repository

694161

694182
ethernet	wireless
the ethernet port and wireless adaptor on the ubuntu server are bridged and hostapd works

694188
google-chrome	firefox
you have adblock installed in google-chrome and probably in firefox as well

694223
ethernet	wireless
this is because by bridging wifi and ethernet your wifi clients will be able to ask your router directly for an ip address so there is no need of the whole shebang of dhcp dnsmasq on the wireless interface

694228
post	put
i put a cron job in place to run my script to post to the condo router to keep the terms of service active

694296
mouse	keyboard
that said if a program which has been set to high priority happens to freeze and putting a 100 load on the cpu then even the mouse and keyboard will eventually stop working because the system is so busy attempting to process the hung program that it cannot get around to processing the mouse or keyboard actions

694309

udp	tcp
additionally i don t have a separate server or connected computer to redirect my outgoing tcp or udp to that computer

ethernet	wireless
if the ip addresses for the wireless clients are in the same range as the dynamic address of the pc with the ethernet card perhaps simply enabling ip forwarding could be all you need

vagrant extracts this archive in the boxes folder under the vagrant directory in your home

694527

on the other vm that s supposed to be a node machine in my cloud system i also updated repositories and installed sudo apt-get install opennebula-node and changed the oneadmin passwd to a custom one

694582

it s because maverick does not have the java tools anymore like maven ant ... pre-installed

i know i can use the keyboard shortcut to reopen the last closed tab but is there a mouse based method

694645
pppoe	dhcp
to my understanding the isp can assign a new ip via dhcp when i make a new pppoe connection

694664
mouse	keyboard
you can choose between a keyboard shortcut a scroll gesture mouse gesture or a rocker gesture to assign it

694696
put	get
so to make the image get put onto the sd card i recommend you cd into the directory that you extracted the iso into just for ease

i read here that the trial versioning of office could be downloaded from microsoft s website and then upgrade to the full versioning with the license key

ideally i d plug into the hub close the laptop lid and then use the monitors and external keyboard and mouse

694941
wan	subnet
the client mode wireless does exactly what you are asking for it connects as a client to your house s wifi network but acts as a router it creates a lan-side subnet which differs from the wan-side network and separates them so that people on the wan side of your router cannot access components on its lan-side

how do i instruct ubuntu so that it can find my debian vm

694983
firefox	safari
now you can re-launch network connect from safari firefox and the installation should go through this time

694988
mouse	keyboard
using the keyboard eliminates the delay--it s just a mouse input issue

695000
hide	show
amusingly enough even though a boss-key programâ s purpose is to quickly hide the specified program usually things like games or p2p which people donâ t want to get caught using because it assigns a hotkey to hide and show the specified program it actually ends up accomplishing what you want albeit almost as a side-effect

695001
wan	subnet
i m making the assumption that you ve got the netgear connected via it s wan interface to your main 192.168.1.x subnet

695001
wan	subnet
there are sometimes multiple settings you need to watch for as the default for most firewalls is to block traffic from private subnet when they re seen on a wan interface

695009

in the meantime you can do it manually by deleting the file s corresponding to that site under the local storage folder of your user data directory

695018
pop-up	dialog
is there a plugin or something that i could install to make it so it pop-up with a confirmation dialog before closing an entire window

695019

your folder has spaces in it so you need to both wrap it in double-quotation marks in both the for command and the do command and specify that the for-loop is not to use spaces as delimiter with the delims option

you can get upgrade versioning of win7 pretty cheap

695372
x86	64bit
i notice that when i click change icon i get a message saying windows can t find file programfiles google chrome application chrome.exe which i assume is because i don t have a 64bit version of chrome so it s actually in program files x86

695381
16-bit	64bit
if it s old 16-bit stuff and you want to run it on a modern 64bit os your only option is to use a vm and if you want to run a copy of xp on said vm regardless of the vm solution used you need a license for the copy of xp you re using

executable	sfx
i had a similar problem an sfx executable that basically runs an exe that then allows you to run the files within the archive

695414

the problem was that workrave wasn t starting and it wasn t starting apparently because i was logged into my machine remotely using nomachine and workrave wasn t detecting any mouse or keyboard activity

filesystems	ntfs
thank you so much for contacting us if you convert a partition with ntfs filesystems to fat32 filesystems the creation modified dates of all the files remain intact

695469
filesystems	ntfs
fat32 is a less safe filesystems than ntfs because it doesn t do journaling which means that if you have a sudden power loss bsod or other momentary unexpected interruption while the filesystems is writing data the filesystems can wind up in an inconsistent state and you can lose data

695473
filesystems	ntfs
i m not sure what you mean by all external drives have fat32 filesystems is that your personal configuration or do you mean external hard drives many of which have been coming with ntfs partitions for some time especially as capacities grow

many products such as norton or mcafee advertise as antivirus tools or suites while others advertise as anti-malware like malwarebytes and even more as anti-spyware spybot s d

695503
spyware	antivirus
generally speaking the main differences between the antivirus makers is that some actively listen and scan files as they are loaded into memory or visible in the folder you are viewing mse avast etc. whereas afaik others aren t active and work to rid you of the baddies when you execute them malware bytes most spyware programs

695507
put	get
i ve never seen that kind of information displayed anywhere before so i would assume the answer to be no and put it down to either a limitation of windows or its file systems but every now and again i open a file and get the following warning

695508
disk	ram
and in some products regular ram was actually used for the display buffer vs having the buffer on the display adapter card. in other cases a hardware device such as a disk drive controller would use memory-mapped addressing for setting reading its control registers

695525

what this does is find any srt subtitle file inside the folder u execute it

your computer is able to tell that the file was downloaded from the internet using ads or alternate data streams a feature of the ntfs filesystems

vmware	virtualbox
you can use oracle s virtualbox vmware s player or whatever virtual machine application you want

695849
disk	ram
my hunch is that a huge dropbox consumes a resource that is not cpu nor ram but something else that prevents applications to access the disk fluidly

you may find that it gives you a manufacturer and model number for a graphics adapter probably from a company like intel nvidia or ati amd

695877

u have to allow svchost.exe and all the useless traffic generated by this and u get windows update to work tcp port 80 443 and udp 53 dns if needed

note that this is an embedded system and i do not have the ability to upgrade the busybox versioning or upload new executable- i can only use script files and the busybox executable already available

695892
wan	lan
it s working fine but the problem is i have to plug in the wan cable into a lan port

695892
wan	lan
from what i have understood after reading around is that i need to i need to bridge the wan port and the lan ports

695911
wan	lan
from your description it sounds like you don t actually want a wan port you want the wan port to act just like another lan port

695911
wan	lan
this will bridge the wan and lan ports making them all work identically and the device acting more like a switch then a router

695911
wan	lan
this will have the affect of converting the wan port to another lan port - it will still leave the logic for a wan port but the physical wan port won t be there

695954

when using the kde save as dialogue how does one create a new directory using the keyboard only no need to grab the mouse

also free download manager which integrates with firefox opera google-chrome ie among other browsers has a feature to prevent the computer from going into standby sleep mode while it is downloading a file

695967
udp	tcp
unicasts of any kind tcp udp or otherwise will likely be transmitted over wi-fi at much higher rates than multicasts or broadcasts of any kind

695967
udp	tcp
in all cases udp unicasts can get a few percent higher efficiency than tcp because whereas tcp is designed to go as fast as possible without compounding congestion udp-based protocols can try to go as fast as possible even if they make congestion worse

695967
udp	tcp
so even a well-implemented finely-tuned tcp stack may occasionally back off in the face of congestion and packet loss whereas udp will blast continuously

695982
mouse	keyboard
the x11 or just some parts of gnome like panels and partially windows details described below are frozen which doesn t allow to do anything with mouse although the cursor can move but clicking anywhere brings no results - panels are frozen the clock is standing etc and windows minimized but generally the system all processes obviously except gnome shell and hardware are working right - all leds main hard disk external swap disk network are blinking from time to time and there is a power supplied to usb ports so for example a keyboard is working and also some shortcuts like super+d minimizing and maximizing all windows but all i can see is only one blank window with plain surface and no contents displayed the other windows i probably moved to another workspace with a shortcut or they are not showed due to the problem but unfortunately not and i don t know the reason but i assume it probably never have been working before i just had no opportunity to use it in the past and check if it works even when it s pressed on external usb keyboard

695982

i m looking for even extreme solutions - the point is how can i execute even small piece of code in such a case to execute chvt or xdotoll or eventually hibernate processes and copy ram contents to external disk to secure unsaved data

fact the on-screen pointer lags behind the mouse or trackpad in os

i have checked hard disk and ram but no indications there

696052
spaces	delimiter
or you can import the data directly from text data -- import from text and choose spaces character as delimiter

696066
spaces	delimiter
i can make wildcard searches more greedy by including delimiter in the search --- does find entire words --- but that would fail in the current instance because for instance while a term like ad-hoc might be preceded and followed by spaces the spaces itself will not have the foreign word style applied to it and thus be excluded from the search nevermind the fact that there is a plethora of potential string borders a multi-word foreign phrase might be preceded and followed by either a colon semicolon spaces one of six potential quotation mark characters paragraph mark or...

can i connect the nas to the ethernet port on my desktop then create a network bridge between the ethernet and wireless adapter and access it as i normally would if it were connected to the router

696119
ethernet	wireless
you might for example see a token ring to ethernet bridge or wireless bridges that convert from wired ethernet to wi-fi

696127
putty	winscp
reason is i would like to keep credentials for any sort of system in keepass and open the connection by running the url so i could connec to for example to a ldap directory with ldapadmin.exe ssh via putty winscp with an addon for it and also windows remotedesktop connections via a special command line tool

you can always install ubuntu linux and that will work a bit better

google-chrome	firefox
every computer has had firefox and google-chrome pre-downloaded

you can change group of the upload directory chgrp nogroup upload_dir and set group id on it chmod g+s upload_dir - files created in this directory will have group nogroup

696310
ubuntu	debian
even if it were bash when bash is invoked as sh it subtly changes its behaviour. on ubuntu bin sh now defaults to the debian almquist shell which is a different shell mdash

the switch of bin sh from bourne again to debian almquist improved the boot speed of debian and ubuntu systems which execute a lot of shell scripts as part of the boot process

my particular hardware is overclocked to begin with default clock multiplier is 43 instead of 36 but you can see this is far from a mobile processors it is effectively a re-branded xeon workstation server cpu and the cpu still does frequency scaling based on load

if i start a windows vm and log in to the domain then use internet explorer google-chrome or firefox to access the site i am prompted by the browser for a username and password

696565

my problem is that if i attempt to access the site from os x using google-chrome or firefox i am prompted for my username and password but entering mydomain myusername and my password does not work - the box simply refreshes and asks me to enter my credentials again and i am unable to login

i m looking for a character to put in my zsh s that would be equivalent to bash s # the command number of this command according to this site

basically this command only deletes the empty directory in my folder which means the ones which have files should be safe and not deleted

apparently i can only save traffic in ethernet format on computer 1 although it s sent through my wireless interface

winpcap	wireshark
winpcap and thus wireshark doesn t support monitor mode so if you re running windows you would only see 802.11 headers if you have an airpcap adapter separate from the 802.11 adapter over which the packets are being transmitted

696728
macports	homebrew
if you have macports available or possibly homebrew or a similar environment you can use watch to print the output of the command every second

696731
fink	macports
however see the issues with ls and tar and using other package aggregators like fink and port macports way below

696731
fink	macports
another reason i don t even put usr local bin in my path at all is because brew doesn t play well with others and fink and port macports have way more supported packages at present that i need now

i can set my current working directory to that shared folder from cygwin on my windows xp vm running under os x as follows

697219
google-chrome	firefox
you can use a google bookmarks bookmarklet in google-chrome firefox to add bookmarks and fetch them in either browser from the google bookmarks site

697240
disk	ram
for hybernation the ram contents are written to the disk and loaded again when waking up which is skipped in sleep ram is just kept active to not lose contents

697242
disk	ram
for s4 sleep mode this can be every subsystem including ram as this is written to disk - the pc is then powered off

697245
wan	lan
.i have a cable from modems lan to wdrs wan and a cable from wdr to pc

697246
rss	feed
you could use rainmeter to setup a nice desktop with rss feed

697246
google-chrome	firefox
otherwise just use firefox addons or google-chrome extensions

697253
versioning	upgrade
a clean win8 upgrade through to 8.1 is still preferable to the wrongly-partitioned oem versioning

697265
winpcap	wireshark
before starting winpcap wireshark didn t show any capture interfaces and afterwards it does

697272
required	placeholder
configure ip address 192.168.11.2 on then lan of r2 no hosts will use this ip anyway it is just a placeholder as some routers required it

697272
wan	lan
connect r1 and r2 by ethernet cable using any of the lan ports not wan because we need to switch between them we don t want to route

697279
filesystems	ntfs
or if this was not ntfs but a completely unix-impaired filesystems like fat32 bind-mount it on top of .netrc every time you boot

697280
mouse	trackpad
as a workaround one can use cmd - ctrl -scroll up down with a mouse or cmd - ctrl -two-finger-swipe up down on a trackpad to zoom in and out

697293
itunes	iphoto
if i create a partition for the itunes library and another one for the iphoto library they are pretty heavy do you think this makes my mac faster or not

697317
itunes	iphoto
only at the moment you start itunes and iphoto at the same time

697395
jobs	cron
that means cron fires jobs and does not wait for them to finish

697430
filesystems	ntfs
is it possible to mount an ntfs filesystems on windows without permission restrictions

697493
ethernet	wireless
paranoid mode get a linux livecd after checking the md5 sum disconnect the hard drive cable inside the pc s case unhook the ethernet cable disconnect the usb wi-fi radio or flip the mechanical switch to turn the wireless off then use the terminal with dd to zero out the memory card

697501
fastboot	adb
run chmod +x adb and do for whatever else you need such as fastboot

697501
folder	directory
now when you are not directly in that folder and your path is correct you can just type adb since typing . adb elsewhere will try to launch adb from the current working directory

697567
google-chrome	firefox
i have started using google-chrome up to date on windows 7 everything up to date on a clean install i did a few days ago and compared to firefox i am seeing huge cpu spikes up to 100 cpu utilization when opening empty tabs

697577
mouse	keyboard
the thing is i usually use those machines side by side and having multiple mouse and keyboard is confusing

697577
mouse	keyboard
but it would be better if the outputs monitor speaker ... still come out from linux desktop while i control it from macbook this means i can remove keyboard and mouse from desktop and there s no need to forward desktop screen to macbook as vnc does

697601
debian	linux
i am running a raspberry pi with raspbian a linux based on debian wheezy as a nas network attached storage with an usb hard drive attached as the only usb device

697657
put	get
to get this exact behavior put this to your .zshrc

697666
hide	show
and my guess is that find looks in all directories just does not show hide results for 2012

697667
spaces	delimiter
the way i would go about this programmatically would be to split the output into an array by the delimiter spaces and reference it by

697679
spaces	delimiter
so if you need the 3rd field and it is delimiter by spaces then it is

697700
minix	linux
you can install linux on android micro-pcs such as minix

697735
ubuntu	linux
i am trying to create a gre tunnel between 2 routers running linux ubuntu 12.04 and pass traffic between 2 subnets trough this tunnel

697739
postgresql	mysql
set up an authorative nameserver which interfaces with postgresql or mysql and simply do

697750
versioning	upgrade
it seems the dock shortcut is malfunctioning - it s been happening since he upgrade versioning

697762
ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	linux
i run linux ubuntu 13.10 and mint 16 most of the time both at work and at home

697780
cpu	processors
i know if i were to run linux webserver on there i d want a good cpu for speed but are there other uses of the basement computer where a solid processors would be of benefit

697807
sudoers	visudo
modify the etc sudoers file using visudo to grant specific users authority to perform administrative tasks

697817
debian	centos
i have set up a simple p2p network between my desktop pc running debian 7 and my home server running centos 6.5

697825
sudo	passwd
the user in question has sudo powers but the mount should be automatic without passwd prompt which permissions need to be set in order to avoid interactive sudo

697844
pop-up	dialog
however every time i save the template a dialog pop-up stating

697847
temp	tmp
the temp and tmp environment variables are populated with a valid directory name

697849
debian	centos
then you need a route on your internet router for the subnet between debian and centos

697882
tunnel	vpn
you could create a 2nd tunnel from the client up to the centos openvpn inside the original vpn tunnel to hide the internet traffic from the vpn server

697902
ubuntu	mint
i ve read mint comes from ubuntu so i hope this works

697902
vim	gedit
feel free to replace gedit by your favourite text editor hint vim

697959
arp	dhcp
the plugged in computer will add an entry to the router s arp table and dhcp lease table which means that in principle traffic will be very very slightly slower as those larger tables are traversed but not enough even to measure accurately

697959
ethernet	wireless
note that all of those examples apply just as much for a wireless client moreso in fact since wireless line discipline is more complicated than ethernet s

697962
subnet	packets
when i sent traffic through one of the interfaces on the router even though its on the same subnet and not being routed it to another pc on the lan things went very slowly as obviously it was doing packets forwarding in software

697967
folder	directory
thanks to this answer rd s remove directory recursively on each of the folder in the

697967
hide	show
what was also useful is enabling windows explorer to show hidden system files and folders like may be called different on different systems such as recycler by pressing alt to show the menu in windows explorer tools | folder options view tab uncheck hide protected operating system files recommended

697969
filesystems	ntfs
the drive model is st4000dm000-1f2168 and my filesystems is ntfs

697991
ethernet	wireless
your router s wireless is isolated from the ethernet ports

697997
folder	directory
but whenever i add a new folder at home to the root directory of my dropbox it adds the folder automatically on my work computer

698030
filesystems	fat
back in the days of fat hardlinks would actually have been considered an error as no two names in the filesystems were allowed to point to the same data blocks

698074
min	max
you can approximate a value axis by using the category axis date option as shown in your example but you ll have to convert your data values to serial date values then set a min and max this is not a pretty option but it is possible and there s still no way to assign a 0 starting point so the best you could do is still 1 501 1001 .

698080
ubuntu	debian
the official repositories only have 1.2.3 packages available and the mumble ubuntu ppa packages which have the correct version seem to have dependencies which are not available in debian

698092
vpn	lan
if you like to use plex without using the myplex account you can only make a vpn connection to your home lan

698108
width	height
the reason is simply the fact that there is no way to make up the +300 of additional information i take your example of doubling mean doubling the height and width of the image required for the operation from the original image

698115
ubuntu	linux
i m pretty sure it is possible to do this but i would like some confirmation i m using ubuntu linux

698118
google-chrome	firefox
if you are working in gmail in google-chrome or firefox you need to make sure that the rich internet application plugin is activated

698139
versioning	upgrade
on mac os x i have recently upgrade from teamviewerâ ž versioning 8 to 9

698192
filesystems	ntfs
if you can copy all the files to a backup folder on your new computer ensure they re properly copied and then you could try formatting the external drive using the ntfs filesystems assuming it s a windows computer

698192
filesystems	fat
it s possible that if it s the old fat filesystems that newer operating systems may not like reading it especially if the allocation sizes are non standard

698198
vlookup	sumifs
i tried with sumifs and vlookup with no luck

698208
debian-based	linux
most modern linux distros all debian-based arch linux ... do not have inetd any longer

698225
post	put
i am confused because i have seen forum post from people who have succesfully put and i7 in my laptop which according to ark is not supported

698253
min	max
i was trying to use max and min but could only return a date of 1 00 00

698258
ubuntu	linux
what can i do to dedicate bandwidth to a linux server running ubuntu 12.04 so that other computers on the network can access the server with minimal lag

698287
wan	lan
my pc gets the 10.10.1.x ip address and i can ping the 10.10.1.1 the linksys router s lan ip address and even ping 192.168.1.142 the linksys router s wan ip address

698300
wan	lan
if the wi-fi ap is acting as a nat gateway which assumes its wan port is plugged into the upstream router s lan port it may be doing dns differently or it may be doing a better job of tcp mss clamping than your upstream nat gateway is doing

698300
mtu	icmp
to test if mtu stuff is the problem trying pinging the problem website with both a normal 64-byte icmp echo request and then try again with an icmp echo request that fills the whole 1500 byte frame

698310
daemons	launchd
performing this task in previous versions of os x was a simple matter of mounting the root partition and launchd the following launchd daemons

698327
floating-point	integer
while a 32-bit integer may not be able to hold a value of 1000000000000 a 32-bit floating-point number will be able to using an entirely different interpretation

698330
afp	smb
the share is made accessible by the synology through afp and smb and i could activate nfs sharing as well

698330
cifs	smb	cifs	afp	afp	smb
i used the noowners switch for afp and the -d and -f switch for smb cifs

698334
subnet	packets
1.a router connects different subnet together and every port of a router should be connected to a different subnet the reason is that when a packets destined for a certain ip address arrives to the router then the router checks its routing table to find the right destination for that packets but if there are two ports with the same subnet which way should the packets go

698334
subnet	vlan
i don t know anything about your thompson router but if there is a vlan option in its settings you may be able to add a new subnet using a new vlan

698338
ethernet	wireless
she has one ethernet port in her room and there is no wireless provided

698360
decimal	ieee
the simple decimal 32 version of the ieee standard allows numbers with about 7 decimal digits of precision and numbers of up to about 10 96 in magnitude

698362
installation	upgrade
but because i have an upgrade license a clean install would be hard so i would like to use the reset option on the installation disk

698367
versioning	upgrade
if you have the older versioning of windows and the upgrade dvd i would recommend a clean install to make sure no trace of virus is left in your disk

698368
folder	directory
if it s not showing up delete the corresponding user folder from the users directory

698371
ftp	telnet
while nearly all of this is wrapped up in web pages today there s still ftp telnet gopher news servers mail servers sip voice over ip and a few other fun protocols

698399
multiplying	add
you can t simply add text to a number just like you can t multiplying a number by text so some of these values can be converted between types

698399
integer	unsigned
yours is an example of a 32-bit unsigned integer where any value from 0 to 2 32-1 can be stored

698399
integer	radix
wouldn t it be much easier to store the number as an integer but agree to put the radix decimal point instead

698419
vmware	virtualbox
virtualbox and vmware are the two popular options

698431
umask	mount
remove the umask option altogether it is not a valid option with cifs mount

698444
opensuse	linux
now i regularly need to use linux specifically opensuse 12.3

698476
ssd	sata
edit also the kudu has a higher-capacity battery and supports up to 2 sata drives and one msata ssd etc

698502
rss	feed
are there any quality osx desktop and or mobile clients which interface well with redmine and provide more use ability than simply an atom or rss feed

698507
vmware	virtualbox
if that is the case consider vmware which is a decent alternative for virtualbox and is also free

698510
mouse	keyboard
uninstalled microsoft mouse keyboard software for a wireless kit

698531
int	chars
because displaying the number is done using individual chars not int

698531
int	chars
each digit in the number is represented with a separate chars literal whose int value is defined by the encoding being used for example a is represented with ascii value 97 while 1 is represented with 49

698531
int	chars
they are chars literals not int

698537
versioning	upgrade
i recently upgrade the openssl versioning on aixx 6.1 server

698561
flac	wma	mp3	flac
another thing that will influence quality is do you use compression on this audio files mp3 wma flac ... if so then most of the time except when you use a lossless compression format this compression will influence the quality more than the chosen sampling frequency

698579
ssd	sata
if your ssd is sata 3 it won t work correctly when mounted in the optibay

698581
sudoers	passwd
if you do not want to specify passwd every time add sesu to sudoers group and run command you want this way

698588
debian	centos
i am more familiar with debian but have been advised that centos rhel has better 64bit java 7 support

698588
debian	centos
would any difference be worth the transition from debian to centos

698591
debian	centos	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	centos
i ve been using bot centos and debian ubuntu with java7 and usually the main problem with performance is the configuration of the application

698591
boost	allocator
also keep in mind that tuning gc ram allocator and some other minor stuff here and there can provide significant boost to performance

698611
debian	centos
the centos v debian thing for java comes from the fact debian is by default very restrictive when it comes to non-free licences and as such the licence oracle attaches to java and the fact the package can only be distributes by oracle ends up being a pain to get natively and out of the box with debian

698682
ssl	https
how can i translate the config to be valid for a https ssl connection

698688
ati	nvidia
go here for nvidia drivers here for amd ati drivers or here for intel drivers

698690
debian-based	linux
the linux vm would be a very small and lightweight one debian-based

698702
wan	lan	wan	subnet	subnet	packets
you have said it all the two subnet on either side of the bridge are the same so the poor router when facing the task of sending a packets to 192.168.1.169 say does not know whether to use the wan side or the lan side

698709
centos	linux
actually if you run a modern distribution of linux such as fedora or centos chances are good that you already have an selinux system

698740
versioning	upgrade
upgrade pypy to the newest versioning but sudo port upgrade outdated did not work because it crashes before it reaches pypy

698749
ssd	sata
ssd samsung electronics 840 evo-series 250gb 2.5-inch sata iii single unit version internal solid state drive mz-7te250bw

698765
chown	chmod
from the wiki page on chmod it looks like you at minimum want the execute bit set on the group flags but you also have to make sure that all related users are assigned to the group assigned to home shareduser see chown so that they can recurse within it

698780
antivirus	norton
also you might want to disable your antivirus if you have one so that it doesn t interfere with norton antivirus check that yahoo performs before every download

698794
tunnel	vpn
another solution would be via 2 gre tunnel instead of the 2 vpn tunnel above

698803
ubuntu	linux
i have seen this both on linux ubuntu 13.10 and windows 7 that when a window editor browser terminal etc containing a text box with a blinking cursor goes out of focus it s cursor stops blinking

698804
vmware	virtualbox
my way is virtualbox or vmware with the minimal or lighter linux you can run and you can use vnc between those systems o teamviewer for communication

698812
ftp	smb
according to the manual for your ea6700 linksys intended smb windows-style file sharing to only be used on the lan and provided ftp server support for wan-side access to files on the usb disks attached to the gateway

698812
ftp	smb
ssh and ftp ports are also quite likely to be attacked so be sure to have extremely strong passwords everywhere even if you choose to provide file access via ftp or scp instead of smb

698852
put	get
once you get it to excel you can use an import wizard to put the data into the access table

698856
hash	md5
data corruption was detected using md5 hash md5sum or and microsoft s fciv which was wrong on the copy the md5 of both original and copy is repeatable

698856
ssd	sata
i have no reason to suspect the various source disks mostly sata some ssd

698874
folder	directory
thus i m looking for a program that can detect all files in a folder and it s subfolders move the files to a separate location and as a bonus delete the now empty directory from which the files were moved

698883
vmware	virtualbox
yes it is legal and even permitted in the eula to run osx as a virtual guest using vmware or virtualbox

698883
vmware	virtualbox
however there are no guest additions available in virtualbox for osx for optimizing speed display etc... so you might want to try both virtualbox and vmware to see which runs your guest-os the smoothest

698890
folder	directory
running this code in the command line at the root directory of the folder you want to flatten

698907
gentoo	linux
linux sabayon is based on linux gentoo

698941
mouse	keyboard
when certain event s take place i need to access the keyboard and mouse on that machine and do certain things

698945
mouse	keyboard
a kvm simply switches the keyboard video not in your case and mouse

699032
versioning	upgrade
edit when you paid to upgrade from a previous versioning of windows you should have received an email with your product key for the versioning of windows you upgrade to

699085
google-chrome	firefox
so in other browsers such as firefox or google-chrome some website are not loading and shows a page which shows only the message error

699089
grunt-contrib-connect	grunt-contrib-watch
what you could do instead is to run a server such as grunt-contrib-connect and a plugin that watches for file changes like grunt-contrib-watch

699089
grunt-contrib-connect	grunt-contrib-watch
have a look at the grunt-contrib-connect and grunt-contrib-watch documentation for more configuration options

699152
bsd	xnu
as far as i can tell it s not possible to explicitly set the output queue length it seems to be hard-coded in the xnu kernel bsd net if.h #define ifq_maxlen 50

699161
subnet	packets
are packets of a special nature called subnet directed broadcasts sdb s

699202
disk	ram
if you re running off of a cd or other non-writable medium like sd with the lock on or if you ve specifically disabled that functionality in the live kernel then the os will set aside a nominal amount of ram for the basic os functionality and treat the rest of the ram as not only ram but a ram disk in which case files are never really saved they are merely saved to ram until you copy that data to a writable medium like a hdd or thumb drive

699207
ubuntu	linux
i have a linux image ubuntu on an sd card for an embedded device

699248
16-bit	64bit
but ms-dos editor is a 16-bit software which cannot be run in win7 64bit and vim vi is not lite

699256
subtract	add
you can remove it from command line if configuration of gitlab permit this or you can use no_extract_addresses_remove_arguments options in exim configuration so exim try to add recipients from command line and not subtract them duplicates will be handled correctly so you should get what you want

699266
ubuntu	linux
many linux distributions like ubuntu ship with such a vim-tiny package

699291
mouse	keyboard
i have personally played around with scripts that repeated turn on and off the num cap and scroll locks another that repeatedly opens and closes the cd drive another that doesn t let the cd drive open inverts the mouse changes the keyboard layout changes the color depth changes the language etc

699308
cpu	processors
this piece of c++ code runs 8 threads in realtime priority so it should cause a 100 cpu hang even on modern i7 processors

699315
put	get
i loaded debian 7 on a vbox vm took 2 days to get everything to run correctly but cool now and just want to put a bitcoin wallet on so i went to the bitcoin site and downloaded the wallet

699324
mouse	keyboard
this would inexplicably disable any input devices such as mouse and keyboard until next reboot

699340
folder	directory
i was shocked to find out i was able to see a bunch of folder accessible over the network and i was able to access everyone s directory from another pc over the network

699343
ubuntu	debian
or if you are using ubuntu debian you can get easily from the repositories

699427
disk	ram
i recently found process explorer which provides exactly the feature i want but with ram cpu gpu and disk i o

699428
folder	dir
i want my ps1 to display if i m in a git folder the branch and color the branch with red if working dir is dirty and blue if it s clean

699442
switching	screens
basically it will create a blue blank screens with no way to switching between apps even with ctrl+tab

699482
ubuntu	linux
i need a usb drive with linux ubuntu in order to repair a 32-bit system

699510
folder	directory
unfortunately if the zip file has a folder there are always two folder so i need to move the files up one directory level

699530
pull	push
i had an issue in ubuntu 13.10 and 12.10 where attempting to connect to github git clone pull push or anything would fail with no output

699530
pull	push
anyone have a solution to allow my git pull push etc to work

699545
udp	tcp
if you need to forward udp as well then i would use this great small open source utility as netsh int portproxy only works with tcp

699570
ssl	https
they actually exist in the tls tls being the modern successor to ssl the security scheme for https world too but they re not in common use there

699570
ssl	https
if you know about https then you know it implies ssl or tls and you probably know that tls is the modern successor to ssl

699570
tunnel	vpn
by the way since many vpn technologies use ppp inside an encrypted tunnel eap has been common in the vpn world as well

699577
kde	gnome
you need to fix the code yourself or i suggest you abandon lxde and use a decent terminal under gnome or kde for example

699585
tunnel	vpn	voip	sip
on it says note that ssh tunnel is not a viable method for voip media path encryption. why can t ssh tunnel as opposed to a vpn be used for voip encryption when using unsecure voip protocols such as regular sip

699586
mouse	keyboard
usb composite device is used to wrap up multiple child devices in a single parent device such as two usb human interface device endpoints one for keyboard one for mouse like the logitech unifying receiver does

699594
udp	tcp
i d posit that the issue is that ssh is designed to handle tcp streams rather then udp

699594
udp	tcp	tunnel	vpn	tunnel	packets
similarly while some vpn s openvpn for example can create tcp tunnel i think you will find most prefer udp tunnel as they are more tolerant of packets loss

699594
udp	tcp	tunnel	packets
looking at the ch aracteristics of a tcp vs udp tunnel if a udp tunnel looses a packets it doesn t care it drops it and expects the encapsulated stream if its tcp or application if its udp to handle it

699594
tunnel	packets
a tcp tunnel would try and resend the packets which could have the impact of suddenly and highly increasing the jitter of the connection making a voip connection very unhappy - particularly if the endpoints are far away

699598
vpn	traceroute
an easy way to demonstrate this is to do a traceroute to a known point which goes is routed throught he vpn when its active - with and then without the vpn and you will notice the hop to your router is eliminated when using the vpn

699599
voip	sip
sip or other type of voip generally runs on top of udp protocol

699599
udp	tcp
one of the significant differences between tcp and udp is that tcp somewhat guarantees the delivery of each packet

699599
udp	tcp
in applications where some packet loss is not critical such as voip or streaming music or certain types of streaming video or some other real-time related applications udp is perfectly acceptable and tcp provides unnecessary overhead and complications

699606
wan	lan
on my openwrt router i have three interfaces a wan interface wan a lan interface eth0 and a openvpn interface tun0

699642
wan	lan
the correct way to insert a second router even though acting only as ap behind a first router is to connect a cable from a lan port on the main router to the wan port on the ap while leaving dhcp dnsmasq and what not disabled

699656
ssl	https
you need to change the url to an https url - this entails getting and using an https server - if you run your apache server and control your firewalling you can purchase an ssl cert and set up apache to run as both an http and https server otherwise you will need to speak to your service provider

699661
min	max
start title dpath i min max separate | shared low | normal | high | realtime | abovenormal | belownormal wait b filename parameters

699778
put	get
this only happens when doing an ftp get or put into a network storage if the file that i m trying to ftp is being written or read from the local hard disk on the centos machine then it works lightning quick

699790
ubuntu	linux
i m trying to connect an embedded linux to my ubuntu 12.04.3 lts by ethernet

699798
google-chrome	firefox
at first glance it seems that on windows 8.1 firefox google-chrome and ie for example all implement the os ui control appearance when it comes to scrollbars

699811
switching	screens
the flicker is due to the screens switching resolutions

699834
folder	directory
i have a directory in windows containing many folder

699867
ubuntu	linux
after i deleted linux partition from windows 7 i wanted to install a new version linux ultimate edition 3.8 which is based on ubuntu 13.04 raring ringtail

699877
sudoers	visudo
i ve edited the etc sudoers file with visudo adding the following line

699877
sudo	passwd
if i understand how sudo works this means that the user _www is allowed to execute like user otheruser without being prompted for passwd only from localhost

699894
mouse	keyboard
take control of their mouse or keyboard while they re doing something

699917
sorting	filtering
try removing the filtering and sorting again

a dvcs like mercurial or git or fossil or bazaar or veracity or... will allow you to pull in changes without merging and without seeing them in your working copy yet on those systems it could make sense to automatically push changes but svn combines the pull with the update so especially in svn such an automatic update would be a bad idea

apparently its some kind of temporary file that s being temporarily written to all the time and another suggestions said that i had run out of ram and the system was using the disk as some backup memory or something that s not true though

702854
subnet	packets
in the really bizarre case where nh2 is also not local your router will continue to look in its routing table until it finds a local subnet or it will drop the packets

702899
wan	lan
so make sure you have a single ethernet cable coming out of your cable modem s lan port and directly into your router s wan port

702976
next	except
i figure this is due to the fact that i have the browser clear cookies on exit which i want especially as google floods my browser with cookies that majority i don t think are needed the next time i fire-up my browser except the one related to authentication

702990
google-chrome	firefox	opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome

modern filesystems like ntfs have bad block features in which any sector known to be unuseable will be avoided

703007
fat	btrfs	filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	fat	filesystems	btrfs
drevitalize doesn t know or care what filesystems you have since it focuses only on individual sectors and not on actual data os it doesn t matter if you use fat ntfs ext btrfs etc

703028
x86	64bit
a quick way to check if your current installation is 64bit is to examine your c drive - look for the program files x86 folder

703028

openvpn	iptables
i have got it to work with hamachi and openvpn in a secure manner with iptables so only the minecraft port is accessable and only the server ip gets routed through the vpn however both require users to install additional software and place additional load on my server encrypting everything.

703119
vlookup	countif
i ve tried so many convoluted inefficient ways to achieve this result using a combination of sum countif and vlookup but it always counted all values and not first occurrence of a value in a given year

703121
filesystems	btrfs
copy the btrfs filesystems to the new hard drive

703320
hash	md5
mpdas last.fm scrobbler for mpd forces one to write password hash in md5

703324
salt	md5	hash	md5	hash	salt
because last.fm does not store your password they only store the md5 hash of your password which is still not a very good idea passwords should be salt and should go through many iterations to slow it down but maybe they just use the md5 as a starting point before they store it in the database

703341
countif	sumifs
the countif sumifs family of functions don t work with closed workbooks try sumproduct for a single workbook to replicate your count

debian	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	linux
i ve been playing around with debian lately as it seemed to me like the most logical step after starting my linux journey with ubuntu i really don t like unity and installing gnome along side it bothers me as i can t uninstall unity completely without messing up much of remaining desktop function. one thing that has always plagued me during the installation is the option to install grub

703417
debian	linux
debian is a linux distro that runs on a computer but to take it to a state where it can start working one requires a bootloader

703436
put	get
put only in .bash_profile and then you ll get screen run only when you re actually logging in instead of getting screen run every time you spawn an interactive shell i don t have scp sources at hand right now but have a faint memory of it actually spawning a shell so that the shell spawned processes .bashrc

703527
ethernet	wireless
my internet connection is frequently dropping on wired lan ethernet but the wireless works fine without any problem

703528

703611
ubuntu	debian
also if you know debian working with any of the debian based uber-distributions such as ubuntu is straight-forwards

703616
ubuntu	debian
what that means depends on your system on debian and ubuntu bin sh is a symlink to dash so that s what your default shell is

703616
bash	zsh
dash does not have the functionality you want you need to switch to another shell like bash or zsh

703892
cifs	smb
sharing folders via windows is called smb or cifs

703898
disk	ram
now consider that these days bringing up a generic system based on linux requires some early-available user-space tools which are kept on the so-called initrd initial ram disk or initramfs initial ram filesystem so actually the boot loader loads not only the linux kernel but also a matching initramfs for it

703904
vlookup	sumifs
you use sumifs range criteria sum_range if you do not want to manually enter all of the possible criteria you can use in combination with a h or vlookup

postgresql	mysql
if you mean to allow users to access data remotely and grant some users the ability to modify that data you may be looking for a more fully-featured rdbms such as an sql server and you might look into microsoft sql server mysql or postgresql

704330
ssd	sata
the hard drive installed in your machine currently is an ide drive which does not bode well for upgrading to an ssd however it does have a sata controller

debian	linux
the machine will run debian gnu linux and we would like to allow multiple people to do administration tasks in particular installing updating and configuring software but we would not like to give everyone of those administrators read access to everybody s home directories so giving them some direct way of becoming root is not the optimal solution

filesystems	btrfs
btrfs has a different on disk format that will outperform other filesystems on some write patterns

705501

705589
wan	lan
it sounds like a mixture of a routing conflict between wan and lan along with security policies being applied

705589
wan	lan
i highly recommend you change your modem to 192.168.1.1 and set your router s wan port to 192.168.1.2 then you can continue to use 192.168.0.0 24 on your lan

706262
mouse	keyboard
...then again since the magic mouse really is about the world s worst gaming mouse perhaps i ll repurpose an old 42 hdtv i m not using and get a dock for the mbp a regular kvm switch and a solid 3rd party keyboard and mouse to do all this

706277
post	get
yes remove even graphic card and see if you get different post beeps

706283
versioning	upgrade
i d also suggest checking if you can get an n versioning of your bridge if you arn t intending to upgrade to ac soon since its likely to be cheaper

706286
freebsd	linux
if there is no specific infomation utility for a filetype you could use hexdump comes with freebsd and osx also available on linux

706308
google-chrome	firefox
to do this what i found easiest is to use google-chrome instead of firefox with the so-called vimium extension see

706348
integer	unsigned
systems typically reserve the highest unsigned integer value 0xffff or -1 if the value is interpreted as a signed integer to indicate invalid or unused

bluetooth	usb
you could put a bluetooth adaptor on a usb kvm but that would be messy and may not start up correctly on toggle

706480
mouse	keyboard
i have used synergy to share my keyboard mouse across a mac and windows environment

706480
vpn	lan
caveat #2 you need to be on a lan network environment if you use a vpn this option may not work for you

706493
tiff	bmp
eps has an optional embedded preview image which may be a tiff or bmp image with whatever transparency options those formats offer

706520
wan	lan
the e1200 is statically assigned on the wan side and the lan is on 192.168.1.1 24

706535
folder	directory
it looks like i have the opposite of what i want set up as i can easily see into the localhost _projects fresh2 app config directory and see all these files as a directory listing in my browser but the one folder that i would expect to see public isn t there i m guessing this is down to the permissions

706536
hash	md5
while md5 is not considered secure for verifying the integrity of a file it is still pretty much impossible to recreate the file from the hash

706578
integer	unsigned
-1 cast to a 16-bit unsigned integer which is what uid_t and gid_t at the system call interface used to be is of course 65535 as you observed

706686
wan	lan
modem ------- wan cisco firewall rvs4000 ------ lan switch ----- wan asus rt-ac66u

706712
cpu	processors
when thinking of upgrading your computer to something modern you ll want the most modern cpu available even if you don t end up buying a high-end one because an up-to-date processors is always more future-proof than an older one

706729
google-chrome	firefox
when checking with some tools from the sysinternals suite i find that my open browsers firefox and google-chrome are attempting to connect to www.007guard.com 1337 and www.007guard.com 1338

706745
wan	lan	wan	subnet
if you have the same subnet on both the lan and wan sides of a router it won t work at least not properly if at all

706745
wan	lan	wan	subnet
if i understand correctly the goal is to get the devices on the lan side of the asus into the same subnet as those on the lan side of the cisco then just take the asus out of the network and plug the devices that were on the lan side of the asus directly into the switch or depending on wiring conditions placement replace the asus router with a switch or move the wire from the wan side and plug it into the lan side and use the asus router s lan-side only as a switch

706835
macports	homebrew
in case it s relevant i have homebrew installed and would like to avoid macports

706837
rtp	rtcp
the problem is that the firewall is blocked the rtp and rtcp traffic

706837
rtp	rtcp
then you should open the etc asterisk rtp.conf file and edit the follow lines with the ports that you want use to rtp and rtcp protocol

706837
udp	rtp
rtp protocol works over udp then you should open this udp port range

706848
trojan	virus
virus trojan

706848
post	put
i have no idea why this is not happening in safe mode and running windows successfully under safe mode put me in completely wrong route searching for an error in software instead of hardware the source of the fault was system bios or uefi in my case not running at all after system post s and boots

706869
google-chrome	firefox
and it s not the browser i ve tried google-chrome ie firefox all three of them say they spend 30-60 seconds waiting after having sent the request

srt	subtitle
i haven t used quicktime for subtitle for quite a while but i seem to recall that muxing an avi and srt to a mov worked although that s just softcoding

706967
subnet	packets
so remote s packets are not making it to the local subnet

706967
subnet	packets
so it seems that openvpn is not forwarding packets received on the tun device to freebsd s ethernet adapter and out to the local subnet

707009
google-chrome	firefox	mp3	ogg
as it is known firefox supports ogg format and google-chrome mp3

707010
mp3	ogg
imo to support as many browsers as possible i would use a combination of a proprietary and an open source codec like mp3 and ogg vorbis

707015
ssd	sata
if you need to ensure that every ssd you have will have its full bus speed per sata port you may want to consider pcie - sata card

707029
disk	ram
so ram and hard disk are both types of memory

is there a way to undo pycharm patch installation and downgrade from 3.0.2 to 3.0.0

707167
google-chrome	firefox
currently i can t run java applets on any of my browsers google-chrome firefox ie

707167
google-chrome	firefox
if so how do i tell google-chrome firefox where too check for the plug in

707168
disk	ram
hibernation.sys is another file that is used when your system needs to transfer everything from the ram to the hard disk whilst it is in hibernation

707168
folder	directory
this would indicate to me if your username is john for example that your home directory for this user is c users john and not related to that folder above mentioned

707175
chown	sudo	folder	directory
you will need to open terminal and type sudo chown -r username usergroup to change the files and folder using the same directory technique as above to change everything to the ftp user so that you can change the files as required

707201
filesystems	ntfs
ntfs is far superior to fat32 and will handle any filesystems errors better than fat32

707201
filesystems	ntfs
prior to windows 8 shutting down windows would be sufficient to close an ntfs filesystems

707207
opera	firefox
it doesn t need to be internet explorer firefox and opera should be just fine

707214
ssd	sata
i would always try to connect your ssd to the first sata port probably where your hdd is currectly connected but it actually makes very little difference

707240
putty	winscp
as a couple examples of what i want by default on my windows machine when i use putty or winscp to connect to remote host both programs ask me for the passphrase for the given key every time i log in

707254
bios	rootkit
this allows bios software to be easily upgraded to add new features or fix bugs but can make the computer vulnerable to bios rootkit

707256
put	get
back then for such operations you had to remove the bios chip from the board put a new one if its not prom or eprom or if its eprom you have to get it to the manufacturer and let them re-program the chip and re-attach it to the board

707263
disk	ram
ram disk is a device driver that merely creates block devices that store their data in memory fixed max size allocated gradually by need which you can use for any purpose create ext2 filesystem on it and then mount to some location in filesystem

707263
disk	ram
in other words when you write to ram disk your data is saved to memory allocated by that ram disk plus that data is saved in ram by kernel caching mechanism so we get duplication here

707311
folder	directory
i can see all the folder directory but i am denied access when trying to copy my user folder

707312

debian	linux
i have got linux debian os

707417
boost	stl
anecdotal in my industry experiences i have found middleware to mean web services or something of the like at least what the person using the term is meaning anyways though i have also seen heard it mis used in many job postings and interviews to mean a variety of things from api s and libraries like boost or spring to the c++ stl and even c# itself the language itself not .net

707421
rpm	yum
i m using tmux on fedora 20 i installed the default tmux rpm using yum

707458
hide	show
i d also add that having a plausibly deniable os partition or a plausibly deniable file store or having the data on a removable device might be superior since in many cases having encryption software kind of show you have something to hide

707477
ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	linux
i m already trying with linux mint and the problem is also present here i m sure that it s not a harware fault because i can use it fine with windows ubuntu and elementary os

707572

707718
filesystems	ntfs
partition the hdd as follows 1500gb filesystems ntfs 500gb filesystems ext4

707752
udp	tcp
third you should definitely not use the flag u because this means looking at udp ports while you are getting an error on ssh which is most definitely using tcp not udp

707800
vmware	bootcamp
for best performance should i choose to install a bootcamp partition and run that through vmware fusion or should i use a virtual disk with fusion

707809
ffdshow	mpeg
i installed ffdshow to get an mpeg 2 codec and that allows me to play test mpeg 2 files but doesn t help with the wtv files

707828
disk	ram
with ram you can reduce the bottleneck that is disk i o

707829
disk	ram
i suggest you to try a clean windows installation on a new or other hard disk with minimum ram 2 or 4 gb ram

707849
ubuntu	linux
if you are concerned about monitoring the health of your disk i recommend you use speedfan on windows systems or palimsest in linux ubuntu s disk utility is based on palimsest

707874
vlc	mkv
i have vlc on my pc which i used to use for watching shows but i ve recently switched to using xbmc so i can stream things control my pc from my phone but i ve noticed that xbmc has a much lower quality of video playback compared to vlc mkv s and mp4 s

707882
switching	screens
another way to lock a mac is to log out to the fast user switching screens

707892
cpu	processors
required translating the parsed-out code usually some sort of abstract data model state machine abstract syntax tree or something like that into either high-level commands statements in c or java or low-level commands cpu instructions for an x86 processors

707892
cpu	processors
for instance if you analyze the code flow of a long sequence of cpu instructions and determine at a high level that what it s asking for is playing a certain mp3 file from disk you can skip the whole instruction-level emulation and just use your native platform s mp3 decoder which may be optimized for your processors to play the same mp3 file

707895
move	drag
you may get better results in some layouts if you move the anchor manually click and drag it to a better spot

which is the correct command for debian-family distros debian ubuntu mint ... if you are not on one of those please adapt it to your distro

708041
spyware	antivirus
you could try to close all outlook and other processes that protect your current settings and retry after it may be working when you re able to find out what exactly is blocking your order to make changes to default browser settings eg antivirus anti spyware firewall etc if so you need to change in the program that protect your settings as well.

708061

everything works but i have no wireless connectivity or through my ethernet port

708062
mouse	keyboard
if i move the mouse or press any key on the keyboard the screen wakes up

708064
google-chrome	firefox
i cannot replicate this issue with browsers such as firefox or google-chrome which i believe use gecko and blink respectively

708093
tunnel	vpn
a better choice would be to set up the same apparatus vpn end tunnel on a pc and then route all pandora requests through that pc

708118
vpn	lan
such vpn is designed to allow me to send wol wake on lan packets from a remote device and accessing samba shares

708144

708231
filesystems	fat
it understands the fat filesystems format and can read executable files from fat volumes and run them

708242
tunnel	vpn
you do not want to build a split tunnel since this will only send traffic through the vpn that is on your home s physical network

708246
processors	hyperthreading	put	get
hyperthreading is both a cost-saving and a power-saving mechanism allowing you to get better performance per watt you put the same energy in but get more performance out than you would on processors without hyperthreading

708246
cpu	processors
of course outside of the low-voltage category there are also higher performance xeons in the recent series such as the beastly 15-core e7-8890 v2 due for release in q1 2014 which is incredibly high-end with a 155 watt tdp very large for a cpu -- the huge difference being that with all those high-end cores this processors can do a lot more than a low-voltage chip

708248
ssd	sata
that s how i run my machine i put the os and some basic common use utilities programs browser av etc on the ssd and all programs games... go onto the sata drive

708277
filesystems	ntfs
ntfs volumes contain a master file table at the core of the ntfs filesystems

708282
ubuntu	linux
this is how gnu linux system administration should be but because systemd is so new and because it s not invented here meaning canonical didn t invent it ubuntu doesn t want to use it

708296

the workstations are 4 macs 2 windows 2 linux ubuntu

708325
google-chrome	firefox

708381
folder	directory
i was using sudo rm -rf to delete some folder and accidentally deleted the users ec2-user home directory

708384
daemons	systemd
ever more complex gyrations to cope with forking from expect daemons to switching to systemd miss the point that the right thing to do is to stop the daemons from forking

708386
folder	directory
in my root directory i have a couple folder named something like aa bb cc etc. each containing files in the format aa1001.txt bb1002.txt etc

708740
versioning	upgrade
can i use brew to upgrade this versioning

attempting to install using the debian package under mint produces the following error

708882
mouse	keyboard
i will then use a autohotkey script on the first vm that will control the mouse and keyboard and simulate these administrative activities that will kick off shortly after a student gets onto the system

708908
ubuntu	linux
restart pulseaudio on the linux machine s ubuntu pulseaudio -k for other distros i imagine you d restart the server like you do any other sudo service pulseaudio restart

708942
versioning	upgrade
i know how to run sysupgrade on it to upgrade it but how do i find the platform i m running to download a newer versioning from

708954
google-chrome	firefox
it does not affect only google-chrome but all my other browsers including ie and firefox

708967
versioning	upgrade
the flash player versioning was at 11 so i upgrade the flash player to 12.0.0.38

708967
versioning	upgrade
i upgrade windows 7 to service pack 1 and internet explorer to versioning 10

709004
stdout	stderr
the 2 1 redirects stderr to stdout

709046
tunnel	vpn
there is a very slight overhead when using a secure encrypted vpn tunnel and it would be dependent on the specific vpn protocols used and the level of encryption that is set

709056
bash	zsh	bash	tcsh	zsh	tcsh	tcsh	dash
this is the same for a lot of shells bash zsh pdksh tcsh dash jsh sash

709060
ubuntu	linux
since you ve not told us what flavour of linux your using i ll make a guess at ubuntu in which case start here

709064
chown	sudo
sudo chown -r username username home samba

709077
filesystems	ntfs
ntfs is a kind of filesystems one of the many options available for abstracting the bytes present within your partitions into logical files within the directory tree

709100
vpn	lan
here i assumed that your lan subnet is 192.168.0.0 24 and your gateway without vpn 192.168.0.1

709112
folder	directory
my goal is to not have to always tell ack which directory to grep in a given project if i don t it s slow because it scans non-source folder as well

709112
folder	directory
i ve so far come up with puting an executable . ack script in the project folder that delegates to the global ack command with some extra options but ideally i would have something like .ackrc in that project directory and ack would just pick that up automatically

709150
subnet	packets
5.configure advanced routing in the new router so that it has a new routing rule all packets to the subnet 192.168.0.0 25 notice 25 twentyfive corresponding to netmask 255.255.255.128 is to be routed through 192.168.0.1

709173
google-chrome	firefox
while firefox and google-chrome can use the already existing

709179
disk	ram
you are running gpgpu workloads with a very specific workload that does not require a high sustained cpu-to-gpu throughput or a very large dataset which would ideally be stored in lots of ram and not on disk or the network

709179
ssd	sata
128 gb 2.5 sata 6 gb s ssd

709208
wan	lan
if you mean absolutely physically separate you need a router that has 1 wan interface and 2 lan interfaces and which will look at the destination ips of your traffic and forward traffic to a different lan interface depending on the destination ip

709221
ethernet	wireless
wireless ethernet switch and router port

709221
ethernet	wireless
if the packet originates on the wireless port it can only send and receive packets that are destined or originate from the router port or ethernet switch port.

709222
ethernet	wireless
the hang occurs on both the ethernet interfaces desktop computers hard wired and the wifi interface ipads and other devices connected wireless

709275
ubuntu	linux
what about if i do this in linux say ubuntu

709281
google-chrome	firefox
i ve also tried checking the settings for both google-chrome and firefox but neither have the option to block a specific cookie only to block certain domains

709300
google-chrome	firefox
note that this will appear whatever browser i am using google-chrome ie firefox

709315
ansible	puppet
an alternative would be to use methods like salt ansible puppet chef .

709328
spaces	delimiter
to handle text delimiter by both spaces and commas using this method you can preprocess your text by replacing commas with spaces

709349
sudoers	passwd
use the sudoers file to add the possibility to execute sftp-server by your user without asking a passwd

709349
sudo	passwd
this will allow sudo to be executed without a passwd since you have already executed it a moment before

709349
sudo	passwd
you can also try to pipe the passwd directly to sudo but i don t recommend this since it is insecure and probably won t work because the server is not spawned by a shell

709372
debian	linux
if i create a virtual machine on the ms windows version of workstation win7 and workstation 9 can a friend use the ms windows virtual machine with the linux version of workstation installed on his laptop debian 6 squeeze and workstation 9

709374
vmware	virtualbox
change cpu type count ram vmware virtualbox just like you want

709376
vpn	lan
ideally i would like to access to both vpn if the dns for vnp nets does not work i can manage it with direct ip not a problem and ideally access to my local lan too.

709392
debian	linux
if i create a virtual machine on the ms windows version of workstation win7 and workstation 9 can a friend use the ms windows virtual machine with the linux version of workstation installed on his laptop debian 6 squeeze and workstation 9

709424
disk	ram
in other words if the system is corrupt either ram or the disk producing wrong bits flipped bits corrupted data then this will fail where a simple might succeed and the chances of this getting to the rm line with corrupt data are vanishingly small because most errors tend to corrupt data in random ways the chances of the random change causing a hash collision in sha1 during the readback is breathtakingly tiny.

709429
put	get
then you can get a desktop optical drive put it in there and be done with it

709455
folder	directory
directory folder

709464
sudo	passwd
sudo su will log you in as root with joe s passwd

709471
google-chrome	firefox
right now i have 12 google-chrome windows probably averaging 10 tabs per window plus my other running programs including firefox

709473
sudo	passwd
i just trying to figure out how i can only have pam authentications just for the main login screens and not the whole system because any time i want to run sudo from terminal or an authentication dialogue comes up for me to enter passwd it takes up to 1-2 minutes just to authenticate a given command or task

709507
firefox	safari
when i test this in other browsers firefox ie and safari it works all fine

709519
ethernet	wireless
it does not detect wireless network cards as physical devices instead wireless card are seen as virtual ethernet devices

709538
move	drag
you can drag and hold âœ to force move

709550
sudo	passwd
sudo - run a command with uid gid of an other user authenticating with your passwd

709557
folder	dir
dir a or ls -la says no file no folder is on root.

709570
robocopy	xcopy
hence i am looking at options like robocopy xcopy richcopy synctoy etc

709582
tunnel	vpn
on windows i would use teamviewer vpn to tunnel http and use ftp to access the file system

709598
macports	homebrew
there are tutorials like this teaching how to port from macports to homebrew

709599
vmware	virtualbox
i installed arch-linux on virtualbox i ve installed it on vmware before and it was a pain to set up but on virtualbox although not easy as is traditional for arch it was much more straightforward

709599
vmware	virtualbox
the performance also seems slightly better than what i remember from vmware and it should tell you something that when setting up a linux vm in virtualbox it allows you to select a ton of distros but in vmware it only has a handful of distros and other kernel 2.6.x or something like that

709599
vmware	virtualbox
unless vmware has some feature that virtualbox doesn t that you want to use i would go with virtualbox

709599
vmware	virtualbox
i know vmware beats virtualbox in this area for windows but i haven t tested it for linux so i can t judge which one is better if you want to do things like watch videos or play some low-end graphic games

709599
vmware	virtualbox
short answer i feel that virtualbox outperforms vmware with linux guests in almost all areas but i didn t provide any proof making this a rather mediocre answer but better than no answer

709608
g++	gcc
el6_2.9.src glibc-2.12-2-gc4ccff1 binary --host i686-redhat-linux --build i686-redhat-linux --enable-static --disable-nss-crypt cc gcc -wa --32 -m32 cxx g++ -wa --32 -m32 cflags -o2 -march i686 cxxflags -o2 -march i686 ldflags -m32

709621
filtering	grouping
certain fansub grouping have been pushing for more high quality releases using using madvr lav filtering mpc-hc and xy-vsfilter

709626
udp	tcp
i thought it was a router firewall issue i have modified the router firewall to let my ip address through on tcp and udp on ports 1433 and 1434 both source and destination

709671
disk	ram
as you know linux tries to reduce number of disk access by using free space of ram as a cache disk and here by counting number of disk accesses i exactly mean how many times os needs to bring data from hard disk to main memory ram hit miss

709676
debian	linux
linux distro in question is debian 7.3

709695
folder	directory
first i tried putting a symlink into the var www directory that points to the project folder in my home directory

709711
appdata	uninstaller
i also uninstaller chrome and cleared the extension folder in user-data inside appdata

709712
cifs	smb
this is just how cifs smb is if you are on a high latency connection 50ms

709764
post	get
of course if the search is via get it s easy to bookmark but what if the search is via post

709765
google-chrome	firefox
there are extensions for both firefox and google-chrome available

709770
post	get
then they would have to get a warrant for your arrest and get it to your local pd who would have to be willing to go arrest you and the investigating pd would have to be willing to pay to have you extradited which they probably will only do if you have done something bad enough that you won t be able to post bail

709773
trojan	virus	antivirus	norton
demonstrable error and per-configured error in cache designed like normal .exe program but actually virus recognised by norton antivirus programs as being trojan

709807
ethernet	wireless
i m using an ethernet card to connect to the internet and am attempting to route the internet from there to my wireless card

709820
sudoers	passwd
i have also added the user to the sudoers file to run the sftp-server without a passwd

709839
sudoers	visudo
so i added the following to etc sudoers edited by doing visudo

709840
google-chrome	firefox
this problem occurs in both my browsers google-chrome and firefox

709846
tunnel	vpn
how do you account trying to copy files from an hdd through a vpn tunnel

709875
macbook	bootcamp
i am running mavericks on a late 2013 model macbook pro 13 retina intel i5 chip and have installed windows 8.1 into a bootcamp partition

709875
parallels	bootcamp
additionally i have set up parallels 9 to used the windows 8 bootcamp partition and when i launch into parallels i have no problem setting up and starting a vm

709879
debian	linux
i am trying to set up a wifi hotspot using brctl and hostapd on debian gnu linux but it seems it does not work

709903
udp	tcp
try encapsulating the tcp connection in udp packets

709914
mouse	keyboard
in some cases this may be a pictogram of the intended purpose of the port for example printers for parallel ports ioioi for serial ports and mouse and keyboard symbols

709939
folder	directory
i m not quite sure what your directory folder looks like but assuming that edu n career is one directory you shouldn t need to escape that with its own set of double quotes you should be able to change the code to

709953
temp	tmp
is it right to have these two environment variables temp and tmp

709953
temp	tmp
for example i was installing cygwin and the directions told me to change the path variable but both temp and tmp have the path variable

709953
temp	tmp
path in tmp userprofile appdata local temp

709958
versioning	upgrade
i also upgrade the bios to versioning 0808 the latest built on 6th jan 2014

709974
temp	tmp
from memory when i used this in mid 80s temp was the original one used in dos and tmp tended to be used by programs that were ported from unix to match the tmp

709999
logmein	hamachi
i also setup a vnc with logmein hamachi so that i can access the lan from the internet

710052
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
firefox ie11 safari google-chrome

710060
unix	bsd
now about your specific question about using the date 1 command the unix man page for date 1 in the bsd general commands manual has this example

710094
ethernet	wireless	wan	lan
something that just bridges between wireless clients and a wired ethernet what you have to do is turn off their dhcp server or set its dhcp ip address lease pool to a zero-length range and then plug the lan port not the wan port into your home lan

710101
sctp	tcp
the proto struct for sctp which is defined as sctp_prot has a listing for the find bind function which hooks to sctp_bind but where is the tcp socket bind function

710119
ubuntu	linux
there are no drivers supplied for either windows vista or linux by the manufacturer so i used the additional drivers tool of ubuntu to find some proprietary drivers for it

710135
opera	safari	opera	firefox	firefox	safari
when i try to use firefox safari or opera i cannot browse to any site

710135
google-chrome	firefox
so basically i can run google-chrome and the other browsers mentioned but firefox will not respond

710135
opera	firefox
still the problem exists with firefox and opera

710189
folder	directory
however say that i have multiple projects in order folder in directory such as

710210
subnet	packets
if a router receives a packets for routing it makes a similar decision based on all subnet it is directly connected too

710210
subnet	packets
it chooses which subnet to send the packets onwards through it s routing table. note the routing table on the client machine was used in the first step - try cmd route print on windows

710216
capitalization	uppercase
capitalization is ignored so no need to include both lower- and uppercase

710241
temp	tmp
as mark mentioned some programs use tmp while other use temp

710241
temp	tmp
also note that the path variable has nothing to do with either tmp or temp

710241
temp	tmp
path is a system variable while tmp and temp are both system variables as well as user variables

710241
temp	tmp
open a cmd window and type in echo tmp or echo temp and it returns the path defined in the user version of the variables

710241
temp	tmp
i m not entirely sure how programs use the path system variable which is likely what cygwin was referring to but regardless i can assure you it has nothing to do with tmp or temp

710245
ssd	sata
i set the sata mode to ahci before installing windows on the ssd

710250
mp4	h.264
as an example you can simply drag an mp4 video into a firefox tab and it will play assuming h.264 video and aac audio anyway

710271
opera	safari
i want to move cache folder for opera safari and some other apps to the external drive

710273
versioning	upgrade
some companies may upgrade to win 8 eventually maybe in a year or two unless microsoft decides to release windows 9 as a desktop only versioning and make a separate versioning for tablets instead of this hybrid thing they did with win 8

710278
tolower	toupper
an interesting sidenote many programming languages have methods like tolower or toupper etc that makes these tools really easy to create

710316
google-chrome	firefox
this is the case for all browsers google-chrome ie firefox

710338
apache	nginx
and in the amount of requests served per second nginx beats apache by a wide margin

710340
nas	qnap
should be usable from mac osx android ios devices as well as a qnap nas 4.0 software

710350
versioning	upgrade
i want to install my win7 upgrade versioning onto my new lenovo l440

710378
tunnel	vpn
i believe it should be possible to prioritize vpn because hamachi for example also creates virtual interface with automatic metric turned on but after connecting it always has lower metric than both physical network and openvpn tunnel

710384
put	get
but it would be a good idea to put it somewhere with good ventilation since you are going to run the disk continuously to get the data off of it

710395
cpu	irq
this almost sounds like an irq flood causing the cpu to spend all it s time doing essentially nothing

710403
ubuntu	centos
i have a ubuntu desktop and would like to install centos on top of it as a dual boot

710403
ubuntu	centos
i d like to keep ubuntu on the first drive and put centos on the second one which currently just has extra data

710406
ethernet	wireless
despite the no antennas ironically it seems to have 300mbps wireless and 900mbps over ethernet

710407
ubuntu	centos
anything that centos can do ubuntu can as well ad vice versa

710415
screens	tablet
i m looking for a windows 8.1 tablet that will act similarly to a traditional laptop desktop in the sense that hitting the power button to turn off the screens will not kill background activity unless i put the computer to sleep

710439
filesystems	ntfs
you should be able to mount a ntfs filesystems under linux although the write function is considered experimental

710439
filesystems	ntfs
for some versions of mac it is necessary to buy a software driver to support read and write for the ntfs filesystems

710442
margin	height
the minimum height depends on the text font size and a bit of margin padding in the event boxes the minimum height allows to vertically display the text

710445
debian-based	mint	debian-based	linux
the distribution i ve got is linux mint w cinnamon gui which is offered as debian-based or as ubuntu-based versions

710454
subnet	ip-address
when you use nat with virtualbox each machine is on its own virtual subnet and gets its ip-address from the built-in dhcp-server in the virtualbox

710462
ubuntu	linux
linux tested on ubuntu linux lucid lynx

710497
put	get
i can go in a put console stdout statements at lines a b c and get a complete listing trace of how the variable that i m interested

710500
ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	linux
seems linux mint 16 and ubuntu current don t do libx264 with ffmpeg anymore

710522
cpu	processors
with some sound cards typically higher end they have their own processors built into the card so all audio processing is handled by the card instead of the cpu same logic as an external add-n video card having its own processors to handle graphics processing

710522
cpu	processors
so if you re looking to maximize your cpu s resources then consider an external sound card with its own built in processors

710546
debian	mint	ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	debian
regarding the avconv issue there s a holy war between the two projects and the package maintainer that makes most of the packages for debian and thus ubuntu and thus mint is on the libav side

710589
folder	directory
but the problem is that anyone can just go to server home-directories and then have their pick any anyone else s home directory profile folder

710612
versioning	upgrade
did you recently do a software update or upgrade the versioning of os x you are running

710615
bash	zsh
here s the function for shells bash or zsh that changes the background color

710625
put	get
so here 74.125.236.195 is the ip address of google.but for suppose i want to know the ip address of superuser.com and if i try using the same way then i get 198.252.206.16 ip address.but if i put this ip addess in browser url then my browser does not take me to superuser.com

710629
put	get
if you just put in an ip address you won t get any of them because you are not telling the webserver which of the many websites you are after

710657
vpn	lan
lastly this command adds your vpn dnss in case you should need these to resolve host names on the remote lan but it places them in the back seat with respect to the dns of your local network so that they are called upon only if the local dnss fail for the remote lan

710710
mouse	keyboard
happy with the laptop but one thing i find annoying is that when i use it through the docking station - it takes several minutes ie 3-5 for the usb keyboard and mouse plugged into the docking station to be recognized activated

710794
burn	uninstaller
later on i decided to uninstaller it because i am rarely burn a cd

710802
ffmpeg	handbrake
but then i ve tried ffmpeg handbrake other video apps but nothing seems to be able to get past the windows 8 pro .wtv encryption

710815
filesystems	fat
for instance on fat filesystems the first sector is called the boot sector and contains some fields which identify in particular the filesystems length

710815
filesystems	fat
for each sector try to see if it could be a boot sector for a fat filesystems and if yes extract its length

710887
opera	firefox
no issue with firefox msie and opera work

710904
ssl	https
https connections via firefox work totally fine on this machine is it the same ssl connection as used by imap

710915
stdout	stderr
try redirecting the stdout stderr and exit code of the java process to a file or use the bsub options -o -oo -e -eo

710941
folder	directory
and there is sufficient permissions in the folder to create new files and there are no files folder called core in the runtime directory

710952
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
keep getting error whenever i connect to youtube.com on google-chrome firefox and safari

710970
ethernet	wireless
for best results use a local performance tool like iperf between a gigabit ethernet machine on lan and your wireless client

710986
sysv	systemd
i know that besides systemd there are other init systemd like sysv and upstart

711008
ubuntu	linux
on ubuntu gnu linux and gnu linux in general it should be sbin shutdown

711019
freebsd	linux
fortunately actual consoles on linux and freebsd at least do also exhibit this behaviour

711019
freebsd	linux
freebsd changed its kernel terminal emulator to be xterm-compatible in version 9.0 as part of a project to get utf-8 support on virtual consoles. all of these xterm-alikes and the linux kernel terminal emulator have the full settable hard tabs mechanism

711047
x86	64bit
to me that looks like i am runing an x86 linux kernel that is 64bit

712072
wan	lan
make sure the two internal networks that of the modem router and that of the netgear are distinct otherwise your netgear will be puzzled when it gets a request to forward a packet to a given address since it will not know whether the address is on the wan or on the lan side

712072
vpn	lan
you may pick as the lan side net of the netgear something unusual like 192.168.211.0 24 which will come in handy if you want to set up a vpn or if you need to connect to one

712082
google-chrome	firefox
same problem happens in google-chrome and firefox

712091
chown	chmod
i ve been using chown and chmod to set the group rights recursively on folders

712099
sudo	passwd
now i can t give permissions to sudo for root because sudo is broken and i can t login as root to change permissions because it s asking for passwd

712102
vmware	esx
when run on linux vm that sit on vmware esx machine i got 0 cache-misses

712102
vmware	esx
if yes is there any other way to get the cache-misses information for linux vm that sit on vmware esx

712133
tar	gunzip
you ve got to gunzip to get back to the tar

712156
portrait	landscape
i m using two of them in pivot mode portrait and one of them in standard landscape mode

712192
mouse	keyboard
remote access involves running an os on the server and either full oses or thin clients for the users where they log into a session on the server and effectively only have a local screen keyboard and mouse - the local machine does no processing or storage

712221
sudo	passwd
also did this nata nata-virtualbox sudo iptables -a output -p tcp -m string --algo bm --string passwd --dport 80 -j drop

712227
ubuntu	linux
i m using john the ripper version 1.7.8 on linux ubuntu to crack linux user passwords as an exercise

712241
hash	salt
type of hash and the number of different salt if applicable

712358
versioning	upgrade
the versioning of windows you re running you can also use upgrade

712376
mouse	keyboard
i am not able to enter bios and or use keyboard mouse while the pc is booting once the windows loaded it detects my pci card with usb ports on it and the mouse and keyboard works finally.

712376
mouse	keyboard
so now the problem since i am not able to use mouse and or keyboard on the boot i cant choose windows 8

712376
mouse	keyboard
remember i cant use keyboard and mouse on startup and not able to enter bios

712391
google-chrome	firefox
if none of these solutions work i would seriously recommend switching to a different browser such as firefox or google-chrome

712420
filesystems	ntfs
when i turn fh off and then on i get an error message file history has found files that are encrypted with encrypting filesystems on a network location or on a drive that doesn t use the the ntfs filesystems

712461
google-chrome	firefox
i am interested in solutions for both firefox and google-chrome

712462
udp	tcp
it s working fine locally udp and tcp dig localhost

712468
folder	directory
if i m not wrong i can t say for sure as i haven t tested this as long as you remove the permission on the top level directory folder the other user other group users can t traverse into the directory even if they have permission on the sub folder

712469
folder	directory
will print all the files with extension .tif found in the foldername directory folder and then close irfanview

712483
titlebar	window
this question talks about changing the titlebar and window border padding so that it is smaller

712510
dns	spf
cpanel advanced dns main domain spf and dkim for google apps see pic 2

712519
vmware	virtualbox
vmware and virtualbox run into the occasional issue and it s easier to find help online for virtualbox based on empirical evidence but i ve used both quiet a bit

712524
subnet	packets
so if you remove the default gateway you will only have access to your homegroup and machines on the same subnet that packets will be switched

712544
bluetooth	usb
i have a generic usb bluetooth le dongle which uses the csr-8510 chip

712548
trojan	virus
you should be able to verify this based on the md5sum - particularly if its a common file or a common virus trojan payload

712557
mouse	keyboard
mouse and keyboard won t work

712558
prng	random
in security-sensitive applications such as encryption a pseudorandom number generator prng may produce values which although random in appearance are in fact predictable by an attacker

712568
debian	linux
i have did apt-get update in my server - linux debian and after that i rebooted the server but now can t access it via ssh

713150
wan	lan
looking at your router s spec it is clear that there is one physical wan port rj45 and 4 lan ports rj45 and of course wifi

713181
disk	ram
also note that any issues might even be related to disk failure or available corrupted ram memory--managing a virtual disk requires keeping various data about the disk in ram for quick access quick here means not having to wait for 10-15 seconds while the vm searches the virtual disk for even a single-byte sized file.. and most issues i ve seen with vm s are related to those data structures getting corrupted in ram and then the corrupted data written back out to the disk file

this doesn t happen when i connect to a ubuntu debian server for instance

715150
tunnel	vpn
after that line you just need to create a vpn connection to localhost so redirection to your remote vpn server is done through the cyphered ssh tunnel using port 22tcp not 1723 so it will not be blocked we suppose

715150
udp	tcp
the issue lies deeply at the pptp protocol now a bit obsolete and insecure mainly because gre type not tcp nor udp packages need to pass through the connection and due too to the problem that nearly every vpn pptp client and even every server uses 1723tcp port to establish connections with no possibility to change this port i have tested a few of these programs

715150
tunnel	vpn
- edit2 upon scott s request here are the steps for ssh tunnel as a replacement for vpn pptp

715150

715563
switching	screens
but don t switching to the alternate screens buffer don t have a fully-fledged full screens user interface and operate in terms of scrolling.

715590
udp	mtu
however latency sensitive applications usually use udp and custom packet sizes so they would not use jumbo frames as long as they don t do mtu discovery so they should not be affected by jumbo frames as the frames would be just shorter

715592
bash	zsh
also note that the following could be wrong in many subtle ways since i m not very knowledgable about getting the best performance possible out of bash well zsh strictly speaking since that s my login shell

715592
ubuntu	linux
on my ubuntu 13.10 linux 3.12.0-997-generic system this gives me

post	put
you can also upload the dmp file to skydrive or another file sharing service and put a link to it in your next post

716097
subnet	packets
as nics on the hardware level traditionally send and receive ethernet frames and not ip packets i don t think this is necessarily a hardware function of the nic - though modern nics have tcp offload engines toes that perform much of the processing required by tcp on the nic itself - those probably filter by subnet in hardware too

716123
opera	firefox
firefox chromium and opera solutions accepted

716127
udp	tcp
you would also need a way to indicate to the receiver of a packet which protocol udp tcp it is meant for

716127
arp	udp
i once worked a real-time system that used only broadcast udp packets for all inter host communications for the sole reason that it avoided having those arp sequences kick in and unpredictably add delay and jitter

716127
arp	udp
i also once worked on a resource-limited embedded system that worked by sending udp payloads inside ip packets directly no ip header because it saved all the complexity and memory needed to implement all the arp and netmask and extra checksums stuff

you can make a usb flash drive bootable to linux my favorite for doing this is unetbootin using ubuntu which can run even without changing your drives and may offer additional diagnostics that windows does not if it fails to install the os

717020
versioning	upgrade
one ambiguous statement on the microsoft support matrix is the statement releases known as components follow the support lifecycle of their parent major product. some people note that a versioning of ie 8 was introduced as part of windows 7 and optionally upgrade in xp - and thus one could claim that ie 8 should be supported as long as windows 7 is supported

717064

717429
rss	feed
their rss feed is their itunes link listing is ign-mpt uo 3d4

717429

folder	directory
2nd - yes when doing a custom install or regular install windows would create a windows old not in this windows old it would have all you saved settings and directory in tact so you can go to them later and retrieve what you want and delete say windows.old folder after you copied everything to the new directory

717898
folder	directory
i would create my c os drive nice and clean and organize delete any excess folder and clean up directory with ccleaner and auslogic apps that all applications and settings are set with no login password just easier with password is issue if you forget but make an image when the settings and everything is set and ready could be 30-70gb but all linked properly to your d data drive

718032
wan	lan
a typical wireless router usually prevents machines from the outside wan to see the machines connected to the inside lan

718032
wan	lan
moreover it probably uses nat network address translation which prevents machine from the wan to directly address the ones on the lan

718064
ethernet	wireless
if the ethernet and wireless were on separate network segments the dhcp requests would have failed so i don t think that s the issue but other than that i don t understand how the router would be treating the ethernet and wireless differently

718153
vpn	lan
so that the basic idea is to oblige your lan to allow replies from the ubuntu server outside the vpn

718220
hash	md5
i was wondering as it is theoretically possible to have duplicate md5 hash are there any known examples of this or is it all just theoretical

718225

x86	64bit
it occurs to me that there may be some low-end x86 cpus intended for mobile applications that aren t 64bit

719110
128bit	64bit
when 128bit machines become the standard one can ask the same thing for 64bit software

719122
x86	64bit
since 64bit x86 cpu s can run 32-bit code and since windows 64bit versions will run legacy 32-bit based programs there s not much need to worry if you are running relatively modern programs

this translates in binary as 0000 0000 0000 0000 1111 1111 0000 0001 0000 0001 you are probably starting to see why we use hex now

719466
hex	binary	put	get
this is easy because since 16 2 4 you can convert one hex digit as 4 binary digits and just put the result together to get the actual binary string

719474
hex	binary
hex seems to be a pretty good compromise between binary and decimal

719474
128bit	64bit
of course when we talk about 64bit 128bit and larger quantities or things like hashes it s not easy to communicate in hex decimal or anything really

719474
hex	binary
i guess hex is used out of habit or tradition here and has also come to be a signal that something is a raw binary value and not really any type.

719488

san	fileserver
again generally speaking if someone is talking about a san they are referring to a drive or group of drives that are available at the block level through iscsi fc or fcoe while someone speaking of a nas will be speaking of a fileserver such as a linux box that is running nfs and samba with the file system written by the hosting device

a vpn router running openwrt which is connected via lan cable with internet router

720261

720802
ethernet	wireless
i tried to connect my notebook directly to the network via ethernet cable opposite to the wireless router that we use every day

720812
disk	ram
so with that in mind given that mavericks and ssd based mac s usually come with a lot of ram i used to look for disk thrashing conditions because you cannot see them or hear them if they are ssd s a la the activity monitor because such conditions are like race disk swapping conditions and i m sure such an event could feasibly destroy an ssd in no time at all if an os were to let that occur but given that the load leveling is smart load leveling performed by the ssd itself i stopped being concerned as much with examining maverick s notion of thrashing which actually has become harder to deduce given the current dummied down activity monitor in mavericks

720832
wan	lan
make sure to connect it via one of the lan ports not the wan port

720894
google-chrome	firefox
the page works fine for me in firefox and google-chrome

720895
wan	lan
obviously connecting the lan side of the main switch to the wan socket of the wireless router doesn t do anything because this means that i won t be able to access anything that isn t connected to the wireless router

720895
wan	lan
asus rt-n66u connected to a switch s lan port via the asus router s wan slot

720904

721042
mouse	keyboard
i booted up my laptop and hooked it up to the monitors i was using and then plugged in the mouse and wireless keyboard as if the system was set up like the desktop

721042

for addition and subtraction many isas arm power x86 provide a carry borrow for subtraction bit and special add with carry and subtract with borrow instructions

721512
subtract	add
some isas alpha which was always 64-bit mips do not provide a carry bit and special add subtract instructions

721512
x86	mips
for an isa mips x86 that provides both a high and a low result from a single multiply the operation is reasonably straightforward

721512
multiplying	multiplication
for an isa alpha that provides separate multiplying for high result and multiple for low result instructions multiplication naturally produces a doubled precision value this operation is somewhat similar

721512
multiplying	add
isas with multiplying add instructions can obviously merge the additions and two of the multiplies into multiply-adds.

721512
x86	64bit
to extend the life of 32-bit isas some isas arm x86 added physical address extensions which use a 64bit page table entry to allow a larger physical address

723349
for-loop	arrays
your wildcards are not expanding because you add them into the arrays with quotes and then you quote the arrays expansion in the for-loop so the wildcards are not expanded then either

the other day i did one partition more from windows 8 bootcamp and since then i can t see the timemachine one from osx i can see it from windows though

724025

ubuntu	linux
just install netbeans for linux either from ubuntu s package manager it is located in the universe category or from netbeans.org

724416
disk	ram
some installers put key files in a ram disk and load the installation information from a network

724432
disk	ram
in this case the installer from the livecd either extract directly the squashfs filesystem to the hard drive after partitionning it then do some adjustments or copy the currently mounted root filesystem which is a virtual filesystem consisting of the squashfs archive and a ram disk storing temporary modification when running the livecd

724432
disk	ram
here the installer which is generally loaded in ram in an init ram disk will extract packages located on the installation medium to the target filesystem and executes some post-install script

width	height
set svg width and height should be set to original size scale of background

725126

725322
ubuntu	linux
i m getting pretty upset and worried about the fact that my desktop is now definitely not booting into windows 7 which it was very nicely before i was an idiot and used boot-repair the linux tool in an attempt to get ubuntu working. so here s what s happening

ubuntu	linux
i am not sure if this question goes here but i was wondering about the relationship between linux and ubuntu

725440
ubuntu	linux
i read on-line that ubuntu is a flavor or variation of linux but then one of my classmates said they are the same thing

725440
ubuntu	linux
if i am asked what platform am i using do i say linux or ubuntu

725441
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu is a kind of linux the exact word is a distribution

725441
ubuntu	linux
so saying that you use linux or that you use ubuntu both would be true

725442
debian	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	linux
ubuntu is a computer operating system based on the debian linux distribution and distributed as free and open source software using its own desktop environment

725443
ubuntu	linux
ubuntu is full featured o.s using linux as its kernel

725462
ubuntu	linux
at the risk of confusing you more if you want to be completely precise you could say that you re using the ubuntu distribution of gnu linux

725466
ubuntu	linux
the relationship between linux and ubuntu

725466
ubuntu	linux
linux distributions like ubuntu wrap these programs up in packages which you can install or uninstall as you like or need

725472

wan	lan
we moved offices and setup the lan wan infrastructure at the new place

725576
tunnel	packets
it gives you a shell on the remote machine as telnet does but all the data is sent through a secure tunnel so if anyone is sniffing packets all the data will be encrypted

725576
vpn	lan
as a matter of fact if you just need to do copying and restarting why not just use some cmd.exe commands like copy xcopy shutdown if its on your lan or you have other route to it like through vpn instead of psexec

725628
vmware	virtualbox
i am used to virtualbox and vmware now i d like to use xen but...i find two different websites hypervisor and server

725636
jobs	cron
the usual answer to this type of question is that cron jobs are run in non-interactive non-login shells so most of your shell startup files both the systemwide ones in etc and your personal dotfiles in your home directory are not sourced read in and executed because most shell startup files apply to login shells the first shell you see when you log into the computer or interactive shells shells that are connected to terminals ssh sessions or terminal emulators because a user is interacting with them via said terminal

725636
jobs	cron
the cron file format does allow you to specify environment variables for your jobs so you might want to specify bash_env or env to point it at a shell startup script to source

725642
subtract	add
it add s subtract the times as required but adds back the latest time thus ignoring it when there is an odd number of times inserted

725660
folder	directory
download the vsix package and unzip into it s own directory in your to your ssms extensions folder - most likely

725684
ubuntu	linux
408608768 279976563 6 gpt part - ubuntu apple_boot linux filesystem data

725684
debian	linux
perhaps its possible that debian used apple-style partition type markers in the gpt but then on the inside used them as linux filesystem and swap partitions

725688
put	get
if there is no solution i will try to get a legitimate windows 7 copy as my laptop originally came with that and put that in hyper-v microsofts visualisation platform installed with windows 8

725703
mouse	keyboard
is it a standard keyboard mouse or a super-fancy style

725703
mouse	keyboard
barring that borrow a cheap 20 keyboard mouse combo and try with those

725703
mouse	keyboard
again just the keyboard mouse and monitor should be hooked up at this point

725706
tunnel	vpn
how do you create a split tunnel on juniper vpn what ips do you block

725744
put	get
they are totally different to ssd cards which are lightning fast - if you can get one of those then yes its a good idea to put swap on it

chown	sudo
sudo chown -r username etc init will change the owner of everything in init to

725867
ubuntu	linux
even many linux distributions do not come with compilers built in i often end up installing build-essential for ubuntu when i need to compile packages for example so expecting windows to have one built in is not correct

725885
tunnel	vpn
vpn connections are point-to-point connections in encrypted tunnel

726029
debian	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	linux
the problem also existed in debian ubuntu arch linux run on this pc

726034
disk	ram
in linux this is accomplished using an initial ram disk which lives on a non-raid partition typically boot mounted on dev sda1

726034
ramdisk	lvm
this initial ramdisk contains enough utilities to activate the raids and lvs and switch over to the lvm raid main root filesystem

726045
installation	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
i am writing a little program that packages configuration files as rpm and it puts a series of triggers to handle installation upgrade of the packages that bring a copy versioning of the same file

what i have in mind is to install 128 gb ssd for system + 1 tb for example 2.5 hdd into my desktop work on it at home and when i need to move the system to the notebook - i just take ssd + hdd from the desktop and install them into the notebook and when i get back - put them back into the desktop

726098
udp	tcp
as others have mentioned udp and tcp are fundamentally different protocols

726098
udp	tcp
however if you must transport data over udp instead of tcp you can use a relay tool such as socat

726098
udp	tcp
you can configure socat to listen for a tcp connection and forward the contents of the tcp stream as a udp stream to another host

726098
udp	tcp
if your application is built to use tcp instead of udp it may not be tolerant of dropped packets in which case this hack may cause unstable behavior

726132
gentoo	linux
after updating to the latest version of chrome 33 on my gentoo linux box certain sites such as github have started rendering with ugly pixelated non-antialiased fonts

daemon	cron
as one of the steps for installing cron daemon for cygwin in windows it is worthful not mandatory on winxp but seems to be greatly adviced since win7 to change along with some others modifications the run as property of the just installed cron service

726318
stdout	stderr
annoyingly ffprobe dumps everything to stderr so you need to redirect it to stdout

726324
range	max
when making your color range selection you can drag the fuzziness to max or where you think is appropriate

726334
traceroute	packets
the traceroute software note that traceroute is not a protocol is based on the fact that at every l3 hop the router decrements by 1 the ttl time to live of an ip packets and when a packets has ttl equal to 0 a icmp time exceeded packets is sent to the source ip address your traceroute software

mouse	keyboard
os 2 version 1.0 in 1987 for example had a session manager from which one could start up to 15 sessions separate virtualized combinations of display output and keyboard mouse input

726532
switching	screens
dr-dos 6 had taskmax where one used control + esc to get to the task manager and ctrl + 1 ctrl + 2 and so forth to switching directly to the screens of individual tasks which could be swapped to and from disc or extended expanded memory subject to some constraints

726532
switching	screens
switching from one to another was trivial alt-f1 pulled up the editor screens alt-f2 brought forth the calculator and alt-f3 showed me the printer preview

726532
switching	screens
each screens switching takes just a fraction of a second

726537

726721
move	drag
whence an effective workaround in the affected window select all the tabs minus at least one see select and move multiple tabs to a new window in chrome and drag them out thus creating a new window or into another existing window all the tabs at once recover their temporary partial status bar for unknown reason dragging all the tabs in a window doesn t work

726735
freebsd	debian
debian kfreebsd is of course based upon freebsd

726735
freebsd	linux
if your system truly behaves like this with both linux and windows then it probably doesn t hit this fault with pc-bsd and freebsd only by accident

726736

a textmate project assuming it works pretty similar to a sublimetext project is a file somewhere on you computer this file has a bunch of metadata about your project for instance which folders to keep in the project drawer you may also have other project-specific settings like theme indentation settings etc.

727172
textmate	sublimetext
as with the default expanding collapsing of folders within your project and default opening of files - i m not quite sure about how textmate handles it for projects i m used to sublimetext these days

727172

tunnel	vpn
when ppp started being used for dsl authentication pppoe pppoa and vpn authentication pptp and l2tp-over-ipsec are both ppp inside an encrypted tunnel it was natural to continue to use the same radius servers for centralized authentication for all your enterprise s remote access servers

727240
l2tp	pppoe
you could of course have your dial-in modem ppp server or your vpn server or your pppoe pppoa really l2tp ppp server or whatever implement eap locally but by now radius was so widely deployed that it was mostly radius servers that implemented it

tunnel	vpn
i suspect that the remote vpn endpoint might be doing nat and is thus providing you an apparent external address of 208.23.71.92 when using the tunnel

727412

you could always encrypt the entire linux drive that is an option when you install recent versions of ubuntu at least that way windows have no way to get to it unless you choose to open it with a passphrase

728045
cpu	processors
my processors is intel core i5-3330 cpu 3.00ghz 3.2ghz and the computer is relatively new

728048

so i started experimenting by creating a standard not dynamic 5mb file container and another one 10mb both are ntfs filesystems aes encryption algorithm and ripemd-160 hash

728048
filesystems	ntfs
i know that ntfs filesystems uses some space for mapping but 2.97mb out of 5mb seems like alot compared to normal ntfs and inefficient

728063
readonly	temporary
the workaround has been to put the box temporary in read-write mode change the password reboot into readonly

728096
cpu	affinity
some of these can be remedied freeing memory limiting the memory-offender picking cpu affinity manually... some are solved simply by keeping your drivers up to date graphics drivers used to be quite notable for the issues they caused which probably played a part in windows dumping them back from kernel-mode to user-mode in recent versions

728108
vpn	lan
if you use a vpn then you can use any file transfer method you like for example nfs mount or windows share so long as unencrypted tranferring is allowed in the lan segments

yes if you have tons of ram and most things you do involve reading data from the hard disk as opposed to writing you will not experience very much speed-up from an ssd after you are booted and all programs loaded in ram

728707
filesystems	ntfs
ntfs the filesystems on windows has an automatic mechanism that forces out all dirty buffers which are pieces of files that haven t finished writing to the actual hard drive about every 5 to 10 seconds it may even be configurable in the registry

728707
disk	ram
so no matter how much ram you have these situations are going to stress the disk subsystem

728707
disk	ram
outside of the above scenarios that is not an exhaustive list of scenarios but you get the idea a system with a large amount of ram is not going to suffer significantly from performance problems even if it has a traditional spinning hard disk drive

728708

i want to show my external usb hard disk as a sata hard disk in a virtual machine but neither virtualbox nor vmware give me that option

729001
vmware	virtualbox
from what i understand vmware would also do what virtualbox does

729010
filesystems	hfs
i also read somewhere that you might need to try hfsplus instead of hfs as the filesystems

729013
folder	directory
the sharepoint webdav folder in which i was trying to create the directory was itself linked to an attachments folder in sharepoint

729013
folder	directory
anyway the reason it worked in windows explorer was that when creating a new directory there windows explorer first creates a folder called new folder and then renames it when you name it

729015
mouse	keyboard
the wired mouse and keyboard won t light up

729017
put	get
well now i need to get my internet explorer passwords from the old drive so i removed the ssd drive pulled the old drive from the usb caddy and put it where it came from from dell

729044
ssd	sata
i ve got a machine running windows 8.1 off a boot ssd with the sata spinning media attached via an adaptec 6405e controller

729061
cpu	affinity
i have checked the affinity of all my processes and all of them are set to all cpus yet i check my cpu usage and my 2nd cpu it s called #1 because my first cpu is #0 is jumping around 90 and it s stuck there until i close basically everything that uses the cpu

729062
bluetooth	usb
i have a cheap mono bt waterproof speaker and got a cheap bluetooth usb dongle off ebay for my windows 7 ultimate pc

729096
filesystems	ntfs
dd overwrites whole filesystems so the formattin to fat32 or ntfs before running dd makes no sense

729126
installation	upgrade
an in-place upgrade is also named a repair installation

729180
asterisk	pbx
we also have an asterisk pbx

729182
mouse	keyboard
for example i have a ubuntu server installed and everytime i had to control + cmd to get the mouse back even though i only use the keyboard in the vm

729200
redhat	fedora
even though this is no longer mentioned in the current rhel fedora documentation it s noted in older documents from redhat redhat and seems to still work in f20

729259
wan	lan
to speed up the admittedly slow answer above and assuming the node you seek is on the lan or a fast wan add a timeout to the ping 20 milliseconds here

729284
cpu	processors
more cpu cores means the processors can do more things simultaneously

729297
portrait	landscape
i have used section breaks to make some pages in my document portrait and others landscape

729297
portrait	landscape
this works great but the only problem is that the footer and header for that matter are setup for portrait pages so on the landscape pages it doesn t look right

729297
portrait	landscape
is there a way to compensate so that the footer is different on landscape pages and portrait pages

729312
google-chrome	firefox
i tend to take two browser windows google-chrome firefox etc and set them side-by-side

729326
folder	directory
now it created tmp folder in my root directory root tmp

729347
factors	mean
assuming a power factors of 0.8 this would mean you could be using about 1760va va watts power factors

729351
png	tga
you can use lots of still image formats png jpeg tga whatever see ffmpeg -formats for a full list

729353
mouse	keyboard
of course it would be encrypted but the main question is how do i know it its a mouse click packet keyboard press packet or another one

729396
folder	directory
just create a .vim directory in your home folder

729399
rar	zip
all you need for this is the free 7-zip program which can also deal with every kind of archive you ve heard of including iso rar zip etc

729423
daemons	systemd	daemons	launchd
with sudo launchctl talks to the systemd instance of launchd which manages systemd daemons

729426
virtualbox	bootcamp
as far as dual booting goes i m not familiar with using bootcamp but would virtualbox or some other virtualization solution do the trick

729439
ati	nvidia
for whatever reason ati and nvidia have been slow to provide efi support for their proprietary linux drivers

729444
ubuntu	linux
scan the boot#### entries for the one that boots efi microsoft boot bootmgfw.efi and another that boots linux probably efi ubuntu grubx64.efi or efi ubuntu shimx64.efi in your case

729448
doc	rtf
to select the file type for the saved file docx doc rtf

729489
bmp	png
it occurs for all image types png and bmp included whenever the user right clicks a thumbnail and chooses set as background

729511
tablet	galaxy
my tablet samsung galaxy tab 3 would see the router allow me to enter the password not saying that here but would keep asking for the password over and over again and would never connect

729541
folder	directory
while performing a similar recovery i found that ontrack s easyrecovery would correctly display the root directory folder and files but would only display a small number of other files within those subfolders

729541
filesystems	ntfs
using windows 7 i ran partition wizard chose the partition wizard selected the damaged ntfs partition the one that shows as unformatted and raw in diskmgmt then chose the check filesystems operation

729583
vmware	virtualbox
if it has windows os then either oracle virtualbox or vmware workstation 10

729583
vmware	virtualbox
local visualization products such as virtualbox or vmware workstation avoid this kind of pain

729595
wan	lan
check mac addresses for wan lan and wlan

729670
peer	p2p
i ve not much experience with bitcoins however enough to say it is a peer to peer p2p based system where your and most other user s having the bitcoin client running computers are used for solving the transactions

729678
chown	chmod	chown	sudoers	chmod	sudoers
i changed chown and chmod and added permission at the end of the sudoers

729681
centos	linux
i have a linux server centos an some windows clients with shared folders

729688
ssd	sata
if i read it right the ssd is still sata 1 and i dont think that that ssd is the right choice

729688
ssd	sata
you would be better of buying an sata 3 ssd

729714
versioning	upgrade
our machine vendor will not perform an upgrade to a newer versioning of windows

729715
put	get
i have no idea what the 2nd is but the first allows backup services to request sql server to put the sql database in to a state that will give a clean backup no half written transactions and whatnot so the backup software can get a copy of the database files

729718
mouse	keyboard
the keyboard and mouse also stopped working

729721
mouse	keyboard
when trying to install win7 however windows ignored my usb mouse and keyboard

729721
mouse	keyboard
i also tried a ps 2 keyboard and another mouse and keyboard in different ports none of which worked either

729756
pop-up	dialog
in the new dialog that pop-up click on the + button which brings up a metro-style folder chooser

729784
post	get
and if you remove the hard drive that would eliminate any ubuntu problems and you d at least see if your laptop still works and can get to post bios

729784
post	get
if the laptop were completely cold and then you turn it on i d imagine you could at least see a post and maybe get into the bios before it overheated.

729787
google-chrome	firefox
maybe not google-chrome but i read somewhere that it s possible with firefox and extensions someone said that in a comment

729798
google-chrome	firefox
is there any way to change the behaviour of address bars in windows especially in web browsers such as google-chrome and firefox such that a single click will place the cursor and a double click will select everything

729803
google-chrome	firefox
you could also use the keyboard shortcut ctrl + l works in firefox google-chrome and in the address bar of windows to achieve this

729831
ubuntu	linux
if the ram seems good and the hd seems good maybe try a virus scan with something like clamav in ubuntu or there are some stand-alone antivirus rescue cd s to try i think they re like a linux live cd

729869
debian	linux
sensors from lm-sensors debian package if you run linux if someone knows about a better software please report

729876
udp	tcp
i have allowed port 21 tcp and udp through the host s firewall and have added filezilla server to the list of programs allowed to communicate

729898
ssd	sata
so any 2.5-inch sata ssd will do

729922
disk	ram
therefore it may not be the problem of your hard disk drive but there could be other errors software bug ram error and many other reasons

729948
lan	intranet
in the example above we created an exception on the local intranet lan but you can do the same thing for remote servers if you feel daring

729957

to move the video image drag it to a new location

729968
postgresql	mysql

i use thunderbird with imap and currently try out mutt

730010
mutt	thunderbird
when i read messages in mutt they are not marked as read in thunderbird

730011
filesystems	btrfs
no you need a filesystems that actively detects and or prevents silent data corruption such as zfs or btrfs

730013
mutt	thunderbird
with mutt i would do the same thing moving emails out of the imap inbox into a local yearly archive file just like i have with thunderbird now

730021
mp3	wav
bearing in mind the fact that when converting audio file to mp3 file a quite amaount of loss takes place then after converting mp3 to wav what kind of information is added on ä t and ä t becomes 80 and 700mb

730023
mp3	wav
a wav file is uncompressed and is a much larger file size than the compressed audio files like mp3

730023
mp3	wav
it is good to note that converting a mp3 to wav does not increase the audio quality of the file as it will only ever be as good as the original source

730024
switching	screens
it is good when i press fn + key to switching screens and second screens only and laptop screens is shutting down which is what i want to have after loading computer automatic

730027
mp3	wav
but converting mp3 back to wav does not add any information it just encodes it uncompressed

730035
ubuntu	linux
for example i have used autohotkey in windows for just this purpose and at the ubuntu forums there is a discussion about linux alternatives

730041
ethernet	wireless
note i understand that i can set the secondary router up as a wireless ethernet bridge with all devices on the same subnet but i d like to get this working with the separate subnets if possible -- i don t want to rely on the wireless connectivity for hard-wired devices to even get an ip address

730043
mouse	keyboard
the mouse will hitch keyboard input will be super slow as if it s throttled

730086
minimum	max
finding the max and minimum slope + - some value i will be able to discover the area of the slope that corresponds to the membrane edge i am interested in

730090
range	min	range	max	min	max
basically you use max or min to get the max or min values of the range then index to find the cell matching that value and cell address to output this as text

730163
afp	smb
my experience highly subjective is that afp seems faster than smb especially since mountain lion mavericks

730209
dpkg	apt
i would like to go through a linux system and find out what packages have been installed whether it was with a .deb file or through the apt or dpkg interface

730240
debian	linux
i guess clonezilla is basing on debian linux that command is used too like

730247
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and firefox both say they cannot find them

730266
copying	overwrite
however if my usb already had an outdated version of a.txt and i want to put the new version on it by copying the new one from my computer and pasting it onto my usb it overwrite the a.txt file

730272
folder	dir
the command dir until i found the two folder that were created in

730275

after moving everything back i get the following error email from various cron jobs

730375
folder	directory
after this i try to create a public_html folder on the user directory and allow php to access that folder

730459
udp	tcp
the ip suite has two main transport layers tcp and udp

730459
udp	tcp
there are semi-equivalent concepts that an application can implement on top of udp which is an alternative to tcp with less overhead but less features

730463
traceroute	packets
the man page for traceroute says traceroute tracks the route packets taken from an ip network on their way to a given host. but while doing research on the topic i was not able to find any statistical data scientific work on how precise traceroute actually is as whether the route displayed is the route actually taken maybe the different packets use completely different routes and what the error margin is and whether it would be possible due to different routing protocols a traceroute ping might display a complete different path than a subsequent tcp request or even the actual ping packets would take

730475
icmp	udp
not all routers will listen for icmp or udp pings

730475
traceroute	packets
even if you successfully map a route and all intermediate nodes reply to your pings and don t attempt to play with your mapping attempt the route may change for the next packets you send using some real protocol or even if you attempt a traceroute a second time

730475
icmp	udp
there is nothing stopping the routers from doing this i m not sure why they would choose to but it s a possibility for packets detected as traceroutes icmp or udp pings

730475
traceroute	lan
you should not rely on information received from a traceroute for anything important except to diagnose a connectivity issue on a network where you already have deep knowledge of the topology on a complicated corporate lan for instance and can control the behavior of the participating nodes

730477
geany	gedit
gedit as well as geany are having virtual line wrapping which helps you reading a long line but not neccesarly wrting this to a file

730491
google-chrome	firefox
for the record i have tried explorer firefox and google-chrome

730523
range	min
if you really need to do this i d add a column for min based on the range

730547
macbook	bootcamp
also it should be noted i am running windows 8.1 on a macbook air using bootcamp

730559
stdout	stderr
for example it looks like you have two separate logs directories so you have two separate sets of launchd stdout stderr files

730563
mouse	keyboard
i recently bought aten technologies cs692 2-port usb hd video audio kvm switch and installed it to my pc and mac combination however i were using a mouse keyboard combo and the kvm switch had separate mouse and keyboard usb port so only keyboard was working.

730563
mouse	keyboard
i plugged it in and it started working however the mouse is not detected by my computer as the mouse it is razer deathadder 3500 but as a generic mouse so i figured the kvm switch was taking the mouse and keyboard input and rehandling it to the computer acting as a keyboard mouse combo so the mouse driver couldn t be used but i need it to work

730563
mouse	keyboard
so what i am looking for is a kvm switch that doesn t emulate to be a mouse keyboard but just forwards the usb device to the computer that it s used on is there any of those in the market or am i stuck with a switch that simulated mouse keyboard

730564
mouse	keyboard
to cover bases make sure that you have drivers installed for the mouse and the keyboard if that applies

730585
cvs	svn
in cvs and svn you checkout and you get a copy and the association is automatically made with the repository you got the file from

730603
google-chrome	firefox
you can also accomplish this locally using the correct extensions in firefox or google-chrome

730603
google-chrome	firefox
if use both google-chrome and firefox keep one browser always configured for plain text

730606
debian	linux
i then thought that i could use easybcd to simultaneously install neogrub with debian linux and use the windows boot loader to select what os i want

730606
debian	linux
i was successful in editing the boot load menu to make it include debian linux as an option as well as the lenovo system recovery partition but only the windows 8.1 os would boot without error only the menu was edited

730637
mouse	trackpad
a trackpad like apple magic trackpad and setup mouse gestures app

730647
nas	qnap
i m trying to remove all the hidden mac spam files off my old nas box qnap ts209

730665
filesystems	ntfs
for filesystems i recommend ntfs unless you re planning on using the hdd on both mac and windows then choose exfat

730701
pop-up	dialog
if that is how it entered your computer please carefully check all the dialog boxes that pop-up during the program install to make sure that you do not install it again by accident

730708
tunnel	lan
my current configuration has the wireless and lan bridged and i run my ipv6 router using a tunnel from a system on the lan

730711
wan	lan
you need to purchase a router than offers both wireless wifi wan lan simultaneously

730756
wan	lan
a private network can also be in multiple buildings with a wan or a lan that extends to a nearby building

730774
robocopy	xcopy
or a command line utility like copy xcopy robocopy to upload and share files using google drive

730786
udp	tcp
if map is used no nat at the isp level ipv4 addresses are shared and a user gets a number of udp and tcp ports the user can use the given ports for nat and inbound services

730789
mouse	keyboard
i have a logitech mk710 wireless keyboard + mouse combo

730789
mouse	keyboard
i have the unifying receiver connected to an usb 2.0 socket in the rear part of my desktop computer under the table and very close to the mouse and the keyboard

730789
mouse	keyboard
both keyboard and mouse batteries are the provided ones energizer not-rechargeable

730790
google-chrome	firefox
in either google-chrome or firefox you can refresh the redirect by typing view-source redirect.yoursite.com and hitting enter

730790
google-chrome	firefox
now that should force google-chrome or firefox to refresh the redirect

730791
versioning	upgrade
i have downgraded my skype from versioning 6.14 to 5.8 but windows keeps trying to run the upgrade back to 6.11 a versioning that doest even work...

730797
stdout	stderr
instead of creating stdout and stderr file to output these to the calling terminals stdout and stderr

730797
stdout	stderr
-k oe maintain stdout and stderr

730808
subnet	packets
if yes thereâ s network traffic and you can use a network monitoring tool to sniff out the packets sent by the device aswell as the subnet itâ s broadcasting in

730822
put	get
the packets would never go out on the wire and probably won t even get an ethernet frame put around them

730833
opensuse	linux
i am running opensuse linux 13.1 it has knetworkmanager to control the network

730858
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari

assuming you can use sudo or su either rm as root or use chown to change it to your username or group

731005
postfix	dovecot
i set up postfix + dovecot and know that i want to have mailing lists i decided to install mailman

731021
versioning	upgrade	ubuntu	debian
sometimes this is part of an upgrade from one versioning of debian ubuntu to the next but just as often it is for when you are following testing unstable and the packaging changes

731024
disk	ram
this means that most resources can be loaded as quickly as the disk or ram can respond potentially less than 1 ms if the resource is in ram

731048
xen	openvz
2 with no physical access at all look into virtualization options ie depending on redhat version and your familiarity install kvm xen openvz or docker on your redhat hosts and create debian virtual machines for your purposes

731055
filesystems	ntfs
as a next generation filesystems refs still cannot be booted from and lacks some features of ntfs such as efs and hardlinks just to name two

731055
filesystems	ntfs
ntfs is a pretty old filesystems developed when a 2gb hard drive was a big deal

731059
mouse	keyboard
1 3 days ago my computer freezed while i was playing a game . screen freezed couldn t move mouse and couldn t type anything with keyboard and extremely disturbing sound came from the headphone which is connected to the creative x-fi titanium soundcard i pressed the reset button and restarted my computer

731065
mouse	keyboard
it happens with all devices like my mouse keyboard mobile phone or headset

731114
folder	directory
if you browse your program files directory to try to find outlook.exe you will find it within a folder named office##

731152
mouse	keyboard
what you can do however is use an application like synergy to seamlessly control both computers with one keyboard and mouse

731158
ubuntu	linux
i first open up a terminal and using ssh to login to a remote machine running ubuntu linux 13.04

731174

in my case it s a lenovo thinkserver rd430 with linux mint debian and it seemed anything i d do about update-grub or changing any hard drives in the server would cause it to not boot

731217

731309
hide	show
the icon that is hidden from the default of hide icon and notifications to only show notifications

731367
traceroute	lan
the weirder thing is that traceroute s to this ip are much slower than to other systems on the lan although i heard that the os i m using ubuntu 13.10 doesn t maintain a local dns cache so it might be doing a reverse dns lookup every time i run traceroute on the affected ip

731375
tunnel	vpn
this is handy because i can tunnel traffic through the vpn to one of my linux boxes and route all of my traffic through my home network handy if the network my remote is on blocks certain websites

731443
ethernet	wireless
i have ethernet in both wireless locations so want to plug the extender into ethernet and give it ip address of 10.0.0.7 to extend the wireless network

731468
bluetooth	usb
that works fine however the motionjoy driver package also contains drivers for internal and usb bluetooth dongles and windows randomly decided to use the motionjoy drivers for my mouse and keyboards usb receiver

731468
mouse	keyboard
let me restate this is only applicable if your usb mouse or keyboard is not working and you have the motionjoy drivers installed on your system

731472
gentoo	linux
this issue affects clients running xp 7 8 and gentoo linux

when freshly formatted as fat then move your boot.elf and private directory into the single folder that will appear

731557

for some reason i decided it would be a good idea to apt-get remove cmake from my ubuntu 12.04 distro and then put it back but when i do sudo apt-get install cmake i get the following error

731606
ubuntu	linux
i think most people would suggest ubuntu as a free both as in freedom and free beer linux distribution for novice use

731606
ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	linux
also linux mint might be worth a look since in essence it s an ubuntu with a gui that might be more satisfying for a windows user

i have a debian mint based system where i plug in 16 usb devices

731751

i am also able to put these devices into a state where no current is being drawing and it is possible to get them up

731753
subnet	vlan
really dhcp has no concept of vlan there are dchp options that can hand out vlan information it s used in voip sometimes but generally speaking dhcp only cares about the subnet that the request comes from

google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari
i can say that most major browsers ie firefox google-chrome safari opera don t update their bookmarks themselves so it might break bookmarks for some users when you stop the 301 redirect

731828

i think firebug works only on the level of http but https is http encapsulated in ssl

731853
vmware	virtualbox
aside from the fact knife does not yet have a plugin for virtualbox though i envision one in the not too distant future there are already plugins for most enterprise virtualization products including vmware xenserver and just about every major cloud provider as well

732753
switching	screens
after restarting everything works fine until the next switching to full screens

732755
mouse	keyboard
this happens with newer keyboard where you have to install driver for both keyboard and mouse to work

732755
mouse	keyboard
if you are using a bluetooth keyboard please make sure it is supported at the bios level otherwise when you go away for extended period of time you will find your keyboard inoperable until the driver wakes up the bluetooth keyboard and bluetooth mouse

732763
installation	upgrade
i recently upgrade my jenkins installation from 1.476 to 1.554 using pkgng

732787
cpu	processors
in regards to finding out about cpu compatibility usually the motherboard manufacturer does present a list of compliant processors on it s website so it s always best to start there regardless of brand

732790
filesystems	ntfs
i d prefer ntfs since fat32 isn t really a filesystems

732804
subnet	packets
you are on the same subnet as 10.122.2.1 you simply find out its layer 2 address and send it the packets

732804
subnet	packets
you look up your routing table to find a router on your subnet that will get you closer to 10.122.2.1 find its layer 2 address and send him the packets

in opera and google-chrome when there is a typo placing caret on the incorrect word and pressing context-menu key on keyboard does not show suggestions and i have to right click by mouse

732926
mouse	keyboard
it seems that windows 8 or windows 8.1 auto-detect the unifying receiver and both keyboard and mouse but the default driver is not working properly

732934
vim	sublimetext	komodo	sublimetext
it is looking good except the fact that the font rendering seems to be the worst among all the editors at least on linux i used vim komodo sublimetext

732934
debian	linux
i am on debian 7 64b xfce linux 3.13-1

733013

in the dialog that pop-up go to the number formatting custom formatting and use

733016
debian	centos	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	centos
i found out it is corrected on ubuntu and debian but not on centos

733017
width	height
the scale filter in this example will change the width to 1280 and the height will be automatically calculated to preserve the aspect

733017
decoder	encoder
depending on your version input type such as png encoder libx264 specifically and encoding options ffmpeg may attempt to avoid or minimize chroma subsampling but most non-ffmpeg based players will be unable to properly decoder the output

733034
apache	nginx
you will have to look at your server platform iis apache nginx etc to determine what it is for your environment

733057
ssd	sata
i upgraded to a crucial m4 ct064m4ssd2 2.5 64gb sata iii mlc internal solid state drive ssd 2 years ago it made a noticeable improvement

733065
disk	ram
i ve got 16 gigs of ram and i have turned off the paging file so i don t have a bottleneck with the hard disk and don t need a ssd

733087
stdout	stderr
i notice that when using tcpdump to read a pcap file the tcpdump command somehow manages to print information to my console even when i redirect both stdout and stderr

733087
stdout	stderr
i ve searched the web for ways to suppress output not captured by stdout and stderr and found a few hits but none that i could understand or use in this context

733088
debian	linux
however when i run the exact same program on my debian linux desktop intel core i7 3.4 ghz 8gb ram running wheezy 64bits it takes up to three hours

733102
wan	lan
so configure its wan port to get its address via dhcp then configure it to be an ap then connect its wan port into your lan

733102
wan	lan
this should allow it to get an ip address lease from your existing dhcp server on your lan and it should bridge packets between its wlan lan and wan ports

733102
udp	tcp
napt pat gateway which messes with transport-layer tcp udp port numbers deserves to be called a gateway

733102
ethernet	wireless
in 802.11 wi-fi an access point ap is at the very least a box that bridges ethernet-like frames between wireless clients and a wired ethernet lan

733102
ethernet	wireless
a box that connects a single wired ethernet device wireless to an ap

733112
wan	lan
this is already confusing to somebody who s only used to twisted-pair as both the wan connection to the cable modem and the lan connection from the moca adaptor are apparently supposed to travel over the same coax cable but i guess that s the magic of rf.

733113
vmware	virtualbox
iâ m trying to migrate a vmware system to virtualbox but the migration isnâ t working iâ ve already spent hours trying the small handful of solutions people have suggest and eventually given up

733113
vmware	virtualbox
as a workaround i am trying to manually migrate by installing windows in virtualbox and copy the important files over then discard the vmware system

733115
bonjour	avahi
ietf zeroconf apple bonjour avahi etc.

733115
wan	lan
since wi-fi-capable home gateways with nat enabled count as routers mdns is not meant to cross from wan to w lan

733119
pop-up	dialog
i ve installed a secondary 750 gb wd scorpio drive in my thinkpad laptop and it was working fine for a while until recently when every time i wake from sleep there is a dialog box which pop-up to inform me that the internal drive did not eject properly

733135
wan	lan
wake on lan works perfectly but when i try wake on wan it doesn t work

733135
wan	lan
also my wol wan tool is wol wake on lan wan for android

733145
wan	lan
wake on lan works from lan but not wan

733156
tunnel	vpn
configure openvpn to install a 32 route to the ssh serverâ s network address through your local default gateway which will override the default route over the vpn tunnel

733185
tunnel	packets
many organisations now outsource services to the cloud and use various technologies to tunnel data packets across network boundaries over the public internet while making it all look like the server has a local ip address

733185
tunnel	packets
alternatively the server could be in your network but at another location such as a remote data centre or another office which would similarly require packets to tunnel across the public network internet

733199
mouse	keyboard
however i would much rather be able to control this function using a macro on my keyboard or mouse

733199
mouse	keyboard
i imagine i could launch a .bat script from my mouse or keyboard and would be more convenient

733203
versioning	upgrade
if you are using old finder plugins on osx 10.7 lion such as totalfinder fuse you will need to upgrade it to the latest versioning to work with osx 10.8 mountain lion

733216
mouse	keyboard
the window manager creates a message which tells the window that has now lost the focus mouse or keyboard focus about that fact by using events messages and then the application acts on that

733219
versioning	upgrade
the question is what have to be upgrade and which versioning is required i am not sure if a versioning i am gonna use is stable or not this is why iam asking this question

733230
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome will issue an ssl protocol error ie and firefox simply say the page can t be displayed

733236
versioning	upgrade
without a clear upgrade path as well as being two versioning behind the easiest way out is probably making backups of everything you need and installing debian 7.0 wheezy

733246
sudo	passwd
sudo passwd for mahmoud

733278
tablet	galaxy
we use tablet samsung galaxy tab 3 lite to be exact in our production facility to deliver configuration parameters to our employees

omit the - this actually redirects stderr to stdout

733299
disk	ram
has something gone wrong with vmware player or has something tragic happened to my system possibly the ram disk

733341
ubuntu	debian
debian and ubuntu can both set up full-disk encryption during the installers

733346
hash	salt
before this the passwords would not be salt making password hash much less complicated and easy to get

733346
hash	salt
two users that have the same password should not have the sam hash because of this salt

733346
hash	salt
salt works by adding characters in some part of the password making the password hash harder to brute force

733383
packets	multicast
i have a system with a virtual network interface eth0 1 and i want to send multicast packets that have a source ip of that interface

733383
packets	multicast
how do i get the correct source ip in my multicast packets

733383
packets	multicast
a directed udp packets sent to 192.168.123.123 5007 gets the correct source ip of 192.168.123.123 but a multicast packets to 224.1.1.1 5007 gets a source ip of 14.0.0.2

733388
ubuntu	debian
here is a howto to create a swap file for ubuntu - identical in debian

i don t know if these will play the srt subtitle though

733402
dpkg	aptitude
i have tried listing packages in both aptitude and dpkg with no luck

733416

if a screen saver is not running then the computer is considered to be in an idle state if there is 0 cpu usage and 0 disk input or output for 90 of the past fifteen minutes and if there is no keyboard or mouse input during this period of time

733417
debian	linux	debian	mint
system runs on the newest version of linux mint debian edition

733433
folder	directory
but i m wondering if i have to set it up in a different place because the www directory of the 6001 service is somewhere in my home folder not in var www but still works i have no clue how apache handles that or knows about the location or if hood.ie starts its own webservice

733461
mouse	keyboard
i.e. i didn t find the grab keyboard and mouse input on mouse click preferences in vmware player

733513
ssd	sata
connected my ssd to sata port 0 on the mortherboard

733525
kde	gnome
you can mount your files with webdav native support on gnome kde windows os x

733536
sudo	passwd
i have access to a linux server where i can sudo to foo like this without a passwd

733553
folder	directory
i believe this is because the command line execution has trouble traversing the folder structure of the target directory without running into permission rights as i don t have and cannot have rights to all of the higher level folder

733558
versioning	upgrade
you may search for the motherboard manual on google as well by it s part number to check the bios menu or even upgrade the bios firmware versioning

733559
debian	linux
i have set up my own local network using a small computer running debian linux wheezy which is acting as a wireless router

733580
google-chrome	firefox
browsers firefox google-chrome latest versions as of today

733592
mouse	keyboard
one is the mouse and the other one is the keyboard

733592
mouse	keyboard
but when you click the hot key the mouse acts like a keyboard

733592
mouse	keyboard
maybe that the button try to run a pop-up application and the mouse sends a keyboard 1-9 set for the gesture

733619
xfce	kde
i want to install krita on debian xfce but i am worried that installing krita will also install all the kde related stuff and will bog down my system

733619
xfce	gnome
how does does it work if i install krita on xfce or gnome

733628
ethernet	wireless
i have connected this device to my wireless router through an ethernet cable

733640
cpu	processors
most important every processors comes sized to fit a particular cpu socket as you ve chosen your motherboard already then you ll know what this is

733673
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and firefox have some extensions addons for unit conversion

733701

google-chrome	firefox
i m interested in solutions for chromium google-chrome and or firefox

733893

the folder is called silver and its inside the var directory

733893
folder	directory
ls -la doesn t show the folder but i can access the directory via cd silver

733941
ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	linux
but i tried to install linux such as ubuntu fedora mint and came across same problem every time

733945
chgrp	chmod
to secure this even more in case you only need a specific subset of users to be able to run this program you could put those users into a group chgrp your program into this group and chmod it to 0750

733947
move	drag
drag the screen and the cursor move

734003
mouse	keyboard
curiously i m using an apple usb keyboard which works just fine and plugged into one of the keyboards usb-ports i have a logitech mouse which is also behaving fine so this seems to be an issue with recognizing usb volumes first and foremost

734010
hex	binary
note i would take extreme care when editing binary files using a hex editor in they way that i have

734016
stdout	stderr
short first one redirects both stdout and stderr to bar second one redirects only stdout to bar and stderr to terminal

734049
debian	linux
that being said i eventually put a triple-boot environment on that laptop - windows xp windows 7 and debian linux

734075
jobs	cron
cron jobs can run either via cli or through the webserver - depending on how you set them up

734080
vmware	virtualbox
other programs that can be used as virtual machine are virtualbox or vmware fusion which are both free and i would recommend over the already suggested virtual pc xp-mode which is quite limited

734133
kde	gnome
it just sets use flags and other values so that when you install packages you get the kde qt variants and avoid gnome gtk+ somewhat

734156
folder	directory
i need to create a field in word 2007 that will display some text when the its file is not in the expected directory a folder called release

734165
google-chrome	firefox
this can be achieved by using adblock plus on firefox or google-chrome

734176
google-chrome	firefox
back than i could have open an instance of visual studio mssql management studio a couple of firefox tabs and a couple of google-chrome tabs

734176
google-chrome	firefox
i can have open the same number of programs an instance of visual studio mssql management studio a couple of firefox tabs and a couple of google-chrome tabs

734176
disk	ram
i have turned off paging because writing to the disk slows the overall performance and i think that amount of ram should be enough to live with

734178
pop-up	dialog
i have modified the recent suggesiton because in its original form when the document was not in the release folder but a document with the same name and fields existed in the release folder that document would try to include itself until word reached its field nesting limit around 19 20 levels and then pop-up an error dialog

734178
pop-up	dialog
the other problem that may exist with this approach is that word may pop-up a dialog in some cases anyway i found that it did with word 2010 win 7 when the document was in a unc path but not a driveletter type path but i do not know exactly what circumstances and settings will cause that problem

734178
pop-up	dialog
afaics the field still works correctly in that situation but the dialog pop-up would almost certainly be unsettling at the very least for an end user

734180
cpu	processors
if you want to run programs faster then a faster cpu processors is key but some programs can only run as fast as they do

734182
debian	linux
under debian linux this image will copy with the correct alpha-value from iceweasel but not from opera web-browser

734206
debian	linux
cdrom debian gnu linux testing jessie - official snapshot amd64 dvd binary-1

734256

734328
daemon	cron
there are several things that are logged in var log messages including mail cron daemon kern auth etc

734328
daemons	systemd
var log daemon.log â contains information logged by the various background daemons that runs on the systemd

734328

734481
bluetooth	usb
i have a usb bluetooth dongle on a linux 3.12.5 arm system

734485
igmp	upnp	packets	multicast
however the kind of multicast that discovery protocols like dial upnp and bonjour mdns dns-sd use are not the kind that igmp is supposed to apply to so a well-written igmp snooping implementation will always allow those packets to get through on wireless because you can t really expect to see anyone issue igmp requests for them

734485
packets	multicast
the ap has to do special work to make sure that multicast packets are queued up and delivered at times when all of the clients that care about multicast have their wi-fi receivers turned on to receive them

734492
debian	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	linux
i d like to know if vmware workstation 10 is running stable under linux debian or ubuntu

google-chrome	firefox
the 32-bit jre is required to use the java plugin in 32-bit browsers like google-chrome and mozilla firefox on windows

734560
x86	64bit
windows x64 systems by default have seperate 32 and 64bit versions of ie so if you plan to use the x64 option x86 is default you need a 64bit plugin and jre

734560
google-chrome	firefox
if you plan to run firefox google-chrome whatever-other-x86-browser just use the 32bit

734563
stdout	stderr
nothing is produced on stdout stderr

734627
portrait	landscape
i couldn t access those options without keeping the changes first and since it said it was in landscape mode i thought something was wrong since it was obviously showing as portrait

734648
filesystems	ntfs
i have a directory that i moved from a linux filesystems to an ntfs filesystems and broke all of the symlinks

734650
mouse	keyboard
i need that because i prefer keyboard to mouse and it s faster for instance to just press win+r - type cmd and press enter

734685
filesystems	ntfs
i don t know how the filesystems was moved to from ntfs but it s possible these small files still contain the contents of the link

734703
spaces	delimiter
suppose you have file named yourfile.csv spaces as delimiter and you want to read the fourth d1 column you should execute this

734705
hash	salt
neither the nt hash nor the lm hash is salt

734707
ubuntu	linux
by the way if i open the file in linux evince ubuntu 12.10 32 bits i can save the file without problems

tap the wi-fi sleep policy entry and you ll get a pop-up dialog with the choices you see in the picture above

734747

vpn	lan
for example if you have a vpn server and want the remote vpn clients to be on the same subnet as the ethernet lan that the vpn server is connected to the vpn server will have to do proxy arp on behalf of the vpn clients to let ethernet hosts know they can send traffic to the vpn server and the vpn server will forward it to the remote vpn clients

734989
vpn	lan
if you are trying to reach the server on its external ip address from your lan this most likely won t work as your router is not going to be doing the port translation - you might want to find another connection to try from or set up a vpn or proxy on your pc to force you to go externally and come back again

wan	lan
if your adapters can do that you could put your wan modem router in on one logical network while your lan router out everything else resides on a different logical network

737700
wan	lan
you can t put wan and lan on the same network segment because the cable modem needs to send dhcp broadcasts to assign your router a public ip address and the router needs to send dhcp broadcasts to assign private ip addresses to all other devices on the network

737757
vorbis	webm
the webm output container only supports vorbis audio and offers experimental support for opus audio so change libfdk_aac to libvorbis

737766
ethernet	wireless
all traffic has to use the mac address of the host s wireless adapter and therefore virtualbox needs to replace the source mac address in the ethernet header of an outgoing packet to make sure the reply will be sent to the host interface

737766
arp	dhcp
... virtualbox examines arp and dhcp packets in order to learn the ip addresses of virtual machines

737787
windows	wow64
additionally the 64-bit version of windows includes the wow64 compatibility layer that dynamically translates 32-bit api calls to the 64-bit equivalents and switches the cpu between 32-bit protected and 64-bit long modes when the process is scheduled to be run

737787
vmware	virtualbox
given the proper hardware support one can sometimes run a virtual machine using virtualbox or vmware that contains a 64-bit guest os while the host os is only 32-bit again given the availability of x86-64 hardware virtualization

wan	lan
however i think this is not the right approach since this schedule is for wan access and my 2 routers are chained via lan ports the wan port on the secondary router is not even used

737879
wan	lan
connect dd-wrt router to your lan via its wan port

737879
wan	lan	wan	subnet
if you have your kids systems in the same subnet as your main lan there really shouldn t be a difference in terms of what local resources they can access however it does give you the control over their wan access that you want

738111
google-chrome	firefox
i suggest you download firefox or google-chrome as a test to see whether the same problem occurs with one of these browsers

738114
folder	directory
well i don t know how the files got there but they have a .swf file extension which is shockwave flash video etc and the probable reason they re on your desktop is because some browsers notably firefox set the default download directory to the desktop folder hence the file icons show up on your desktop

738270
ssd	sata
since my laptop has only sata 2.0 interface i assume that even if i upgrade to the above mentioned ssd there won t be much difference in performance as the sata 2.0 interface will not be able to fully utilize the full speed advantage of the speed of ssd which is 400+mb s

738370
disk	ram
see pushing the limits of windows virtual memory of memory whether that memory is currently paged into physical ram or onto disk

738370

worse in your case the pagefile is not large enough to move any of the leaking process to disk so you have essentially forced it to leak exclusively into physical ram

cifs	smb
the drive itself is formatted as ext4 and i m writing the files over the network via cifs smb

740250
put	get
simply put if your tx is set too high the antenna will cause reflection noise for itself - similar to screaming in a concrete room doesn t make it more easy to understand as the listener will get a lot of echo as well

740266
disk	ram
this is because modern oses page out things to disk that either overflow ram or aren t used in a while and ssds increase the speed of this process substantially

740266
disk	ram
cad programs are heavy on both disk i o and ram so it s really hard to say in your situation for sure without testing and knowing about your users workflows

740291
pop-up	dialog
when i try to browse the other machine one of three things will happen everything works everything appears to work but then explorer blanks out for awhile while it tries to reconnect or something or explorer eventually pop-up an error dialog telling me the machine doesn t exist

740314
folder	directory
use normal directory folder

740339
jobs	cron
however i can say that what finally did work for me was to set up a pair of cron jobs to disable and enable the wireless radio at specific times using the wl command

740358
wan	lan
if i were you i would disable the dhcp server in the wireless router and connect the wired router to it via lan port not wan port

740379
ubuntu	linux
i have 2 terminals desktop computers both running linux ubuntu 12.04.04 server

740382
ubuntu	linux
i m new to linux and running on ubuntu 12.04

740409
kde	gnome
i installed the kde and gnome flavors in two different laptops hp toshiba already having win8 pre-installed meaning that i happily ended with dual booting

740434
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari
it supports internet explorer firefox google-chrome safari and opera

740434
google-chrome	firefox
version 4.0 - 10.0 mozilla firefox all versions google-chrome

740434
opera	safari
safari and opera

740437
ubuntu	linux
boot up the machine using a linux livecd such as ubuntu

740448
ubuntu	linux
optionally i would also like a directly bootable fully persistent linux preferably ubuntu on this stick

740448
ubuntu	linux
persistent linux partition to which ubuntu was installed using normal methods from the same usb stick

740477
installation	upgrade
i have a windows server 2003 installation which may be upgrade to 2008 in the future configured for the default of 2 remote desktop sessions

740481
spaces	delimiter
this replaces each occurrence of the desired delimiter in your case spaces with 99 spaces

740483
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
i tried google-chrome firefox and safari

740484
punctuation	words
but if i turn â œxâ and â œyâ into equations by selecting them and then giving the command insert â equation for example in words 2007 or newer a spelling error is reported space before punctuation

740497
kde	gnome
please let us know your distro version and desktop manager kde gnome etc but generally speaking and assuming you use a debian-ubuntu based distro i would check reinstall default fonts packages and would reconfig them following these commands

740538
button	checkbox
each mixer stripe can have volume and balance sliders a mute select checkbox and an advanced parameters button

740569
tunnel	vpn
to change this behaviour check your vpn client for a feature called split tunnel

740569
tunnel	vpn
you could also google the vpn product name with split tunnel

740577
tunnel	vpn
i assume that you setup vpn using the build-in windows vpn capability which will have no such feature as split tunnel

740602
affinity	processors
you can open up the task manager and remove one core from the processors affinity screen

740616
cpu	hyperthreading
practically any turing-complete cpu can perform multithreading even if the computer only has one cpu core and that core does not support hyperthreading

740616
cpu	hyperthreading
in the case of a uniprocessor one cpu core with no hyperthreading if you have more than one software thread they will always be interleaved

740616
cpu	hyperthreading
if you have a 4-core cpu with hyperthreading that s 8 hardware threads meaning the cpu can execute 8 simultaneous threads of execution at the same instant so if you had 8 software threads trying to run they could all run at once

740616
processors	hyperthreading
hyperthreading on the other hand refers to a very specific hardware technology created by intel which allows a single processors core to interleave multiple threads of execution more efficiently

740616
cpu	hyperthreading
in other words a cpu with hyperthreading is going to provide performance which is somewhat greater than a cpu which is otherwise the same but without hyperthreading because the hyperthreading cpu will be able to concurrently balance two sometimes more but hyperthreading is usually 2-way threads of execution on a given core

740616
cpu	hyperthreading
but if i had a choice between 4 cores with hyperthreading or 8 cores assuming that each core itself has the same performance i would choose the 8 core cpu every time

740618
processors	hyperthreading
hyperthreading is an intel concept that implements simultaneous processing of multiple threads in a single processors core

740672
folder	directory
so my question is there a way for me to specify during installation of windows that i want those directory program files and user folder to be on the hdd instead of the ssd while still installing the os onto the ssd

740677
folder	directory
although you can basically do this for any file or folder please be aware that if you do this with the c windows winsxs directory windows updates can no longer be installed until you move it back

740692
opensuse	linux
yes you are right opensuse build service allow you to build packages for the number of linux distributions but no you are thinking wrong to use last c++ compiler version for all distributions

740715
folder	directory
i could create a hard link in the software s configuration folder and let it point to my cloud storage directory

740732
ethernet	wireless
hp elitebook laptops have a built-in ability to disable the wireless connection when an ethernet cable is plugged in

740787
voip	sip
sip is a voip platform

740787
udp	tcp
it works over udp not tcp this is an important feature and limitation

740787
voip	sip
in order to use it you need a sip client like ekiga or a voip phone - voip phones are common as well as a device system to handle the calls

740787
voip	sip
also invariably if you have a naked dsl connection where your provider provides voip calling this will be running sip in the backend

740788
ubuntu	linux
if you are not going to use linux anyways or you would like to have the ubuntu install cd simply reinstall grub you could restore the windows boot loader from the windows recovery cd you kept it around right

740819
folder	directory
i don t know if it matters but notice that i have granted full admin rights on all the files and folder of the mounted directory i can copy write delete from system-restricted directory i mean that seems i don t have any problem with the files rights

740843
pop-up	dialog
1 for example vmware player will give you a pop-up dialog telling you that you need to use ctrl + alt + ins to send the sas command to the vm instead of ctrl + alt + del when you return from the sas screen

740936
apache	nginx
nb as stated in the blog post this workaround will not fix nginx and apache server who have to be recompile with 1.0.1g openssl sources.

741030
sudoers	visudo
so add this line to etc sudoers using the command sudo visudo

741051
tunnel	vpn
the simplest solution is having your firewall within it create a vpn tunnel to a known point where you could then access the systems inside your firewall directly

741099
vim	emacs
i tried changing the variable of my terminal to emacs but it still uses vim

741103
cpu	processors
1 2 that it would only have taken 25 of the cpu load makes sense because he said it was a four-core processors so the dns service was using 100 of the core it was using

741198
firefox	safari
workaround use safari or firefox

741200
disk	ram
i ve created a ram disk under windows using imdisk

741200
disk	ram
but for example it isn t possible in visual studio 2013 currently to create a project in a ram disk neither is it possible to download files to it using the popular downloader utility jdownloader

741202
switching	screens
you can log-off or switching user or even just press alt+ctrl+del and it should show your new logon screens background

741208
daemons	systemd	daemons	launchd
for information on launchd the systemd wide and per-user daemons agent manager see the following

741213
itunes	iphoto
it is slow but works well as an itunes iphoto backblaze machine. it has a few services running in the background all the time backblaze google drive dropbox and splashtop which i mention in case any of these might be causing trouble

741213
automator	iphoto
i am trying to create an automator folder action that monitors dropbox camera uploads and imports the images to iphoto and then deletes them

741217
filesystems	ntfs
both have an ntfs filesystems

741234
mouse	keyboard
sometimes but very rarely it will boot up and go into a log-in screen or windows memory diagnostics - in both cases i can not control the keyboard mouse to do anything even w usb keyboard mouse

741247
mouse	keyboard
if there are hardware issues with the input devices you could try plugging an external mouse keyboard

741318
afp	smb
with -w tcpdump doesn t print anything per packet so it doesn t go over the wire unless you re saving the capture to a file on a file system mounted from a file server such as an nfs or smb or afp server

741354
notepad++	sublimetext
i used sublimetext but notepad2 notepad++ will work

741355
google-chrome	firefox
one the left is firefox and on the right is google-chrome

741380
ubuntu	debian
so how to install i386 package on amd64 under the ubuntu debian multiarch environment

741410
mouse	trackpad
os x mavericks if you enable system preferences accessibility mouse trackpad trackpad options enable dragging you will be able to double tap to drag but there will be an annoying delay before a single tap

741480
x86	64bit
also in 64bit operating systems you ll see both x64 64bit and x86 32-bit versions installed and the latter is required for 32-bit c++ programs who might need them

741486
folder	directory
i have added a folder with a page in it in the inetpub wwwroot directory

741492
ubuntu	debian
did you try install vim apt-get install vim on ubuntu debian

741512
gtk	ncurses
in addition to the gtk gui there appear to be both qt and ncurses interfaces in the repository so you may be able to install or build one of those instead

741591
ubuntu	debian
i know ubuntu is based on debian but i would like to find out if i am running debian or ubuntu

741591
ubuntu	linux
result linux version 2.6.18.8-x86_64-linode10 root build.linode.com gcc version 4.3.3 ubuntu 4.3.3-5ubuntu4 #1 smp tue nov 10 16 29 17 utc 2009

741591
ubuntu	debian
so what is it debian or ubuntu

741591
debian	linux
debian gnu linux 5.0 so i can conclusively say it is debian

741598
min	max
it s a little ugly but for the data used for the column chart you could make an excel column numbered 1 through 70 to match your x-axis min and max and then stick your numbers that represent the height of the bar in the next column for the appropriate category for instance 1-11 would be empty 12 would be 50 13-23 would be empty 24 would be 115 etc. like i said

741610
ubuntu	debian
you should trust lsb_release since both debian and ubuntu claim to be lsb compliant

741621
cinnamon	gnome
since cinnamon is based on gnome 3 i would think that you would have an uphill battle getting it to work on centos

741707
x86	64bit
if it s a windows 64bit machine it will return the path to program files x86 if it s not 64bit it won t be defined and will just return programfiles x86

741727
google-chrome	safari
rockmelt a chrome-based browser connects to the internet whereas my usual browsers safari google-chrome and nightly don t

741748
hash	md5
on the source disk generate md5 hash

741758
debian	linux
the only difference between my windows and debian systems is that windows is using the gateway for dns resolution and linux is using defined external dns servers

741765
hash	md5
md5 is a hash

741765
hash	md5
there will obviously be multiple files which hash to the same md5 sum

741765
hash	md5
however lots of single bit changes together may cause the md5 hash to be the same

741765
hash	md5
it is therefore quite reasonable to use md5 to validate file integrity against random corruption but no if malicious intent is possible as someone could modify a file while making sure the md5 hash is the same

741770
hash	md5
it is possible to maliciously construct two different blocks of data that produce the same md5 hash

741770
hash	md5
while it is conceivable that such an event could cause the md5 hash to be the same the probability is so low that it s almost unimaginable that it would be a probability worth worrying about

741770
hash	md5
even if you had a quadrillion units of data the probability that a mismatched md5 would produce an md5 hash belonging to one of those quadrillion units is much less than one in a quadrillion

741809
wav	caf
i am using afconvert to convert wav files into caf

741826
debian	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	linux
i am upgrading ubuntu 8.04 on a dedicated router firewall nat smtp ssh server with a current linux debian wheezy

741826
ubuntu	debian
i am using virtualbox 4.2 with ubuntu 8.04 as host and the new debian build as guest

741826
wan	lan
the host box has two nics wan and lan and acts as firewall nat between them

741860
voip	sip
sip trunk enables you to extend voip telephony beyond your organizationâ s firewall without the need for an ip-pstn gateway

741870
vim	sublimetext
is it possible to get sublimetext s goto symbol behavior on pressing ctrl + r in vim

741889
debian	linux
i switched from windows to linux sparky linux based on debian testing jessie with xfce 4 as

741926

after i put this iptables rules in my firewall i still able to get login into 30.30.10.1 webgui interface

741957
relaxng	schematron
i m writing a docbook 5 document and would like to fully validate it against both the relaxng and schematron schemas

741957
relaxng	schematron
to my knowledge xmllint from the libxml2 package won t handle relaxng schemas with embedded schematron and the standalone schematron schema docbook.sch won t successfully compile according to xmllint

741957
relaxng	schematron
how can i fully validate my docbook 5 document against both the relaxng and schematron schemas

741964
udp	tcp
the reason for the weird iperf results was that every system i tested on has different default tcp window and udp buffer sizes

741987
folder	directory
during a change of the folder location for google drive explorer crashed and when the dust cleared the c users directory was now renamed to c google drive

742018
ssl	https
that s why most encrypted connections like https tls and ssl encrypted vpn maybe some online games will not work or may misbehave with such connection type

742022
rmdir	mkdir
mkdir and rmdir create and remove directories

742039
ssd	sata
my pc says my hdd is sataii is it possible to just plug in a sataiii ssd and use the hdd as an external drive with a sata usb cable

742062
tunnel	lan
finding someone to give you an ipv4-over-ipv6 tunnel from the internet to your lan will be difficult

742084
gentoo	linux
- i m a gentoo linux user so i consider myself a good learner but haven t yet found any good references for openwrt

742085
opensuse	mint	opensuse	linux	ubuntu	opensuse	ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	linux
you reformat and reload windows onto your computer or you could try a live linux distribution eg ubuntu mint opensuse fedora

742163
ubuntu	debian
found the answer in the debian wiki the ubuntu community multiarch wiki is incomplete --

742171
fish	bash
it was working in bash and fish shell

742257
hash	md5
there are also some non-standard hash commands xcrc md5 mmd5 xmd5 xsha xsha1 xsha256 xsha512 which are supported only by a few servers and clients

742267
mouse	keyboard
dedicated mouse and keyboard for a virtual machine is it possible

742317
disk	ram
in case you ever want the temporary performance of an ssd you can use softperfect ram disk to create a ram drive with your extra ram

742331
udp	tcp
wile doing research i noticed that ssh both uses tcp and udp

742331
udp	tcp
i completely understand the use of tcp but udp seems a bit strange

742366
udp	tcp
in this thesis they tried to implement udp for ssh transport but they also mention that the default only uses tcp

742366
udp	tcp
the wikipedia page might say it s udp because the ssh developers made an initial request for udp tcp assignments but the related rfc makes no mention of it

742388
move	drag	mouse	keyboard
she can just move her mouse and keyboard from on monitor to the other without any issues and in most instances she can drag and drop

742395
hide	show
more modern taskmanagers such as processhacker2 will show everything regardless how well someone tries to hide it

742410
onenote	ms-office
for word excel powerpoint onenote - you ve got the online ms-office suite

742411
bluetooth	usb
but i have add the another usb audio device for recording the bluetooth device not allow the usb device to record the audio

742433
pull	push
yesterday until 14 25 utc i was able to push pull changes for this repo

742433
pull	push
i have another repo another project on the very same gerrit server and i was able to pull push everything without any problems yesterday before after choke on antoher repo and today before after applying the solution

742433
pull	push
if there are some changes bugs in ssh layer in general then i really can t understand how can they influent only a one way pull push works b one repo other works and c happen suddenly all was working minutes before

742437
daemons	systemd
esentially you create a systemd unit file which handles the startup and shutdown of the btsync daemons on boot and shutdown

742448
loops	if-statement
it features basic programming constructs like variables if-statement and loops

742464
hash	md5
i need to design a solution that will allow me to submit a series of md5 hash and then be alerted if these hash are found on any machine windows on the network

742466
hash	md5
it supports both recursive calculation of various hash digest including md5 of content within a path

742505
folder	directory
since starterkit is in your home folder cd will not find it in the directory

742515
folder	directory
i ve got a directory that contains a bunch of other folder containing coffeescript javascript files

742524
fish	zsh
here s a simple function which will give you a similar effect to that zsh prompt put it in your fish functions directory

742527
relaxng	schematron
i still haven t found a validation method that will correctly handle a single relaxng schema with embedded schematron but i have found a way to correctly validate my docbook 5 document

742527
xslt	schematron
using the xslt scripts and method described at be sure to get the obsolete files rng2schtrn.xsl and xsd2schtrn.xsl which work with schematron 1.5 was successful

742527
relaxng	schematron	xslt	relaxng	xslt	schematron
use an xslt file rng2schtrn.xsl to extract the schematron 1.5 rules from the relaxng schema

742527
xslt	schematron
use the schematron 1.5 validation xslt files schematron-basic.xsl found at to create a validation xslt file from the schematron rules for the docbook document

742533
ubuntu	linux
i m not gonna post a full explaination here sorry as i usually use syslinux with arch linux but if you don t know how to actually do it check out the ubuntu wiki article on grub 2 again it s basically the same as fixing a broken grub 2 installation

742539
cpu	affinity
if we create 2 cores and set affinity to a1 and b1 it s not one thread to a1 and other thread to b1 it s combined affinity for two threads then it works fine and cpu usage shows 25

742539
cpu	affinity
but if we set affinity of 4 threads to a1 a2 b1 b2 then cpu usage shows 50

742562
disk	ram
note that the comparison is against the disk image in ram not the source media itself so if the source data did not read correctly it will be written incorrectly

742579
mouse	keyboard
such a solution would be faster and more comfortable because it would have fewer steps no need to switch between the mouse and the keyboard and no need to worry about highlighting exactly the right amount of text

742595
tunnel	vpn
as it is a split tunnel is there a way i can force all traffic through the vpn connection so my external ip is always the pfsense box s one

742595
tunnel	vpn
how would i overcome this is there an alternative to trying to force the traffic through the vpn tunnel

742619
ubuntu	linux
as a last resort you can use a livecd of a linux distro ubuntu for example to copy the files from the external hdd

742635
udp	tcp
you opened udp port try to open tcp port instead as well

742640
udp	tcp
also change protocol to tcp udp as ssssteffff suggests

742655
cifs	smb
you could also establish an ssh tunnel to proxy some other method of network sharing such as nfs smb or cifs which would again achieve a similar end result

742777
tunnel	vpn
i ve read the various questions about content filtering and it seems that opendns is the consensus solution although it s easy to bypass with a vpn service or an ssh tunnel

742826
ssd	sata
i recently replaced my sata hdd with an ssd and keeping the hdd in as a spare

742828
cos	sin
pthread_ calls cos sin tan etc

742828
unix	bsd	unix	solaris	solaris	bsd
note there are differences between the man section list for linux and that for unix system v variants solaris bsd sco venix

742853
width	height
window width and height will each be half the size of the screen

742857
centos	linux
but using a linux box with centos release 6.5 i can not navigate through the shortcut

742862
put	get
but if i put it in the crontab it will get stuck if i don t redirect it s output with export display command

742874
postfix	dovecot
though i was able to set up an email for one account using postfix dovecot and installed roundcube squirrelmail and everything worked just fine

742874
folder	directory
i have understood that each email account has it s own directory in the home folder but this means if someone from site1 creates an email called contact site1.com and another client from different domain creates an email called contact differentsite.net then there would be two folder called contact in home directory

742879
folder	directory
the reason why the cd command is failing is because you are asking linux to cd to a file and not a directory folder

742879
filesystems	ntfs
windows supports unix linux-style symlinks with the mklink command on ntfs filesystems - however i haven t tried accessing them via cifs share to see if they d work

742916
versioning	upgrade
since the latest couple of upgrade ie11 metro modern versioning permanently shows the menu bar at the bottom

742920
daemon	cron
and with cron daemon in the message header

742936
disk	ram
just make sure you have at least one gib of ram and your hard disk isn t failed

742951
google-chrome	firefox
i would like to browse folders of another pc in my wireless lan using a browser google-chrome ie firefox

742952
unix	bsd	unix	solaris	solaris	bsd
linux unix bsd solaris osx hp-ux whatever i m still missing

opera	google-chrome
i have used google-chrome and opera but as i do not like them and do not currently have them installed i cannot presently use it for an example

742957
opensuse	linux
my opensuse is divided in two partitions and the lib is in the home partition at least his is how i understand it this is my first time with linux

742958
children	parent
actual deletion happens before going back up to the parent as it appears to break the iteration over the children if done on the fly

742967
filesystems	ntfs
one very important difference comes about if you use the efs encrypted attribute efs stands for encrypting filesystems which is not actually a filesystems but rather a feature of ntfs

743005
folder	directory
i have a user who hid a folder in xp after they did this the folder no longer showed up in the directory

743005
folder	directory
not only do they not know the directory of the hidden folder they don t know the name of it

743018
folder	directory
just change c to the directory you want to check and it will give you a list of all hidden folder minus system folder

743045
folder	directory
set your ntfs permissions on the directory to list folder contents and read

743047
post	get
if you really want to convince your it department i think you ll have to get a definitive answer from dell and show that to them or maybe you can just try showing them the forum post about your particular laptop

743062
post	get
if you would like to go that route let us know and i can post some information to get you started

743088
folder	directory
it doesn t seem useful to leave currentjdk pointing to a non-existent directory so i ran this command in the system library frameworks javavm.framework versions folder

743114
icmp	udp
your firewall does not only filter icmp but udp as well

743114
icmp	udp
per default linux traceroute uses udp for probes - not icmp

743114
udp	tcp	icmp	udp	icmp	tcp
moreover you can use tcp syn with option -t udp lite with -ul or request icmp echo like ping with -i

743122
vmware	virtualbox
currently i m trying to achieve the same thing using all the info i ve referred here and the site use a real windows 7 partition in virtualbox kvm vmware under linux combined

743154
debian	linux
for some time i have kept a lot of my files stored on a home server running debian linux with samba

743181
short	base
rebuild the base system you might need to rebuild the kernel if the sources are not in-sync with your current system version in short make buildworld and make installworld more information here

743221
screens	tablet
ubuntu 14.04 lts is the first version that has complete support for tablet and hi-dpi screens

743242
google-chrome	firefox
some softwares need not be reinstalled after an os reinstall like firefox google-chrome etc

743311
post	get
altered some settings in acrobat as per some other post again can list a few more details when i get to my friends

743329
subnet	packets
loop issue caused by misconfigured router which sends packets back using different subnet instead of dropping them

743346
put	get
how do i get this cell to stay blank when there is an error from b15 not having text but i don t lose the formula when i do put text in b15

743398
sudo	passwd
they said they used no sudo passwd but that doesn t work and nothing else works

743398
sudo	passwd
can i reset the sudo passwd from the terminal

743404
sudo	passwd
in general sudo is using your user using to login into your desktop passwd

743405
sudo	passwd
just remember when sudo asks for a passwd it needs your user

743419
ftp	telnet
the telnet command will try to connect to hostname.ftpsite.com replace this with the ftp hostname you are trying to connect to on port 21 which is the standard ftp port

743447
udp	tcp
a tcp connection not udp not multicast etc upon which sessions applications establish to conduct transactions and present content is between one and only one source ip port and one and only one destination ip port

i made a bootable linux mint flash drive on another computer booted into linux copied over all the files in my installation of teamviewer if i only copied over the teamviewer setup file from their website i would have to click run only or install it for it to run and tell me the user id and password but i can t exactly do that without my mouse and keyboard into windows startup folder

i have 500000 plus files in over 3000 directory and need to rename all folder called photos to photos

744505

i m guessing there must be a way to find that type of information with apt or dpkg or something

744529
xfce	gnome	xfce	kde	kde	gnome
on the other hand those gui applications which wish to integrate into the desktop environment such as gnome kde xfce lxde etc usually provide the so-called desktop files ending with the .desktop extension which give their program a descriptive title a description of its purpose and state the way the application has to be called

udp	tcp
most of the time when talking about the internet people think of the tcp or udp protocols and what tcp or udp port numbers particular applications use

744566
udp	tcp	icmp	udp	icmp	tcp
ping on the otherhand does not use tcp or udp but rather icmp

744566
udp	tcp	icmp	udp	icmp	tcp
the abuse of icmp is typically confined to confirming whether or not a device is active at a particular ip address without going through all of the available protocols and for tcp and udp all of the port numbers

744566
udp	tcp
even just scanning the popular tcp udp port numbers for recognisable applications to prompt the device to respond takes time

744694
ethernet	wireless
when 802.11 wireless ethernet chipsets first appeared they presented themselves to host oses as ethernet interfaces because those oses didn t have any special 802.11-specific support built-in

744694
ethernet	wireless
so on os x 802.11 wireless ethernet interfaces were called enx just like wired ethernet interfaces and the name has stuck ever since

744761
mouse	keyboard
now however i see a new dialog window that doesn t make sense to me that asks for the mouse and keyboard center. clicking on this opens to a new window that says that my mouse is not supported

744764
mouse	keyboard
check the mouse and keyboard center compatibility list for win8 to see if your mouse is on there

744764
mouse	keyboard
if it s an older ms mouse and it s not on the list uninstall the mouse and keyboard center and use the ms intellipoint software instead

744780
switching	screens
switching to external display and press any keys you want without waking up the screens then switching back to lcd to see what have you messed up -

744793
mouse	keyboard
to my understanding you want to prevent a mouse keyboard from waking your computer or does this include software

744820
ethernet	wireless
it is a modem that converts atm to ethernet your actual dsl connection a router nat dhcp a wireless access point and a switch the physical rj45 ports

744821
filesystems	ntfs
i would like to format it with a filesystems such as ntfs

744830
filesystems	ntfs
all you need to do is select the device in this case your flash drive and make sure filesystems is set to ntfs

744844
mouse	keyboard
to share only keyboard and mouse between computers you can use synergy

744844
mouse	keyboard
for monitors + keyboard + mouse sharing you need kvm switch something like this - not sure about the price though

744845
minimum	max
to show how severe the issue is normally i keep my headset at about 18 volume and grooveshark turned down to near the minimum volume and that was far louder than the current max volume on both with this issue

744848
udp	tcp
i try to understand differences between tcp and udp packet on the error-checking

744848
udp	tcp
and tcp packet is the opposite of udp

744848
udp	tcp
my question is if a packet send into a closed port of a remote host what action will take place on udp and tcp packets

744848
icmp	udp
udp packet - response with an icmp code-3

744860
icmp	udp
rfc 768 for udp does not specify any action on a closed port but the icmp rfc 792 specifies a message type 3 code 3 destination unreachable destination port unreachable that may be sent

744907
ubuntu	linux
i ve successfully set up event mpm in arch linux but i m failing to do so on ubuntu

744912

the server needs to only understand http protocol primitives get post head etc. and return corresponding resources to the client via the tcp socket

moving the mouse or using the keyboard doesn t wake the monitor in this case

745142
tunnel	vpn	tunnel	packets
basically if split tunnel is turned off all traffic must flow over the vpn however try tracert command on both windows and linux and you should hopefully get a trace of the route that packets take to reach the destination then you ll be able to tell if it s passing through your vpn gateway

745154

daemons	systemd
then you need a router advertisement daemons on the systemd for your internal network

745425
mouse	keyboard
what you can do though is to use a keyboard mouse scripting program such as autoit or autohotkey with which you can run a program then send the relevant key and mouse clicks necessary to get the program into the state that you require

745425
mouse	keyboard
autohotkey also has several script writers that you can use to record a series of keyboard and mouse clicks into a script for you saving you time and effort learning the syntax

745463
disk	ram
assuming windows the program fastcopy not only will buffer more data into ram during a single disk operation like this reducing the strain on the i-while-o problem but it also has a throttling feature a few notches down from full speed could get the rest of the disk activity some time slices to operate in

745481

745621
folder	directory
first list all files and folder in the current directory ie

745683
vmware	virtualbox
even better to avoid rebooting your machine to get from one os to the other load windows download vmware it s free and then load linux as a virtual machine the other way around is ok too however the linux version of vmware is a little tricky so you might want to use virtualbox

745686

when my computer started up again no boot options were available even though the computer can see the ssd in the sata port

745715
mouse	keyboard
disabled awaking via mouse and keyboard

745740
disk	ram
once you have a ram disk device you can put any fs on it you like

745740
disk	ram
since you re on a mac it s the most natural fs to put on your ram disk

745743
filesystems	ntfs
so if i can manipulate the ntfs on a low level and shrink it to the size of ssd then i can maybe get the filesystems back without the data from hdd

745768

wan	lan
your router is connected to your local network with its lan ip on the one side and to the internet with your 4 global ips on the other side of course google.com is in the wan the internet

745900
wan	lan
now the magic happens your router with the nat pat in it is as before connected to the lan but to the wan not longer with 4 but with only this one ip address

745905
xfce	cinnamon
it works in unity but does not in xfce nor in cinnamon which i am testing right now

745920

uname -a on debian shows linux debian.xx.xx 3.2.0-4-amd64 #1 smp debian 3.2.54-2 x86_64

746138
icmp	tcp
my understanding of this is that my.router drops the icmp time exceeded messages coming from the intermediate hops and i think that s because my.router is expecting tcp responses to the tcp entries in its nat table and considers icmp responses to be invalid

746153
ubuntu	debian
because there is explicit open-source support for setting up full-disk encryption during the install process in some distributions such as debian and ubuntu

746171
mouse	keyboard
tried the amd cleaner utility once thay green box came up the keyboard and mouse just stopped

746186

746346
ethernet	wireless
well it didnâ t last night - when i went to bed my wife asked about an ethernet cable i had run through the kitchen and thinking that the wireless connection would handle the traffic if the ethernet was removed i told her just to remove the ethernet cable retract the line out of the kitchen shut the door and go to bed as i rolled over.

746363
ethernet	wireless
this is also due to the fact that the theoretical link speed of wireless varies depending on technology used and ethernet 10 100 1000 are quite different

746372
ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	linux
ubuntu is a popular one but linux mint seems to be a more streamlined version of ubuntu

i tried xcopy first as the user suggested but then i used robocopy which is included in windows 7 and this one succeeded

you will need at minimum a fiber channel card for your server and sfps for the thing you are buying which has empty sfp slots and some fiber or copper if you get copper sfps but fiber can often be cheaper and also has much more flexible length options. you will probably need sfps for the card you put in the server as well unless it happens to come with them

there are some threads out there telling you how to reset the password on older versions of vtiger but it seems like they changed from md5 hash to something that looks like bcrypt

748654
mouse	keyboard
so i can use it to attach keyboard mouse and also use hdmi tv to it

748666
folder	directory
keep in mind if you have multiple instances of the same tomcat version in the same directory you ll need to give each a unique parent folder name

748705
mouse	trackpad
if you re actually stuck with an ancient mouse or trackpad that doesn t let you right-click you can hold down control while clicking to do the same as a right-click

748705
mouse	trackpad
so be sure to check your mouse or trackpad preference pane in system preferences to make sure you ve enabled right-clicking or two-finger clicking if you can

748705
mouse	trackpad
don t just assume you can t because you don t see a separate right-click button on your mouse or trackpad

748750
debian	linux
i am running a debian flavor of linux and i use htop to keep track of memory usage since it is more detailed than top

748756
win64	windows
also windows can only cope with a fixed memory size esp 32 bit stuff so unless you re using win64 4gb is well enough

748773
disk	ram
standby pages are essentially cache â itâ s better to have infrequently used data kept in ram â œjust in caseâ than pushing it out to disk when the memory isnâ t needed for anything else

748786
ubuntu	linux
on linux get the libltdl-dev package for example on ubuntu

748822
sudo	passwd
to do this with a command-line text editor like nano execute the command sudo nano etc bash.bashrc and if needed enter your passwd

748829
vmware	esx
the rdp server is running on vmware esx just like all the other servers in the subnet

748853
folder	directory
- server settings and tools - account settings - local folder to specify the correct account and mail directory

748900
ubuntu	linux
virtual box is flexibility to start any linux from .iso file as red-hat fedora ubuntu etc

748904
fontconfig	freetype
i installed fontconfig fontconfig-devel freetype freetype-devel

748911
disk	ram
also more ram means more in-memory caching and therefore less disk work

748978
cpu	processors
so an x64 cpu is not so much 32bit and 64bit as it is an x64 processors with an instruction set that will work fine for either 32 or 64bit os s

749016
udp	tcp
what does not work however is anything that seem to utilize tcp possibly udp also but nslookup works

749020
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari

749123
udp	rtp
instead the majority of the rtp implementations are built on the user datagram protocol udp

749123
rtp	sip	udp	tcp	udp	rtp
the other answers about the differences between udp and tcp do apply especially trying to udp tunnel over ssh but aren t as significant to sip as they are to rtp

749123
sctp	tcp
sip is perfectly capable of running on top of tcp and even sctp

749123
udp	tcp	sctp	udp	sctp	tcp
the latency and or retransmissions of the network may either be handled by the transport protocol tcp sctp or in cases where those functions are not provided at the transport layer udp sip has its own mechanisms for retransmissions and timeouts

749123
sip	sdp
many headers in sip and sdp bodies include relevant ip addresses which you may be implicitly obscuring at the tunnel

749123
rtp	sip
in fact if you re not careful you may end up tunneling sip over ssh without tunneling the rtp at all

749136
hash	md5
now where can we find a similar listing of the md5 hash for those files

749146
cpu	processors
i m considering running a game server for some friends and i to play on with my laptop but while the server is running my processors use tends to go to around 55-65 and my cpu temperature hovers around 70 c

749267
mouse	keyboard
is there a way i can use a wireless keyboard and mouse without inserting its usb stick into the usb port

749270
mouse	keyboard
a wireless mouse keyboard does not use regular wifi 802.11x and can only bind with the receiver it came with

749384
kate	geany
maybe these linux editors support such html feature geany kate

749441
hide	show
using fx29 with vimperator i added following js code in .vimperatorrc maybe _vimperatorrc on windows to show and hide the navigation bar by f2 key

749592
google-chrome	firefox
it is located in the google-chrome subfolder inside your firefox profile folder

749594
mp4	h.264
also you want to use h.264 and aac as video and audio codec respectively with mp4 as a container not the mpeg-4 and mp3 combination in avi that you will get with your current command

749647
folder	directory
logs and snapshots are stored in folder of the same name in the virtual machine directory

749683
bash	zsh
in zsh and i believe bash too you could run

749701
libpcap	wireshark
rawcap writes to libpcap files that wireshark can read

749713
onenote	ms-office
the downside is that you need onenote which until fairly recently was not included in all versions of ms-office

749731
punctuation	words
modify the phrase in novel ways like swapping the first and last letter of each words and wrapping each with numbers and punctuation while capitalizing seemingly arbitrary letters on a pattern say second from the end

755863
google-chrome	firefox
you can use sysinternals process explorer to see if there are any suspicious child processes running under firefox google-chrome

755863
google-chrome	firefox
in your case however because it happens with firefox google-chrome then you ll have to go through all the entries there s a lot to go through under the everything tab

756405
mouse	keyboard
do you think that with the 500 ma of the usb 2.0 i will be able to feed the keyboard and the mouse

756405
mouse	keyboard
power requirements for the backlit keyboard are less than 100ma 5vdc typical and all power required for backlighting is taken from the keyboard port of the host pc even if the one referred by the link is smaller than the one so less leds i specified i think that i should be able to feed keyboard and mouse with less than 500ma

756407
stdout	stderr
as you can see the scripts logs the stdout stderr of every command to log.txt

756422

756566
mouse	keyboard
my question is this is there a keyboard shortcut ctrl+r to reveal the password so that it can be done quickly and efficiently without taking your hands off the keyboard to use the mouse to click the button

756566
mouse	keyboard
it seems to me that this would be an obvious feature to add given that standard textboxes already respond to a number of keyboard shortcuts ctrl+x and that moving your hand of the keyboard to use the mouse and move it to taret the small icon is incredibly inconvenient expecially when you only need to see the password for a fraction of a second to confirm it

i am using a usb bluetooth dongle and my sole purpose is to auto connect the bluetooth dongle when ever it is in range

756622
bluetooth	usb
which gives me that my bluetooth usb dongle is working fine

756654
bash	zsh
the bash completion code was borrowed from zsh so if you have zsh you ll be able to use this too

if your correspondent really is running a versioning of gnupg so ancient it can t handle a 4096 4096 rsa rsa key then you should really tell them to upgrade

natively you cannot store files larger than 4 gb on a fat filesystems

757901
filesystems	fat
the 4 gb barrier is a hard limit of fat the filesystems uses a 32-bit field to store the file size in bytes and 2 32 bytes 4 gib actually the real limit is 4 gib minus one byte or 4 294 967 295 bytes because you can have files of zero length

758919
filesystems	ntfs
i have installed win7 in my disk c and the filesystems format is ntfs

758919
filesystems	ntfs
maybe the reason is filesystems format debian7.5.iso and vmlinuz and initrd.gz can not be read under ntfs so i cut the files into e disk how to edit the menu.lst now

758935
filesystems	ntfs
being able to convert a fat32 drive to ntfs is an exception not a rule and converting from one modern journaled filesystems to another to another is implausible

758935
filesystems	ntfs
any filesystems operation is tricky - i suppose you could shrink the ext4 partition then create a small ntfs partition move some files and repeat until everything is moved over and the ext partition is gone but one mistake and its all gone

ubuntu	debian
a viable solution for making this porting process manageable may be to progressively move forward moving forward and fixing the compilation issues for each intervening debian release before finally updating the code for the most recent ubuntu release

759523
ubuntu	debian
as debian has a much longer release cycle than ubuntu and decent forward compatibility this shouldn t be too insurmountable a task and will almost certainly be more feasible than porting gcc 2.x to the latest ubuntu

putting the ps 2 keyboard in the port designated for the keyboard or a ps 2 mouse in the port designated for the mouse or both

as you can see however on the 550-ti the performance difference is trivial we re talking 0.3 fps difference i assume that in real performance the difference would never exceed 1fps programs aren t perfect in an earlier benchmark the 550-ti on x4 got 21.9 max fps just to be clear the max min are kinda worthless it s the avg fps value that really counts i am going to guess i admit to having no idea what i am talking about that the deciding factor for how important it is to use an x16 bus over x4 is the cards memory bandwidth geforce gtx 670 has 192.2 gb s while geforce gtx 550-ti has 98.4 gb s

tunnel	vpn
but i could not find a way to get it to work until i dropped the idea of using a vpn and instead connected to the server via a simple socks tunnel with ssh by running

767201

one way to check for this is expand the height of the formula bar or the width of the column

767414
versioning	upgrade
i am using systemd v196 and cannot upgrade it to versioning 198 because the latter requires a recent kernel with support for cgroups which cannot be updated by customer requirements

767431
daemons	systemd
on redhat based systemd it appeared that the at daemons atd which is required to schedule and execute actions will getting started after package installation

767435
folder	dir
you can then use familiar commands such as cd and dir to navigate the paths similar to the way you navigate folder in a command prompt window

767438
daemon	cron
the at command places the script in a file in var spool cron atjobs which regularly get checked by the atd daemon

767451
mtu	pppoe
the pppoe protocol has 8 bytes of overhead per packet reducing your mtu from 1500 to 1492

767451
mtu	pppoe
pppoe or not some isps networks have other mtu restrictions

767451
icmp	tcp
some idiot misinformed firewall administrators block all icmp because they want to block ping attempts but don t realize that icmp is used for a lot more stuff than just ping and that blocking icmp does serious damage to the way some low-level parts of tcp ip are supposed to work

767451
mtu	icmp	icmp	tcp
if unhandled mtu restrictions end up being your problem buy a better home gateway that does tcp mss clamping correctly i know apple s airport time capsule lines have always done this well but i can t vouch for others and make sure you don t filter out icmp so that pmtud can work

767457
stdout	stderr
i discovered wget and yum send stdout to stderr so i had to pipe everything to log files

767460
installation	upgrade
the problem you ll then get is that when you distribution upgrade your system it s likely to break your qmail installation

767460
qmail	exim	qmail	smarthost	smarthost	exim
and while they re at it they could offer something useful in the kind of way exim installation does such as asking if you want to use a smarthost you probably do if you re installing on a machine without an fqdn and you need to specify it in qmail s control file smtproutes

767491
bash	zsh
zsh has a more powerful built-in time command than bash has and the zsh version can report memory statistics

767513
cpu	processors
the southbridge now part of the intel pch or amd chipset handles the communication between the cpu and expansion cards including video cards so the bit width of the bus does not create any restrictions on the processors architecture

767543
disk	ram
however it can still consume resources such as cpu ram disk and the network of the host machine

767559
openvpn	iptables
so any traffic destined for 192.168.100.0 goes through the openvpn interface but is destined for 200.1 because my openvpn box has 2 eth connections and has iptables setup to route that traffic

767577

packets	multicast
right now i m getting ntp multicast packets from a computer that i have neither access to nor information on let s call that a that is serving as a stratum 4 ntp multicast server and i m trying to get a few computers time to synchronize to that

767609
packets	multicast
b can receive the multicast packets from a but can t access a otherwise can t ping

767609
packets	multicast
from the ntp multicast packets i gathered that a is sending to multicast address 224.0.1.1 from ip address 192.168.1.103

767609
packets	multicast
i m wondering if there s a way to either configure ntpd on b to be able to do that or to have something that parses the multicast packets from a and either gives me a correct timestamp or the time difference between a and b

767611
rtp	sip
for sip protocol asterisk use port described in sip.conf default 5060 and for rtp data use ports described in rtp.conf default 10000-20000

i ve been running 64-bit versions of windows 7 and ubuntu or centos linux under vmware for a while

767649
ethernet	wireless
basically your mac s wireless card is treated as a virtual ethernet switch by virtualbox

767671
google-chrome	firefox
i could ping websites and nslookup was able to resolve names to addresses but neither google-chrome firefox nor ie could load any webpages

767687
put	get
in order to get some benefit from the expenditure i though i would put in faster components and for future-proofing went for recently released ones msi z87-g41-pcmate and intel i3-4130 with 4400 hd graphics

767693
stdout	stderr
i don t know if it will work since i don t know how windows deals with stderr stdout but it might work

767718
ethernet	wireless
i just created a wireless network using connectify and used my static ip ethernet as source for internet

767753
folder	directory
browse to that folder and then copy and paste all the files into platform-tools directory

767772
disk	ram
i have tried several things to try to pinpoint the problem such as reseating the ram and the hard drives error checking the disk under disk properties running a memory check verifying all the drivers installed have signitures updating to the latest nvidia driver updating to the latest inf driver and making sure i am running the most recent bios version

767927
installation	upgrade	installation	downgrade
i improvised and deleted all partitions by using gparted thinking that windows 7 was causing the problem because it can t downgrade that as an upgrade so now all partitions except system reserved are unallocated i re-entered the setup and went through all the way up until i need to choose the destination drive of the installation there i found it doesn t recognize any hdd drives only the usb i m booting from

767942
ssid	wlan	vlan	wlan
trying to segregate wlan clients based on vlan ssid but i can t use multiple ports on dd-wrt router

768010
google-chrome	safari
for me the safari javascript console seems to be a bit better than google-chrome on a mac for debugging angularjs module loading errors -

768015
google-chrome	firefox
for instance i have connection to the internet through the browsers firefox google-chrome ...

768042
children	parent
i m interested in sorting a section of fstab whatever is mounted under x in such a way that parent are mounted before its children

768048
virtualbox	parallels
where you might run into trouble is with applications that require product activation like adobe products applications that install kernel extensions like parallels or virtualbox and mac os s built-in apps

768085

can the ubuntu linux nvidia xserver powermizer feature use dpms to trigger power saving mode in my acer lcd

768115
debian	linux
i ve just installed kali linux debian in a virtualbox vm

768122
packets	multicast
multicast and broadcast which 802.11 treats like a special case of multicast is very expensive on wi-fi networks because multicast packets aren t acked because it would be an ack storm so the packets have to be sent at a lowest-common-denominator packets rate that everyone on the network can reliably receive and that means that it s quite often the lowest data rate the band can handle which for 2.4ghz is the old 1mbps rate from 802.11-1997 predates even 802.11b

768122
arp	dhcp
that is the data rate of your video multicast plus the mean aggregate data rate of things like bonjour upnp netbios name service arp dhcp etc

768130
filesystems	ntfs
you can put the webservers document root the directory that is served by the webserver htdocs on the windows ntfs filesystems

768130
filesystems	ntfs	ubuntu	linux
you can serve files from there in windows and linux ubuntu can mount ntfs filesystems

768188
mouse	keyboard
there is no keyboard command that i know of but you can use the mouse

768198
tunnel	vpn
you could always tunnel the remote desktop connection through ssh if you have ssh access through the proxy or set up a vpn from pc1 pc2

768203
mp4	h.264
the format of the input video is mp4 h.264 encoding afaicr

768217
unix	solaris
unison runs on both windows and many flavors of unix solaris linux os x etc. systems

768219
mouse	keyboard
every couple seconds the mouse or the keyboard will stop working entirely then come back

768253
mouse	keyboard
this is a programming mistake typical of somebody first-day-in-the-real-world that i can t believe has existed for years now no mass outrage also shows how few use the keyboard aka those people who do everything at a snail s pace with the mouse but don t get me started on that

768253
google-chrome	firefox
one last comment this is not a firefox google-chrome ie problem

768308

where it matters also put stdin stdout and stderr in binary mode

768507
robocopy	xcopy
should i use xcopy robocopy powershell

768543
switching	screens
my dv9000 laptop screens won t come on due to this switching and i want to replace it

768543
switching	screens
i was going to let this go but having the screens turn on fine after all this time then go back to the not-powering-up state leads me to believe this problems has to do with the screens open close on off switching

768559
dns	spf
add your ip address to your dns entry for spf

768579
ubuntu	debian
most usb devices don t have the necessary driver s for os x to toggle monitor mode on so you ll be better off using some form of nix aka debian kali ubuntu where you can use open source drivers to get monitor mode going wit the usb device -- virtualization works great for this

768588
notepad	scite
for example notepad is not but my other text editor scite is

768599
mp3	flac
in vlc is it possible to make it so that for files that are just music mp3 flac specifically are played and the video part of the screen is the song title album artist

768605
google-chrome	firefox
you have ubuntu s software center the windows 8 marketplace the itunes store google play even individual software like google-chrome firefox all have new features focused entirely on ease of finding and installing new software that it s almost expected

768621
ethernet	wireless
t bridge wifi and ethernet because wireless disconnects when i connect ethernet cable also there is a microsoft kb article somewhere that says it sometimes doesn t work when the wifi adapter doesn t support promiscuous mode

768625
centos	linux
i was installing centos linux distro in vmware workstation 10 when i stuck across the issue as to use which networking option to get my work done

768647
virus	botnet
seems likely that your university network is blocking access to some botnet or virus that s on your computer and your home network isn t...so you connect at home and whatever it is beats your network and computer to death

768648
pop-up	dialog
restart your computer that should do it you will have to re-set some preferences back to the way you had it for me it was the energy saver settings and my monitor setup you should not get the pop-up dialog box saying â œ there is a problem connecting to the server â

768658
ubuntu	linux
well the scenario is that i have a windows machine at home and a linux box running headless ubuntu server without gui on a remote location

768667
mouse	keyboard
how do the monitor keyboard and mouse use the virtual machine without a host machine

768667
mouse	keyboard
is there some kind of very cheap hardware one can buy which the monitor keyboard and mouse connect to then that hardware connects to the server via wifi or how would this work

768671
mouse	keyboard
you can afford you not a virtual machines but real evironment with graphical user interface with mouse and keyboard working separately for every connected client

768671
ubuntu	linux
if you run linux on your server you will find a free software called freenx here is the documentation from ubuntu

768673
mouse	keyboard
the workstations consist of a monitor keyboard and a mouse

768686
google-chrome	firefox
use firefox or google-chrome or open your internet options local intranet security tab on each machine and

768691
switching	screens
switching between the normal and full screens mode

768700
ubuntu	linux
the situation is the following one i connect to my raspberry pi from my ubuntu linux 12.04 using ssh

768797
button	checkbox
visual themes or styles are fancy graphical renderings of the windows interface chrome borders as well as controls like button radio button checkbox scrollbars etc.

768797
switching	screens
however turning off themes only affects what is actually displayed on screens so if it is set for a fullscreen program windows turns themes off but you canâ t see it because the program is fullscreen but if you press alt + tab to switching to the desktop it will turn them back on and then off again when you switching back to the program

768801
debian-based	ubuntu
it s possible my semi-satisfactory solution will work on ubuntu since both are debian-based

768811
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome on linux does not complain though and firefox on the same windows 8 machine does not complain either

768811
google-chrome	firefox
i imported the ca certificate correctly in both google-chrome on windows which uses the windows internal certificate store and google-chrome on linux and firefox on windows which has its own certificate store

768811

in firefox on windows and google-chrome on linux i can check the certificate for the browser and it correctly lists all the details from the certificate

768875
mouse	keyboard
i m trying to use a dell mouse and keyboard via a single usb port using the usb splitter hub but the devices seem to misbehave

768875
mouse	keyboard
but generally the output of a usb port must be maximum 500ma and my mouse only needs 100ma and the keyboard 50ma at most

768876
mouse	keyboard
between the hub ic the keyboard and mouse something is bringing the voltage down enough for it not to work

768876
mouse	keyboard
that said i ve had more flash drive wireless mouse keyboard on a cheap 1 dollar usb hub and it worked

768936
udp	tcp
i think i have successfully forwarded tcp and udp ports but any help in how to set that as well would be very much apprecated

768960
wan	lan
assuming each router is nat has its own static wan ip and is hooked to the modem the lan side of each router is independent and can use the same private ranges.

768992
folder	directory
this would place the shared folder in user s home directory

769007
vpn	lan
the purpose of this vpn service is to provide a private lan where players can connect to the vpn and view the lan server list to connect to servers servers obviously have to be connected to the vpn also

769010
opera	google-chrome
new opera is automatically saving your filled data the way google-chrome does

769017
ubuntu	debian
i maintain several headless virtualbox guests on my laptop ubuntu host ubuntu debian windows guests

769030
ubuntu	linux
i prefer linux ubuntu for this

769096
daemons	systemd
it could for instance connect a local socket on the server to an ssh daemons running on the embedded systemd so you would then ssh to the localhost but on a different port number and it would forward that connection through to the embedded systemd

769096
tunnel	vpn
my favourite would be to use the vpn though as it opens up a whole new world of possibilities not just a single ssh tunnel

769096
ubuntu	debian

770128
mouse	keyboard
the keyboard will work most of the time but the mouse jerks around and is slow to react when clicking the buttons

770128
mouse	keyboard
the point of the dock is so that i can just plug a single cable in everything just works keyboard mouse network monitor printer

mouse	keyboard
everything else works except the keyboard and mouse

770150
scatter	graphing
so want to plot these as scatter line graphing on the x y axis

770487
cpu	hyperthreading
...7003.38 mhz with two cpu cores enabled and hyperthreading

770487
cpu	hyperthreading
does disabling some cpu cores disabling hyperthreading or thermal throttle for amd cpus really increase system stability especially when overclocking

770493
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome and firefox are working as expected - split second

770493
google-chrome	firefox
ps. i have my own local dns server s so i first thought that google-chrome and firefox might use other dns servers directly and thats the cause - but even if i completely disable my own dns servers reset the cache and provide the google-dns directly the issue is present

770498
ethernet	wireless
you might be able to use an ethernet wifi bridge google if you absolutely need wireless access - this can be a dedicated device or a computer of some sort set up appropriately

770518
mouse	keyboard
i have a mac and pc that i need to share the usb keyboard and mouse connections with

770518

will i need to buy two usb switches or are there creative ways i can share the keyboard and mouse via usb with one switch

770539
mouse	keyboard
leave the monitors directly connected to the computers and use the kvm switch for the keyboard and mouse only

770539
mouse	keyboard
plug both the keyboard and mouse into a small usb splitter and you ll only need one switch

770553
versioning	upgrade
i had another similar problem because of my third party firewall it was working well on xp but not on 7 i had to upgrade to a newer versioning

770565
ftp	telnet
the whole thing is made more complicated by the fact that the program is running on an embedded linux with absolute minimal tool support there s no ssh or ftp even only telnet to connect to it

770612
stdout	stderr
if you don t remember -u for python you can always prefix a command with stdbuf in coreutils already installed to set stdin stdout stderr to unbuffered line buffered or block buffered as desired

770654
redhat	fedora	debian	centos	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	centos
if you don t have it installed install it with sudo yum install lshw redhat fedora centos or sudo apt-get install lshw debian ubuntu etc

770699
windows	winpe
another method of backing up is to use a winpe disk dism and capture wim files of your windows partitions

770743
google-chrome	firefox
ms ie likes to follow all security rules where firefox and google-chrome does not

770772

debian	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	linux
the commands you ve given are for debian based linux systems such as debian and ubuntu and are not putty specific as rich pointed out

770864
redhat	fedora	centos	linux
centos is built from redhat fedora linux so its commands will differ

770864

mouse	keyboard
i m using the sculpt keyboard and i just updated the microsoft mouse and keyboard center hoping that it would fix the problem

770983
mouse	keyboard
i know that i can disable page up down in microsoft mouse and keyboard center but it won t let me to configure single tap for middle click

770990
folder	directory
as for not having all of the files being located in the root of the drive the same directory structure that you use in the google drive folder on your local machine will be synced to the drive

770990
folder	directory
so if you place all of your source code and temp files in a folder of their own and then place that folder in the google drive folder that same directory structure will be found in drive online

770991
cvs	svn
personally i recommend cvs svn mercurial and git

771046
folder	directory
i came up with one simple idea - create a bootable os disk first then create a new directory on it called files or something like this and store my files within it - should work but will create chaos like xx files in top pendrive directory and then everything else deeper in my folder

771048
debian	linux
i ve installed the guest additions on my debian linux virtual machine

771065
stdout	fflush
this will fflush stdout and also disable buffering

771138
windows	winpe
normally loaded windows keeps track of settings to registry while the one loaded through minint ie winpe does not

771153
debian	linux
make sure dkms is installed in the guest os following command for debian linux

771162
disk	ram
sudden hard disk usage increase on c is due to the system transferring back into ram everything that was transferred to the pagefile to make space for that 5 gb working set

771162
gentoo	linux
i now use gentoo linux as my main os and only use windows to play games

771195
mouse	keyboard
i have unplugged everything from the computer except the monitor keyboard and mouse

771214
disk	ram
you start the os you allow the users to do everything they want to do but you write these changes to ram or a temporary folder on disk

771218
screens	tablet
firefox provides feature responsive design view to view how websites look on different screens sized devices such as mobile phone and tablet

771239
ubuntu	linux
assuming there is a windows linux machine with a monitor available on the same network you can login into this ubuntu device using vnc and get a gui or ssh it if you prefer the command line

771308
filesystems	ntfs
names are stored in your filesystems s metadata tables the specifics depend on your exact filesystems but the mft is the ntfs table

771320
dpkg	apt
i would prefer to do this using either dpkg or apt but if another tool or combination of tools is required i am willing to install that tool

771362
wan	lan
if your landlord is broadcasting 5ghz you could take your 5ghz radio and connect it to that network and set the mode to wan client - dhcp. then with your 2.4ghz radio simply set it up like you normally would with a lan - infrastructure model

771364
post	get
though on this post on overclock.net the picture clearly shows it is possible and the user there managed to get the heat down after cleaning

771376
google-chrome	firefox
there is a firefox google-chrome add-on called i don t care about cookies that will help you to remove these warnings from many thousands of as it says infected websites

771393
hash	md5
where md5 is sort of not ok is if you use as stored password hash

771393
hash	md5
however if a hacker gets a list of accounts with these hash they may be able to generate a password that when put through md5 generates the same hash this is called a hash collision

771393
hash	md5
i m not sure how any of this works really just that it with md5 hash collisions are possible and easier than they ve been in the past

771459
put	get
no matter what setting i put the mtu at on the firewall 512 was the max that i could get through without fragmentation

771467
ubuntu	linux
you may alternatively use a boot cd of ubuntu or whatever other flavor of linux that

771472
wan	lan
usually an ap wireless router with guest ssid functionality needs to be the nat gateway at the head of your network so that the network out its wan port is the public internet not another segment of your lan

771472
wan	lan
they work by making sure the guest ssid traffic can get out the wan port but not to its own lan ports or main ssid

771472
wan	lan
but if you have another segment of your home lan out its wan port those devices will be accessible to the guests just like anything else on the internet

771472
tunnel	lan	tunnel	vlan
all of apple s airport base stations that support guest networks which means all the simultaneous dual band equipment which means all extremes and time capsules since 2009 or so as well as the 2012 airport express can now as of a firmware update in 2012 or 2013 support guest network extension where remote units in place of your e1200 is can publish a guest network and tunnel it in a vlan to the main unit in place of your at t u-verse 2wire box to make sure the guest network traffic gets out to the internet without being able to access the lan devices in between

771472
wan	lan
to use that you d want to configure your 2wire box to just act as a transparent modem nat off dhcp service off wireless off and have your airport extreme s wan port plugged in as the only thing on the 2wire box s lan port

771514
mouse	keyboard
then the timeout for default os ends ubuntu loads and for a few seconds i can see on the scree somthing like so it seems the signal from the keyboard somehow works but i can u use it in bios grub os - only usb keyboard mouse works

771551
wan	lan
the tp-link td-w8960n allows a lan ethernet port to be configured as a wan port

771592
vmware	virtualbox
another option if this is for testing purposes is to virtualize the system image in a virtual desktop like vmware workstation or oracle virtualbox

771628
centos	linux
when i run a centos linux vm on virtualbox in headless mode the cpu continuously spikes up to about 80 for a couple of seconds at a time with a short 1 or 2 second gap and then does it again

771629
x86	64bit
for completeness you could run both x86 and x64 on a 64bit windows machine

771815
wan	lan
what i d like to do is be able to share files on the same wlan lan but still use our separate wan internet connection. id love to be able to combine our internet connections too but from what i ve read that s not gonna happen with the hardware we have

771818
vpn	ssid
my suggestion would be to start a ftp server of the files that you wish to share and share them over the internet as far as i know without dual radios ssid s and some crazy setup or a vpn which would be over the internet there is no better way

771824
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	opera	safari	opera	firefox	opera	google-chrome	firefox	safari
use it to debug traffic from virtually any application that supports a proxy like ie google-chrome safari firefox opera and more

771826
google-chrome	firefox
search your browser s plugin repository for live http headers link goes to google-chrome plugin - here is firefox here is one for ie

771830
udp	tcp
another quick hack giving windows an example but any network filesystem will do is to have one person set up a windows share use dyndns or share your ip address with your friend and open udp and tcp ports 445 i think

771854
cpu	processors
i m thinking it might be better to offload the encryption to the ssd by using the evo s encryption option so that the processors doesn t have to do any encryption this might be better for i o performance and give the cpu a breather

771869
ubuntu	debian
i was attempting to multi-boot windows 8 debian fedora and ubuntu

i suspect that using a 32-bit windows 7 vm does not have any benefits regarding the ram and disk space usage in my case - as every 32-bit memory address of the vm would be mapped onto a 64-bit memory address of the host

as you can see there s not any noticeable difference between the different fonts and even with or without hinting however the only thing that jumps into sight is the difference of the startup times between the gnome-terminal and the xfce4-terminal where gnome is 554 slower than xfce but in normal circumstances this is negligible

host-multicast router communication is handled by icmp or mld which both serves just to the purpose of multicast router having an actual database of which local host wants which multicast packets

772390
packets	multicast
given the fact no-one has to subscribe to the ip multicast group to be able to send packets to it this is pretty hard thing to do not even mentioning how dynamic the enviroment is and on the top of it multicast group addresses have no hierarchic inner structure to help you route they can t by principle

i have many more images on the mobile phone which i do not want to import for example mp3 album art images or images from other applications but the camera stored in many different directory out of the dcim folder

773408

i think it has nothing to do with the images but with the software used to view them - both formats png bmp are raster graphics

ubuntu	linux
i started with windows hosting ubuntu in vmware player which worked fairly well certainly great if you are primarily doing visual studio development and merely occasionally need some linux only package or whatever

773522
ubuntu	linux
as i switched to primarily linux development lots of as3 in intellij and some node + python with only occasional need for windows asp.net site i flipped that around to ubuntu hosting a virtualbox using a disk2vhd - .vdi of my old windows disk

773522
vmware	virtualbox
after a fair amount of fiddling i m fairly happy with this given the split of work i generally have but if you re doing any serious amount of visual studio you probably want windows hosting linux either virtualbox or vmware should be fine

it seems the virtualbox port transfer mechanism didn t work since i could ssh to localhost in my mint machine so i don t think it s the problem of the ssh i installed. the port transfer mechanism worked well with my ubuntu machines

774021

since find doesn t output anything on success any error is sent to stderr and the output stored into result is only what s sent to stdout we redirect stderr to stdout to capture the error on then you can check wether is empty success or not there was an error

ubuntu	mint
before installation run try ubuntu mint or whatever and check which one suits your video requests

784693
disk	ram
this seems to take all the available ram of the system to buffer disk data you can monitor this in activity monitor too

784711
sudo	passwd
putting the passwd into .profile is a very bad idea and it is the reason why su sudo ssh and the like don t support reading the passwd from a file

784733
ubuntu	linux
you can use ubuntu kali linux etc

784736
putty	winscp
why can putty successfully perform ssh tasks while winscp nor filezilla can t

784744
portrait	landscape
i have document with two sheets sheet1 and sheet2 and i want set orientation of sheet1 to portrait and orientation of sheet2 to landscape

784744

784761
mouse	keyboard
you can prevent mouse interaction with keyboard maestro s app switcher

784791
ssd	sata
i ve entered bios and set my ssd as the first and only boot option in all instances i had to detach the old disks since there was only 1 sata cable in the computer every time

784794
disk	ram
if your ram banks are ok and the problem is of software nature you could try with yumi boot usb creator and boot repair disk to fix windows startup problems

784803
filesystems	ntfs
windows uses non case-sensitive filesystems ntfs thus it doesn t matter which way you refer to its files

784827
folder	directory
the reason for disallowing each user to read other user files is that some users have their own config.php files which contain sensitive information whereas some users dislike the ideas of others being able to see the file structure and source code of their content-management systems therefore i m trying to create system where the user has access to their home directory as the top-level folder

784832
post	put
i ll need to put in more research time before accepting my own answer but i thought i d post what i think it is

784840
ubuntu	linux
docker.io on the other hand is the name of the package that you install in your linux os ubuntu

784869
ftp	telnet
connect to server1 using something like ssh telnet or one of the remote copy utils or set up an ftp server and point it to your home folder

784891

785052
hash	md5
how can i make a download an image md5 hash the image and save that image with the md5 hash as name to a directory using wget

785070
vpn	lan
what i d like is a vpn client router or server that accepts all lan traffic and sends it through a vpn server

785102
jobs	cron
cron jobs run in a very minimal environment and since they re executed directly by crond without a shell unless you force one to be created the regular shell setup never happens

785110
vpn	lan
if you want to route all traffic from your lan through vpn it is easier than routing selected network traffic

785116
wan	lan
otherwise the wan connection remains disconnected although the internal lan works

785135
opera	google-chrome
why in google-chrome ie 11 and opera it plays fine

785144
ubuntu	linux
also try linux live distros like ubuntu live

785156
stdout	stderr
then make the program print the menu to stderr and the choice to stdout for example like this

785208
norton	mcafee	norton	rootkit
some of the hardest ones to detect and remove are boot sector mbr viruses and rootkit which can hide from even well-known and trusted scanners like mcafee and norton

785213
bash	tcsh
contrast this to other shells i ve worked with like in un x bash tcsh etc where the command interpreter first expands all the pattern matches and passes the full file list to the command

785237
vim	emacs
you would have to allow them to sudo vi and sudo vim and sudo nano and sudo emacs and sudo pico et cetera

785269
packets	multicast
i only recieve broadcast and multicast packets

785315
opera	google-chrome
it is a completely different program contains no old opera code and is based on the google-chrome codebase

785324
cpu	processors
since processors and motherboard are different so you have to reinstall the os again to boot from hdd so that proper driver for cpu and motherboard could load

785326
ubuntu	linux
ideal solution would be to image that drive in its original pc using a livecd distro of linux for example ubuntu or partedmagic

785362
debian	linux
i tried how to make emacs open all buffers in one window debian linux gnome s answer s suggestion

785392
ethernet	wireless
i cannot figure out why it doing this only if i am connected through the ethernet adapter and not through wireless

785416
ubuntu	linux
broadly speaking if you need to install ubuntu or any other linux distribution on a computer with a 32-bit efi and no bios csm legacy-mode boot support the way to do it is

785417
ubuntu	opensuse
must use opensuse 13.1 i might be able to stretch that to ubuntu

785521
ssl	https
i also tried https ssl sites and it didn t redirect

785531
h.265	hevc
ffmpeg supports encoding hevc h.265 since 2014-2-12 with libx265

785531
h.265	hevc
current h.265 hevc encoders are

785534
h.265	hevc	h.264	hevc	h.264	h.265
h.265 also known as hevc is the successor to the popular h.264 video codec which is supposed to improve its performance by 50 and more

785575
vmware	virtualbox
you re not using vmware you re using virtualbox

785600
trojan	virus
i uploaded the file to virustotal.com and its analysis said that 28 out of 53 signature databases report it is infected with a trojan virus so it is very likely infected

785619
spaces	delimiter
for example i have a list of mac addresses which may be formatted with one of three delimiter colon dash spaces or no delimiter at all

to conclude the solution provided here doesn t work as there is no powershell directory in the windows azure folder

785724
mouse	keyboard
i prefer to keep the hands on the keyboard rather than grab the mouse

785726
robocopy	xcopy
robocopy is the successor to xcopy

785731
rbenv	homebrew
homebrew is system centric and you probably won t be able to install rvm rbenv in user mode with that

785749
mouse	keyboard
i am looking for a way to disable a windows pc for x minutes every y minutes 15 minutes every 1 hour for example where the pc is disabled frozen or the keyboard mouse frozen for an interval and at the end of the interval becomes operable again and to repeat this regiment in a loop throughout the time the software is activate - 45 mins on for example followed by 15 minute freeze for example

785767
mouse	keyboard
using autohotkey write a small script that opens device manager and disables the keyboard and mouse under human interface devices - you will also need to write a script to switch them back on

785891
tunnel	lan
i am working on a microcontroller project where i need a ethernet internet access so is there a way i can connect my project to the internet by somehow tunnel the connection through my desktop lan port

785897
spaces	delimiter
body with tokens delimiter by commas and or spaces

785935
ethernet	wireless
ethernet cable is plugged into the computer on one end and into the wan port of the wireless router on the other

785986
mouse	keyboard
i am looking to switch my keyboard and mouse between a desktop computer and a laptop

786028
folder	directory
the backups directory also has other folder to organize the server and type of the backups

786039
tunnel	vpn
i ve also tried creating a pptp vpn tunnel between my upstairs computer and the downstairs router - and this does inexplicably gives me the full bandwidth i would expect

786067
cpu	processors
i said similar because the exe name for that service is wmpntwk.exe not wmplayer.exe and the cpu usage peaks at 100 or less depending on the processors when you login not when you start to play something

786126
cpu	irq
cpu 4 usr 2 sys 0 nic 92 idle 0 io 0 irq 0 sirq

786126
cpu	irq
cpu 3 usr 2 sys 0 nic 89 idle 0 io 0 irq 3 sirq

786146
hex	binary
the patch can be applied with any hex editor open the chrome.dll search for ff15c0d77103 binary code shown as hex string then replace the string with 585833c09090 again the actual binary code encoded as hex

786163
filtering	grouping
i don t think you will be able to do this with a pivot table as the filtering is not that advanced on the grouping items

786208
ubuntu	linux

786295
mouse	keyboard
after reboot i can t use my usb keyboard or usb mouse to press ctrl+alt+del

786324
truecrypt	umount
i used disk utility to umount the blank volume and tried truecrypt again however the moment after i enter my volume password the drive re-mounts and truecrypt says the device is busy

786325
x86	64bit
that means the program will be installed under c program files x86 example program on a 64bit machine

786325
x86	64bit
i think a possible solution would be to ask for the machine type 32 64bit and decide whether programfiles or programfiles x86 should be used with an if-clause

786328
folder	directory
it can then be executed through the windows command prompt cmd.exe like this c python27 python.exe c directory containing the .py file jpeg_corrupt.py c directory of folder to be scanned

786328
gif	png
it should scan all jpg gif and png images in the specified directory and all of its subdirectories

786328
gif	png
1 answer in stack overflow - how do i programmatically check whether an image png jpeg or gif is corrupted

786355
folder	directory
however this is assuming that there is only one profile folder in the directory

786373
switching	screens	mouse	keyboard
we have 4 computers controlled by an kvm-over-ip switching so we can remotely control the keyboard and the mouse and can see the screens

786374
filesystems	hfs+
i ran the command fdisk -l to find out what my external drive is formatted to i found out it s uses gpt partitions and the filesystems is hfs+

786417
vim	emacs
as long as i use text editors that open in the terminal emacs vim my keyboard is decently recognised and i can t really complain about it

786444
disk	ram
adding folders in filesnottobackup didn t work with the first partition 270 gib of data took 2 hours to backup so i made some tests on a small ram disk 150mb and the only thing that worked is to add the folder s full path in filesnottosnapshot

786451
subnet	packets
in your case both source and destination ip address are in the same subnet so the destination is directly reachable and the packets is thus delivered directly without router involvement

786497
ffmpeg	libav
by the way libav packages in deb-multimedia are from ffmpeg proper while those packages in debian are from the libav fork

786512
google-chrome	firefox
type 192.168.0.1 in your web-browser google-chrome firefox internet explorer

786523
google-chrome	firefox
i ve tested with the most recent versions of google-chrome 36.0.1985.125 firefox 31 and ie 11

786523
disk	ram
i looked into task manager and i noticed that my ram usage is about 8-9gb mostly because of 2 databases and my ide running and my disk queue length is constantly 1

debian	linux
i am looking for a way to send a serial break from a shell script in the debian linux that comes default on a raspberry pi without needing any additional software to be downloaded or compiled

786547
mouse	keyboard
from what i understand bios is a set of programs on the system rom that the cpu uses to control certain hardware keyboard mouse speakers etc. the southbridge used to contain the various hardware controllers that would talk to the system rom but now the southbridge is integrated into the cpu

786554
google-chrome	firefox
is there an extension for google-chrome firefox or any other software that can basically record the user s session with a webpage from the client perspective

786557
subtract	add
take the travel time divide it by two subtract fifteen minutes and add it to the departure time

786649
post	get
i ve read some conflicting post so hopefully i can get a clear answer

786657
ubuntu	opensuse
in fact i now completely removed opensuse and i have ubuntu because it s the only thing that worked for me

786675
bash	zsh
zsh is running properly but there are syntax differences between bash and zsh for displaying the prompt

786684
disk	ram
yes because the operating system can use the extra ram as disk cache which speeds up access to data on disk

786684
disk	ram
extra ram won t make cpu-bound computations not involving much disk i o faster though

786707
tunnel	vpn
to overcome this clients first create an ssh tunnel to the server then connect to the vpn over that

786707
tunnel	vpn
i give my clients a script that tunnel their localhost 8080 to myserver 40001 then connects to the vpn

786707
tunnel	vpn
their client openvpn configuration has remote set to localhost 8080 such that the vpn connection is directed over this ssh tunnel

786707
tunnel	vpn
when it fails the client will connect to the vpn but will be unable to access the internet and after about 30-40 seconds the ssh tunnel process will simply end opening the tunnel manually yields only write error broken pipe when it dies

786707
tunnel	vpn
my suspicion is that my iptables rules are such that incoming connections directly to the vpn are accommodated but connections to the vpn coming from inside the server itself due to the ssh tunnel are treated differently

786707
tunnel	vpn
when the client runs the vpn all traffic â including that of the ssh tunnel itself â is routed over it

786718
disk	ram
the hard disk can not even come close to the speed of ram being that ram is directly accessed by the cpu depending on bus speeds

786718
disk	ram
chkdsk maxing out ram to speed up caching in turn speeds up performance and disk checking time so in this case more does in fact faster.

786759
ethernet	wireless
in that case you should let your wireless adapter with a gateway and your ethernet without one

786759
ethernet	wireless
you ll need to either increase the priority with a lower number of your wireless adapter or lower the priority with a higher number of your ethernet adapter or both

786764
wan	vlan
put each wifi router into a seperate vlan and tell your edge router to channel traffic from these vlans over the additional wan ips

786772
versioning	upgrade
even though ssh was already installed in my case it wasn t pulled in for updating when i ran apt-get update apt-get upgrade and so the system still had the same ssh binaries with the now-outdated libraries linked against it hence the versioning mismatch

786777
sudoers	visudo
then to use sudo remotely you need to configure something else in the sudoers file on that machine with visudo

786814
vmware	virtualbox
you could then create an iso file of the hdd using a tool like this and then run the iso through vmware virtualbox

786839

apologies in advance if this is the incorrect forum i wasn t sure if i should post it here or stackoverflow or dba stackexchange please do not punish me with downvotes just let me know if i should get it moved elsewhere

786920
opera	firefox
i just made the switch from opera to firefox and one of the features i liked in opera was a menu which showed the last tabs closed in order

786931
post	get
note that you have to click on activate the post first to get this menu option

786932
spaces	delimiter
in this case i just used spaces as delimiter though that could be improved

786939
gedit	nano	vim	gedit
i ve been unable to write to a file in vim previously when i shouldn t so i guess the real heart of my question is how can i make a file unedit-able by vim and why isn t it based on file system permissions like i d expect and what mechanism is vim using to edit the file that other editors gedit nano can t use

786974
portrait	landscape
i looked up a method of opening multiple files in separate instances of ms excel as i have both a landscape oriented and portrait oriented monitor and need to use both

786984
ubuntu	linux
linux ubuntu 14.04

787006
folder	directory
it supports groups and users so depending on what you d like to do you can either set each computer up as a user to have separate root directory to sync to or have one account with folder for computer1 through computer5

787009
debian	linux
i m trying to download all of the server files from google cloud compute running linux debian

787013
openvpn	iptables
i haven t done anything to my the default firewall rules except open a port for ssh from the wan and add the rules for openvpn as defined in this tutorial but i m concerned that i have left more ports open than intended because of the output iptables -l

787016

i just switched from safari to google-chrome canary on osx in order to have a 64bit browser

787026
debian	linux
i m using debian linux with x11 and dwm as a window manager

787037
terminate	timeout
came back to find the putty session had timeout terminate become inactive

787052
spyware	antivirus
its targeted more towards malware adware and spyware but it has respectable antivirus capabilities as well

787052
antivirus	rootkit
with that said here is the basics of what software you need to protect yourself a firewall service can be a substitute or in addition to router firewall or you can just use the router firewall but i reccomend an extra layer of protection antivirus anti-spyware anti-adware and some sort of rootkit detector and removal tool

787063
tunnel	vpn
it should not set up tunnel interfaces or anything like that it should just bind a specified port and talk socks5 on that port and forward only proxied traffic over the vpn

787084
folder	directory
does moving files between two folder on a single remote nfs server redirect the files through the client or does the server simply adjust it s directory structure

maybe you can just hide the folder using hidden system attributes and selecting not to show hidden or system files in folder options

787966
mouse	keyboard
i turned my computer off and came back to it a couple of days later to find that the keyboard and mouse are not working in windows

787966
mouse	keyboard
to see if this was a windows problem i checked to see if the keyboard and mouse still work in the bios and they do perfectly

787966
mouse	keyboard
but when windows boots up during the windows loading logo screen the keyboard and mouse lights suddenly all turn off then the login screen appears and suddenly only some of the keyboard buttons light up faintly as if the keyboard is getting power but not enough

787966
mouse	keyboard
connecting and disconnecting the mouse or the keyboard to a different usb port i tried usb2 and usb3 makes windows try to install or search

also you can try remove all non existing keyboard mouse devices with following commands

788060
sudo	passwd
initrd makes use of fstab crypttab to decide what is needed prior to mount and to prompt for luks passwd on boot sudo update-initramfs -u -k all note you can recreate all initrds using sudo update-initramfs -c -k all but i didn t try that to be sure.

788065
content-disposition	content-type
the problem seems to be the content-type http header if it does not contain a charset value ie simply shows a blank page unless you have a content-disposition header in which case ie offers you to save the xml

788082
google-chrome	safari
safari and google-chrome report invalid certificates on certain https sites for example github and bitbucket

788111
google-chrome	safari
it seems that somehow google-chrome and safari for that account are using an expired root certificate even though a new one is already present in your system roots

788115
filesystems	fat
to solve that you obviously need a better permission system than a fat filesystems provides

788115
filesystems	fat
the fat filesystems is mounted normally and not accessible at all for the user

788115
filesystems	fat
the permissions are handled by a filesystems that stores it s files just as files on the fat filesystems - but can implement additional features like a permission system

788119
ubuntu	debian
i m running debian but should work the same for ubuntu

788148
disk	ram
before you blame your disk drive you should look at the amount of ram you have

788148
disk	ram
in a healthy computer with lot s of ram a significant amount of it will be dedicated to a disk cache thus preventing re-read s of data

wan	lan
i have a ubiquiti edgerouter lite v1.4.1 currently configured to have 1 wan port and 2 bridged lan ports

788235
wan	lan
i say bridged because the ubiquiti routers do not come configured out of the box you must manually set up the 3 ethernet ports to be either wan or lan

788355
arp	tcp
based on your comment below if you want bypass disable the arp handling of the tcp ip stack then winpcap should let you do that

google-chrome	safari
like gecko google-chrome 36.0.1985.125 safari 537.36

788595

third - ram and cpu usage can be almost 0 this does not mean the the hard disk is not in use

788620
google-chrome	firefox
i don t have firefox or google-chrome installed

788636
wan	lan
at the moment both routers b and c are connected to router a via lan ports rather than their wan ports

788645
portrait	landscape
1- i almost always use the portrait orientation but the software always defaults to landscape

788681
filesystems	ntfs
ubuntu will show files and folders in ntfs fat32 filesystems which are hidden in windows

788696
ffmpeg	libvpx
the problem is that by default ffmpeg does not include libvpx

788701
cpu	hyperthreading
you may also have hyperthreading which then makes one each cpu appear as more than one logically

788724
wan	lan
if you only have one 64 prefix and that prefix is on your wan side then you can t do ipv6 for your lan

788724
wan	lan
if that 64 is on the wan interface then you ll never get decent ipv6 on your lan s

788946
folder	directory
appropriate folder for this new website in my server directory

788964
versioning	upgrade
after an os versioning upgrade i have the following strange problem

788964
versioning	upgrade
furthermore if i do it all from within tmux port works there as well so it might not be related to the versioning upgrade

788976
disk	ram
the software side of it is covered in other answers and boils down to the os chosing to use ram rather than disk

788984
ubuntu	linux
can someone explain me why a tool like partedmagic - which is also linux - can perfectly mount and use this drive and ubuntu 14.04 cannot

789035

wan	lan
typical wireless router which is connected to wan internet and its lan ip is 10.0.0.1

now i wanted wi-fi in another room say room number 102 in the first floor so i ran an ethernet cable from the switch in room 101 to room 102 and connected second wireless router

789074
post	get
through the api you can send http post get requests to utorrent which will enable you to remove a torrent when it s done

789076
bluetooth	usb
the iphone s personal hotspot wifi feature is useless as is bluetooth so how can i configure the pc to route its connection from usb to the network card

789076
ethernet	wireless
i have also looked into virtual router software but can t find any that works in vista or that routes to the ethernet port rather than wifi no wireless card in pc

789117
virtualbox	parallels
1 use a visualization software like virtualbox free or parallels paid but integrates better with osx to run windows within osx like another program

789122
mp3	flac
for converting flac to mp3 that would be

789123
range	max
2 use inexpensive powerline adapters so as to create an ethernet network over the power lines range varies depending on model but i believe max 300m or so

789174
vbscript	vba
however there is an advanced method of tricking vba into running multiple threads by generating vbscript files and executing them concurrently

789176
disk	ram
my problem is that it seems that linux just copies the least amount of data that is needed back into ram because when i m switching between applications there s a small delay until these are usable because they still have to be loaded from disk which is an hdd in my case which makes this delay quite noticeable

789218
mouse	keyboard
vnc is screen sharing with the option of using a client s input mouse keyboard etc on the server s screen with the server s controls still active

789238
zlib	libpng
i decided to compile my own versions of zlib and libpng

789246
min	max
for more info see this article effects of min and max server memory

789262
robocopy	xcopy
i m using xcopy to copy an entire folder we have some xp machines still so robocopy isn t an option

789266
folder	directory
if so adding a cd command to the start of the batch file to change directory into src should fix it or alternatively use an absolute path to folder instead of a relative one

789270
ubuntu	linux
i have windows 8.1 32-bit on my pc and i want to install kali linux 1.0.8 64-bit or ubuntu 14.04 64-bit on my pc my pc can run a 64-bit os

vmware	virtualbox
take some aspirin and get a copy of virtualbox or vmware fusion the latter is my preference

789294
wan	lan
i was wondering if i could send the wan connection into one of the rooms and then have the lan connection come back through the same wire

789297
mouse	keyboard
it doesn t have keyboard nor mouse but it is in reality a small task-specialized computer

789303
umount	btrfs	filesystems	btrfs
i would like to umount the filesystems at that point if that s not what btrfs does anyway and set an alarm

789304
ethernet	wireless
i am able to connect to the wireless network on another machine i can still connect with ethernet cable

789304
antivirus	norton
i use norton antivirus

789310
wan	lan
at that point you would have one connector that would be used for wan and another used for lan

789316
wan	lan
using a device called a router you can bridge a wan wide area network also known as the internet with a lan local area network

789350
mouse	keyboard
as soon as he plugged the flash drive into his computer his usb mouse and usb keyboard stopped working

789365
put	get
my current best idea is to get a long usb extension cable and put the key on a usb stick that s glued to the inside of the wall or something

789367
ubuntu	linux
check also bootnext utility which allows direct booting of linux ubuntu fedora from windows 7 8.1

789393
sorting	filtering
and then i d just use sorting filtering

789398
mouse	keyboard
use a kvm keyboard video mouse style switch

789398
mouse	keyboard
the dongle for the wireless receiver is used in one of the kvm keyboard mouse inputs

789415
vmware	virtualbox
the overall solution is to make an clean install of windows and the next time make the portable app inside a virtual machine like vmware or oracle virtualbox

789483
jobs	cron
the thing is that the jobs ran by cron do not take into account the settings and environment variables you have with your current user so you probably need to source the .bash_profile settings file for the user as a step prior to sending the email in your script

789493
ubuntu	linux
i am successfully able to install linux ubuntu 12.04 on the ssd using usb pen drive which has erased windows 7

789509
ubuntu	debian
for vpn connection you have kerio-vpn-client on debian ubuntu and windows

789516
folder	directory
so to the best of my knowledge that means only the git user is allowed to create files directory inside the cache folder

789556
ubuntu	centos
i m running centos as my primary desktop but i need to be able to use windows and ubuntu from time to time to test things on those

789559
ubuntu	centos
or if the windows machine is windows 8.1 look at adding the hyper-v role to that use windows 8.1 natively and run centos and ubuntu from there

789691
mouse	keyboard
ideally i d share one usb keyboard and mouse between the two computers

789751
folder	directory
i have pretty much gotten everything set up but i am trying to figure out how to get linux to auto mount network folder based on the active directory groups the user is in

789761
folder	dir
the end result is that attempting to run dir from the command-line on that folder will give you a access denied error because you are not allowed to list the contents of that folder

789785
put	get
however assuming that you don t need to see the entire screen your screen recorder just uses the part of gimp that is the canvas you could set up several colors using the pencil or paintbrush tool outside the visible area to create an actual virtual palette. it would then be as simple as pressing the o key to get the eyedropper tool then clicking on one of the colors you put out

789787
put	get
about the switch in the back of your computer it s used to change the voltage input now it s set on 115v the other option would be 220v 240v most countries use 220v 240v however you should not touch that switch as long as your pc is running because if you put the wrong value the power supply will get destroyed and maybe light up some fire some put protections though

opera	google-chrome
so i seem to be having this issue on a couple of sites now and only in google-chrome 36.0.1985.125 m and opera 23.0.1522.60

google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
firefox ie safari and even google-chrome canary are working as expected

i should mention that the kindle content folder i m referring to is a hidden folder located in the library directory which i have never touched before today

790068
ubuntu	linux
i was looking for a better way to get the most of a laptop on ubuntu or any linux distro

790083
wan	lan
assign wan port to switch optionally enable this to use the wan port as another lan port

790092
udp	tcp
you may try using tcpview an instrument by mark russinovich which displays despite its name open connections both tcp and udp

790101
folder	directory
select create shortcut this will create a replica of the file folder in the current directory

790109
logmein	hamachi
also check out openvpn and logmein hamachi as two good vpn softwares

790189
subnet	packets
when a device tries to send a packets to another network outside its subnet it will send the packets to the router so the router can forward the packets as needed this is a simplification

790200
cpu	affinity
what affinity lets you do is confine your cpu eating app to 7 8 cores so that everyone else is guaranteed access to a relatively unused cpu and you don t constantly have to deal with stuttering and interruptions to the usability of everything else on your computer while eclipse is grinding away

790216
versioning	upgrade	vmware	virtualbox
after searching for this error on the web i already upgrade to the latest versioning of vmware 6.0.3 on windows 8.1 and virtualbox 4.3.14 on ubuntu 14.04.1 inside vmware and i reduced the number of cpus in the vagrant virtualbox machine to 1 but the error still occurs sometimes after an hour or so and only when running the vagrant virtualbox inside the vmware

790230
multiplying	multiplication
you may know your multiplication tables up to 10x10 yet you probably have no problem performing 123x321 on a piece of paper you just break it into many small problems multiplying individual digits and taking care of the carry etc

790231
cpu	processors
however none of that matters with for example intel 32 bit processors and floating point as the floating point part of the cpu has its own registers and they are 80 bits wide

790245
128bit	64bit
32-bit 64bit and 128bit all refer to the word length of the processor which can be thought of as the fundamental data type

790245
128bit	64bit
this is the real key to 64bit and 128bit processors they allow us to handle larger numbers of bits in a single operation

790245
x86	64bit
in the alu on an x86 processor there is a hardware circuit to perform this for ieee 32-bit and 64bit floats

790262
width	height
if i adjust the width between the dev screen and the page with my mouse a number will appear giving the width and height of the window

the problem can neither be the dongle it works perfectly with mouse keyboard and whatever else bluetooth i could find or the headphones they work perfectly with the mobile phone tablet and got great reviews at the shop

dropbox	evernote	logmein	hamachi
i also have a number of other constantly-on apps -- for example xampp crashplan mcafee autohotkey evernote dropbox and logmein hamachi -- but i don t believe any of them have updated in the last few days

790470
notepad++	sublimetext
i d recommend ditching notepad and using notepad++ or sublimetext instead

790470
notepad++	sublimetext
they are comparable in many ways but notepad++ is free while sublimetext is not

790470
notepad++	sublimetext
sublimetext has a few features not in notepad++ but i d recommend trying out notepad++ first and seeing how you like it

there has been two occasions where i have accidentally chmod-ized 777 the whole direcotry of etc and it has forced me to come to the decision that i d be better off to do fresh installation of os linux - ubuntu 14.04 to be specific

790546
chown	chmod	chown	sudoers	chmod	sudoers
i am wondering if it is possible in removing chmod and chown specifically for only these two directories from sudoers meanwhile allowing files to be controlled by these functions

790566
ubuntu	linux
as you didn t include what os do you have it will be below explained how to do this in linux for example from ubuntu live cd

790578
wan	lan
what are the drawbacks that people use wan port over lan

790595
chown	chmod	chown	sudoers	chmod	sudoers
if sudoers explicitly allow chmod chown command you can achieve this by writing a wrapper script to do the chmod chown and allow this wrapper instead of raw commands

790597
google-chrome	safari
this appeared on both google-chrome and safari

790602
chgrp	chmod
also bob can always use chmod chgrp etc

790605
cifs	smb
might for example restricting untrusted users to sftp smb cifs nfs or webdav access work better in your use case

790608
rpm	yum
one of those tools is postgresql server however the company vpn is blocking yum and i ve been told that configuring yum to go through company proxy is too difficult and i ve got no authority ability to do it myself.thus i m basically stuck with downloading rpms manually transfer them over to the server through winscp and cross my fingers hoping that rpm -i will work

790659
filesystems	ntfs
to extend a basic volume it must either raw not formatted with a filesystems or it must be formatted with the ntfs filesystems

bluetooth	usb
this is probably because the bluetooth adapter in my desktop is powered by usb and per microsoft s implementation of the bluetooth protocol the usb root hub and controller handles the power states for connected devices

790931
bluetooth	usb
using the powercfg -lastwake command in a command prompt only tells me that the device that woke the computer was the usb root hub as it should be per microsoft s implementation of the bluetooth protocol

790950
ethernet	wireless
this seems to be a common confusion wireless client mode means your router is working as a full-fledged router except it is connecting to upstream via a wireless connection not an ethernet one

790950
wan	lan
it is rather clear that any program finding out that wan and lan belong to the same network 192.168.1.0 24 in your case will be utterly confused

790950

then go to the wireless setup page enable wireless choose in the drop-down menu the operating mode wireless ethernet bridge and then insert the name and password of your primary router s wireless network

centos	linux
i downloaded the latest openssl rpm for centos from linux packages search updated openssl and then managed to successfully install postgresql

791046
udp	tcp
you only need to add a rule to ufw allowing tcp udp both and it keeps until you delete it no matter if you reboot the server

791056
mouse	keyboard
i can get programs to stay open if i keep bashing keyboard and mouse randomly when the program loads that is really strange

792269

if that does not work make sure the keyboard mouse connections are good and try pressing buttons again

792269
mouse	keyboard
if that does not work try unplugging the keyboard mouse and plugging it back in again possibly in a different usb port also try a usb on the front if available if it is currently in the back

792269
mouse	keyboard
my reasoning for this is that it could be a bad keyboard mouse or maybe just the port s they are plugged in

792269
mouse	keyboard
it also would not hurt to try a different keyboard mouse

792271

kde	gnome
if your keypad is hooked up to a computer with a gui desktop based on gnome or kde autokey can be used to turn the keys into hotkeys which can do almost anything you can think of

792425
vmware	virtualbox
i would consider the use of virtualbox vmware to run a small machine for your vpn connection requirements so you can leave your main internet connection of your computer free of customizations

792441

sometimes when the download speed is really bad the mouse and keyboard are unresponsive

mouse	keyboard
so detach anything usb other than mouse and keyboard

792887
tunnel	vpn
i have setup my vpn client vpnc front end to use split tunnel

792910
packets	multicast
on the pi i have a python script that sends multicast packets about 50 bytes in size at a rate of 25hz

792910
packets	multicast
a netgear wnr2000 with the multicast packets coming from a visual c++ application running on a wince device connected via ethernet completely different than the setup used above

792915
udp	tcp
this would make sense as far as only affecting tcp traffic which requires a response while the udp traffic could never reach the target and simply be discarded without causing any issues

792917
hide	show
i am looking for a tweak to either a server or client such that it will hide messages that have arrived and not show them to the client user until a specific time - this can be for any client server and i am not looking for a full setup - assuming that i have a working server client that receives messages already but i simply don t want to see them until the specified time how where would i go about configuring it

792952
debian	linux
the vps is a linux vserver-based thing running 32 bit debian stable

792976
debian	mint
my icon appeared in the bottom right corner next to my printer utility debian so you may have to look for it if you aren t using mint

793040
filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	fat
depending on filesystems ntfs fat ext3 etc... there will be different metadata available for example windows owner and permission on ntfs

793040
filesystems	ntfs
all filesystems pre-allocate spaces to contain these metadata at the master file table mft for ntfs some other names for other filesystems which is not directly accessible by users

793120
google-chrome	firefox
2 change useragent for example to firefox with user-agent switcher for google-chrome

793128
disk	ram
an alternate solution i ve seen is to set up a mirror of ram disk where at least one leg of the mirror is on a different computer exported with iscsi or similar

793128
disk	ram
it s still volatile and you ll lose your data if all the computers goes down but it s slightly more secure than just a ram disk

793135
filesystems	ntfs
this problem become more funny when i format the flash memory with ntfs as its filesystems format

793192
subtract	add
if we subtract add the buffers cache to used and free we see

however everything 1.2 x86 works perfectly on my 64bit machine

793241
sudo	passwd
catch key presses through the x server watch for the word sudo then try the text between the next two enter key presses as the passwd

793241
sudo	passwd
if malware infects a shell that uses sudo and sudo caches credentials the malware can continouosly check if it is possible to sudo without a passwd

793241
sudo	passwd
the only way to completely eliminate the chance of the sudo passwd being sniffed seems to be to avoid it altogether

793241
sudo	passwd
sudo reads from tty instead of stdin so breaks sudo but does capture the passwd

793245
width	height
offset reference rows cols height width

793257
sudo	passwd
this does the trick if you have sudo and it can save you from entering your passwd one more time in some cases

793289
disk	ram
the swap space is usually used as a replacement for ram as in another storage for pages which are in memory but not necessarily only when you run out of ram since ram too as other usage than being memory for your programs it is common for modern memory managers to move the memory allocated by programs which are idle in background into swap space and use the newly freed ram space to cache disk accesses

793289
disk	ram
another usage of swap space is to save a snapshot of ram when doing suspend to disk or hibernate so that the system can shut down the power from ram without data loss

793289
disk	ram
in modern system it is sufficient to have enough swap space to keep out of the way background idle services which would otherwise clobber the ram you would use for other more important stuff unused ram can always be exploited to cache disk anyway which speeds up your system a lot

793289
disk	ram
some system save memory pages into swap preventively while they are still in ram so that if they need to remove them to free a bit of memory they can do it a lot faster they can be discarded without the need to write them on disk because they are already there

793289
disk	ram
for this reason and to allow hybernation it is probably a good idea to have at least enough swap space as the amount of ram except for cases in which you have an exceptionally huge amount of ram and or a small disk like ssd drives

793345
mouse	keyboard
your pc when in sleep mode you can only use keyboard instead of mouse to wake up the

i have booted to a ubuntu usb and i can see the windows filesystems but when i try to view it i get an error saying the ntfs partition is in an unsafe state

793519
stdout	stderr
you can redirect both the standard output stdout as well as the standard error stderr to the same log file

793538
wan	lan
you can simply add that lan line to your wan port on your router and set that port up to use dhcp and get an ip from the router

793554
disk	ram
dr you don t have enough ram ram disk size + application memory

793580
filesystems	ntfs
macs are unable to work with the ntfs filesystems the one windows use due to the system architecture however if your hard drive is formatted in fat-32 you should be able to copy them from one system to another fine

793580
filesystems	ntfs
if your hard drive is formatted in the ntfs filesystems however.

when this problem occurs it seems to only affect http - ftp seems to work smb shares seem to work

generally so long as the usb adapter is the same bluetooth version 4.0 for example it should work well with all 4.0 devices since it is a standard

mouse	keyboard
okay so i figured there was a problem with either my mouse or my keyboard

793904
mouse	keyboard
i swapped these out for others another keyboard and a wired rather than a wireless mouse

793904
mouse	keyboard
i downloaded the latest drivers for both the mouse wired and unwired and the keyboard

793907
mouse	keyboard
other options are to see if you can find a bluetooth keyboard and mouse as they will work as well

793955

gtk2 and gtk3 are commonly available on most rpm-based systems for example though they re so large they get put into their own directories in lib or lib64 which is probably not useful or necessary with libevent

794060
tunnel	vpn
please note that while split tunnel allows for easy access to both secured and unsecured traffic the disadvantage lies in the fact that since the secured gateways of the vpn are bypassed for accessing unsecured data there is a danger of opening the door to unauthorized access to the secured network

794067
agile	sprint
one option would be to create a different sprint tracker for the other team and set-up a new agile dashboard planning accordingly

ubuntu	linux
i recently installed ubuntu 14.04 and i m a long time windows user i was used to have a lot of windows open at the same time i was told i could use workspaces in linux to replace the need for multiple windows

794739
switching	screens
another way of putting this is making the super + s screens interactable so i can actually use the windows and not just switching workspaces

794744
ethernet	wireless
in order to play the games without lag the sales assistant suggested i use an ethernet connection rather than wireless

794759

794789
udp	tcp
this works best for tcp but certainly shouldn t be impossible to generalize to udp

794854

ssl	https
i want to route all http and https requests emitted by firefox through the above server over ssl tls

794865
bash	zsh
it is bash zsh that are doing that

794867
disk	ram
in the situation with a load of ram and zero need to ever page large data out because you just do not ever do that then your only paging some kernel stuff and possibly paging some program data and the paging would be best on the data disk

794867
disk	ram
a 1 2g on your system disk c and a 1 gig one on on the least used other disk would probably do the job fine with 16g of ram

794867
disk	ram
if your actually using way beyond the physical ram then it does not hurt anything to have paging files on each of the disk

794891

there may be one caveat which i m not sure if your vpn client solves by itself the tunnel endpoint needs to be excluded from being routed via the vpn it has to be routed via your eth0 interface

794961
wan	lan
by default a router will route all traffic from the lan to its wan port

794961
wan	lan
see step 7 of that guide if you connect this router to the other router using one of the lan ports and the other router does dhcp it will work as it bypasses the wan port

794995
put	get
higher numbers are worse. get an overprovisioned model put a system-managed swap file on it and accept that it might wear out slightly sooner than a spinning-platter hard disk drive perhaps would

795005
vpn	lan
which is of course what you do not want because it belongs to your local lan thus all of your stuff is routed through your local gateway as if the vpn did not exist

795011
ubuntu	linux
if you want to test out a 64b system for free you could download one of the linux distros ubuntu

795617
udp	tcp	icmp	udp	icmp	tcp	sctp	udp	sctp	tcp	sctp	icmp

the harddrive on the other hand is listed as a 1tb drive but it s probably just a standard 2.5 sata connector - i would expect a 2.5 ssd to fit in there just fine or a 2tb 2.5 hdd

799545
cpu	processors
some things like the processors and gpu typically can t be replaced at all and even if multiple cpu gpu configurations are listed on the data sheet you ll be stuck with whichever one you bought

799568
sudo	passwd
passwd protected access to sudo harks back to an era before complex shell environments with commands executed by shims

799568
sudo	passwd
once the passwd has been submitted there s a window of opportunity in which a shim can execute commands via sudo without any notification and with full system control

799568
bash	zsh	fish	bash	fish	zsh
if i was intent on access i d create a useful shim for bash and zsh and fish etc

799568
sudo	passwd
the moment that sudo has been given a satisfactory passwd and you have shells that run commands to get a prompt you re potentially in trouble

799592
bash	zsh
you will also need to export the gpg_tty variable every time when you start a new tty could also be done from bash zsh rc files

799621
filesystems	fat
when the os tries to read a file it ll look up the location in the filesystems metadata which is usually not a fat table these days rather a tree instead and then it ll request the logical sectors from the drive which correspond to that file i need sectors 200-400

799632

when i study the task manager the only issue that is constantly happening is the 100 disk usage ram cpu network occasionally spike up but never reach maximum utilization

apparently enough people have put in complaints requests about the restriction the apartments are for graduate students and university staff many of which need to set up things like vpns for work reasons to open up some sort of ticket to get the functionality in place but all the calls i ve made to get status updates have been a waste of time

800198
joystick	keyboard
i wanted to know how does windows know if a usb keyboard is connected or a usb joystick is connected

800198
joystick	keyboard
it just sees what input is coming from the usb -- a joystick key or a keyboard key

800198
joystick	keyboard
so to summarize i want to know how does windows know if a usb keyboard is connected or a usb joystick is connected.

800211
mouse	keyboard
i very frequently have to pick items from a very long list with very long common prefixes among the entries 30-40 starting with ourcompany - which renders both the built-in keyboard interface and the mouse pretty slow and unergonomic

800214
filesystems	ntfs
this is windows 7 x64 sp1 on a ntfs filesystems

800225
screens	tablet
disabling the keyboard by stopping the service does work - it will nuke the on screens keyboard right outta the park - but the yoga converts into a tablet as well as a laptop and at that point you ll want that onscreen keyboard back - so the thought of digging into multiple screens and scrolling down to find that one tiny setting buried in a long scrolling list of other tiny settings each and every time you just want to flip your dam computer into a tablet is exasperating

800256
debian	linux
the system starts up fine windows 7 x64 or debian gnu linux with xorg+nvidia s drivers

800312
mouse	keyboard
then when mouse movement or keyboard input is detected it ll lock your pc preventing unwanted access

800313
disk	ram
but windows displays disk and file sizes using binary prefixes as it does ram sizes so that is displayed as 746 gb should be displayed as 746 gib

filesystems	ntfs
notice how the two partitions on disk 0 have ntfs listed for their filesystems but the partitions for disk 1 don t have anything

800405
cpu	processors
deploying processors to hardware equipment also reduces workload of your central processors which is your cpu on the mainboard

800442
cpu	processors
so when you are using the laptop in battery the fan will be off which will make your processors to heat up and the cpu consumption will be near to 100

800481
macbook	bootcamp
i ve installed windows on my macbook pro using bootcamp

vmware	bootcamp
when i try to import the bootcamp partition through vmware fusion it works fine but it copies and creates a second virtual machine

800511
mouse	keyboard
if you have a keyboard and mouse connected to usb ports there s a processor inside the keyboard and one inside the mouse speaking the usb protocol

800511
cpu	processors
when the cpu asks to read a bunch of data the processors finds the optimum order to retrieve that data from the disk and maybe even fetches some extra data that happened to pass under the head to put into cache in case the cpu asks for it next

800513
google-chrome	firefox
what exactly happens internet explorer displays the error internet explorer cannot display the webpage firefox displays the connection was reset and google-chrome shows this webpage is not available

i am running windows 7 and i have ie v10 google-chrome v36 and firefox v31

800539
google-chrome	firefox
the issue i am seeing is that ie crashes seconds after i open it before it even has time to load a page and google-chrome firefox crash whenever it brings up windows explorer uploading files or save as

800539
google-chrome	firefox
for google-chrome and firefox even if you just hit control + s to save it immediately crashes

800539
google-chrome	firefox
at this point i think it is a windows issue since it happens with their ie product and only happens in google-chrome firefox whenever windows explorer is needed

800558

they have the same margins but rotated 90 degrees so the top margin in the portrait page is the right margin in the landscape page

800577
portrait	landscape
problem if i insert a portrait foreground page using the portrait background and then insert a landscape foreground page using the landscape background the landscape page has the non-rotated margins of the portrait page

800602
google-chrome	safari
i m not exactly sure what goes on but as i found on the blog article how to stop google chromeâ s annoying keychain access request messages it has something to do with using two browsers google-chrome and safari can t tell about other combinations having a password manager lastpass 1password and the password being stored as web form password in keychain access

tunnel	vpn
a if you know which tunnel should actually be used for your deployment try to set the â type of vpnâ to that particular tunnel type on the vpn client side

800730
tunnel	vpn
this can be set by clicking the â network connectionsâ icon on the bottom right of the task bar select your connection right click - properties - securities tab - under â type of vpnâ select the interested vpn tunnel type

800730
tunnel	vpn
by making vpn connection with a particular tunnel type your connection will still fail but it will give a more tunnel specific error for example gre blocked for pptp certificate error for l2tp ssl negotiation errors for sstp etc.

800730
tunnel	vpn
b this error usually comes when the vpn server is not reachable or the tunnel establishment fails

800730

i have read similar post regarding this fail that imply there is possibly a windows 7 compatibility concern with usb3 and that if a usb2 port is available....or if you can change your bios to make your usb3 look like usb2...then you can get around this error

801019
disk	ram
since the beginning of virtual memory there have been formulas regarding the amount of swap space you should reserve on disk usually between 1x and 2x you ram size

801019
disk	ram
however windows still calculates swap space using a formula based on ram and available disk space

801020
disk	ram
first off for some sleep and hibernate states depending on os you need to cache process memory to disk so the size of the swap must be greater than or equal to the size of the ram it will cache in case you were already full up

801139
lvm	btrfs
i am not reluctant to have btrfs on top of lvm just because i want this

lvm	btrfs
i am asking because if btrfs does not have this functionality i will continue using lvm for the time being.

however i ve just encountered a user s machine where they have no hklm software mozilla firefox registry key or the wow6432node version and there s hkcu registry keys like this which make me think it can like google-chrome be installed by a non-admin user to their users area of the machine

804258
ecdsa	rsa	rsa	dsa
if you want to recover the signed hash value which pkcs#1 supports but other rsa formats may not and other algorithms like dsa and ecdsa definitely do not you need to 1 do a modexp-e computation often inaccurately called decrypting with the public key then 2 unpad then 3 asn.1 decode

the filesystems requirement on the portable hard drives recently changed from nonjournaled hfs+ to ntfs

804540

the job that writes the data to the hard drive takes 50 longer on ntfs than on nonjournaled hfs+

804540
hfs+	ntfs	filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	hfs+
i don t know how much of this advantage for hfs+ is journaling which would then go away if i were comparing journaled hfs+ drives to ntfs drives and how much is basic differences in the filesystems

filesystems	ntfs
linux filesystems prefer to allocate blocks closest to the parent directory s inode whereas ntfs prefers lower-address first and prefers unallocated blocks over previously deallocated ones

804881
filesystems	ntfs
i m using ntfs on my hard drive and fat32 on the micro sdhc card so i thought perhaps it might be a filesystems problem like max file dirs so i formatted the card as exfat and tried again with the same result

805159
google-chrome	firefox
it infected both my ie and firefox but didn t affected my google-chrome

805177
burp	mitmproxy
ssl encryption is done at the application layer so you would either need to modify the application you want to sniff the browser or you need to mount a man-in-the-middle attack like with mitmproxy or burp suite

805189
gedit	sublimetext	folder	directory
in gedit you are able to change the directory of a file or folder the same way as sublimetext editor

usbhid manages all communications between you and the computer hid human interface device like mouse keyboard webcam touch device etc

this only happens to me in google-chrome and not ie or firefox

folder	directory
as it transpires there are thousands of pairs of folder with the same names in the parent directory

805367
openbsd	freebsd
openbsd 5.2 i386 also drops the em0 device to 100baset so it must be an em driver code shared between freebsd and openbsd

805377
folder	directory
somehow as i was selecting the solidworks registry folder in wow6432node i ended up selecting the parent directory and sort of deleting almost all it s contents.

805585
width	height
some shapes won t resize because they have locked attributes like height and width

805621
icmp	tcp
so it would be great if i could do without the icmp echo test entirely and reduce the timeout for the tcp connection test in order to speed up my scripts that use test-netconnection for this purpose

805629
cpu	hyperthreading
to expand on what s already been said hyperthreading means that a single cpu core can maintain two separate execution contexts and quickly switch between them effectively emulating two cores at a hardware level

805629
cpu	hyperthreading
the hyperthreading core only has one main execution unit but certain other parts of a cpu associated with readying instructions for processing and maintaining an execution state are duplicated

805629
cpu	processors
processors cores have an instruction pipeline - a queue of future instructions to be executed that is constantly being updated ready for the cpu to execute the instruction at the head of that queue

805637
stdout	stderr
redirection of stdout or stderr to stdin works perfectly fine as long as no command actually tries to write anything to the redirected output

805637
stdout	stderr
the strange behavior only occurs when an internal command attempts to write to stdout or stderr after it has been redirected to stdin

805661
google-chrome	firefox
the firefox one blocks the images and displays alt text in place of images but the google-chrome one does not

805678
freebsd	solaris	freebsd	linux
now when you say only has linux support what that means is the software is linux based but any networking monitoring tool can monitor traffic from windows linux mac freebsd solaris or any operating system that communicates using the tcp ip stack

805678
ubuntu	linux
it s not like you need a windows based network monitor for your windows machines and a linux based one for your ubuntu machines

805692
sorting	filtering
i recommend that you do the selection sorting and filtering here in the power query because if you do this in the final table in excel you need to re-apply all those filtering every time you update the table

google-chrome	firefox
you could use adblock plus either in firefox or google-chrome it does a good job

you could set aside a small partition on the external drive that is used for the liunux os and then keep the rest as a fat ntfs filesystems

806357
filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	fat
you will also need a tool on the windows 7 machine that would synchronize the contents of the fat ntfs filesystems with a local directory

hold the ctrl key down and push or pull the scroll-wheel on your mouse

806532
children	parent
has to have a parent listed to conform with the requirements of being recognized as a special file of type directory. without this listing first it would be as if had a different parent specified whatever came first in the special file and i suspect but have not confirmed that this would cause one of its children to be interpreted as its parent creating a circularity in the file system it would not be a rooted filesystem anymore but rather a circular one

806548
mouse	keyboard
if i run the script while the wireless keyboard mouse is connected to the imac everything is fine

806548

all of this is ultimately present in my particular pain point of when the machine goes to sleep it disconnects tdm and i have no way to reconnect without first giving the keyboard and mouse back to the imac

808790
cpu	processors
i wanted to provide a very specific and tangible answer here while also covering the two most widely used types of processors so i made a bunch of assumptions that may not be valid in the absolutely general case of cpu design

808790
cpu	processors
even if the tablet s system on chip soc were connected to an a c mains power source so it doesn t have to worry about power sipping to save battery a quad-core tablet soc would completely lose every single cpu benchmark to a 2012 low-end core i3 dual-core processors running at perhaps lower ghz

cpu	processors
cpu performance in modern processors is average of factors like die size architecture number of cores and frequency

810164

810279
ubuntu	linux
why is it so difficult install linux read ubuntu as a dual boot option on a uefi windows 8 8.1 pc

810280
ubuntu	linux
there are several reasons that installing linux on a uefi windows computer is more complex the primary one is that some windows computers test the signed bootloader by default and there are several computers that even disallow the boot of unsigned loaders completely another issue is because windows starts loading as the boot options are displayed so if you want to start linux instead of windows you ll have to reboot if you choose that from the windows boot menu and windows does not add the ubuntu option automatically in addition windows often provides methods to fix boot issues that sometimes overwrite the work done by the ubuntu installer since it does not identify the boot loader

810283
disk	ram
the desk is the computer s ram and the filing cabinets are the hard disk

810283
disk	ram
the best performance comes from keeping the memory full of useful things â a cache and the ram is a cache for the much slower disk is only as useful as it s used

810318

810363
versioning	upgrade
but what the the correct best way to upgrade to a newer versioning of postgresql in the future

810383
disk	ram
to reiterate what others have said moving swap to a straight ram disk is rather pointless in the most common case see below

810383
disk	ram
however a compressed ram disk as swap drive a zswap drive can be beneficial in edge cases where you might need just a few additional mb ram to avoid swapping to hdd by improving space efficiency of a segment of ram to a certain extent

810384
disk	ram
so immediately 4gb of ram is basically wasted it can be used to cache clean disk pages but that s about it

810396
bluetooth	usb
this card is actually two distinct parts glued together one is a standard pci wi-fi card that works fine the second is a bcm92070 which is a usb bluetooth module and it is attached to the usb lines of the mini pci-express port

810396
bluetooth	usb
i fixed it on my machine by disabling bluetooth device in the wireless devices tab in the bios - that tells the bios to ignore but not disable - given that the wi-fi part still works i assume the pci-e slot is still on the card and not attempt any communication with it and that seems to do the trick and the card isn t bricked when the os detects all usb devices and it can thus load the correct firmware and finally make the device functional

810396
bluetooth	usb
try to tinker with the usb options of your bios and or try to disable the mini pci-express slot of the machine in the worst case scenario that may make the wi-fi part unusable but you ll at least keep the bluetooth

810399
bluetooth	usb
your macbook has a broadcom bcm92070 bluetooth card which is actually an usb dongle

810399
ubuntu	linux
rebooting into mac os or ubuntu unbricked the card by loading the correct firmware on it mac and linux have a different way of detecting usb devices and they somehow manage to detect a bricked card where windows just says unknown device so it appears again using the correct usb pids vids and windows can load the correct driver and firmware for it

the yarrow pseudo random number generator uses entropy harvesting from normal activities such as mouse movement or keyboard input to generate random numbers

810964
rsa	dsa
it seems that you want a guarantee like most of us that the numbers given by dev random will actually be cryptographically secure so when we make dsa or rsa keys we know that nobody besides the intended audience can gain access

813396

mouse	keyboard
i d suggest a different solution when you re in the room with the projector run a remote mouse keyboard app on a smartphone or tablet to control your pc

813672
mouse	keyboard
as an alternative to a remote mouse keyboard app you could use an app that lets you view the pc s screen remotely and use the mouse keyboard remotely but that would be overkill because you can already see the screen when you re in the room with the projector

813672
mouse	keyboard
so the idea is to make your mouse keyboard accessible from another room instead of making your second screen accessible from another room
