ubuntu	linux
i am using many virtualbox vms with different os on one ubuntu linux host for development

980634
cpu	affinity
two caveats first the fact that you have confined the process to run on a single cpu does not mean it will be the only process running on it all processes whose affinity includes that cpu will run for some fraction of the time on it

980638
imagemagick	mogrify
so you can simply use the imagemagick command mogrify with the option -append on the downloaded file or even +append if you want to append them horizontally

980660
centos	linux
it works on centos or aws linux

980678
wan	lan
also wasn t showing ip traffic either that looked like it could have been related to using a non-192.168.1.x network since the ip traffic webpages always show 192.168.1.x no matter the wan or lan settings

981043
icmp	udp
there are different ways of doing pings - it is probable that your provider is rate limiting or prioritizing icmp but not udp based pings or vice-versa and you are getting different results

981043

i think you will find winmtr uses udp while pathping uses icmp

versioning	upgrade
if youâ ve upgrade a pc to windows 10 â not performed a clean install but an upgrade â youâ ll have an easy option that lets you revert to the last versioning of windows

981181
mouse	keyboard
to test that it really is a freeze look at the clock in windows it shows minutes not seconds so give it a few minutes so as to make sure the clock is still so you know it s not a keyboard mouse issue

981181
mouse	keyboard
or an alternative test could be to try plugging in the keyboard mouse again or into a different socket

981181
mouse	keyboard
if you ve already had a freeze and tested to make sure it is a freeze then you can be more sure it s a freeze and not a keyboard and mouse issue

981181
mouse	keyboard
if it is keyboard mouse it s unlikely to be both keyboard and mouse so be sure to try both before concluding that it is a freeze

981184
daemons	systemd
on one systemd make a daemons that listens to requests and opens urls in a browser

981192
x86	64bit
on dell s website it is listed as 64bit but in the system information dialog box it displays the system type as x86 which indicates that it s 32-bit

981207
udp	tcp
ports belong to transport layer protocols such as tcp and udp but normal routers don t interpret those â they work on internet layer and carry ip packets based only on their ip address regardless of their contents

981207
udp	tcp
although they do peek inside tcp udp and rewrite certain port numbers usually the source port not the destination port they still don t change anything about the tcp ports being end-to-end

981207
udp	tcp
aside routers do understand tcp and udp and can accept initiate tcp connections

981213
mouse	keyboard
is there an application setting or command for cmd that i could use to force the monitor stay in standby mode and thus ignoring the mouse keyboard

unfortunately no there s no option yet that allows you to do that i explored the google-chrome flags section but didn t find any option which allow you to do that but there s a browser which allows you to do that opera

981377
trojan	virus
since many vpn are not free have speed cap or virus and trojan to steal your bandwidth i suggest you use chrome as your browser and go to the chrome online store to download betternet for vpn which should be verified by google and is totally free

981392
vpn	lan
then i have a vpn connection established from my ubuntu laptop to a lan network

981392

after establishing the vpn connection from my ubuntu laptop to the lan network i used rdesktop and other remote desktop clients like krdc to run the program on the windows machine

981409
debian	centos	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	centos
the issue is i was attempting to invoke start stop items via etc init.d â which is more of a centos redhat system constructâ instead of using usr sbin service which would be more appropriate for a ubuntu debian system

981419
uninstall	upgrade
you can uninstall your graphics driver and then upgrade to windows 10

981423
stdout	stderr
is this technically an error like stderr or is this message simply stdout

981445
stdout	stderr
so brew must send warnings of this type to stdout rather than stderr

981445
stdout	stderr
you could redirect stderr 2 and stdout while running your script to two different files

981446
mouse	keyboard
you are not going to see any difference in latency between different software that shares a mouse and keyboard because they both rely on wifi in your situation

981453
tunnel	vpn
openvpn 2.3.7 on debian and the vpn tunnel uses udp

981462
ubuntu	linux
i have ubuntu and fedora linux distributions on my computer

981468
wan	lan
i m using three of these as waps on my lan so they all have static wan addresses in the 10.0.0.0 24 network

981475
tunnel	vpn	tunnel	packets
vpn does require a very small amount of bandwidth when operating to set up and keep the tunnel open - likewise when downloading you also need to send acknowledgement packets back - but these packets are very small

981477
cpu	processors
vectorized code especially avx naturally increases cpu heat output because the processors must operate at a higher voltage to execute these instructions

981477
floating-point	integer
intel avx is designed to achieve higher throughput for certain integer and floating-point operations

981493
filesystems	ntfs
if you want to avoid a malicious action the solution could be icacls in an ntfs filesystems

981504
ftp	smb
you could mount via nfs or smb or use ftp etc.

981505
filesystems	fat
however the windows fat filesystems has a timestamp resolution of 2 seconds

981535
cpu	processors
in the days of yore when the cpu when people used to sit down and weave wrap the wires between a processors and the memory you would have had to use either 32 or theoretically because it didn t exist at the time 64 wires between the cpu and the memory controller that would be used to specify which memory address you wanted to access

981535
x86	64bit
they didn t just tack on an additional 32 wires and say here you go this is a 64bit cpu you can use in 32-bit or 64bit mode but rather they said this is our new cpu and it only takes programming in this entirely new machine language behaves in this entirely new way solves a bazillion different problems far more elegantly than the old x86 i386 32-bit cpus ever did and it s a native 64bit architecture

981539
disk	ram
it simply saves ram and vm state to the disk

981546
macbook	bootcamp
i ve checked on apple s website that my macbook doesn t support windows 8 or later because of bootcamp drivers issue

981550
folder	directory
i can write ruby scripts and in order to run them i have to save them directly in c users elliot as i can t change directory even to newly created folder

subnet	traceroute
ping and traceroute give me results for the class a address as they seem to have no options for specifying subnet masks

981704

981722
osx	yosemite

981736
chown	chmod
so i have assigned chmod 775 to both public_html s and placed them in chown www-data www-data but am unsure if this is safe

981776
bash	zsh
both bash and zsh probably ksh as well but i haven t tested it can expand part of a directory s name to its full name complete with safe escaping via s

981789
button	checkbox
this launches a modal dialog with a checkbox at the button with the label show location icon in menu bar when system services request your location

981792
vpn	lan
it is also possible that from the rpi you cannot access other pcs in your lan via name because dns has been rerouted thru the vpn not necessarily so but most frequent

981792
vpn	lan
this will route packets for 1.2.3.4 thru the regular lan gateway i assumed it is 192.168.0.1 if not modify accordingly bypassing the vpn altogether

981792
tunnel	vpn
if you had a vpn server on your own vps which btw is what i always do cheap vpses are 3 dollars euros a month and some have unmetered connections then you simply connect to the vpn server via the vpn then contact your rpi by means of ssh using as its ip address that of its tunnel end

981792
tunnel	vpn
so if your vpn tunnel has addresses 10.0.0.1 for the server and say 10.0.0.6 for the rpi client this

981792
vpn	lan
this second routing table does not use the vpn just your normal lan gateway

981793
stdout	stderr
you need the because strace is writing its results to stderr not stdout

981862
installation	upgrade	installation	downgrade
i am unable to downgrade to win8.1 and do an upgrade since win10tp overwrote the recovery portion which it warned of at installation

981892
debian	linux
i first tried creating the linux and windows partitions in debian live

981907
mouse	keyboard
i started uninstalling this one usb driver and all of a sudden neither my keyboard or mouse have been working

981907
mouse	keyboard
the mouse and keyboard work fine in the bios and the windows recovery menu with the recovery disc

981980
rar	zip
7-zip understands file formats other than zip and rar such as msi files and pe executables

981986
disk	ram
as others said in comments it is up to the operating system to decide what portion of the total virtual address space for the os + all processes is kept in ram and which is out on disk in swap space

981986
disk	ram
if that stuff was modified since it was last brought into ram the modified version has to be saved on disk - that s why stuff gets put in swap space or in windows terms the pagefile

982004
redhat	fedora
i can t find it well documented anywhere but it seems to do this on all redhat centos fedora distros or is virt-manager centos redhat stuff

982015
vpn	lan
here s the firewall rules 10.42.0.0 is the bridge lan 10.43.0.0 is vpn

982054
tunnel	vpn
the idea setup to avoid this kind of stuff is some kind of vpn where you tunnel back to your own network and then access the nas s services via that tunnel

982081
ubuntu	linux
just tried on ubuntu linux - you get access to all

982101
mouse	keyboard
i would like to limit it to mouse and keyboard

982121
spaces	delimiter
in excel i have used text to columns for delimiter data separating by tab or spaces

982137
disk	ram
i want to ask how to transfer hardware data cpu ram disk stats from raspberry pi to online web server using sftp

982150
folder	directory
the more annoying aspect is the design notes setting which seems to create a _notes folder in every directory where files are updated

982171
ethernet	wireless
the typical setup involves a poe wireless access point fed by an ethernet cable coming from bespoke poe hardware to interface with the control unit

982188
sudo	passwd
because all running a command via sudo means is you are running it as root which means â œadministrator.â so as long as you are an administrator on your machine and you know your passwd you should be good to go

982200
folder	directory
i have folder options set to so i can still see the likes of myuser appdata from the myuser directory listing

982216
stdout	stderr
this appends cmd s stdout and stderr to whatever was already in file filename

982217
stdout	stderr
in the case of that redirects standard output stdout and standard error output stderr to a file

982217
stdout	stderr
but in the case of that that redirects standard output stdout and standard error output stderr to a file

982225
google-chrome	safari
a command line like this would ingest the rtmp stream and output it for google-chrome safari ios android

982259
daemons	systemd
to fix this you need to disable the systemd service so it doesn t conflict with your user level daemons

982263
width	height
the last two offset parameters return a range with a height of 10 000 and a width of 1

982287
debian	linux	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	linux
on windows it works fine but my work requires me to use linux tried both ubuntu and debian

982335
mouse	keyboard
i just spent two hours trying to solve the same problem keyboard and mouse shut down during system recovery even ps2 connection doesn t work and for some reason moving the usb mouse and keyboard from the 3.0 ports to the 2.0 ports solved all of my problems

982340
google-chrome	firefox
a really odd request basically i want to limit my google-chrome firefox internet explorer so that it is on rather slow internet and if possible increase the ping delays to basically allow me to see how a site functions when the user has slow internet connection

982360
google-chrome	firefox
browsers do not work and i ve tried ie google-chrome firefox

982377
docx	xlsx
i just removed all required office formats i need to sync from this string doc docm docx xlsx etc. and it helped me to solve my problem

982406
mp3	wav
you may be better off extracting the entire audio stream from the video as a wav or mp3 - open it in say audacity - use said audio editor to manipulate the volume normalize the audio - use ffmpeg to re-add the audio track.

982431
rank	max
typically your memory controller can drive 2 rank of memory at max speed and four rank at reduced speed

982498
trojan	virus
it s a virus trojan

982498
daemons	systemd
many variants of it its basically a bitcoin mining daemons rebadged to look like part of the systemd

982512

it can have more complex uses how to properly launch a program and make possible to redirect its running output stdout and stderr at a later stage

982528
stdout	stderr

postfix outsources authentication to dovecot via dovecot sasl

982591

should it be done in postfix or in dovecot

982625
ubuntu	linux
i have a linux ubuntu server that is rather loud is inconvenient to place near enough to my home network router to connect it via ethernet

982627
ethernet	wireless
or you can configure certain wireless routers to connect to your existing wifi and then plug your linux server into an ethernet port on that

982648
pppoe	dhcp	ppp	dhcp
if your gateway s wan interface gets dynamically told the list of public dns server addresses to use via dhcp pppoe pppoa etc. then that list could change at dhcp renewal time or if the ppp oe|oa link gets renegotiated

982650
range	max
basically we exclude previously found items from the large max range

982700
wan	lan
in the past when you had a wireless router but also had a router in front of it as you do with your cisco box we would disable dhcp on the device and plug the cable from either the lan port or a switch port to the wireless router s switch port and not the wan or internet port

982724
ubuntu	debian
this uses system.ntfs_attrib_be attribute from ntfs-3g so you need gatfattr and setfattr utilities from your distro in debian ubuntu sudo apt-get install attr

982785
centos	linux
i have a windows 7 host and a linux centos guest vmware installation

982792
mouse	keyboard
press ctrl+alt on your physical keyboard then use your mouse to click del on the on screen keyboard

982802

i tried using those slots for my keyboard and mouse but the same as the external drives it seems that the device is powered hence the led but not detected by my computer

982827
kde	gnome
you open your file manager i use kde hence dolphin for me but it is nearly identical in gnome or other desktops split the screen into two halves with the split command click on the second half which for the moment displays the files on your own pc then search under

982829

vpn	lan
since the base station is unable to make a vpn connection itself i have a thin client connected to the internet via wifi which shares it s vpn connection via lan to a switch and the base station connected to the switch like this

982853
vpn	wlan
base --- switch --- pc --- wlan --- internet --- vpn --- host

982857
put	get
to get around this i either a put a new line after each codeblock in a 5pt font or b have a second style called code last line that has a break after a paragraph and select that style for the last line of every code snippet

982930
google-chrome	firefox
in my work due to the fact i need to maintain older equipment i need to keep ie8 and java 1.6 java 6 i use firefox or google-chrome for everything other than older equipment and this has never been a problem until i changed employers and got a new laptop

982942
antivirus	mcafee
the best answer i was given to this problem was to use some free antivirus software called avira www.avira.com rather than the antivirus i had been paying for mcafee

982957
post	get
according to this post here it seems that the server s disk usage tracking can get off under some circumstances

982970
hide	show
using the microsoft show or hide updates tool to see updates before installing them

983033
google-chrome	firefox
everything works fine except google-chrome and firefox browser

983033
google-chrome	firefox
i cannot create multiple sessions of google-chrome or firefox though i use the same account at multiple places

983040
filesystems	ntfs
uefi can boot from any type of filesystems as long as you have the relevant uefi driver and rufus will set up a bootable ntfs driver for you

983057
put	get
when this happens i ve found that the quickest way to get my mouse working is actually to remove the mouse from my bluetooth devices completely put the mouse in pairing mode and pair it again

983057
mouse	keyboard
is there any way that i could use a single keyboard command to remove and re-pair the mouse

983093
countif	sumifs
unlike some functions countif s sumifs s with which the use of entire column references has virtually no detriment to calculation performance array-processing functions must calculate over all cells passed to them

this code works in firefox google-chrome but not working in ie

983152
filesystems	fat
as a result a new filesystems and not just better fat

983152
filesystems	fat
this filesystems called fat32 uses 32-bit values for the fat entries

983155
mouse	keyboard
there is also xdotool which allows to fake input from the mouse and keyboard very easily

983179
button	checkbox
besides the preview button there is also checkbox always warn before previewing this type of file

983179
button	checkbox
i have accidentally cleared that checkbox for pdf files so now i have preview available immediately without confirmation by preview button

983192
findstr	tasklist
as others have said it s not clear exactly you mean by equivalent but many of the commands commonly used on the command line are either built into cmd.exe dir copy type mkdir etc even when the unix equivalent would be in bin and others findstr net mountvol shutdown tasklist etc are mostly located in typically c windows system32 32-bit versions on 64-bit systems in c windows syswow64

983196
pop-up	dialog
the problem is that when i try to open an mp3 from the search bar the how to you want to open this file dialog always pop-up

983221
width	height
set slide size to width and height calculated from values collected in step 1

983253
hdd	floppy
which pretty clearly reflects why a old school floppy disk or tape was more susceptible to this kind of thing and a modern hdd is not

983294
installation	upgrade
in general i recommend against upgrade installation

983309
filesystems	hfs+
apple migrated the format of the partition table for el capitan boot image from mbr to gpt and virtualbox does not yet support hfs+ filesystems on gpt partitioned drives when starting from efi

983350
ftp	telnet
after this i cannot even logon to the remove vax vms server for several minutes through ftp or otherwise telnet

983388
udp	tcp	icmp	udp	icmp	tcp
this has prompted developers on linux to provide a richer set of route-tracing tools supporting different methods besides the traditional icmp and udp among which are raw dccp tcpconn and several different versions of tcp probing

983410
folder	directory
to solve that question i deleted the .git folder in the folder moved that folder in another directory cleared the index removed the directory where in my repo and then i was able to add the directory properly

983448
installation	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
my problem however i run a higher versioning and want to install a lower one and this upgrade button isn t available during the custom installation

983478
ubuntu	linux
i want to join ubuntu linux machine with ad server

983517
filesystems	btrfs	lvm	btrfs
use lvm to build a striped volume across the smaller disks and then build a btrfs mirrored filesystems on top of that and the larger disk.

983517
lvm	btrfs
this would yield pretty unpredictable performance though as writes would be limited by the speed of the larger disk and reads would be erratic depending on whether btrfs chose to read from the lvm set or the larger disk

983521
ubuntu	linux
what did work was loaded a live usb version of ubuntu linux and simply turned on the device and rebooted back to window 10

983521

can someone please post the content of this file somewhere or tell me where to get it

983570
sudo	passwd
i have two users that can sudo some commands without passwd to simplify lets assume they can run sudo all

983570
sudo	passwd	sudoers	passwd
my first guess was that sudoers was differentiating between session and proper login session but i still get the passwd prompt using -s with sudo and -l with su

983570
sudo	passwd	sudoers	passwd
but sudoers is still ignored and further sudo calls as userb shows the sudo passwd prompt just like before

wan	lan
leave the technicolor router doing normal nat and connect the lan port to the yellow wan port of the ddwrt router giving you a double nat situation

983652
countif	named
the countif finds which of your target strings is found actually it gives you a count of matches then use the index of which string has 1 match by using match and then your index grabs the corresponding state named that goes along with the match that was found

983750
range	max
since the antenna in the client phone is very smaller say lambda 8 it must have lesser range max 50 meters

983750

983903
versioning	upgrade
it seems that a direct install of 3.10.7 causes the error but installing an old versioning and allowing it to upgrade avoids the problem

983971
ubuntu	linux
i run ubuntu linux

983972

mouse	keyboard
i would also like to know how to open the new task view window by executing some sort of function vs clicking the icon or pressing the keyboard shortcut as it may be a better choice to associate with the mouse wheel in win 10

984205
udp	tcp
these methods internally create bind connect encapsulate a udp datagram note dns us usually performed over udp though most systems can be configured to use tcp instead and send it listen for a response parse it into a structure and return it to the application all with one call

984223
wan	lan
similarly the network boundary betweenâ letâ s sayâ a wan or a lan could be defined as wan traffic begins and ends at the router for inbound traffic unless ports are opened on the router to allow further access

984223
wan	lan
thus port forwarding on a router from the wan to a lan system bridges the network boundary

984233
xlsx	xlsm
the second is a .bat file which will run the previously mentioned xlsm document to trigger the vba script which ultimately will convert the html document to xlsx

984253
udp	tcp
so the tcp ip networking stack places the udp datagram into an ip packet that will go to the ip address of 8.8.8.8 and encapsulates that into an ethernet frame that goes to 01-23-45-67-89-ab

984253
udp	tcp
however the tcp ip networking stack forgets about the bits in that udp datagram

984253
udp	tcp
the tcp ip network stack isn t done with the http request because the resolver is still waiting for a response based on the source network address of the outgoing udp packet

984253
udp	tcp
but the tcp ip networking stack doesn t keep a copy of the bits that were unreliably sent off in that udp datagram

984253
udp	tcp
so the tcp ip networking stack sends this udp datagram to the resolver

984253
udp	tcp
the process is pretty much similar to the handling of the udp datagram except that when the tcp ip networking stack takes ip packet containing tcp segment and sends those packets to the to the network driver to handle the ethernet frame the tcp ip networking stack will remember the entire contents of that tcp packet until the packet is acknowledged in a reply tcp segment

984253
udp	tcp
this time instead of waiting for a udp datagram containing dns traffic that gets sent to the resolver the tcp ip networking stack waits for a tcp reply

984258
chown	sudo
anyway sudo chown -r myname admin usr local and i got what i want

ubuntu	debian
edit checked with wireshark on a windows pc the custom server is effectively not sending the hostname in the dhcp offer possibly as it s not getting requested and from what i ve read ubuntu doesn t request it as well which also may apply to debian

984414
debian	linux
on the linux machine uname -a returns linux hostname 3.2.0-4-amd64 #1 smp debian 3.2.65-1+deb7u1 x86_64 gnu linux and xterm -v returns xterm 278

there s no change after bios update and theres no signal appear on screen only hard disk working after 1 at a time ram test

984747
ecdsa	rsa
if it had been then likely it uses ecdsa instead of rsa and therefore reverting is less important just remove the known fingerprint from your own machine s .ssh known_servers path to be verified shortly and then reconnect to the server.

984762

985323
filesystems	fat

985332
disk	ram
is it possible to put the entire operating system on a ram disk

985350

so the idea is that a chosen vlan where my workstation is assume vlan with id 10 can access virtually all vlans but a client within any other vlan could only see its own subnet and get access to internet nothing else

986617
subnet	vlan
i can ping ip addresses within a particular subnet vlan

986617

yes you can install windows 10 x64 but if you do that you need to completely reinstall the system you can upgrade from a windows versioning to another without losing your files but if you want to go from an architecture to another then it s completely necessary to reinstall the o.s

988169

ubuntu	linux
2.boot from a live linux dvd cd usb like ubuntu then start gparted and format the required drive or if you have external storage available you can copy your data from the live boot

988414
mouse	keyboard
the solution is to uninstall microsoft mouse and keyboard center

988434

988510
x86	64bit
of course starting with at least the 80286 interrupt vectors could be moved to a different starting location other than 0 but modern 64bit x86 cpus still boot up in 8086 mode so everything still works the old way for compatibility as ridiculous as it sounds in 2015 to still need your x86 cpu to be able to run dos

988966
folder	directory
for your code i would recommend retrieving a directory list or otherwise handling the folder name in a case-insensitive way

989011

989020
folder	directory
that is when i extract the zip every file resides in the appropriate folder always beginning with a folder that was my c users directory

989039
cifs	smb
don t go by the local temporary location that choco uses to download the installer you should move it somewhere else like a cifs smb share that every computer on your network can access or if the installer is small enough less than 50mb embed it into the package

989047
wan	lan
what iptables rules should i add and or remove to enable to router to forward port 80 and 23 to the dmz server if these ports are accessed from wan interface and to keep these ports accessible for router configuration if accessed from the lan interface

however be careful that the vlan associated to the former subnet 192.168.0.0 24 can be associated with the wifi as explained again on the dd-wrt wiki

989282
subnet	packets
as for iptables packets coming thru the internal adapter and trying to reach the internet will carry as a source address that of the guest which on your lan of course no one knows since it belongs to a different subnet 192.168.56.1

989329
versioning	upgrade
i m asking if i m eligible for a second free upgrade from a retail license of a previous versioning of windows

989329
versioning	upgrade
even if you upgrade from a retail copy of a previous versioning of windows you do not get a retail license for windows 10 through the free upgrade offer

989329
versioning	upgrade
remember the free license is not transferable so after the end of the offer period you can still downgrade to your previous versioning of windows but cannot upgrade again without paying for a retail license

989357
sudo	passwd
the other way round as you suggest is to use sudo but you would need also to modify sodoers file to achieve appropriate results -- also allow only this command for your user and probably use option without passwd to be able to automate things

989440
udp	tcp
i tried setting it to only tcp since i ve read somewhere that it doesn t really use udp

this is known as tab flipping and provides a handy way to go back and forth between two tabs by simply clicking one of the tabs again and again without having to move the mouse alternatively you can use the keyboard shortcut ctrl +

989557
tunnel	vpn
if the d-link supports any vpn functionality you could use that to tunnel ip broadcast traffic from your laptop to your local network

989557

990432
ubuntu	mint
broadly my virtualbox installation has been fine with window animations anyway in both ubuntu and mint cinnamon so this was unlikely to bear fruit

990445
google-chrome	firefox

i am onto 64-bit ms windows 10 and want to print double-sided if possible to an older inkjet printer with no windows support attached to a linux debian jessie system

990753
disk	ram
if the system doesn t need to access the hard drive for normal operations then it s perfectly possible for it to boot from a hdd take whatever preparatory steps may be necessary and then allow the drive to spin down while working with data in ram only with the hard disk spinning up only very occasionally if indeed at all

990757
installation	upgrade
after the upgrade i reset the pc so that i got rid of all the cruft from the previous installation

opera	google-chrome

unix	bsd
from what i have learned the halt command on unix e.g bsd unix-like systems e.g linux will halt the cpu after calling sync

991085
freebsd	linux
i know that on most modern linux distros halt is just another way to call shutdown but i have installed freebsd and arch linux on my laptop and both of those systems seem to do what halt is supposed to do halt the cpu but don t acpi shutdown

991085
freebsd	linux
after calling halt on eiter arch linux or freebsd my computer seems halted like it is unresponsive and nothing works but i can still hear the fan running

991086
subnet	packets
if a host knows based on its own ip address and mask that a destination ip address is not on its subnet it will send the packets to the configured gateway s ip address

991143
folder	directory
i use this short script for monitoring and continually synchronizing a directory with remote sftp folder

991149
disk	ram
it is technically possible to use hard drive space as swap ie virtual ram which pushes the least used ram to disk

991149
disk	ram
most modern os s do this seemlessly however the penalty for excessively using disk as ram is a massive performance decrease to the point where its probably not useable

991425
vmware	virtualbox
virtualbox for free alternative lacks some of the features of the paid vmware versions

991426
versioning	upgrade
iirc if you do a clean install of windows 7 then upgrade on top of that with the media creation tool will upgrade to the same versioning

991426
versioning	upgrade
so clean install with media for the versioning you want you have activate run the media creation tool to upgrade the system and i chose to keep nothing then pick the appropriate 64 bit versioning

991432
google-chrome	firefox
can i change this in the browser settings firefox or google-chrome and is this some sort of html standard or preset value

vmware	virtualbox
also i using suggest install kali on the vmware or virtualbox and use it

991537
bluetooth	usb
i unplugged all the usb devices which were the ubuntu stick 58 gb and the bluetooth receiver for a wireless mouse

991568
installation	upgrade
using the media creation tool to create an media usb key and running the upgrade tool from the resulting usb key on a windows install would upgrade the system without asking for the key if the current windows installation is activated

991582

i m trying to configure a pptp vpn network to play lan games

991683
subnet	packets
the way to implement wol across different networks is to set up a wol server on each subnet and send a layer-3 message to it to send the wol magic packets really a magic frame out on the server s layer-2 domain

991700
google-chrome	firefox
i suggest that once you are properly connected you download firefox or google-chrome and install the rest of your drivers

991762
tunnel	vpn
there s no proxy firewall vpn tunnel or anything like that

991783
hash	md5
some parts of openssh are using md5 hash and some are using sha256 hash

991783

in your case it seems like your client is providing an md5 hash whereas your server ssh-keygen us using sha256

991789
folder	directory
i have created folder for thees three hostnames in my z htdocs directory and copied all site content across

991798
put	get
beyond that pinging out the wrong interface isn t something an attacker could actually do to you because even if they were monitoring the dns server for requests from your network that might provide info on it they will only get back what they put in so nothing is discovered

macbook	bootcamp
i have a macbook pro with bootcamp running windows and mac

992074
filesystems	hfs
hfs read-only loop-mounted filesystems that has a tendency to crash

992075
daemons	systemd
best practice is to call shutdown -h now which will gracefully stop all processes and daemons dismount filesystems and eventually bring the systemd to the same halted state

992083
debian	linux
if this were a regular linux like for instance a debian one could insert in the file etc network interfaces in the stanza for the outer interface let s call it wan the following line

992083
openvpn	iptables
so if you setup your firewall with the two rules above you will be certain that no packet from your lan leaves your router outside the openvpn but you are not sure that the iptables firewall will be up before networking

992097
wan	lan
they may route between this wan and lan ports

992103
ubuntu	linux
linux ubuntu 15.04 - gnome

disk	ram
remember that hibernate differs from sleep in that the contents of ram are saved to the hard disk and the computer is powered off rather than simply going to low power mode

992142
mouse	keyboard
you re stuck with using the laptop closed at least while you prepare and install the os you ll need a usb keyboard and mouse

992146

i know firefox on windows works better and i know that google-chrome on linux works better than firefox on linux

992164
vmware	virtualbox
however kali seems to have problems when trying to install onto virtualbox vmware using the straight .iso file

992175
opensuse	centos
i ve tested the camera in my pc with opensuse 13.2 and another pc with centos 7 the same issue in both

992202
sudo	passwd
however i suspect you could circumvent that by copying moving or renaming the sudo binary so you d probably want to lock down passwd write-access for all root processes and then only ever change it using a live cd

992216
ubuntu	centos
centos installs fine and i haven t tried it yet but i think ubuntu will install fine as well

992218
mouse	keyboard
being unable to see the mouse you may have to get creative with your keyboard using tab et cetera to get around i ve had this issue connecting to windows server 2012 basically server of win8

992248
debian	centos	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	centos
on ubuntu the secure_path line does contain user local bin but centos may be different both are derived from debian but according to man sudoers selinux may override some entries

992275
vmware	bootcamp
interestingly for those running vmware fusion on a mac with a windows bootcamp partition it s possible to start a virtual machine that runs off the bootcamp partition

992275
vmware	bootcamp
vmware fusion allows you to launch an already-installed bootcamp partition without affecting its ability to boot natively

992275
vmware	bootcamp
source vmware - launching your bootcamp partition in vmware fusion

992283
centos	linux
you must configure selinux to allow mongodb to start on red hat linux-based systems red hat enterprise linux or centos linux

992318
ubuntu	linux
the host machine is linux ubuntu as you can see from screenshot below .the same performance issues are on windows as host machine

992352
countif	sumifs
if possible i would prefer a solution without using countif or sumifs nor any other functions that require a certain condition to be given as a string to maintain portability.

back in word i type ctrl + shift + 8 which does show hide

992406
folder	directory
i had similar problems where my connection to the ftp server would go through fine but i couldn t get directory listings for the folder

992408
wan	lan
looking at your routing table it seems to me your wan interface the one talking to the internet not to your lan is vlan2

992410
vbscript	vba
to make regular expressions work with vba you need to reference to microsoft vbscript regular expressions 5.5

992647
versioning	upgrade
my previous versioning of np++ didn t have this problem syntax highlighting always worked until i upgrade

992684
vmware	virtualbox
both virtualbox and vmware should support 4k out of the box as long as the refresh rate is over 60hz

992723
vmware	virtualbox	virtualbox	parallels
i recommend using virtualbox vmware fusion or parallels to virtualize windows for you

992753
switching	screens	mouse	keyboard	hid	keyboard
i prefer to use multi-monitor kvm switching with usb ddm technology which provide better in usb hid keyboard mouse touch screens ....etc device sharing and faster switching time with almost no latency

i ve also tried changing the .iso file to a .img file per ubuntu s guide on installing linux to a flash drive but using this instead had no effect

992929
versioning	upgrade
if you upgrade straight from an activated windows 7 after downloading windows 10 windows 10 would not ask for it to be activated it would know of the previous versioning and already be good

992939
google-chrome	firefox
there are some add-ons in google-chrome as well as in firefox which provide them

992961
umount	btrfs
for some reason umount never works for me on the btrfs mounts

992972
google-chrome	firefox
if that does not work i would recommend downloading google-chrome or firefox and setting it as the default

992972
google-chrome	firefox
close all of your browsers and see if the link opens in firefox google-chrome

992972
google-chrome	firefox
uninstall firefox google-chrome if you don t want them

most guides say that the recommended rule of thumb is that you need 1 gb of ecc- ram for every tb of disk space in your pool

993023
mouse	keyboard
i plugged in the mouse today and even after adjusting both the windows scroll speed settings in control panel and the settings within the microsoft mouse and keyboard center which appears to be the intellipoint replacement the message list in outlook 2013 scrolls very very slow

993031
width	height
multiply the width by the height of the largest resolution desired then multiply the result by 4

993031

993050
mouse	keyboard
when the mouse was first plugged in a window appeared saying that it was installing the mouse and keyboard center

993059
filesystems	ntfs
i learned another lesson while debugging this problem ntfs journaling only protects the filesystems metadata

993059
mouse	keyboard
however i did continue experiencing system-wide hangs where the mouse keyboard would become unresponsive

993061
feedback	activation
device activation improvements we have received a lot of feedback

993132
google-chrome	safari
how can i work with only one copy of password being kept in icloud and still be able to access it from any of my device and in all browsers safari on iphone and google google-chrome on my mac

993138
folder	directory
a directory folder is a metadata abstraction created by the filesystem and while their names exist as metadata and their contents are linked to their names that data can t stand on its own outside of the filesystem on which they were established

993138
rar	zip
we could have figured out a way to do as you suggest but it would be a huge endeavor and no one has seen that as a meaningful improvement over the ability to just zip tar rar a set of files together

993147
post	put
if this is the wrong place to post this type of question please let me know and direct me to where i should put this question

993158
gentoo	ubuntu	gentoo	linux	ubuntu	linux
also i found out that on a separate desktop pc i could also reproduce the issue again on windows but not on ubuntu or gentoo linux

993165
rpm	zypper	rpm	yum	zypper	yum
secondly if by install from rpm you mean tools such as yum or zypper and by install by tarball you mean downloading a tarball source code from a project s website and building and installing it manually there may be several reasons why someone would prefer to go with a tarball instead of a prepared package

993220
google-chrome	safari
if i need to use google-chrome on mac then i open safari and navigate to the preferences passwords tab and right-click to copy password

993220
google-chrome	safari
after logging in when google-chrome prompts me i save the password in google-chrome as well so i won t have to copy the password from safari in the future

993233
filesystems	ntfs
the type of the filesystems is ntfs

993235

993392
disk	ram
i ve bought a new motherboard ram cpu and hard disk

993423
filesystems	btrfs
i m assuming there s a separate boot partition sda1 and your btrfs filesystems is on sda2 so you want to create an identical sdb2 as raid1 mirror

993423
filesystems	btrfs
create a new btrfs filesystems mkfs.btrfs dev sdb2

993423
filesystems	btrfs
either mount your old btrfs filesystems which should be turned into a mirror using mount dev sda2 mnt or reboot the live system and start the actual ubuntu system mountpoint would be instead of mnt

993423
filesystems	btrfs
add the new partition as second device to your btrfs filesystems btrfs device add dev sdb2 mnt

993423
filesystems	btrfs
double-check you should get a list of 2 partitions sda2 and sdb2 which is still empty btrfs filesystems show mnt

993423
filesystems	btrfs
turn your 2-drive btrfs filesystems into a mirror

google-chrome	firefox
their example uses greasemonkey in firefox but tampermonkey should serve the same purpose in google-chrome

993575
put	get
i still get errors that are preventing backups from occurring saying to insert overwriteable media in fact when i put in the tape it specifically says that the tape is overwrite protected and beneath that it shows it has overwrite protection until 12 31 1899 which i assume should just be the setting to make it have no overwrite protection

993609
ubuntu	linux
i use a linux ubuntu 14.04 lts with google chrome to connect to the video call

993685

993693
debian	linux
running xfce4 under debian gnu linux i m facing the following problem with my audio mixer

993694
ansible	puppet
and you are worried about consistency perhaps you need too look at a configuration management system like puppet chef ansible or the like

993706
kde	gnome
in linux is there a global configuration that is not kde gnome dependent that will stop external monitors displays from shutting off

993777
rar	zip
winrar provides complete support for rar and zip archives and is able to unpack cab arj lzh tar gz ace uue bz2 jar iso 7z xz z archives

whenever i am using win xp it occurs rarely but in case of win7 or win8 it occurs frequently in web browser like google-chrome firefox etc and in video players also

993818
ubuntu	debian
fyi ubuntu and debian based distros use update-grub to do the same thing

993822
put	get
put this formula in any column starting from first row fill down at least for ten rows to get correct result in case all numbers need to be displayed

993838
switching	screens
when i switching back to chrome it s a force of habit to refresh immediately causing me to refresh the wrong screens each damn time

993876
debian	linux
so you are better off installing the package xscreensaver for your distro the capitals above are ok for arch linux debian et al

993876
kde	gnome
notice that xscreensaver is started automatically by xfce4 and lxde for the other desktops gnome and kde you will have to do it in a suitable way

993878
ssd	sata
i tried to install the jmb363 driver from windows 10 not from windows installer and it doesn t work so i can t use the jmb363 sata controller again so my ssd works on a sata 1 controller.

filesystems	ntfs
builtin windows feature encypted filesystems efs allows you to encrypt single folders files on ntfs formatted drives

993882

993883
installation	upgrade
it will allow you to upgrade your computer to windows 10 or create bootable installation medias for other computers you might have

versioning	upgrade
it is possible to use a mysql utility to upgrade databases but it is so much simpler in the long run to do a backup on your old versioning and a restore on your new versioning

994023
min	max
when the column difference is equal to the max or min for worst case difference it will return one otherwise it will return zero

994023
min	max
in case the goal difference is equal the tie breaker will favor the result with the least goals against therefore returning only one max or min

994023
min	max
since we only have one 1 it will return the row number of the best max or worst min result

994032
goto	break
using goto within parenthesis - including for and if commands - will break their context

versioning	upgrade
reinstall repair windows 8.1 so you have a working versioning then upgrade

994052
installation	upgrade
doing the upgrade before this update is released will result in a installation that cannot be activated until that update is installed

994052
installation	upgrade
once you fix the installation you just download the update and perform the upgrade

994070
ubuntu	linux
i started having a weird issue on my ubuntu linux with kde if i press any of the following combinations

994081
versioning	upgrade
i was not really aware that i have now two versioning of onenote installed after the upgrade to windows 10 since i do not use it much

994134
xmodem	zmodem
i have also tried hyperterminal on windows 8 but i keep having time-outs when using the file transfer for whatever protocol i select xmodem zmodem etc.

994134
ubuntu	linux
the best solution would be one that works for ubuntu linux as well

994144
daemons	systemd
i think you can re-configure pulseaudio to run as a daemons for the entire systemd but with possible security issues aside from this blurb i don t know specifically what they are

994145
mouse	keyboard
if i am actively doing something i do not observe this behavior and quick movement of the mouse or input from the keyboard will bring them back to normal

994152
xmodem	zmodem
for serial communications like xmodem zmodem i d start with just basic communication

994295
google-chrome	firefox
tex for gmail is a plugin for google-chrome and firefox which adds la tex capability to gmail and gmail chat

994300
gnu	groff
however if your man-page is overly traditional roff or if you are not happy with mandoc s formatting you might want to format view your man-page with gnu troff groff

994309
sudo	passwd
i forgot my passwd so i cannot use sudo halt

994369
google-chrome	firefox
all office 2013 programs both firefox and google-chrome and sublime text do this for instance

i have a programmable microsoft wirelesess keyboard and mouse model 3000

994435
installation	upgrade
i recently upgrade to win 10 and used my same username and password from my previous windows installation

994458
gentoo	linux
gentoo linux

994476
udp	tcp
i presume you are talking about tcp and udp ports

994476
udp	tcp
in particular tcp and udp use port numbers

994476
udp	tcp
i belive some other protocols use them too but i ve only worked with tcp and udp myself

994476
udp	tcp
tcp ports and udp ports are entirely separate

994476
udp	tcp
a tcp server and a udp server can use the same ip port combination

994478
disk	ram
past any of that if you are concerned about the service life of a disk donâ t worry about how many downloads you have but instead make sure your system has as much ram installed as possible

994478
disk	ram
easy most all modern operating systems cache data to ram before writing to disk

994481
filesystems	fat
then i formatted it again with a fat filesystems and some default settings that windows said are default

994485
versioning	upgrade
i am using emacs versioning 24.4 and since i don t have root permissions on the system i can t upgrade to a newer versioning

994508
cpu	processors
so if you had 4 logical processors in your cpu that might mean that the 25 is running one logical processors at 100 and the others at 0 or that 25 is divided among several logical processors

994508
cpu	processors
i think python apps can t use multiple logical processors so you might want to look into multi-core processing in python if you want python to use more of your cpu

994508
affinity	processors
you can also limit the amount of logical processors python uses by right-clicking on the process and selecting set affinity

994508
cpu	processors
you can also monitor each logical processors s usage in the next tab after that just make sure the graph is set to show logical processors not average cpu usage

994535
disk	ram
i am concerned if the 768 ram not able keep up with 1 tb of hard disk space

994553
ubuntu	debian
if that fails you i use debian which should use about the same methods as ubuntu

994561
arp	dhcp
a dhcp or arp request are examples of such frames

994561
udp	tcp	icmp	udp	icmp	tcp
then you have enough information to send it ip packets and access tcp udp icmp services running on that device

994574
disk	ram
in earlier versions of windows disk cache had a tendency to eat up the available ram google vcache

994580
filesystems	fat
there is a standard support for ext filesystems under the name fuse-ext2 and one for fat under the name fusefat

994599

994666
width	height
to avoid distortion of the image i have to use a vb picture image i want to alter the height and width of the displayed picture box to fit the size of the picture

994666
width	height
to do this i want to extract the height and width of the file then ratio it down and resize the picture boxes size

994671
mp3	wav
maybe the most current file using more memory sound files tend to be heavier in terms of memory usage is a good candidate but i cannot tell which file extension should i use to play it maybe the data was stored in mp3 wav whatever format assuming i was lucky enough to pick a sound file to start with ...

994672
google-chrome	firefox
i used a browser after reading an article from pc world the browsers with extra security than google-chrome and firefox

994673
width	height
what fields in exif files provide image height width information

994677
x86	64bit
if the files are not encrypted or corrupted access the hard drive from another operating system capable of reading ntfs say a live cd of some linux distribution and check for the program files x86 folder or something of the sort that would indicate a 64bit operating system

994718
versioning	upgrade
if you don t have root access to the machine and can t upgrade any package you ll have to fall back to the previous major versioning 1.4.2 which requires emacs 23.2

994785
versioning	upgrade
i have asked the seller if he upgrade it to windows 10 from a versioning of windows 7 8 that he had bought since the laptop originally came with windows vista business there is a sticker on the bottom

994785
versioning	upgrade
if the licence is a win7 8 upgrade or an oem retail versioning

994810
ubuntu	linux
i ve booted into ubuntu live and used ntfsfix ntfs-3g tools to clean the hibernation read-only stuff but it still is locked somehow i can mount in linux rw

994819
google-chrome	firefox
also you didnt mentioned about whether your ie or firefox working fine the last solution would be resetting google-chrome to defaults and import settings from default browser ie firefox

994846
mouse	keyboard
i migrated my installation of point of sales basically generic keyboard mouse i o from old e2200 pc to raspberry pi

994878
mouse	keyboard
i can of course drag the tab out using the mouse but as you might have guessed i try to do as much as possible with the keyboard only for productivity reasons

994889
notepad++	sublimetext
for these kinds of features you need something more robust like notepad++ or notepad2 or sublimetext etc etc

994898
udp	tcp
normally you open ports by specifying port number and the protocol - either tcp or udp

994903
union	distinct
db union select distinct

994903
union	distinct
tables_priv union select distinct

994903
union	distinct
columns_priv union select distinct

994919
filesystems	ntfs
the security tab is also only available on drives that are formatted using the ntfs filesystems

994919

if you are using the fat or fat32 filesystems you will not see the security tab

994936
udp	tcp
names system service names tcp ports and udp ports

994943
disk	ram
if the guest doesn t use some of that memory host ram can be used for many other purposes such as caching clean disk pages even though it s reserved for the guest

994946
filtering	grouping
it is of course possible for the exchange admins to deploy global filtering with grouping policies or office custimization tool if they use this there might be a process to report offenders and have a spam address added to their list

994950
titlebar	window
type cmd click cmd right click cmd window titlebar select properties

994950
titlebar	window
type cmd click cmd right click cmd window titlebar select defaults

994957
folder	directory
starting a certain tool in the windows 10 setup folder get a windows 10 using microsoft s downloader on a flash drive then follow the procedure from copying source gatherosstate.exe to a directory with write permissions and running it in order to retrieve a genuineticket.xml file to be copied into a fresh win 10 installation without any keys entered during setup

994978
put	get
i thought i d like to update the ram so first i bought two new kingston kvr16n11s8 4 4gb ram sticks to put into the two empty slots to get a total of 12gb ram

995027
windows	winpe
theory creation of a winpe thumb drive is forced to 32-bit fat using the windows aik

995098
lvm	glusterfs
if your glusterfs bricks reside on lvm logical volumes then you should be able to simply resize the lv and the filesystem on it and the gluster clients should see the new larger size immediately without any gluster-specific steps required

995101
width	height
explanation the is a phantom that does not appear and has zero width 2 and that is the same height as a bigcap

995117
postfix	dovecot
one of the vms is responsible for my emails dovecot postfix one is responsible for http s server nginx

995117
openvpn	iptables
the droplet has firewall rules iptables that forwards the packets to the openvpn client responsible for the packet if it s coming for port 80 forward to the internal vm that has nginx

995117
starttls	smtps
smtps transactions would just hang during the starttls phase https connections would hang during the tls negotiation

995120
ssd	sata
i did further research on how to upgrade my sata drive to a larger sata drive not interested in solid state ssd at this time

995147
vmware	virtualbox
virtualization there s also the possibility of virtualization either by using something like xenserver to virtualize several instances of operating system images or with vmware virtualbox to virtualize on top of gnu linux but this might not be powerful enough for the majority of games

995159
disk	ram
looking at system requirements we know that windows server 2012 r2 has a minimum requirement of 32 gb disk space and 512 mb ram and the client-oriented windows 8 needs at a minimum 16-20 gb of disk space and 1-2 gb ram depending on processor architecture

995159
vmware	virtualbox
then look at virtualization software such as vmware or virtualbox depending on your needs

995184
switching	screens
but if i click it to switching to it windows kicks me out into the login screens

995238
cpu	processors
processors intel core 2 cpu e8400 3.00ghz 2 cpus

995263
add-on	xpcom
as mozilla is preparing its next-generation servo engine it s also phasing out older add-on technologies xpcom and xul and introducing new ones like the webextensions api which is largely compatible with the model used by chrome and operaâ to make it easier to develop extensions across multiple browsers

995263
google-chrome	firefox
but if you re planning to port google-chrome extensions over to firefox with an eye towards the future then i recommend installing firefox nightly and getting your hands dirty with the webextensions api today

995263
google-chrome	firefox
porting google-chrome extensions to firefox with webextensions

995266
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
it works fine on safari intermittently but not on firefox or google-chrome

995273
google-chrome	firefox
but what i observed is that it shows different time on different browsers like the timer shown on google-chrome firefox differs with that shown on ie

995291
hide	show	folder	directory
i have the same problem which would like to hide the whole path to the current directory only show the current folder line in the putty command line

995319
disk	ram
i have burned a bootable disk which contains ms-dos with the ram drive himem.sys

995334
disk	ram
to this end i want to force the file system to access the disk itself without caching too much data on ram

995340
hfs+	ntfs
in case there is ever a need to format a disk with hfs hfs+ or ntfs you can boot from an ubuntu live usb and install the following packages in the ubuntu live usb

995346
switching	screens
while chatting with my friends we usually press alt+tab to switching over to the screens

995366

it certainly works for txt rtf doc x other filetypes untested

995400
hide	show
folder linktarget d bat a b hide only folders but show files

995407
put	get
i could get a random static webhost and put a cdn in front of the whole page

995425
temp	tmp
you may want to create the temp file in special directory that cannot be read by other users and maybe under the tmp or another one that will be erased on the next reboot

995427
arp	dhcp
another more feasible but less applicable solution is dhcp snooping which allows dhcp-driven networks to ignore arp updates that do not match info in the network dhcp server

995427
spoofing	traffic
advanced switching infrastructures allow several configurations that help defeating spoofing including the limiting of the number of mac addresses per interface 1 to be precise and the ability to digitally encrypt and sign network traffic between critical systems using ipsec with certificates for identity

995455
put	get
the best way to get what you want ie numbers staying the exact way you type them is to put this in front of what you type

995478
sudoers	passwd
add your script to the etc sudoers file with the nopasswd attribute so that it is permitted to run without prompting for a passwd

995590
vlc	mkv
when vlc plays an mkv from the web it first downloads it and then plays it

995590
mp4	h.265
so is there any way to put h.265 and opus in the mp4 container with the moov atom at the beginning of the mp4 file so that it can start playing without needing to download the whole file

995591
spaces	delimiter
also the delimiter is a tab not spaces

995594
postfix	dovecot
postfix and dovecot do different things

995594
postfix	dovecot
yes postfix can use dovecot to perform authentication and dovecot s lda to put mail in mboxes so there s definitely more to the story.

995607
tunnel	vpn
a real actual vpn is based on the tunnel concept

995622
tcsh	dash
finally i tried running in sh dash and tcsh but none of these shells expanded the into anything else

995663

a v lookup that keyed on the uid and returned the max date from the date_selector range and and then a simple if statement to keep the rows where the date from the date_selector range matched the date in the record

995676
vmware	virtualbox
this is true for both virtualbox and vmware workstation

995699
disk	ram
superfetch is now tied in with the prefetcher also accomplishing the task of aligning data for fast boot loading and quicker access to program parts and pieces based on the defrag alignment of your hard disk which assists in the first run of any programs not actually pre-loaded in ram

995699
disk	ram
where did you want to go today or where did you want to have your processing disk activity and ram use to be occuring can be much of a users choice and totally dependant on the use of the computer

995711
move	drag
drag and drop a .exe to the desktop no longer creates a shortcut instead the action is always to move the file

995711
move	drag
there was a similar problem reported march 2013 drag drop a file to desktop icons ceased to open it replaced with move to desktop

995774
crypt	hash
not all hash functions are strong enough to protect a short password â for example the same original des-based crypt hash function was strong at the time but is considered utterly weak these days

995774
crypt	hash	crypt	salt	hash	salt	pbkdf2	hash	pbkdf2	salt	pbkdf2	crypt
linux crypt now supports a wider variety of hash functions such as based on sha-1 or based on sha-256 but the added protections salt multiple rounds still aren t as good as the later developments of pbkdf2 or bcrypt and many short passwords hash can still be cracked in a short amount of time

995774
hash	salt
similarly windows to this day uses a very weak hash function just one round of md4 no salt or any other security features

995780
bash	zsh	bash	tcsh	ash	tcsh	zsh	tcsh	tcsh	dash
as neither the posix standard nor the mainstream shells sh bourne ksh bash ash dash zsh csh tcsh expand to something else the quotes are not required

995817
xfce	kde
when i first started using linux it was for the purpose of getting back on track a 1 gb ram laptop and so i used xfce and lxde for that while keeping away from desktops like unity and kde

995817
kde	kubuntu
i am talking here about systems that come with these desktops as default like kubuntu linux mint kde and manjaro kde

995817
xfce	kubuntu	xfce	kde	kde	kubuntu
anyway kde4 like linux mint kde 17.2 seems to me lighter on my 4 gb ram computer than kubuntu or manjaro running plasma 5 - and even than xfce

995865
mouse	keyboard
for about the last 1-2 weeks after i login mouse and keyboard centre spends about 5-10 seconds downloading then disappears from the screen

995873
wan	lan
alternatively as the question title suggests you can use cascading routers by leaving the setup on the top floor as it is and plugging its cable to the middle floor router the blue one in your image into its wan port instead of its lan port

995981
postgresql	mysql
our it department uses commvault simpana to create backups from a server s filesystem mysql databases and postgresql databases

995981
postgresql	mysql
i d like to get plain backup files individual files from the filesystem backup and mysql postgresql database dumps out of simpana

995993
debian	linux
on debian based linux

996024
vpn	lan
setting up a vpn may not be ideal but is often used to play lan games over the internet so it should fit for any developing needs you have

996030
filtering	grouping
security filtering is set to a grouping named mastercam users

996036
put	get
yes this will work fine obviously any files you create on the ssd will not be copied over when you put the hdd back in so an idea to get around this is to use cloud storage like dropbox or google drive

996059
ubuntu	linux
i have an linux server running ubuntu 14.04

996085
wan	lan
permitting access from one lan port is perfectly acceptable and permitting access from all lan ports is reasonably acceptable but permitting access to the wan is not permitted at all

996117
ubuntu	debian
so after i successfully booted installation of debian and installed it on the hdd i just tried to boot ubuntu from usb one more time

996126
twitch	steam
after turning it on my wi-fi speed is usually normal but after a while like a couple of youtube videos an hour of twitch streams a few steam downloads etc my speed drops to around 1 4 of the intended speed only on this device

996179
wan	lan
so i had to confirm this when i got home but i definitely have the internet supplying ethernet cable connected into my wan port and not a lan port

996181
fish	bash
as others have noted it will at least be yes in bash and no in fish

996196
centos	mint	ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	centos
next i set up ubuntu mint 14.04 on a virtualbox which is now on the centos server

996220
redhat	fedora
14.04 lts is a long term stable release which means that like redhat over fedora it values stability and compatibility over being cutting edge

996220
versioning	upgrade
apt-get upgrade the versioning of openssl you are running will not be vulnerable to heartbleed even though its 1.0.1f - ubuntu simply patched the versioning rather then create a new versioning

or do i need to go into the terminal and follow the set of instructions described on this website banym.de linux centos setup-bridge-device-on-centos i can t post more than two links sorry

996437
vmware	virtualbox
or do i just need to configure it on the vmware settings and then modify eth0 inside of the guest virtualbox

996446
macports	homebrew
you could get it by installing homebrew or maybe macports

996474
google-chrome	firefox
this problem is contained to internet explorer and does not affect any other browsers such as firefox or google-chrome

996531
mouse	keyboard
i tend to find that when i have a keyboard or mouse problem installing their utilities seems to help

996574

chown	sudo
sudo chown -r root applications transmission.app

996580
min	max
right below it you will see guids for the min and max processor states as well

996619
folder	directory
gnupg does not scan all your drives and folder for its home directory but looks for it as dedicated places by default only .gnupg in other words in your home directory

996620
folder	directory
when i navigate through the offline files on my computer it takes several seconds to simply change directory its much slower than just using the mapped network folder

996650
folder	directory
for now i just try to drag in between the subfolders or i go up in the directory hierarchy and drag the file onto the destination folder while i am in the folder above

996678
put	get
if you don t want to put up with the requirement of dealing with such limitations then get a 29 so you needn t worry about it

996687
mouse	keyboard
there is a context-menu key on your keyboard which usually does the same thing as right-clicking the mouse

996691
osx	yosemite
firefox 43.0b1 - mac osx yosemite

996700
hide	show
but in the open file dialog i cannot find how to show and preferably toggle show hide hidden files and directories

996731
wan	lan
the router assigns ip addresses to the lan not the wan

996731
wan	lan
you need to connect the wan port of the router to the modem and connect the switch to the lan port of the router

996762
folder	dir
although i can see the file in windows explorer i can see it when i run dir command on that folder but when i run copy command to copy this file to another location it says the system can t find the file specified.

996844
installation	upgrade
i would suggest you run setup.exe from installation media from running windows 10 which allows upgrade of current windows 10

996863
ethernet	wireless
10 laptops 2 desktops 2 printers can work wireless or via ethernet

996875

is it possible to write a script to download that file by tunnel over the vpn

996901
google-chrome	firefox
extension to add desktop notifications into firefox the way it works with google-chrome and chromium browser works with gmail gtalk gmail chat imo.im and all other websites that use this technology

996903
kde	gnome
i thought maybe network-manager was running but i installed without a desktop environment and installed xorg and i3 after install so network-manager wasn t installed with kde gnome etc

996937
filesystems	ntfs
i ve tested another drive with ntfs filesystems which showed same issue

996976
wan	lan
then you set all your other routers as wireless access points only connected via their lan ports only to the lan that is connected to the one router with both wan connections plugged into it

996976
put	get
as an aside if you are managing to saturate even one 100mbit connection with only 12 users that s hardly moderate use - a perfectly reasonable approach to this would be to put in traffic shaping or limiting so that each user gets 8 mbit and then everyone else doesn t have to get terrible service due to the jerk or jerks that s torrenting the heck out of your shared connection.

997036
x86	64bit
if you really do want to build from source go to the ghostscript download page and download the package labelled ghostscript 9.18 source instead of the package labelled ghostscript 9.18 for linux x86 64bit

997056
udp	tcp
the ip protocol and protocols that lie directly above it like udp and tcp are intended to be global nat notwithstanding intended to be hardware agnostic and intended to not care about security

i am currently running windows 10 pro which is an in-place upgrade of a former windows 8.1 pro installation

997117
ssd	sata
the installer only recognizes one physical drive which is my samsung ssd plugged into sata port 0

997165
tunnel	vpn
there is also a means to bypass the need for port forwarding via the reverse tunnel technique using vpn or ssh tunnel

997165
tunnel	vpn
using a vpn to create a reverse tunnel is an option though it does require some technical sophistication

997165
tunnel	lan	tunnel	vpn	vpn	lan
a better approach would be to rent a vps instead that you vpn into so you control the remote endpoint and feed traffic incoming on the vps into the vpn tunnel and onto your lan via reverse tunnel

997187
put	get
this is i assume because i am scraping from a large directory but my question is how do i get wget to put the files directly into my current directory without adding the parent directories

997225
put	get
however when i try to put the output into a file i get nothing

997278
post	get
took out the ram i get the post beeps to indicate no rams installed

997286

udp	tcp
tcp and udp are transport level 4 protocols whereas bluetooth is a lower

997814
udp	tcp
thus you could use tcp or udp on top of bluetooth just as you use tcp and udp on top of ethernet but the opposite is much harder

997814
rfcomm	l2cap
the bluetooth protocol stack includes its own transport protocols l2cap and rfcomm where rfcomm links use the l2cap layer

997814
tunnel	packets
you can work some ip tunnel over bluetooth encapsulating udp packets over rfcomm links

997838
mouse	keyboard
basically when you press option key 5 times it enables and disables the same way and then you can only use like 6-8 keys on keyboard to only control mouse - other keys and touchpad are disabled - so if your cat doesnt hit 1-2 keys left and right mouse clicks you are fine

the second vpn points to the london uk server uses tcp and has the option dev tun1 set to act as the second tunnel

998105

obviously i could run cron jobs scripts to open and close the vpns to allow me to run get_iplayer successfully through the uk vpn but i would much rather keep both vpns open have all of my traffic going through the tun0 interface and only use tun1 for get_player when i need to with bind.so

the greatest differences between ssd s and what we would call normal sata iii drives henceforth referred to simply as hdd is price per gigabyte and read write speeds per drive

998557
debian	linux
since kali linux is based on debian wheezy debian 7 you should tell vmware workstation that you are installing debian 7

998637
filesystems	ntfs
without realising it i formated my external 95 full with data to a single gpt ntfs filesystems

998637
filesystems	ntfs
you created a fresh new technology filesystems ntfs on a partition on the disk

998637
filesystems	ntfs
this is especially likely to be true if the new filesystems ntfs is the same as the one it replaced and if the new partition starts in the same place as the old one

998654
int	double
the problem is that for formatting a string is returned but for the graph int or double are needed

998680
bash	tcsh
normally it would be a shell such as bin bash or bin tcsh but it could be any console program

998680
stdout	stderr
it will be run with its stdin stdout and stderr redirected to the emulated terminal created by konsole

host b - ahk script b - keyboard a via mouse without borders synergy

999159

msg	eml	folder	directory
install importexporttools then right-click inbox and select importexporttools - export all msg in the folder - eml format clear inbox as in the note to 2 above then then right-click inbox and select importexporttools - import all msg from a directory - also from its subdirectories - the msg will be in a time-stamped directory limbo_yyyymmdd-hhmm msg within the directory you selected for export

999205
sudo	passwd
type your user passwd and if you can run sudo commands the terminal will freeze do not panic this means it is working

in command line just go to that directory folder and then run the needed commands for your drive locations as the above example shows

999387
ubuntu	linux
you ll need access to another computer to create a live linux distro like knoppix or ubuntu

sudo	passwd
i am getting sudo no tty present and no askpass program specified error while executing command like sshpass -p passwd ssh user remote sudo ls

999529

to make sure there is no confusion i recommend disconnecting the hard drive and connecting the new ssd to the first sata port

999535
google-chrome	firefox
actually most browsers are moving slowly to 64 bit see here about firefox and here about google-chrome

999535
google-chrome	firefox
probably it taken so much time firefox still not public by now google-chrome download defaults to 32 bit and 64 is still marked as beta beside the various bugs they had to solve because maybe they didn t find it to deserve so much attention

999542
filesystems	btrfs
in addition with advanced filesystems like btrfs that have checksumming it s often recommended to schedule a scrub every couple of weeks to detect silent corruption caused by a bad drive

999542
filesystems	btrfs
unfortunately btrfs may not realize that a drive is gone while the filesystems is mounted as pointed out in this mailing list entry from 09 2015 it s possible that this has been patched

999549
tunnel	vpn
the principle is the same regardless of which vpn tunnel technology you use

999585
vpn	lan
to route your ssh via the lan gateway not the vpn

999585
vpn	lan
to route git via your the lan gateway not the vpn

999595
move	drag
simply move the shortcuts from the public desktop folder to your personal one drag drop

999598
filesystems	btrfs
the same device may be mounted on multiple locations using bind mounts btrfs subvolumes or fuse filesystems

999598
umount	btrfs	filesystems	btrfs
a mount might have multiple backing devices for filesystems such as btrfs and umount won t necessarily understand all of them as the mtab mountinfo files only show one

999616
ubuntu	linux
i m using ubuntu linux

999643

we can use min max and structured references to dynamically work out how many terms there are in your table for use in the randbetween

999657
google-chrome	firefox
for developing i use google-chrome but i have to fix one bug in firefox

999660
udp	tcp
depending on which type of vpn service you are using you ll have to port forward some other tcp or udp ports

999674
ftp	telnet
enable the ftp and telnet services

999674
ftp	telnet
edit etc inetd.conf and make sure ftp and telnet are uncommented

999674
ftp	telnet
from the windows box assuming the interface has a 192.168.0.x address you can now ftp or telnet to the qnx target

999691
ubuntu	linux
i tried to install software centre ubuntu software centre in kali linux using apt-get install software-center but it showing error like in the image e package software-center has no installation candidate

999728
filesystems	btrfs
now if you use an advanced filesystems like btrfs that does checksumming as a single filesystems without redundancy on top of a dumb raid-6 system it s up to this raid system to detect and fix errors because once too many errors have corrupted the raid system btrfs will not be able to fix them

999728
filesystems	btrfs
if you use btrfs the way it s supposed to be used by creating a btrfs raid-6 filesystems without md raid with direct access to your drives it will be able to fix errors reliably and it will know if the errors are actually gone because it has checksums

999728
filesystems	btrfs
also unlike a btrfs filesystems a zfs raidz2 like raid-6 zpool cannot be resized there are tricks but bottom line is that a raidz2 vdev cannot really be grown by adding a drive so an existing system cannot easily be expanded with more drives

999730
x86	64bit
the 64bit version of chrome is always installed in program files and the 32-bit version of chrome on a 64bit version of windows is always installed in program files x86

999740
filesystems	btrfs
have you scrubbed the btrfs filesystems

999740
filesystems	btrfs
for future reference unfortunately btrfs does not seem to be able to detect a failed drive live while the filesystems is mounted

999740
filesystems	btrfs
degraded mounts anyone who manually removes a drive in order to simulate a failure will probably think about mounting the filesystems in degraded mode to use btrfs replace

i ve read that gpu passthrough on linux ubuntu mint is possible with the correct types of hardware

999768
jobs	cron
i am not sure where i am supposed to put the cron entries in order for the jobs to run or if i need to reboot the router or if something is turned off somewhere or if this sort of thing is not supported on the router

999778
google-chrome	firefox
no i m not suggesting we re-open the security holes that google-chrome and firefox are trying to close

999826
put	get
with the example data it will be b7 c25 if you put it in a cell by itself you ll get a #value

999826

if you put it in a cell by itself as an array formula you ll get the upper-left cell s value or 11 10 14

999866
opera	google-chrome
since google-chrome opera both discontinued support for full-text search here is a current extension that i found

999866

and it can be used in opera with the download google-chrome extension for opera which lets you use extensions from the google-chrome store

999868
google-chrome	firefox
since a few days ago - i believe it started after the daylight saving time change - i can t open websites that use https connections such as yahoo facebook and youtube on google-chrome or mozilla firefox

1000040
ubuntu	linux
i have moved to mainly working on linux machine primarily ubuntu 15.04

1000116
nas	qnap
getting an of-the-shelf nas solution from a well established vendor - qnap and synology come first to my mind nases are their core business - will save you loads of time.

1000272
gentoo	mint
the only thing i ve been able to accomplish is getting the gentoo mininmal installation cd to run but i d rather use mint if possible and i really don t want to have to compile a kernel

1000272

i ve tried vi vim emacs joe nano but doesn t seem to have any

the box has a number of cron jobs running the unison utility designed to back up various directories onto external hard drives

1001022

you can download 64-bit version of ubuntu make a bootable usb flash disk boot it and see if it detects 4 gb of ram

is there a way to get firefox to switching to the next tab when you click the middle mouse button regardless of where on the screens the mouse pointer is

1001419
switching	screens
from this menu select mission control on the left hand side and at the bottom of this list you should see an option for switching to desktop #. this is the screens where you can create a keyboard shortcut in order to change focus between your desktops

1001463
google-chrome	firefox

when you start your machine the most basic information is processed first like showing the desktop turning on the graphics locating the mouse and keyboard drivers etc

1001486
filesystems	xfs
warning before proceeding take a backup of your xfs filesystems using this procedure where dev sdg1 is your xfs filesystems and path to backup.xfs is where you want to store your xfs dump

1001486
filesystems	xfs
it s very self-explanatory and it even expands the xfs filesystems to fit

1001486
filesystems	xfs
now you have a larger partition which contains a smaller xfs filesystems

1001486
filesystems	xfs
these commands would expand the xfs filesystems

1001486
filesystems	xfs
the advantage is that you can actually shrink xfs filesystems using this method but the downside is that all the data need to be rewritten which is slower

1001497
versioning	upgrade
it works regardless of what os versioning you re on now you don t have to upgrade to yosemite first

1001500
folder	directory
md - make directory - creates a new folder

1001505
folder	directory
this won t be better than a script for your particular scenario but it s kind of nice to know this when your folder names are unrelated you can make multiple directory from the command line by separating them by a space

1001510
arp	tcp
any system that talks via tcp ip over ethernet has to use arp or other neighbor discovery protocol to find out which mac belongs to an ip

1001513
vmware	virtualbox
also i m fairly new to hyper-v switched from virtualbox and vmware i can use vmware again but totally disappointed with virtualbox - the one caused 2 times of bsod error on my host

1001532
icmp	tcp
tcp timeouts -- without receiving any icmp unreachable messages -- are usually measured in minutes when a server is not responding

1001532
arp	icmp
if you intentionally take it down for maintenance the fallback will be faster if it s off the network and arp requests are not answered router will report back with icmp host unreachable

1001564
osx	yosemite
this worked for me with a chrome version of version 46.0.2490.86 64-bit on mac osx 10.11.1 not yosemite sorry but hopefully same solution works

1001931
rmdir	mkdir
the only thing i have come up with and found so far is to have the parent folder deleted and then recreated with the rmdir and mkdir commands

1001942
udp	tcp
you should try tcp udp connections first - config - netboard params sugests that board listening on 192.168.0.127 5000 or will be trying to connect to 192.168.0.127 5000

1001965
bluetooth	usb
some wi-fi bluetooth combo modules put the bluetooth radio on usb or uart serial instead of pcie as i understand it there are extra pins on an internal pcie x1 connector that can be used for non-pcie purposes such as usb

1001965
bluetooth	usb
the ac 7260 spec docs seem to mention that it uses both pcie and usb so the bluetooth functionality may be what it needs usb for

1001965
bluetooth	usb
it s possible that your laptop s internal pcie slot where the previous wi-fi card was installed does not have the usb pins of the pcie slot connector actually hooked up to a usb host chip so it s possible that your slot doesn t provide the usb connectivity that your ac 7260 s bluetooth functionality requires

1001983
mouse	trackpad
there is no difference if i use the trackpad or the usb plugged mouse

1001986

1002223
debian	linux
p-s i m using linux debian and welcome in particular every solution compatible with it

1002236
content-length	content-type
putting those together it would be possible to write a script that retrieved urls from a page then walked through the list of referenced urls first doing a head probably faster than reading the whole referenced page inspecting both the content-length and content-type to see if that information is available and if so whether it points to another web page to crawl through

1002350
filesystems	ntfs
must be formatted with the ntfs filesystems

1002557
vpn	lan
if this is so then your server lan router must perform nat and have a static route for your vpn pointed at your vpn server ip

subtract	add
this should work if you want to subtract 1 from the figure in a2 for each yes in the b column and add 1 to the figure in a2 for each yes in the c column

1003053
subtract	add
if you just want to subtract 1 or add 1 if there is a yes in either column this should be the kind of formula you re looking for

1003079
mouse	keyboard
this issue with directshow is also affecting all applications on my pc with windows frequently becoming not responding and then responding again - the process happens in less than a second creating a flashing effect for the application and is quite detrimental in games as the game then loses focus of the keyboard mouse and i have to press the keys that i was holding down again

1003780

the standard solution to this problem would be to create a vpn and use this to bridge your remote device onto your lan to communicate with your nas

1004115

it is possible either or both devices will be able to act as a vpn server - if not you will need to replace one of them or get them to act as a client and get another device outside your network and setting up a vpn from your lan to it as well as from your off-site computer

vmware	virtualbox
vmware virtualbox etc. attempt to present the hardware on the host machine to the guest machine so the guest machine can use the hardware directly like being able to use a usb device on the guest and in this context not much is actually virtualized in the classic sense of the word since the guest uses the hardware itself

1005316
vmware	virtualbox
the jvm attempts to abstract as much of the platform architecture machine as possible to make the code as agnostic as possible to be able to run on as many devices as possible that support java where as a vmware virtualbox container abstracts the physicality of the machine as much as possible so you can reduce the physical hardware needed to run a platform though you still have the same soft limitations i can t write arm assembly and expect it to just run on an x86 processor in vmware virtualbox

i am trying to manually reproduce a etc shadow password hash from the plaintext password and the salt

1005765
salt	md5	hash	md5	hash	salt
i tried appending and prepending the salt to the password and hashin it using md5 but i don t get the same result as in the password file is there any other transformations the system performs on the plaintext to deduce the hash

1005765
hash	md5
something else i noticed the hash saved in the file maps to 176 bits whereas the traditional md5 maps to 128 bits

1005769
crypt	hash	crypt	md5	hash	md5
as otus noted the hash aren t raw md5 â crypt uses md5crypt which involves a few dozen md5 iterations the exact amount actually differs based on the hash itself some bitshifting and some pixie dust

1005769
crypt	hash	crypt	salt	hash	salt
also both the salt and hash in the crypt output are encoded using a slightly-modified base64 6 bits per byte while md5sum prints the hash in hex 4 bits per byte so that accounts for the difference in output length

1006326
freebsd	linux
that way all operating systems will see the area freebsd as something like ada0s1 windows -- as d linux -- as whatever its conventions

ramhound pointed out to me something along the lines of that winpe is the environment in which windows installations boot from

so that explains why early macriums and windows 7 give the bsod in legacy in that even with win7 it s the winpe part of it that is bsoding

1006348

though the bsod is still a bit of a mystery it may be somewhat irrelevant since it s just from an old winpe that doesn t need to be used rather than from the windows installation itself

by default windows will send all traffic down the vpn tunnel even to locations that aren t on the vpn

1006673
tunnel	vpn
what you re looking for is split tunnel which is when only some of the data goes down the vpn tunnel

1006673
tunnel	vpn
if the gateway interface equals your local router local interface then split tunnel is in place and not everything is going via the vpn tunnel

1006673
vpn	lan
the metric for my vpn interface 10.198.167.242 is lower so in theory everything bar some lan addresses is sent via my vpn connection

if you re sure you re not using fink and you want to run another perl version alongside the one provided with os x you can use the one from homebrew

versioning	upgrade	migrate	upgrade	uninstall	upgrade
if you have not yet migrate from an earlier versioning of windows it is best to uninstall the idt software in the old operating system again windows will automatically reinstall compatible drivers before attempting the upgrade to windows 10. after days of troubleshooting i finally have no desktop or file explorer loop crashes

1006951
subnet	packets
but aha i can use 192.168.1.255 from outside 192.168.1.0 24 to reach all members of the network with a single broadcast because the router separating my subnet 192.168.2.0 24 from the target subnet 192.168.1.0 24 will pass these packets on

1006963
bluetooth	usb
so there is no usb bluetooth adapter included and i must have bought a 3rd party bluetooth adapter along with it

wan	lan
you will need to know your wan internet ip address which you can find from the router or usually by googling find my ip from a computer on your lan

1007097
put	get
thus i came up with the plan to use a linux there to boot without installing the linux and then use command line statements that i could then put onto an usb stick in order to just call a single command and get my hard drive and system back to working condition

1007156
antivirus	mcafee
having followed the advice of someone on superuser i have stopped using mcafee as my antivirus and am now using avira instead- this has been much better at picking up removing any virus i get than mcafee ever was and also seems to regularly inform me that it has blocked another potential threat

1007160
vmware	virtualbox
and it should be noted that virtualbox vmware type of virtualization is different than what you are asking which is actually is it possible to emulate any cpu on any other cpu

1007160
cpu	processors
patent license issues aside intel could decide to add the instruction sets for the arm processors into a line of it s x86_64 cpu s so that you could potentially run the arm binaries direct on that cpu but they would still have to have the architecture do as the arm architecture does or the output might not be exact

1007173

srt	subtitle
i m using mencoder version 1.1-4.8 on ubuntu 14.04 to encode various avi mp4 and mkv files into smaller .avi files with srt subtitle burned in to view in a portable dvd player that has very limited format support

1007292

in those cases the output file displays the original subtitle lines for around half a second and then switches to the text from the srt file i provided repeating this behavior for every piece of dialog

1007292
switching	screens
i use spanish language .srt files and the mkv files usually have english subtitles produced from closed-captioning so the quick switching nothing on screens - english dialogue - spanish dialogue can be extremely confusing

1007292
srt	subtitle
i can t find a way of telling mencoder to ignore any subtitle that come with the mkv file and use only the srt file i provided so i wonder if anyone here had a similar problem and could find a solution

why would you ever want to create a symbolic link to another folder in the same directory

1007975
mouse	keyboard
for example you won t be able to use your computer during the conversion process as mouse and keyboard are controlled by the script

1007991
filesystems	fat
or i prefer a multiboot usb even if there s only one .iso to boot since it doesn t overwrite the whole drive s partition table like plain dd does and you can use a filesystems like ext3 4 or something more reliable than fat fat usb s tend to erase all their filenames somewhat regularly for me somehow never a problem on the same usb with ext3

1008004
mouse	keyboard
needless to say the microsoft mouse and keyboard center is of little use

1008018
versioning	upgrade
hint in newer apt versioning you can just use apt install update upgrade

1008020

flac	ogg
i have my music library on my machine in flac and ogg format

1008084

however to be able to listen to the music in the car i convert the flac ogg files to mp3 using ffmpeg

1008084
flac	ogg	mp3	flac	mp3	ogg
ffmpeg seems to automatically read the tags from ogg flac files and convert them to mp3 tags

1008084
flac	ogg	mp3	flac	mp3	ogg
for example if the ogg flac file has two artist tags as and the mp3 file will have a tpe1 which reads as artist one

1008084
flac	ogg
i have embedded the cover art images of the albums into the flac ogg files

1008084
flac	ogg
this is precisely done using --import-picture-from option of metaflac for flac files and setting coverart tag equal to the output of for the ogg files

1008084
flac	ogg	mp3	flac	mp3	ogg
now in conversion to mp3 using ffmpeg as explained above everything works fine with flac and the cover art image is also automatically embedded in the output file but for ogg files the resulting mp3 will not have the image

to my refind_linux.conf since adding just the filesystems as root parameter causes the btrfs root to be mounted with and home subvolumes inside it

the btrfs root can then be accessed by mounting the filesystems with subvolid 0

1009077
ubuntu	linux
if you do insist on going the hard way and assuming the laptop has soem lan connection the most promising way is to set aside a small partition on the harddisk install one of the easier linux distributions on it i recommend ubuntu and then use tools such as lio or ietd to create an iscsi target on the rest of the harddisk

so you have a chance to redirect traffic to your computer only by dns poisoning or arp spoofing

1011861

set your variable root folder and subfolder up top and the for d and for loops iterate accordingly to do the rest of the magic traversing the directory as the logic specifies and completes the del q f command for the files

1012382
udp	tcp
tcp port 135 is shared by dcom based on rpc and raw rpc server component as a public entrance of tcp udp namedpipe transport layer which is chosen by each dcom raw rpc server component so it s not simple as disabling dcom on this computer will stop port 135

wan	lan
a typical home grade consumer router has 4 lan ports and 1 wan port

1012887
wan	lan
the idea is that the router logic sits between the lan ports and wan port and translates the address using nat

1012887
wan	lan
if you are a real masochist you might be able to flash dd-wrt onto your router and reconfigure one of the lan ports as a wan port - but dd-wrt does not work well at all on dsl devices and reconfiguring a lan port to a wan port is not trivial

1012914
wan	lan	wan	subnet
i was thinking using a star topology with a main router connected to my dsl modem and connected to 2 children routers on its lan ports and connecting to their wan ports subnet 1

which should return a whole pile of results with pretty much all of them showing the full path to libphp5.so which should be something like this if you are on an ubuntu debian system

1013349
ubuntu	debian
in that example itâ s loading the default apache log file from an ubuntu debian setup but you should change that full file path to match your actual apache log file location

1013354

to test this hypothesis consider connecting your wired pc to your router s wan port in place of the modem and doing the performance test from wan to wlan just like you d previously done it from lan to wlan

i tried several times to set up dual-boot with ubuntu 15.04 14.04 mint 17.3 with no success

trojan	virus
as a consequence it could act as a virus or trojan or keylogger or whatever

1013948
wan	lan
its router aspect is not very impressive its router aspect has only 2 ports or 2 sides the lan side and the wan side

1013948
wan	lan
one for wan and one for lan

1013948
wan	lan	wan	subnet
the majority of home routers and small business routers only support one subnet for lan and one subnet for wan

folder	directory
do keep in mind if you press cd on a folder in nerdtree the working directory automatically changes to the folder you are on so it is fairly quick

1014231
ethernet	wireless
both routers have a wireless network and the connection between the tp-link and the set-top box is by ethernet cable

1014236
ethernet	wireless
i have a windows pc with hardwired ethernet and two wireless linux devices on a lan

1014238
ethernet	wireless	sniffing	wlan
the ethernet ports on the asus rt-ac68u must be switch ports so a device connected to any of those ports will see only traffic directed to it and broadcasts therefore your sniffing device must be on the wireless lan and the wlan nic must be in monitor mode

1014248

however when i execute cd aenw08v401 folder i001 the current working directory won t change at all

this is easiest to do from linux since there are rpm and debian packages that will do all the hard work

1014307
google-chrome	firefox
tried all three browsers installed google-chrome firefox and ie - no toolbars - no effect

1014327
hide	show	umount	mdadm

it is available for firefox google-chrome safari ie and a bunch of others

1014646
disk	ram
you access the files in the fast ram disk

1014664
disk	ram
i believe vm s like virtualbox can save the ram and use it to start up again with all the same programs running like a regular computer s suspend or hibernate - saves ram to disk and turns off power then reloads ram from disk and continues as if it was never turned off

1014664
mouse	keyboard
that is a possibility but in that case i m sure any rogue program already running on your computer could read the screen keyboard mouse inputs listen to the network traffic and basically do anything already vm or no vm

1014934
opensuse	debian	opensuse	linux	debian	linux	ubuntu	opensuse	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	linux
their documentation only says it supports ubuntu 12.04+ debian 7+ opensuse 13.1+ or fedora linux 21 which is laughable because fedora 21 isn t even supported by fedora anymore only fedora 22 and 23

robocopy	xcopy
you should be fine to use the native windows robocopy command rather than xcopy which is a much more robust way to complete your task than a batch script using for loops with xcopy and date time stamp substitution checking etc

1015116
robocopy	xcopy
if you re building something new it d be best to use robocopy instead of xcopy as xcopy is a deprecated command intended to be replaced by robocopy specifically per microsoft as of windows vista and newer oses i believe

ethernet	wireless
i have a d-link wireless router with four ethernet ports

1015266
wan	lan

1015595
filesystems	ntfs
i have heard it is more reliable to use - are there any drawbacks to using this filesystems rather than ntfs

1015618
robocopy	xcopy
you should be fine to use the native windows robocopy command rather than xcopy or fc which is way more robsust to complete your task than how you describe you re doing it

1015618
robocopy	xcopy
if you re building something new it d be best to use robocopy instead of xcopy as xcopy is a deprecated command intended to be replaced by robocopy specifically per microsoft as of windows vista and newer oses i believe

1015625
filesystems	ntfs
refs has some distinct advantages over current reigning windows filesystems ntfs but it also has some drawbacks

udp	tcp
after contacting the server behind the nat it establishes a channel with tcp semantics using udp packets

1015787

1015879
folder	dir
if all the virtual hard disks were in the same folder e hyper-v virtual hard disks it would be simple to just do a dir of the hard disk folder and create equivalent virtual machines

1015888

it can browse websites using google-chrome ie and firefox just fine

1015926

1016004
wan	lan
from your picture you need to plug the modem into a lan port on the tplink device rather then a wan port

1016004
wan	lan	wan	subnet
you should also get rid of the network 10.0.0.50 24 - you really should not have the lan and wan on the same subnet

that is you should connect both devices through their lan ports and leave c7 s wan disconnected

cpu	processors
my cpu is an amd fx-6300 3.5ghz 6-core processors black edition

1016463
vmware	virtualbox
however that still doesn t explain why virtualbox doesn t detect that i have amd-v i tried running ubuntu on vmware and that tells me that i have to turn hyper-v off so my virtualization is definitely on it s just that virtualbox does not detect it

1016465
vpn	lan
use a free vpn service to connect from the problematic lan

cpu	affinity
another option is to set the cpu affinity

1017091
cpu	affinity
you can set the affinity to the 1st cpu core and you ve got 3 others at idle

1017091
cpu	affinity
try the nice value cpu affinity or ulimit for cpu time before limiting the ram

as most linux distributions include all the filesystems modules it is normal to be able to see ntfs partitions

1017367
rtp	rtsp
if you re receiving the stream via rtsp you re probably receiving an rtp stream that doesn t have those packets

1017367
rtcp	sdp
your client would have connected via rtcp to get the sdp describing those streams because pps and sps are usually once-per-stream unless you re changing resolutions framerates etc

xcopy is a deprecated command intended to be replaced by robocopy specifically per microsoft as of windows vista and newer oses

robocopy	xcopy
i m going to post an example robocopy command batch solution below since it is a windows native solution but not deprecated just like xcopy

1018061

just not that some of the robocopy options are default to do what some of the xcopy switches were doing and needed for so you may not need to include every switch you think you d need to otherwise

i attempted to install mint 17.1 it only recognized linux and not windows so installed thinking that mint would just install on the ubuntu partition

during installation of mint 17.1 it only discovered the ubuntu partition and not the windows

wan	lan
internet router lan port 1 is connected to 2nd router s wan port

1018214
google-chrome	firefox
i also read that google-chrome has its own dns settings so it does not use the windows set dns - i have been testing with firefox and ie so unless they also have their own dns settings this is not working

none of my attempts above to block access to the domain msecnd.net worked although when i experimented with the acl set to icmp instead of tcp udp - it did stop ping replies from the ip before i removed it

overall it appears that using network shared folders nfs smb cifs is better when source control sync is not an option

1018461
ubuntu	mint
so far the best answer i ve found in the case of versions of mint based upon ubuntu 14.04 17.01 through 17.03 is to apt-get remove mdm but not to reinstall it

1018488
folder	directory
if you re not too worried about the actual folder structure existing you can move the folder anywhere you want and use a directory symbolic link to point to the new location for example if you have limited space on your system drive

1018489
flac	wma	mp3	flac
it does an excellent job but only supports mp4 m4a m4p mp3 wma flac and oggvorbis formats so you will have to convert your audio files first if you want to use this program

1018489
wav	aiff
i don t believe that aiff or wav has any actual space set aside for the full set of id3 metadata in its headers as well as storing images

1018489
flac	wma
you can do this easily with flac lossless wma apple lossless and similar files

1018537
wan	lan
i have installed the relayd package too and bridged the lan and wan connections to create a bridged repeater connection which if i understand it correctly would theoretically allow all the machines connected to either router 1 or router 2 to access each other as if they were connected to a single router

antivirus	norton
btw i had windows 7 premium edition on my computer and didn t have to disable my norton antivirus

1018640
wan	lan
the best way to do that is generally to connect to the lan port because sometimes devices disable access from the wan port since lans are generally more trustable than a wan port which may typically be more likely to receive packets from the highly untrustable internet

1018650
folder	directory
without it cd will try to go to the folder with that name in the current directory you can check that with pwd

1018657

linux ubuntu terminal is there a method to get the last line

1018660
sorting	filtering
i m having a heck of a time getting autofilter criteria to apply both the filtering and sorting

1018660
sorting	filtering
attempted methods for filtering and sorting have resulted in either hiding the entire sort filtering range or hiding none of them

1018660
sorting	filtering
these sheets need to be tamper-proof as up to a dozen computer novices use them on a daily basis so i ve hard-coded the formatting filtering sorting and equations into the hidden vba scripts

1018710
subnet	vlan
option 2 shall i use vlan for pcs and phones so i don t need to change new subnet on all servers

1018732
maya	blender
i would expect an arm core to perform video transcoding massive physics computations think big rts games or raytraced 3d rendering blender maya appreciably slower than an x86 core but those are not necessarily common user tasks and so don t get benchmarked

vim	emacs
emacs also allows you to do something like that as well as vim

subnet	packets
and why a computer would answer on the an interface for an ip address not bound to it - and relatedly - would this have the potential to under certain circumstances stuff up routing in scenarios where there were multiple interfaces on different subnet and packets should be forced to traverse a firewall

you can filtering domain users and grouping by organizational unit

1019284
installation	upgrade
the problem exist at upgrade installation and clean installation of windows 10

1019292
wan	subnet
if so you would need to know the currently assigned wan ip address subnet mask and gateway address for the wan side of the router

1019292
wan	lan
it is also possible that the network configuration at the office is uncomplicated no systems need to be accessible from the internet and that both the wan and lan sides use dhcp with the router functioning as the dhcp server for the lan side so that you could just replace the new router with the old one and everything would work as it does today with at most perhaps only a change on the wireless side for an ssid and passphrase key and perhaps a reboot of systems so they pick up any needed ip address change on the lan side or alternatively issuing an ipconfig renew command at a command prompt on windows systems to have them query the router for new dhcp-assigned settings

1019305
udp	tcp
this way your network firewall proxy would see only one connection and depending on the type of vpn that could even be a udp connection thus leaving you with 0 zero tcp connections and you would never fall afoul of this stupid rule

1019306
google-chrome	firefox
my 64-bit pc running windows 7 home premium version has installed 3 major browsers ie 11.0.9600.17914 64-bit firefox just updated to 43.0.3 and google-chrome 47.0.2526.106 64-bit

tunnel	vpn
i have a vpn with vpn sh in a home network and i would like to know at which nodes the tunnel starts and ends for example is the traffic being sent from my computer encrypted before it reaches my router or is it encrypted when it reaches my isp before leaving for the internet

1019552
tunnel	vpn
i m unsure that vpn sh has any meaning but a vpn encrypts data between the tunnel endpoints - thus if you are running the vpn client on your computer everything between your computer and the far end of the tunnel is encrypted ie your router will only see the encrypted traffic

1019633
osx	yosemite
1tb drive with data and a osx yosemite installation

1019661

if you have a dns name in place instead of an ip the device would have to resolve this name before the vpn tunnel is established

1019677
debian	linux	disk	ram
luks is well supported by debian and other distribution installers it s fairly simple to encrypt your full system or full linux partition except for a small boot partition containing the kernel and initial ram disk

1019761
versioning	upgrade
suppose you are using windows xp and you have downloaded its drivers then you upgrade your os to windows 7 or 8 the drivers for windows xp wouldn t be enough for windows 7 because the latest versioning of windows comes with new features and new framework etc

1019761
x86	64bit
in the case of versions 32-bit x86 and 64bit x64 the 32-bit drivers work efficiently on 32-bit os but those drivers wouldn t be enough for the 64bit os because of the extra features in the 64bit os

in virtualbox mounting a shared folder is fairly straightforward after sharing the folder with the guest in the vm settings in virtualbox you can run sudo mount -t vboxsf share host which should mount the folder drive in the host folder in your home directory

i ran crystaldiskmark on my sata 3 connected samsung evo 850 ssd and it reported a 1839mb s sequential read speed and 1676mb s write speed

min	max
you can try putting the power-plan to performance and also try setting min and max processor states to 100

1020369
wan	lan
if you are wondering why i said wan speed and not just wifi speed that s because the lan wifi connection between clients and modem is stable strong and fast too with file transfers averaging 200mbps within the lan

1020369
wan	lan
as much as i think about it i cannot see what relationship there might be between the os running on a client and how it could affect the wan wifi speed leaving the lan speed unaffected

kerberos	ntlm
ms-chap is an entirely different type of protocol than lm ntlm kerberos and is designed to secure an entirely different set of things in a completely different environment

1020462
wan	lan	kerberos	ntlm
ms-chap is a wan protocol whereas ntlm kerberos are lan protocols

1020462
kerberos	ntlm	kerberos	ldap
lm ntlm kerberos are service-level authentication and authorization protocols paired with service protocols like netbios smb ldap

1020462
wan	lan
all these service protocols are lan protocols and are not generally exposed to the wan where there would likely be security performance and reliability ramifications

1020462
l2tp	pppoe
perhaps the question you should be asking is why ppp pppoe pptp have not been replaced by protocols like ipsec or l2tp which are modern wan-safe tunneling encryption protocols commonly used in vpns the modern remote access method of choice

1020495
ansible	puppet
if you want to manage the configuration of all your servers you should use a configuration management tool like chef puppet ansible or salt there are others too

when you resume the session often by pressing the power button moving the mouse or tapping a key on the keyboard the system immediately re-enables all of the previously disabled hardware and is pretty much ready to go

1021471
disk	ram
this is safer than sleep mode but obviously when you turn the machine back on it is going to have to go through power-on self-test post and then restore ram contents from disk

1021503
findstr	tasklist
the batch script logic with tasklist and findstr as i have it to

1021512

1021670
google-chrome	firefox
this is despite having set firefox or google-chrome i tested both as the default browser

1021688
mouse	keyboard
i say this because it happens on two separate workstations using separate but identical keyboard mouse setups which were purchased about a year apart so have substantially different levels of use on them so should rule out unlikely failure of both mice

ip address is very necessary for 2 devices to communicate even if you create a batch file to transfer the files you have to use a protocols like ftp telnet ssh http get and put but without ip how the protocols in batch file will talk to the other device or how will it know i have transferred the file to right machine

1022492
disk	ram
at the same time virtual addressing also introduces a means to map virtual memory to disk transparently usually with the help of cpu exceptions or interrupts that are raised when code accesses memory that is not mappable to physical ram so that the operating system can automatically load the data into ram and then grant access to it

1022783
wan	lan
you need a 64 for each network so one is not enough for both lan and wan

1022783
wan	lan
the only ways you could make this work is by doing proxy-nd or by bridging ipv6 between lan and wan making it appear like it s one network so the single 64 would work

1022798

the usual way as i understand it in a debian family linux distro is to put some entries into etc network interfaces to specify that they re to be started upon boot how they get their addresses dhcp or explicit and so on

1027257
sudoers	visudo
this silently checks the file no output due to -q and only if that does not return an error exit 1 means an invalid sudoers file then it will copy the file into sudoers.d this way you can create the file and work on it without having to make it right the first time using sudo visudo -f etc sudoers.d myfile has to succeed or it discards the content if you don t fix it

1027257
sudo	passwd
i just confirmed that if i run chmod o+w etc sudoers.d vagrant i can no longer sudo as the vagrant user it prompts me for my passwd and then fails

looking at my last attempt 643 packets were captured out of which 638 99.2 were broadcasts and 5 were multicast originating from the laptop

1027304
icmp	udp
note the op from this question why wireshark is not showing high layer packets like icmp ip udp

1027332
libpcap	wireshark
the way you capture in monitor mode is os-dependent - newer versions of libpcap on non-windows oses and current versions of wireshark attempt to let you do it by checking a checkbox but for various reasons that doesn t necessarily work on linux or bsd and it doesn t work at all on windows to capture in monitor mode on windows you d need to capture with a tool such as microsoft network monitor or use an airpcap device with wireshark

the vlookup inside the sumifs does not make much sense since you return the result from the 1st column of the lookup table

folder	directory
if the folder structures match and the files haven t been renamed you can use diff -r meld or whatever tool which compares folder and it stops to work if you rename files or even directory

1031070
folder	directory
in this example the folder bali or pictures_of_me inside folder2 might not even exist in folder so diff -r would just skip the directory

1031196
cpu	hyperthreading
however your cpu has multiple cores and or a feature called hyperthreading

1031196
cpu	hyperthreading
whether you get that speed boost or not largely depends on just what kind of software you are using and how well the software s parallelization implementation is able to utilize cpu features like multi-core cpus and or hyperthreading

1031196
cpu	hyperthreading
as for your question is this a quad core i would guess it is either a quad core without hyperthreading which often has the effect of appearing to double the number of cpu cores or a dual core with hyperthreading enabled

1031339
ubuntu	mint
original page s command was ext2fuse dev c c mnt lvm but it s apparently no longer in ubuntu or mint or ubuntu s software repositories there is a fuseext2 package fuseext2 binary... it would ve used the installed ext2fuse utility to support the mounted ext3 file system

1031505
move	drag
if you are copying lots of small files or a single large file split into many parts your drive may need to move the head dozens of times per second which can drag your speed down to less than 0.5mb sec under worst-case conditions

1031508
filesystems	ntfs
in reality the closest you can get to hiding data on ntfs is by hiding data within metadata structures in the filesystems

1032757
lvm	mdadm
while the combination of mdadm lvm dm-crypt works nicely i find it incredibly complex escpecially to plan an easy disaster recovery strategy

well there is a bunch of howtos and tutorials on how to use luks encrypted lvm s in conjunction with either zfs or btrfs

1032763

1032821
lvm	mdadm
mdadm lvm dm-crypt is probably your best bet - and its not that complex at all - you just handle each layer appropriately - or depending on your needs mdadm dm-crypt lvm if you want all the lv s to share a single device with 1 passphrase

google-chrome	firefox
if you re interested just ask and i ll give you an overview the transition should be very easy xfce xubuntu s interface is known to be very familiar for windows users it s comparable to that of windows xp but a bit less ugly you can install google-chrome firefox libreoffice and vlc for your basic desktop needs there are also better players than vlc but libreoffice is the best available office pack

1033140
ethernet	wireless
you could simply connect both computers to the same network preferably with ethernet but wireless will work it ll just be a bit slower then share the files on the local network and copy them over the network directly from one computer to the other

1033140
rar	zip
if the files you re backing up aren t too massive in size all put together we re not talking like hundreds of gigabytes you could also simply archive them into a zip rar 7z or other archive format and compress them while at it this will make the file transfer from one computer to the other significantly faster whether you do it through ethernet or using a usb hard drive flash drive

1033140
rar	zip
if you don t want to upload them one folder at a time put them all into one folder and upload that or archive it into a compressed zip or rar or 7z file. i bet if you re sane all your user files are located in pretty much a small handful of folders documents desktop etc unless i misunderstood you and you mean to copy your user account and all the crap files that have gathered up over time in your appdata folder

1037262
daemon	cron
first create the following file in the cron daemon queue

1037267
vlan	packets
if your router has a non-stock firmware like dd-wrt or openwrt it s probably possible with some iptables commands to tell your router not to nat your packets from the lan given certain conditions - especially if the router hardware is vlan capable and you go through the trouble of setting it up

1037267
wan	lan
alternatively you could set up a pc with two nic cards as a linux-based router and definitely have any tool you need right there in front of the wan or lan interfaces

1037296
folder	directory
the centos 6 version of nautilus offered 2 modes for displaying the directory folder heirarchy

1037304
hide	show
although everyone claims it is not possible to control windows update there is a microsoft tool which can be used to disable updates called show or hide updates

1037304
hide	show
curiously enough there are several other updates that i can also disable but even though they appear in the list of updates in the show or hide updates tool the windows update is claiming that there are no updates

1037434
bash	zsh
i am currently using the zsh shell but the exact same problem occurs in bash

1037486
vpn	lan
if you add a static route to your machine for destination 123.123.0.0 16 say and specify your vpn interface as the interface to use then it won t fall back to the default route and try the lan connection

1037496
mouse	keyboard
obviously a remote desktop client is going to capture keyboard and mouse and could proxy local resources but i should have thought there would be some mechanism for the user to manage access to local resources

1037515
sorting	filtering
you should use the secondary level of sorting in excel and create an extra column at the same level of the number of points per team you use for your primary filtering

1037523

every computer with wireless and an ethernet port will have an error like this if they are not both connected

1037705
put	get
you might have to put a load on the supply to get it to turn on or use the enable wire

1037706
versioning	upgrade
upgrade to a newer nmap versioning 7.01 was released in december 2016 to fix this problem and benefit from a lot of new features

1037718
cpu	processors
and if it has such advantage why new processors integrate some of its features into cpu

1037719
cpu	processors	put	get
put another way in order to get the performance that people want all of the available area on the cpu chip is devoted to processors cores and high-speed cache memories

1037723
tunnel	vpn	tunnel	packets
vpn connection solves the problem maybe because of tunnel testing packets sent every -+20 seconds by vpn client

1037732
ubuntu	linux
i first installed windows with 120 510 gb disk in efi mode and then want to install linux but every single linux just doesn t reconize my ssd excepted ubuntu

i tried firefox opera chromium and google-chrome

1037763
robocopy	xcopy
also xcopy is deprecated per microsoft and it s recommended to use the robocopy command in place of it and this especially makes sense to do if you re building a new process

1037763
robocopy	xcopy
so while it s your idea to use xcopy i m hopeful you ll be willing to use robocopy for the particular need since it is a windows native command line tool intended to replace xcopy

1037797
macbook	bootcamp
i am running windows 7 x64 on a 2012 macbook pro via bootcamp

1037802

the 192.168.x.x network range is reserved internally for private lan networks and not for publicly accessible wan addresses

1037907
disk	ram
windows 10 still have issues with it s ram management where it compress the memory and then writes it to the disk

1037920
versioning	upgrade
recent versioning can also disable upgrade to windows 10 behavior in the windows update control panel and do much more

1037929
mouse	keyboard
the solutions on all these places explain how to re enable aero snap but aero snap is working for me i can snap the windows with the mouse for example just not with the keyboard

1037934
filesystems	xfs
i skipped the xfs filesystems creation on dev pandydemo centos-root for brevity but you can create an xfs filesystems there now if you want to

1037934
filesystems	xfs	lvm	xfs
at this point you can reactivate the lvm with vgchange -ay pandydemo and lvchange -ay dev pandydemo centos-root and then if you had created an xfs filesystems you can grow it online after mounting it

1037934
filesystems	xfs	lvm	xfs
if you are not using lvm and are just using gpt or msdos partitions and xfs i have another detailed writeup on resizing xfs filesystems

1037993
centos	linux
i have a simple network with three linux systems running centos 2.6

rsh	verbose
-v means verbose so echo to screen what it s sending and -e specifies the rsh command in our case ssh -i which tells ssh which key file to use

1038014
umask	chmod
for example umask g+w enable write permissions by default to group when you do a chmod +w

1038018
umask	chmod
the umask by default 0022 is the reason the chmod +w change only the user attribute

1038041
put	get
if you don t put anything after the username you just get a bunch of information about the account

1038108

1038249
mouse	keyboard
i deleted the drivers for the mouse and keyboard then restarted the machine

1038250
lan	intranet
however if h3 is connected to the internet using lan the default entry in h3 s route table becomes the lan interface that s connected to the internet then all packets to 192.168.144.0 24 are forwarded to the internet router which definitely doesn t have access to r2 s intranet

1038268
folder	directory
i emailed crashplan s tech support team and they claimed that crashplan does not make any changes outside of it s main directory and that something else is conflicting with the program and causing these folder

cpu	irq
or does the cpu check the state of the irq during each cycle

1038378
versioning	upgrade
in previous windows versioning this worked without problems i see this behaviour only after upgrade to windows 10

1038388
cpu	irq
or does the cpu check the state of the irq during each cycle

1038388
cpu	irq
but if you look deeper how does the cpu itself work then there is a state machine that examines the irq line

1038421
ubuntu	mint
i would imagine that most distros will allow you to do this on a fresh install - this is true of ubuntu mint and if you want to switch the lvm and encryption layers here

1038449

i have a macbook pro 13 and an alienware 15 that i would like to be able to swap external monitors mouse and keyboard quickly

1038514
debian	linux	debian	mint	ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	debian	ubuntu	linux
recovery usually entails reading copying any files you want to keep if you can t read it try mounting it read-only or another computer or with linux linux mint debian ubuntu etc or try a dedicated recovery program like gnu ddrescue gddrescue or photorec related to testdisk

1038567
sudo	passwd
as a side note see that i ve included a -t argument to ssh so that sudo has a tty through which to ask for my passwd which is much better than putting the passwd on the command line imo

1038567
sudo	passwd
if you must pipe the sudo passwd in i suggest doing it via cat secret.txt | find .

1038627
folder	directory
you can prove that the current directory is different by creating a batch file named loc.bat in a folder called test containing echo cd

1038627
folder	directory
it s certainly possible to launch programs in other folder but you need to be careful about their current directory

1038627
folder	directory
to start a program in a certain directory you can use start b wait d folder program

as i ve answered there i have determined how to get the stdout and stderr to display once the tests have finished however the method i describe prints everything in the terminal when the process ends it s execution not as it goes

1038808
stdout	stderr
is there a way to get the stdout and stderr streams of the child process created by psexec in the terminal window that psexec is running under in real time

1038826
put	get
if you pop out the conversation you ll see that it has a url but if you take the url and put it into a new browser window you get nothing

1038828
versioning	upgrade
all i seek to know is that would nat be required if after ipv6 is implemented would nat be eliminated or be used in a different way transformed or upgrade into a new versioning with some added abilities to tackle any situations or problems that the network specialists or researchers foresee

1038869
sudoers	visudo
what you can do is edit your sudoers file with the command sudo visudo

1038869
sudoers	visudo
side note please make sure to use visudo and not vi to edit the sudoers file

1038869
sudoers	visudo
visudo edits the sudoers file in a safe fashion analogous to vipw 8

1038869
sudoers	visudo
visudo locks the sudoers file against multiple simultaneous edits

1038869
sudoers	visudo
visudo parses the sudoers file after the edit and will not save the changes if there is a syntax error

1038869
sudo	passwd
save the file and you should now not be prompted for a passwd when using the sudo command

1038874

1039018
ubuntu	linux
i m using linux specifically ubuntu 15.10 but i don t this is related to distribution

1039054
filesystems	btrfs
if i create the vm and store the data in a ext4 filesystems would the btrfs checksumming on the host server detect data corruption on the vm

1039054
filesystems	btrfs
if the previous answer is no would i have to create the vm with btrfs as its filesystems also

1039070
hide	show
i also disabled any intel graphics update with the show hide tool from microsoft and enabled the prevent installation of devices that match any of these device id s in local group policy editor so there is no way that the intel hd graphics 4600 driver get s installed

1039074
chown	chgrp
i don t want to chown chgrp the files to my username because arbitrary users shouldn t be mucking about in opt ... right

1039104

i wonder if i should enable https ssl on web servers in my lan

1039105
hide	show
search show search icon and then both taskbars will hide normally

1039157

1039232
put	get
however when i put this code without export in root .bashrc i get this effect when i change the current shell to bash using the command bash

1039236
sorting	grouping
if you really need them on a separate sheet what you can do is copy paste them to the next sheet since they will all be grouping together from the sorting

1039247
put	get
when you copy fonts there with windows explorer it helps you by registering the file but if you just put the file there with a command prompt nothing special will happen and the font won t get registered

1039267
arp	icmp
i have enabled detailed packet debugging arp debgging and icmp debugging on the switch

1039310
spaces	delimiter
thus i would probably achieve this by using two blank spaces as delimiter then ticking the merge delimiter option

1039315
ubuntu	linux
i ve also tried the same approach on arch linux and on a newer version of ubuntu it made no difference whatsoever

1039317
spaces	delimiter
you just have to select spaces and merge delimiter

1039317
put	get
i think you will be able to get the wanted behaviour only if you put the dummy text#

1039317
spaces	delimiter
under quotation marks and deselect all except other where you have to put your double spaces in and set the text delimiter to the used quotation marks

1039327
ubuntu	debian
they refer to the openssl lib for ubuntu debian ad libssl-dev

1039377
debian	linux
using raspbian that would be debian linux v8

i used sudo chown -r www-data www-data media pi _ext.vol owncloud and sudo chmod -r 770 media pi _ext.vol owncloud to set ownership and permissions to this owncloud folder ext4 filesystem used

1039383
ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	linux
ecryptfs is already installed in linux mint ubuntu and many other distributions do you may only need to run ecryptfs-setup-private and then use the created private folder

1039386
mouse	keyboard
when i start the computer keyboard and mouse works fine in the bios but when windows is launched there is a window which ask me to choose language but impossible to choose it because keyboard and mouse are not recognised

1039386
mouse	keyboard
how activate mouse and keyboard

1039393
mouse	keyboard
it should simply be a case of hovering your mouse over the item you want removed and hitting the del key note on mac you may need to use shift + del kbd or with an extended keyboard shift + backspace .

1039410
hide	show
you can hide the scripts so they aren t show in windows explorer and task scheduler will still run them fine

1039414
google-chrome	safari	google-chrome	firefox	firefox	safari
issue only happens in firefox safari and google-chrome are okay

1039464
folder	directory
you could also delete from the command prompt start it change directory to the parent folder cd users myusername pictures and either delete an entire subfolder with its contents with rd s foldername or specifically delete this file with del a thumbs.db the a switch is needed because this is a hidden file

1039481

however in ms-office 2016 this keyboard shortcut no longer does anything and i can t find anything called send to onenote

1039523

it may be read from metadata bit_rate_value from avc h.264 or from frame size mp4 has the list of frame sizes in the header so we can see which frame is the biggest one

1040787
macports	homebrew
since each port system usually comes with different quirks and the occasional port failing to build due to some weirdness hidden deep down its path of dependencies i ve got one system with homebrew macports and freeports installed in parallel

1040787
fink	macports
so far it has been enough to initialize a clean building environment that only has the system directories make sure to avoid usr local for macports fink freeports see raims answer + its own target directories in its search paths linker path etc the way already described in the question above

you d be better off running this in a vm - i believe vmware has native drivers but virtualbox does not

1040880
disk	ram
but it s necessary to be root or use sudo to copy the kernel file to boot to copy the modules to lib modules via make modules_install and to create an initial ram disk via commands that vary from one distribution to another

ubuntu	yosemite
i had trouble starting ubuntu i booted the mac recovery disk which went straight to internet recovery - because the recovery partition is still yosemite

1040910
ubuntu	yosemite	osx	yosemite
then i was able to boot ubuntu from refind for a couple of days but for the past two days i am unable to boot anything except osx the recovery drives one internal yosemite and the usb with el capitan

google-chrome	safari
the text of the error appears to be browser-specific -- google-chrome says empty response while safari claims the server unexpectedly dropped the connection .

1040937
google-chrome	firefox
because you did not initiate a secure connection as per the https protocol you had google-chrome and firefox behave that way

google-chrome	firefox
if the case is that you want no video playing on websites because you are on metered connections and regardless of using google-chrome i believe this can only be possible with firefox and noscript

1041074
google-chrome	firefox
however changing this attribute would only stop auto-playing instead of blocking the element entirely as noscript does which means google-chrome may still buffer some small parts yet without playing them btw firefox has a feature to stop auto-play videos

1041082
versioning	upgrade
i have now just done an in-place upgrade upgrade on my desktop and am finding differences between the versioning of the operating system

int	boolean
additionally if you prefer the binary output 0 1 vs the boolean output true false you can wrap your function in int int true 1 int false 0

1041187
disk	ram
of course much more memory is being used but it s good usage through caching which makes it available while making program to start faster and data to be read from ram instead of disk

1041222
switching	screens
was looking for this recently and as far as i could see it there is no official way for now to disable it in windows 10 taking into account that this question was asked on official forum on august 26 2015 and the solution microsoft representative provided since then and till december 5 2015 was only for touch pad you can initiate this switching windows mode thing using three-finger swipe on touch pad as well kind of registry changes but it is not disabling touch screens gestures from the side of the screens

cpu	processors
after reading alot of links it bothers me that there is so much overlap between simple definitions such as cpu processors core etc

1041370
cpu	processors
let s clarify first what is a cpu and what is a core a central processing unit cpu can have multiple core units those cores are a processors by itself capable of execute a program but it is self contained on the same chip

1041370
cpu	processors
a cpu or central processing unit is what is typically referred to as a processors

1041379
cpu	processors
everything from the cpu which does the majority of the thinking for the computer to the gpu drives the display is technically a processors

1041379
cpu	processors
as for cores many modern cpu s at the time this was written are made up of multiple processors

1041379
cpu	hyperthreading
a mulitcore cpu has more than one core not including hyperthreading while a singlecore cpu does not

1045971
mouse	keyboard
they seem to have done a good job at whitelisting windows keyboard shortcuts ctrl+shift+esc alt+f4 the windows key etc but their sudden choice to steal mouse keyboard input has prevented autohotkey scripts i created from detecting key presses effectively breaking them

1045971

1046827

do i need to find a compatible ssd drive to connect to a sata ii motherboard or is everything i need in the box and are there any performance disadvantages to using an external usb3 hard disk to an internal sata disk

1046850
ssd	sata
do i need to find a compatible ssd drive to connect to a sata ii

1046850
ssd	sata
you can use the same ssd on a sata i sata ii and sata iii controller and it will work just fine just a tad slower

1046850
ssd	sata
bottom line just buy any sata ssd and connect it to your sata ii port

1046850
ssd	sata
so for this setup i would go for an internal sata ssd

1046911
iscsi	dhcp
you can assign static ips within dhcp - but be careful if you re using iscsi root devices without a hba ipxe and so on you can t change the ip after boot time because it will disconnect your root iscsi device

1046911
iscsi	dhcp
windows when netbooting over iscsi will get two ip s at boot one from ibft and one from dhcp client service

if i remove sudo from my script it runs without passwd promoting but i still get the permissions denied errors over and over

1047050
versioning	upgrade
it seems likely though that eventually increasing numbers of websites will prevent access to older versioning of browsers and then you might get a snowball effect of not being able to upgrade the browser because the browser won t update on xp or some variant of this

1047055
chown	sudo	chown	passwd	chown	chmod	sudo	passwd
you don t need to put additional sudo for chown or chmod as these commands will inherit permissions from the script but in this case sudo chown would run without problems as root has permissions to run all commands without passwd prompt

1047055
chown	chmod	chown	sudoers	chmod	sudoers
you did not allow myusername to run chown or chmod in sudoers

knoppix is a debian-based linux distribution designed to be run directly from a live cd dvd or usb flash drive

1047488

kali linux originally based on an offshoot of knoppix but now based directly on debian testing

1047509
disk	ram
linux uses free ram basically anything not being used by programs for disk caches and buffers so with enough ram your whole uploaded file can be buffered in memory as quickly as it can be received from the network

1047580
tunnel	vpn
this connection uses split tunnel to avoid routing all traffic through the vpn connection

1047603
ssl	https
my personal experience given a tight-laced server with just a single https port open no other port client certificates required and iptables being active it was still able to list available ciphers while top-voted solutions were not i was trying small shell script ssl labs nmap sslscan

1047605
vim	sublimetext
an equivalent to vim s ga would suffice but a more elaborate solution that shows more information within sublimetext itself so i don t need to google would be good

i am renaming files using - instead of spaces so having to put rename into a loop just to get rid of 1 to 10 dashes in hundreds of files is really really lame

1047905
disk	ram
system consumes 50 of ram out of 8gb and over 90 of disk usage out of about 80mb s regularly however the processes are not listed under my user

1047908

later you reference . output which points to an output folder in your current directory like c users myusername output

1047934
disk	ram
if you want to be able to hibernate to disk you must have at least as much swap space as physical ram

1048380

1049851
switching	screens
so basically what you could do if your monitors support this is to plug your two pcs into both monitors then write and keybind scripts i recommend autohotkey that would blank the screens install nircmd and use the command nircmd monitor off to blank screens and then use that keyboard shortcut to switching between the computers

dhcp server settings list both lan and wan ports.

so unless your router is unusually configured it s not possible to perform an arp poisoning cache from the wan to a machine on your lan

my first thought was that the keyboard mouse was faulty and would send random keystrokes to the os win+l but the problem persisted even with a different keyboard

1050179
pop-up	dialog
the problem is that one user just ignores those dialog for example google chrome update won t run if not authorized by an admin and for some reason having these dialog open in the background actually makes the laptop overheat fans start running in high speed after a few seconds after the uac pop-up and remains open

1050826
tunnel	packets
the incoming ip packets at ip a would then need to be passed inside the tunnel

1050826
tunnel	packets
i guess i could simply add another ip on the gre1 interface on my router namely 1.2.3.4 so it would 1 accept ip packets with this destination value and 2 send outgoing packets with that ip instead of the tunnel ip 10.0.0.2

1050859
disk	ram
in the days of ms-dos killing power to the computer would generally cause the loss of any information which was held in ram but not stored on disk but would not affect information stored on disk

this is why bash ksh and zsh have their own profiles they are not 100 compatible

ethernet	wireless
it s quite possible that the firmware in one of your routers it could be either one really is crappy and isn t updating its bridge table correctly when the mac address of the client moves from being on that router s wireless interface to being seen on its ethernet lan interface or vice-versa

1051390
arp	dhcp
this usually occurs automatically due to arp and dhcp broadcasts but if you want to try forcing it by sending your own broadcasts multicasts from the device seeing the issue you could try pinging some broadcast and multicast addresses such as 192.168.25.255 assuming you re using a 24 subnet 255.255.255.255 and 224.0.0.1 from the device that has lost touch with the other half of the network

mtu	pppoe
i believe the correct mtu setting for running 6in4 over pppoe is 1476

1051802
tunnel	packets
if changing the mtu on the tunnel doesn t help you can try using ip6tables to lower the mss on all tcp syn packets forwarded through the router

1051820
ethernet	wireless
as far as the ubuntu installed in your virtualbox is concerned it has an ethernet connection even if the connection on your physical computer is wireless

to clarify the question in case it is not clear by the title of the post how can i get ie10 to accept a self signed root ca generated using the method described that has 2048 bit rsa

firefox on the win7 box and google-chrome on a linux box produce no issues since i have added the rootca.pem file to their list of trusted authorities

arp	icmp
so far i know that if wireshark does not display arp frames before icmp frames it s usually because there are arp requests in the cache

1051851
arp	icmp
then i start wireshark add a filter arp or icmp to filter out any traffic except arp or icmp data

1051851
arp	icmp
but there is no arp information right before the icmp data even after i clear the arp cache

1051924
hide	show
a second option would be to resize the taskbar so it show all icons and use the auto hide feature of the taskbar so you have the screen available

1051937
width	height
aspect ratio will stretch to the max width or height without distorting the image but will blur soften the picture. often used in cs go

1052020
x86	64bit
finally it should be safe to delete the following directory noting that this is the name of the directory on a 64bit os and if you have a 32-bit os the x86 piece will not be part of the path

1052023
ubuntu	linux
i can get to the ubuntu desktop via advanced options for ubuntu ubuntu with linux 4.2.0-30-generic recovery mode resume but the cpu runs at nearly 100 and is not sustinable

1052027

the accept license agreement checkbox was clicked and the install button was then enabled

1052034
folder	directory
also sfc will not create any directory for you so if you decide to store the logs somewhere else c i_just_made_this_folder_up mylog.txt you need to manually create the i_just_made_this_folder_up folder before running sfc

i don t know if there is any connection between frequent crashes and websites in my browsers opera google-chrome or programs like netbeans

filesystems	ntfs
there is at least one entry in the mft for every file on an ntfs filesystems volume including the mft itself

1052105
filesystems	ntfs
it works similarly on linux however linux has access to a lot more filesystems than windows and ntfs

the text is on a webpage and i use firefox or google-chrome not an offline editor

earlier i was successfully using vm fusion with centos linux vm for web development needs

1052241
wan	lan
i came across this solution to try and get a wan to lan setup

1052252
button	checkbox
to fix this you will have to do what opendns says to do with the dns addresses on the network connections of each computer and here is the kicker you have to go to the advanced button and then the dns tab inside the network connections and uncheck both checkbox that are checked and then ok all the way out and recheck with opendns website

1052288
tunnel	lan	tunnel	packets
note that the dsl modem can t see the packets at 30.986704 because that comes out of the tunnel on server1 and is sent via the lan to server2

1052290
cpu	processors
laptop processors are different than desktop processors be sure you pick a motherboard with the correct cpu socket for that processors

1052318
folder	directory
the dropbox folder is just another local directory

1052318
mouse	keyboard
second check out one of the virtual keyboard and mouse applications available

1052318
mouse	keyboard
this software allows you to use one keyboard and mouse on multiple computers through the network

1052323
vmware	virtualbox
now if you mean moving the vm to different hypervisors then yes this is fine and you can usually get away with it since each hypervisor application like vmware virtualbox etc has its own set of helper tools vmware tools virtualbox guest additions etc

1052366
wan	lan
one of the lan ports on the thomson which doesn t have a wan ethernet port as it uses a phone connector for that purpose is connected with the wan rj45 port on the allnet router

1052379
wan	lan
it looks like the archer c7 makes it easy to disable the dhcp server but there s no way to to make the wan port act like one of the lan ports that is switch off all firewall router nat gateway features making it just a bridge

1052382
temp	tmp
would moving temp and tmp help and would they fit

1052383
daemon	cron
a cron daemon is included in the standard installation on almost any distribution and i doubt centos is any different in this regard because it is useful for so many other things

1052401
temp	corrupt
excel saves first to a temp file and then renames that to the correct original filename but that process was corrupt by my clicking save to a network drive a second time too quickly

1052405
traceroute	packets	mtu	icmp
sometimes they block even outgoing icmp packets which among other things breaks traceroute as well as other things like mtu discovery

1052405
udp	tcp
almost any firewall lets you filter tcp udp packets selectively based on things like source address and or destination port

1052405
icmp	tcp
so there s no surprise that firewalls can pass tcp but block icmp for example.

the process of defragmenting a drive moves chunks of data around on the disk to improve seek times - this movement process does involve reading a data file into ram and then writing it back to disk so generally the procedure will take much longer on an external drive because you have all the overhead of the usb protocol and the limited bandwidth

at the time the crypt function was created it was believed and this was stated by the creators of the unix operating system that attacks against the password hash would be infeasible due to the number of possible passwords and the use of a 12-bit 4 096 possible values salt

hex	binary
hex and binary are two different bases

1055977
hex	binary
hex in my understanding is simply an easier to use and more convenient version of binary

1055977
hex	binary
however i often hear that hex editors are binary editors

1055977
hex	binary
if you search for binary editor on google you get hex editors

1055986
hex	binary
it is easier to read hex than it is binary

1055987
hex	binary
a hex editor is a type of binary editor in which the binary data is represented in hexadecimal

1055987
hex	binary
a hex editor or binary file editor or byte editor is a type of computer program that allows for manipulation of the fundamental binary data that constitutes a computer file

1056006
switching	screens
windows shouldn t need to do that check until the user clicks on one of the other users on the logon screens or in the switching list but it does

1056019
hex	binary
in this instance it appears that the hex in hex editor refers to the conventional human-readable representation of each byte s value whereas the binary in binary editor refers to the notion that you re indeed editing the file at the byte layer and computers store bytes in binary without consideration for higher-level text encoding and the like

1056030
hex	binary
when people are using hex they are usually thinking in binary and using the hex as a shorthand notation

1056030
short	base
hexadecimal hex for short base 16 represents 4 bits per digit

1056043
hex	binary
why are hex editors called binary editors

1056043
hex	binary
a hex editor is used to directly edit a binary file by displaying the binary content in hexadecimal format and allowing these hexadecimal numbers to be changed

1056043
hex	binary
hex editors as also called binary editors or byte editors

1056049
hex	binary
it rightly considers itself both a binary editor and an hex editor

1056056
hex	binary
the apple iie rom monitor is a great example it can dump memory in hex to the 40-column integrated video and expanding values to binary on an 80x24 screen will run you out of room quickly

1056060
subnet	packets
each outgoing packets is compared against every entry in this table and the one with the highest subnet cidr number will win and be used to send the traffic

1056078
hex	binary
to be honest i found hex easier than binary to read

1056081
client-side	server-side
it turns out the problem was server-side rather than client-side

1056153

1056222
min	max
it has a group by function that can calculate min and max values for your start and stop date requirements

1056230
wan	lan
wake-on-lan will not natively work over a wan which means that to would need to set up openvpn as a tap device on the lan interface rather then the generally more appropriate tun device on the wan interface - which makes connecting to to your desktop over openvpn much harder

1056230
vpn	lan
the trick is to have vpn advertise the routes for the lan to the client

1056237

1057783
cpu	processors
observe how for the top 3 processors as the core-count increases the cpu frequency decreases

1057785
mtu	icmp	icmp	tcp
ideally your broadband modem gateway should know what the mtu of the broadband link is it should limit all traffic it can to that size a nat-related feature known as tcp mss clamping it should break up oversized packets into smaller pieces that fit known as ip datagram fragmentation and for clients that want to find the right mtu themselves known as path mtu discovery it should send them notifications known as icmp â œdestination unreachable fragmentation required but â donâ t fragmentâ bit setâ messages if they exceed the mtu limit so the clients can adjust their mtus themselves

1057785
mtu	pppoe
in the case of pppoe over dsl you can sometimes make your isp-provided modem act as a simple bridging modem and have your own home wireless gateway product act as the pppoe client which can either learn the correct mtu via the pppoe handshake or you can configure its wan port mtu setting yourself

1057790

post please the router model that your isp gave you probably there is a way to alter the settings get into the admin aprt routerpwn.com

1063358
wan	lan
the main router - isp - is the one with the dhcp server so if you put another one after that in gateway mode it will take ip from the -isp- router let s say 192.168.1.xxx and nat the traffic thru there so just use a patch cable from lan port on -isp- router to wan port on your main router on main your settings for wan can be dynamic dhcp and it will work or you can set them static in the sub net that -isp- is giving you if dhcp is enabled in main then it need to be another sub net if isp is 192.168.1.xxx then main you should set 192.168.2.xxx the child devices will have that ip for wan or if you use them only as ap for wireless then you can use a patch directly in the lan ports and do not use them as routers and just as switch with wireless ip will be in the sub net of main anyway on child devices disable dhcp

1063358
wan	lan
in other owrds on the netgear set wan as dynamic dhcp and connect the netgear wan port to one of the lan ports of the isp router in the lan settings set sub net that is different from isp router if isp is 192.168.1.xxx then you set 192.168.2.xxx in the netgear for lan - remember it so you can access it later

1063358
wan	lan
connect child devices to netgear as you see fit but it s best to connect lan from netgear to lan on the ap wireless router then just set wireless settings on ap and leave wan unset disbale dhcp on child devices

mouse	keyboard
i m using a kvm-switch like setup to share my keyboard and mouse between a windows machine and a linux machine

1065098
mouse	keyboard
i have a logitech mouse and corsair k95-rgb keyboard ironically both devices made and optimized for windows with only windows-side official driver support... and the problem is that when i switch the devices from windows or offline to linux linux picks up that the devices are plugged in and activates them immediately i can use the devices within 1 second no matter how recently i last switched or which state the devices were in previously

1065098
mouse	keyboard
according to my windows clock i counted roughly 38 seconds for device detection powering on and another 17 seconds update on a re-test later on i found the mouse activating in 15s and keyboard 5 secs later or in 20s for device activation for the driver to kick in properly so from the time i switch to windows i waited 55 seconds before i could use the devices this time was the same for both my keyboard and mouse despite using separate driver software and being completely different devices

1065098
mouse	keyboard
wacom untested mouse and keyboard become usable at the exact same time despite the keyboard driver being seemingly more complex and should probably be taking longer to load than the mouse it s kind of like no device can work until all the devices connected to the hub have had their drivers loaded may just be coincidence though

1065098
mouse	keyboard
i tried booting in safe mode generic drivers only in here the device disconnect still took 40s but the driver activation after detection took 1s for the mouse and 5s for the keyboard much faster than the 17s for both

1065098
mouse	keyboard
but in light of this i decided to re-test the activation time after detection for both devices after booting out of safe mode and true enough this time the keyboard took around 5 seconds longer than the mouse to load the drivers mouse 15s keyboard 20s

1065098
mouse	keyboard
further testing lead me to conclude that i can uninstall the corsair specific keyboard drivers and use the generic ones instead with the corsair utility engine still running and activating the leds and this gives me enough speed boost so that driver enablement takes 5s mouse and 10s keyboard however this solution is not an option for me since it means my keyboard would not function correctly

1065117
portrait	landscape
the trick then is to make sure you apply this to each page of the document individually specifying whether the given page is portrait or landscape orientation

1065117

then the converted pdf should give you 100 printable area and still maintain the formatting of both portrait and landscape in the document

yes most home na p t gateway routers let you specify a port mapping port forwarding rule or sometimes it s even called a virtual server where connections from the wan to a certain tcp or udp port on the router s wan ip address are forwarded to a lan private ip address and port where the service really resides

1065720
wan	lan
in the example of ftp port 21 tcp is usually used for incoming control connections so you would want to enter a port mapping in your router to forward port 21 tcp from your router s wan address to the lan private ip address and port where you re running an ftp server 192.168.1.2 21

then the other switch can strip off those vlan headers when it sends those packets out the other ports so the receiving equipment doesn t have to know that vlan magic was going on behind the scenes

you can potentially do this by changing your openvpn config that it does not advertise the 192.168.0.0 25 range but if you have other hosts in that range on the other side of the vpn you will no longer be able to reach them or you can renumber your network out that range - for example change your lan network to 192.168.1.0 netmask 255.255.255.0

google-chrome	firefox
the same website works with firefox or google-chrome without issues

1068181
stdout	stderr
i ve heard in some occasions that the default stdin is the keyboard and that the default stdout and stderr is the screen but i find that is pretty innacurate

1068181
stdout	stderr
if that were absolutely accurate i think that a command like cp file dev stdin would never be allowed and that if stdout and stderr where the screen then i should be able to control exactly what it might display which sounds pretty risky by the way

1068181
stdout	stderr
so i m more into defining that the default stdin is the way the current active terminal has for entering text from the user stdout the way the current active terminal has for showing text that is not an error on the execution of a command to the user and stderr the way the current active terminal has for showing text that is an error on the execution of a command to the user

1068181
stdout	stderr
is my definition correct about what specifically stdin stdout and stderr are in a typical linux system or is there something that defines better what those things are

1068198
folder	directory
cd - change directory - select a folder and drive

1068232
mouse	keyboard
i then have a kvm with just the keyboard and mouse on it

1068232

1068232
mouse	keyboard
and one with one monitor b plus they keyboard and mouse attached to both computers.

1068259

1068261
daemons	launchd
another long period later i finally got around to making a sleep script and applying sleepwatcher as a launchd daemons

1068275
google-chrome	safari
my impression previously is that there was a google-chrome plugin to manage your blocklist but nothing like that for safari under os x

1068290
ansible	puppet
or you can think about using one of the configuration management systems like puppet ansible or chef in a future

1068295
versioning	upgrade
i believe most windows 10 license s now especially if you upgrade from an earlier versioning of windows are hardware-locked and will re-activate automatically in the case that you wipe your drive and re-install it

bash	zsh
if you re looking for something to make this kind of suggestion for any command you might like to try using the z shell zsh instead of bash

1068476
udp	tcp
i know ssh can forward tcp ports not udp

1068476
udp	tcp
ssh with its encryption and tcp traffic would slow things down -- working against the reason udp was used for in the first place

1068497
kde	cinnamon	kde	gnome	cinnamon	gnome
you then should install a desktop like gnome cinnamon kde ... and use the network-manager

versioning	upgrade
my hard drive seagate has been working perfectly up until this past friday when i upgrade to the latest lts versioning of ubuntu 16.04 lts when i did this i was having trouble watching movies off of my hard drive and figured it was a bug with vlc for the new versioning of ubuntu so reverted to the old versioning but my hard drive continued with these errors and i had only figured out it was the hard drive after the revert

1069305

1069466
post	get
afaik the address bar in common web-browsers causes the browser to issue a http get request not a http post request

1069466

you cannot assume that a post request can be transformed into an equivalent get request that will be recognised by the server

1069466
post	get
scripts written using other scripting languages or more general purpose languages perl ruby python etc usually have standard libraries that cater for issuing post and get requests and managing cookies etc

1069810
cifs	smb
however most nix has an implementation of samba wich is an smb cifs server and client

1069810
rpm	yum
install samba using your package manager fedora uses rpm yum right

1070044
rss	feed
browser with rss feed on desktop 1 of activity reading

1070072
rsa	dsa
but dsa keys are weaker than rsa so that would be unhardening my new server

1070081
ubuntu	debian
because i have some scripts that install packages accross wide range of oses i would like to know since when apt install is available in debian and ubuntu

1070087
folder	directory
so if my folder already resides within the home directory of the current user from which i m trying to copy i can do something like

1070095
wan	lan
i can log all other traffic crossing the bridge from lan to wan and vice versa

1070097
vpn	lan
by the way i tried using networkmanager and customizing the dns entries for each connection to use my router s dns server to resolve hostnames on the lan and the laptop s local dnsmasq to look for hostnames on the vpn

1070107
stdout	stderr
i know how to capture stdin stdout and stderr of child processes

voip	sip
we re using a vigor2830 for routing voip sip traffic

1070141
udp	tcp
one of the ports required to be open is 5090 for tcp udp

1070141

we ve tried entering 5090 tcp and 5090 udp as separate entries but this has made no difference

1070176
pop-up	dialog
it shows a pop-up toast style dialog on track change and it allows you to use global hot keys for play pause next previous etc. i ve used it before to add hotkeys in windows 7 and 8 works pretty well

does anyone else know how to force ie to upgrade to a different versioning

1070249
debian	linux
i have a problem with my linux router debian

1070278
google-chrome	firefox
how is the way firefox and google-chrome are using the port different from the way rails is using the port

1070348
vmware	virtualbox
you can use software like qemu raw or with libvirt and virt-manager or virtualbox vmware .

1070383
google-chrome	firefox
i have found a simpler solution than the ones put forward by teknovenus for firefox and google-chrome

1070401
arp	icmp
at this point b probably already has a in its arp table as it already received all of this info from the icmp ping packet

1070436
folder	directory
the only workaround i can see is to import your company directory into your outlook contacts folder or create a separate outlook folder of contacts type

1070471
mouse	keyboard
recently my mid-2011 imac default specs except 2x 4gb ram boards were added years ago running latest os x and most recently updated days ago has been locking up during use - a single random app would get a beach-ball - sometimes it would finally clear and sometimes the system would lock-up hard - the dock the hard drive icons some finder toolbar icons etc would vanish the mouse wouldn t move and keyboard won t work so i have no choice but a hard reboot

1070471
disk	ram
itunes would halt playback as if there was an issue accessing the disk or ram

1070524
versioning	upgrade
this will roll you back to whatever versioning of ie was on the machine before you upgrade to ie11

1070528
folder	dir
you can show hidden files in folder options - show hidden files or from the command line with dir a

1070528
folder	dir
also hidden from normal browsing but you can show them via folder options - show protected operating system files or from the command line also with dir a

1070530

the first 2 common reasons it might have 2 is protocol udp and tcp

1070614
debian	linux
i ve switched an old laptop with the dreaded sis 771 graphics card to linux debian jessie to be more specific but while i work or even leave it on idle the screen suddenly turns off while the fans are still audible

1070664
sudo	passwd
i entered the correct passwd for sudo for sure

1070688
switching	screens
those usually switching screens size graphics modes and could throw a reset like command to the monitor

1070688
cat	tee
like check cat proc sys kernel sysrq to see if they re enabled or to enable them may need root or sudo tee etc

1070702
wan	vlan
i have then created another bridge that bridges between this vlan and the wan port atm0

1070709
mouse	keyboard
the contents fail to resize to the new window size and chrome does not respond to any mouse keyboard input

1070778
gentoo	linux	filesystems	btrfs
i m running a linux system based on gentoo with a btrfs filesystems installed on an ssd toshiba q300 with 480gb net

1070778
filesystems	xfs
before i had an intel ssd with 240gb net with xfs filesystems

1070794
chown	chgrp
adding to the answer by sitekickr chgrp does not have the --from argument but you can achieve the same with chown by omitting the user

1070823
ubuntu	debian
on debian ubuntu sudo apt-get build-dep libreoffice

1070828
google-chrome	firefox
i tried this with google-chrome and firefox both worked

1070860
google-chrome	firefox
networks can detect if the version of google-chrome or firefox is a desktop version

1070860
udp	tcp
3- traffic port sniffing networks look at what udp tcp ports you are using and what kind of traffic is going over them

1070883
folder	directory
this only adds a context menu item for all directory folder in windows

1070911
cpu	processors
the cpu tab you refer to in your link only says these are the processors that have been validated tested by ecs and are guaranteed to be supported this does not mean others will not work

1070919
arp	dhcp
sounds like there s some arp conflicting going on from the tablet or the router is giving your tablet a higher priority in the dhcp tables

1070928
ubuntu	linux
in ubuntu linux you can install it through

1070950
french	turkish	french	polish	turkish	polish
key spanish english german french italian russian portuguese japanese czech chinese hungarian turkish polish ukrainian latino

1070976
udp	tcp
a better way would be to set up a vpn service like openvpn requires only a single tcp or udp port and forward ports for this service only

1071015
vlookup	countif
it consists of replacing the countif method with min vlookup vlookup vlookup vlookup to find the highest rating of the 4 given values

1071057
udp	tcp	udp	mtu
there are some other possibilities but these are again less likely - it could be that the vpn is using udp while your download would typically use tcp and different optimisations mtu for example are allowing better use of your connection

1071086
ubuntu	linux
basically you need a 64-bit linux distro with a 32-bit bootloader for it to work because as far as i know 32-bit ubuntu doesn t have an .efi file and the 64-bit ubuntu doesn t have a 32-bit .efi

1071108
ethernet	wireless
the wireless router would be hard-wired using ethernet into a nic on the desktop itself

1071113
google-chrome	firefox
ms office google-chrome firefox etc can sync setting for you

1071114
apache	nginx
apache or nginx

1071129
installation	upgrade
in-place upgrade done within a working windows using a system image or installation disk will not work

1071159
centos	linux
our router is centos but we just use iptables to modify linux kernel firewall rules

1071163
ubuntu	linux
assuming i use ubuntu linux hosting

1071204
kerberos	ldap
please note that all my systems are members of a freeipa server which itself is an ldap kerberos on the backend

1071210
daemons	systemd
this suggests that systemd security services daemons aka sssd is fetching the offending key from another source

1071322
filesystems	hfs+
using macintosh hfs+ filesystems on windows computers

1071322
filesystems	ntfs
using windows ntfs filesystems on macintosh computers

1071373
post	get
per this post you can get to them through shell recent automaticdestinations and shell recent customdestinations

1071389
filesystems	ntfs
that said it does technically create a partition but it doesn t give the option to change the filesystems type to ntfs

1071411
width	height
since the page height is compressed you have fewer words per page thus probably fewer comments some comments will follow their parent text onto preceding succeeding pages with more space per comment due to the width resulting in a significantly lower chance of comments being compressed

1071491
wan	lan
i m not an engineer but i ve been configuring sme smb lan wan wlan for 17+ years

1071508
bluetooth	usb
i was absolutely appalled that the sound quality of these very expensive bluetooth headphones is far inferior to my logitech usb headphones

1071518
udp	tcp
ping remote over the tcp udp control channel if no packets have been sent for at least n seconds specify --ping on both peers to cause ping packets to be sent in both directions since openvpn ping packets are not echoed like ip ping packets

1071537
vlan	packets
this means the switch would be set up to tag packets with the vlan id before sending them to your client pcs

1071589
range	minimum
i am arranging a data set that contains range of numbers that are specified by two columns the minimum and maximum values sometimes these values are the same

1071589
range	minimum
if the range in the rows rests inside of my desire range anything with a minimum value over 4 and a maximum value under 20 i would like the formula s output to be 1 and if both the minimum and maximum values are under 5 or both are over 19 i would like the output to be 0

1071589
min	max
column b is max value and column a is min value

1071589
next	except
the next column is where i try to produce my intended value which works except when values cross the upper threshold crossing 19 it outputs the c1 value the result of the first formula which is wrong for the upper range

1071589
range	min	range	max	min	max
if i can fix the formula the percent included in the desired range should be 0.5 and because the min and max values cross over the 19 mark the output should display 0.5 as well

1071590
email	dkim
if everything checks up correctly active the dkim email authentication on google apps

1071607
post	get
slam the power off 2 times before it finishes post it will think that the present settings are screwed up and that it will not post and ask you to get into the bios uefi and change them

at the moment i m using nohup to start the process in the background log stdout and stderr to a file and return the pid of the started process

i have been trying to get synergy to work for a while now but it seems that if i can even get it to run prior to login it gives me error messages evidently resulting from lack of access to the window system this post suggests that it may be a sort of bug in synergy and i remember the synergy website once outright stated that starting before login was not supported

1076459

mouse	keyboard
to cross check i already changed my mouse switched to another program via keyboard + using the mouse buttons afterwards used the mouse going to the task bar below and switching the program there - always works just fine

1081987
mouse	keyboard
the same effect also holds true if i logon via a remote control tool such as ultravnc from another client to this pc then serving as host there also navigating and triggering via keyboard works but the mouse click command in that special case also is ignored

1082357
ppp	dhcp
also when i check the connection configuration with ipconfig - the correct dns suffix is listed under the ppp connection - so i know that it s being sent from dhcp over the vpn

1082361
put	get
so i ve add certificate with putting it in etc pki ca-trust source anchors run update-ca-trust extract which put it in to the bundle file - so is ok - but when i try to run openssl s_client -connect my-domain 443 -capath etc ssl certs i get

cpu	affinity
i expect you won t need to repeat said one-liner to cover new processes since cpu affinity is inherited

1082367
subnet	packets
pc1 put pc2 s mac address in there because pc1 checked whether pc2 was on te same subnet and since it was it put pc2 s mac in the packets or one might say frame

1082367
subnet	packets
if pc2 had not been on the same subnet then it would have put the router s mac address in the packets where i use the term packets in quotes i mean the general sense rather than the osi iso sense so i mean whatever field regardless of layer

1082367
subnet	packets
i think the case where it d hit the router would be from pc1 to the internet or vice versa or consider a router with multiple interfaces not just the two that a home soho one has then if you sent a packets from one directly connected subnet to another or a packets came from the internet to a directly connected subnet then the packets would go past the switch to the router to a switch then to the computer

1082384
put	get
for now i used the cmd+maj+ã ã to get a it s a tilde to put on another letter like ã so you have to enter another thing to make it appear

versioning	upgrade
linux will hold on to th e old versioning of the file till nothing is using it so typically a restart is for kernel upgrade and maybe drivers modules

1082442
uptime	reboot
finally there s a philosophical difference between linux designed for powerusers and folks who boast about uptime and reliability and a desktop oriented os - windows server probably wouldn t force a reboot either

1082448

arp	dhcp
a router serving as a dhcp server will respond to arp requests i m sure there are exceptions but not in a consumer product

1082598
vpn	lan
disclaimer - this is assuming a typical home network without vlans no currently active vpn connections and no other currently active router or managed switch - all of these can make interpreting the arp results more difficult and limit your visibility to arp results for the local lan

centos	linux
centos seems to work slightly differently 1 from other linux flavours

1082668

with # usermod -ag wheel myuser you are adding myuser to the group of wheel 2 the centos equivalent of the group of sudo of many other linux flavours

i want to avoid that the linux that runs the kvm can access the wan port directly - it should use only the lan port and traffic to the outside should run through pfsense

you need to run git pull push after this command and give the user name pwd for the first time

according to microsoft your session is protected from loss by power outage while in hybrid-sleep because the entirety of your user-space ram image is copied to your hard disk in the hiberfil.sys file so long as your system retains the session then upon boot it will load it from disk as though you had never slept

using virtualbox with its own bridge support vmware with its own bridge support and the windows s miniport bridge simultaneously is surely unneeded on your system and it will cause problems which you can t solve

vmware	virtualbox
but all of them vmware and also virtualbox have their own bridge solution which is better as the microsoft one but it can handle only their vms

1086707

ssd also except the case if you have a special sata port for ssds like a few recent mbs support

whether the activation server is actually smart enough to prevent re- installation of windows 8 after you have upgrade it i can t say

1087476

reboot replaces the normal 5 asterisk timing method instead of 0 0 0 you simply put reboot and your script will get called each boot up

1087562
daemons	systemd
the status you are getting is normal for a one-off - systemd services are really focused around daemons processes that are kicked off and you aren t doing that - so simplifying it a lot basically it saying it s inactive simply means that script isn t still running it isn t scheduled to run and it didn t spawn any processes that systemd is tracking - which is all correct and fine

windows	winpe
the strategy is to copy a different bcd file into place to change the default boot from winpe used to boot windows in a maintenance mode to booting the vhd file that boots a snapshot a baseline windows configuration and if i could do that within the grub2 bootloader it would be ideal

1087781
windows	winpe
it switches it from booting the vhd file to booting winpe which evaluates conditions and if they re right removes then recreates the child snapshot.vhd then changes the default boot back to snapshot.vhd and then exits causing the baseline windows os to be booted

1090654

there are definitely devices that can connect a wired ethernet device to a wireless network but there s no reason to assume that any such device would give you a more stable connection to the wireless network than the built-in wireless interfaces on the devices you already own

1090654
ethernet	wireless
the radio and antennas in such wired- wireless ethernet adapter could be just as crappy as the radio and antennas in your laptop or tablet or smartphone

if you make your ram disk too large you may induce pagefile swapping severely slowing things down

1091864

ethernet	wireless
and to fix the wifi dead spots you use a wireless access point which give you wifi where you need it physically by bridging the ethernet network to wifi you can connect this at perhaps the unmanaged switch or plugged into a spare wall jack somewhere

i just installed 16.04 lts 64bit version of linux ubuntu but it says that my graphics are intel sandybridge mobile and the problem with that is that i cant open more than 2 windows of youtube videos in my browser because temperature of my computer keeps rising like crazy and i believe its because of this sandybridge driver my 2nd operating system is windows 7 and everything is fine and plus its 32bit so...is there a way to get better driver than this sandybridge thing because i think that my first display adapter intel r hd graphics 3000 is the main one and more important one than nvidia one but now that this driver doesnt work like it should nvidia is the main one which it shouldnt be like it isnt on windows also and my computer overheats am i wrong here maybe

1093050
wan	lan
if you can acquire an ethernet router with wifi on it that is capable of running dd-wrt tomato or gargoyle you can disable wifi on the adsl router and enable it on the ethernet router - and plug the wan port of the ethernet port into the lan port of the adsl router and move any devices plugged into the lan port of the adsl router to the lan ports of the ethernet software and configure dd-wrt to do handle this - better you can use qos to give these people lower service guarantees letting them leach when there is bandwidth available but giving other users sites priority

format data series line icon width height 0.20 cm adjustable

1093504
vpn	lan
something similar can be achieved by adding a static route to your computers in the lan which tells them where they can find the vpn clients

1093504
vpn	lan
obviously your vpn clients also have to know about your lan which can be achieved by adding this to your openvpn server.conf

1093508

ubuntu	linux
if cygwin cannot provide a gnupg 2.0 due to memory management limitations you could try looking at the new microsoft windows subsystem for linux wsl to run bash on ubuntu on windows

1093614
icacls	runas
if you re running cmd.exe with runas and you determine the userdomain username variables don t set or list the expected values which you need to use for the icacls commands to work as expected then run the below commands in cmd.exe before using the runas functionality to find the current logged on domain and username credential values which you can then use with the icacls commands for setting the permissions for that identity security principal

1093654
min	max
default value is 2 and min max is 1 20

1093668
pull	push
another option would be a kind of master password or a rights management system like with git servers where you can add a ssh key so others can push or pull without the need of a password

1093678
tunnel	lan	tunnel	vpn	tunnel	packets	vpn	lan
in your case it would seem that you are pushing a route to the lan behind the vpn so you end up sending packets to the vpn tunnel endpoint to be forwarded to the lan

1093678
vpn	lan
in which case i would suggest to set the vpn using a bridged tap device which automatically sets the route to the internal lan without the need for forwarding or nating

1093699

using bash everything works just fine but when i switch to zsh some characters were displayed wrong ã â

1093897
kde	gnome
they are drawn by the widget toolkit that each program uses â in gnome it s mostly gtk+ in kde it s mostly qt

1093897
cinnamon	gnome
thus scrollbar behavior in gnome cinnamon programs would be a gtk+ option and more specifically a gtk 3 option in your case

1093897
cinnamon	gnome
yes it could have been added to cinnamon s settings app although it s a bit obscure and so more likely to appear in gnome tweak tool

1093910

after uninstalling the vpn i have had some issues connecting to the internet my local network on a ethernet connection wireless works fine

1095900
mouse	keyboard
separately i tested the brix by plugging in an old usb2 seagate hard drive and was able to see it as drives d e and copy files from it so i have to conclude that the usb3 system on the brix is compatible with most usb2 devices including the wireless mouse and keyboard but has a compatibility issue with the u-blox 7 gps dongle for which there may be no solution as the attempt to update the u-blox firmware failed

1095923
vmware	virtualbox
if you need that you can always install linux in a virtual machine using microsoftâ s hyper-v technology virtualbox vmware or something similar.â

1095943

for ipv6 the remote address is denoted by for tcp and for udp

1095999
udp	tcp
in os x is used for both tcp and udp whether ipv4 or ipv6 note that os x uses dots to separate address and port

1096006
freebsd	linux
though i personally don t use virtualbox it s most likely doable i guess since linux and freebsd are both supported

1096035
udp	tcp
the local address column has the same meaning as it does for tcp and the remote address column is meaningless because a udp socket could have one peer many peers or no peers at any moment

1096035
udp	tcp
linux net-tools netstat displays for the remote end of both tcp listen sockets and udp sockets for ipv4

1096035
udp	tcp
perhaps windows is going for a semantic distinction between to be filled in later in the case of tcp and open to anything in the case of udp but just as likely the two bits of code were written by two different people with no particular concern for consistency

given that different operating systems may use different packets types for example udp packets tcp packets icmp echo requests can i be certain that an active browser session will follow the same path that a traceroute call would follow

1096898
udp	tcp
if we use the tcp or udp message the traceroute can t know the services running on the destination computer which means it s hard to determine the port in tcp or udp message

for example if you have a linux-based router you can use iptables to drop forwarded traffic from your vpn endpoint to the lan but allow to the internet

1098116

1098147
sudo	passwd
if you want your java to run arbitrary commands as arbitrary users without providing passwd for either those users or your own you are essentially replacing sudo

1098203
uninstall	upgrade
the bad news is if you accidentally did get tricked into installing the upgrade the only supported path for going back to 2013 is a complete uninstall reinstall cycle and if you want to avoid being tricked again i recommend installing the easy fix after you complete that cycle

one solution could be to run an ethernet cable from the router to a switch and connect the devices to that but then we ll have 2 ethernet cables running from the router to where the modem is one for the wan and one on the lan connected to a switch

1098704
wan	lan
so we would have the modem connected to the e2000 s wan port a few devices on its lan ports and then a cable going from the e2000 to the r7000

1098709
mouse	trackpad
for whatever reason when my laptop goes to sleep and then i wake it back up my external usb mouse no longer works and the only way for me to navigate is either to use the trackpad or unplug the mouse and plug it back in.

1098709
mouse	trackpad
the thing that s bizarre is that the computer actually does recognize the fact that the mouse is still plugged in when it wakes up because when i checked the option to disable the trackpad when external pointing device is connected the trackpad immediately became disabled even when the mouse wasn t working due to the computer having just woken up

it happens on windows and linux tested on windows 7 and debian

1098943
cpu	processors
but whenever this question is asked the answer is the gpu is many slower processors while the cpu fewer faster processors

1098960
disk	ram
this can happen even while having enough disk space and enough ram

1098978
disk	ram
now i imagine that the first part of this is because during application startup the operating system needs to fetch all of the application s instructions from the disk and load them into ram

1098978
disk	ram
now what i don t understand is how this doesn t also affect programs that are currently running since the os can move a running application s memory pages from ram to the page file swap space on the disk

1098978
disk	ram
when the running program needs to access a page that was moved to the page file swap space a disk read needs to occur in order for the page to be brought back into ram to be used by the application

1098985
ubuntu	linux
i realize there are lots of options to get my linux machine to connect to this vpn including openswan and using a different network manager than the default ubuntu 16.04 comes with but i ve tried everything

1099000
disk	ram
ssds are faster than conventional hard disk but they are still significantly slower than ram memory

1099000
disk	ram
a running game in an adequately designed system uses only cpu gpu and ram and the hard disk is accessed only for saving game status or such

1099005
disk	ram
this means writes are written to ram and eventually flushed to the disk at a later point

1099012
google-chrome	firefox
i will need to use something to save whole webpage into one image file available in google-chrome and firefox

1099025
ssl	https
any company of decent size will incorporate explicit forward proxies for ssl so that they can decrypt the https traffic for monitoring logging and filtering purposes - a common euphemism being compliance reporting

1099058
min	max
the issue is that i can see that every now and then 5-10 min i see duration reset in ethernet status window and usually on the first reset some times on the second one speed switches to 100mbps and now i have max speed of 10mbs for the love of god i dug through google left and right can some one lend me a hand on this one

1099164
disk	ram
i have a dell inspiron core i5 with 4 gb ram and 500 gb hard disk

1099173
public	protected
accesslevel as you may assume would need to be either public protected or private

1099181
filesystems	btrfs
maybe using btrfs send receive could be made to work but it is not so simple because to send a filesystems a read only snapshot must first be made and then the name of this snapshot is used on the external disk

1099194
disk	ram
is it cpu gpu ram disk i o

1099198
google-chrome	firefox

openssl	gnutls
but i have got this far i ve been trying to update my netgear stora nas ms2110 it does not support tls1.2 so i set about manually compiling what s needed to update wget which needs openssl gnutls and their dependencies compiling its my understanding i have no access to a package installer with any updates to those libs tools

1099243
hex	binary
by default you are looking at the binary hex representation of the payload data in the packets which for the case of plain text web traffic would be ascii encoded

1099260
google-chrome	firefox
the global mute works fine for all apps except google-chrome and ms edge not sure about firefox

you may consider using vmware or parallels which are more flexible than using bootcamp if you plan on resizing your partitions as needed or need to recover your windows more machine easily

1099395
filesystems	ntfs
do you have the the right permissions on the filesystems ntfs as well as on the network share

1099414

1099470
ubuntu	linux
is there a way to do this via a network or some other method i am using windows 7 on my pc and ubuntu for the linux machine

1099479
punctuation	words
also if all your words are hebrew and the only blocks of english are punctuation marks then if you use rtl mode then there may be less of an issue because in rtl mode there s no question that end of any block of hebrew characters will be adjacent with the next block of hebrew characters

1099484

uniq	grep
where awk extracts the token 5th entry tokenizing by | sort | uniq extracts the list of unique tokens appearing in the file and finally xargs grep and counts the bytes

1099592
cpu	processors
if the thread just waits for the processors pipe to free up in case of ht race - is it counted as time spent in cpu

1099615
mouse	keyboard
the standard microsoft mouse and keyboard center doesn t let you assign mouse right click action to the favorites keys but it does allow to set it on other keys choose search button and then choose the radio button macro and choose right mouse click

1099635
put	get
essentially the set of benchmarking shows that while the os makes a difference for how disk is accessed and the general feeling of responsiveness when you get down and actually put the thing to work the differences become very negligible and could even be attributed to measurement error

1099635
ubuntu	linux
windows 7 vs ubuntu 9.10 more focused on disk than actual raw cpu no suprises that linux can be more effective responsive

1099639
mouse	keyboard
it happens for now when i m playing on it and the screen keyboard mouse are completely blocked

cpu	hyperthreading	cpu	processors	processors	hyperthreading
this lets us talk about how the scheduler works without constantly qualifying what we mean by a cpu . either way a logical processors is seen by the os as a processors and except for some attempts at scheduling optimizations the os doesn t do anything else by for or because of hyperthreading

cygwin	cmder
when i run tput colors from within either the cmder prompt or the cygwin terminal running within cmder the system returns 8

1100020
cygwin	cmder
i have environment variables that tie cygwin more directly into my windows terminal environment within cmder and sometimes run cygwin commands from outside of a bash prompt running vim on some file from a windows prompt so simply running the connector every time i d like access to the cygwin bash isn t quite a complete solution for me

mouse	keyboard
from there you can manage the servers including seeing its output sending keyboard and mouse inputs even when in the servers bios

1100257
folder	directory
the main problem is that as rsync recursively descends through a folder hierarchy it only enters directory that match its filter rules

1100299
debian	mint
as mint is based on the debian distribution the instructions here will be useful to setup the system

1100314
postgresql	mysql
you can query across workbooks and also use tables from an external database sql server sqlite postgresql access mysql in the same query

1100364
stdout	stderr
over af_unix you could send the tty file descriptor itself using sendmsg and recvmsg and have the receiving side use it and not the socket as the subprocess stdout stderr

1100364
stdout	stderr
the slave side needs to be given as the subprocess stdout stderr and your script will need to run in a loop copying data between the socket and the master side

1100370
installation	upgrade
if you use the free upgrade system via windows update media creation tool or standalone installation media windows 10 will overwrite your windows 8

if not and you know the aspect ratio of the 2nd video use where h w should be replaced with the ratio of the height to width of the 2nd video

1100442
rpm	yum
you can have a library installed outside of yum with rpm so one should check for that too

1100443
wan	lan
the purple ap connected to the modem router has a internal static ip wan - 192.168.0.2 and lan - 192.168.1.1 it has dhcp server for ip range 192.168.1.100-200 all other ap have dhcp off

here i am unable to set up their wan and lan ip on 192.168.1.xxx which is what i need to have the connecting devices on the same subnet

1100475
arp	icmp
when i ping 10.37.129.6 from vm1 i see the arp requests who was 10.37.129.6 tell 10.37.129.2 the corresponding arp reply and the subsequent icmp originating from vm1 s ip 192.168.56.101 so the os x bridge must be working

1100726
google-chrome	firefox
whenever i run google-chrome or firefox those processes are executed with an additional argument that points to an annoying russian website like so

1100726
google-chrome	firefox
my educated guess is that there must be some kind of file or registry that tells windows how to execute firefox google-chrome processes by default and somehow the malware modified those files by adding the annoying russian website as an extra argument

1100733
google-chrome	firefox
try using revouninstaller it also makes a sys restore so that you can back if you mess something up to completely delete all of the files associated with google-chrome firefox then do a reinstall

1100882
wan	lan
unreliable - 4mb router has 4 lan and 1 wan ports

1100883
google-chrome	firefox
there was no need to reinstall neither google-chrome nor firefox either

1100883
google-chrome	firefox
the malware basically modified the shortcuts of firefox and google-chrome to make them point to a malicious launcher called salterlauncher.exe with arguments 1 0 and 2 0 respectively

1100883
google-chrome	firefox
so basically i killed a process that was having a handle on files within that folder unchecked the process in autoruns to prevent it from running again in the future shift+deleted the entire folder and finally recreated the shortcuts for firefox and google-chrome in my desktop

1100917
versioning	upgrade
as for the flash drive i would upgrade the versioning that is on it

1101101
ethernet	wireless
i then added an asus wireless router high-end and plugged it in to one of the d2200d ethernet ports

1101101
ethernet	wireless
why would plugging in ethernet from a 2nd device when that 2nd device has no other devices attached and thus no internet traffic cause the d2200d wireless performance to drastically fall

filtering	grouping
gpo scope security filtering contains grouping of users which is in the users folder of the domain controller

what happens is that i m switching between desktops ctlr + win + left right and it is switching on both screens

1101378
traceroute	nmap
nmap specifically chooses probes for traceroute from what it knows about the target choosing probes that are most likely to make it all the way to the target

1101378
traceroute	packets
for this reason its traceroute is not really useful for debugging dropped packets but is excellent for quickly tracing the path without knowing what will reach the target

1101440
disk	ram
copying files from one disk to another doesn t utilize the very high reading and writing speed of ram because the clipboard only stores information about the files location and not the files themselves

1101687
folder	directory
edit i should note that i do not want to use the directory tree on the left side because that expands endlessly for directory with a lot of folder in them of which i have quite a lot

1101687

of course if this can be made to only expand to and show the current directory path and not all the other folder within the directory path i would use that too

though that s not a strict requirement â it would survive even with a 192.168 address on the wan interface as long as each interface was on a different subnet

1101729
ubuntu	linux
you can certainly run linux on skylake processors - i m doing that now - that said getting it running was not a pleasant experience as linux needs to catch up with changes to the architecture - specifically getting my laptop to not crash was interesting and required the latest version of ubuntu esoteric grub parameters and it still produces silently scary looking logs in syslog - and can t run kvm actually vnc i suspect with graphics accelleration - and the system is very jerky without it

filesystems	ntfs
it is a little bit weird for me because we shrink the ntfs filesystems and then remove the partition and create a new one with a smaller size i don t understand how it is possible to not loose data

wan	lan	wan	vlan
you must set wan port to use eth0. vlan_number eg eth0.100 and the other external ports to use eth1. vlan_number eg eth1.2 even though wan and lan ports share the same switch and same vlan config

1102126
wan	vlan
also for some reason i found wan had to use a specially set vid of 100 or any number that isn t 1 and doesn t conflict with your other vlan numbers while the vlan itself must still be set to 1

1102126
wan	lan
it will try to call them all eth0.1 eth0.2 eth0.3.. and so on when in fact you must use eth1.x for all lan ports and eth0.x for the wan port

1102126
wan	lan	wan	vlan
my working config with wan and each lan port on its own vlan ports labelled as 3 and 4 on the back of the device are defined here but currently unassigned to any network

virtualbox	parallels
virtualbox vm the client bridge network using parallels s virtual adapter vnic1 created for its host only network

1102379
virtualbox	parallels
note i could get virtualbox to use parallels s vnic1 in bridge mode

1102379
virtualbox	parallels
however all my tests failed when trying to get parallels to use virtualbox s vboxnet0 interface or even os x s bridge0 when i tried that

1102379

now i can access the internet from the client virtualbox through a wireless card attached directly to the router parallels without the host s os x intervention

mouse	keyboard
however if i boot the machine or restart from win10 and then pick windows 7 my keyboard lights turn off the moment windows 7 starts up and neither my mouse nor keyboard work

1102409

however if i hard-reset the machine get to the boot loader pick windows 7 and then tell windows 7 to start in normal mode the hard reset causes it to offer the safe mode vs normal mode startup options suddenly the keyboard and mouse work perfectly fine

wan	lan	wan	subnet
a simple set up is to connect both the routers wan ports to their respective modems and then connect the two routers lan ports to a switch making sure that each of the two routers occupies a different subnet but both have the same broad subnet mask 255.255.254.0 or 255.255.224.0

i ve grown up on winamp and still have much of my media library on windows from those days much of it neatly organised in a folder structure of artist album -- but some just a bunch of files in some directory

1102666
folder	directory
this means that i would either have to dissolve the folder structure of my library and just throw everything in one huge directory then use the list sorting in vlc -- or i must sort all files cleanly into directory and can only ever sort by whatever criteria i ve manually sorted for

1102678
wan	subnet
but it finds that the 10.30.31.1 doesn t belongs to the internal subnet or the external subnet. your wan port gets an internet ip address so the router will forward your request to the isp s gateway

1103465
versioning	upgrade
bottom line there are no guarantees of perpetual licenses but usually the break-off point is under your control such as by choosing not to upgrade to the latest shiny versioning of os x if doing so would create a compatibility conflict

1103475

go to start menu all programs accessories right-click command prompt properties layout window size width 80 height 25

1103484
wan	lan
i also took a look of the manual for netgear dgn2200 and i couldn t see the suggestion for lan to wan connection so i think you got that a little bit wrong

1103484
wan	lan
by connecting the wan port for your access point router in the lan of your primary router you effectively put all the devices connected on the access point router in other network behind nat from the primary router perspective point of view

1103484
wan	lan
connect both router through their lan ports and do not use wan port

1103491
google-chrome	safari
they work fine in google-chrome but not in safari

to setup a site to site vpn tunnel you will need to do the following

1104110
tunnel	vpn
private network to be used for the vpn tunnel

1104110
tunnel	vpn
if your router does not have a gui but uses cli and does support site to site vpn then you will need to configure a server config file for the vpn tunnel

after that you should have a vpn tunnel connecting the two networks allowing the two ends to communicate freely

ethernet	wireless	packets	multicast
i have investiged this phenomenon by sending multicast packets from windows pc to wireless channel and ethernet port

1104460

the command can be put in a batch script that accepts an optional root folder as an argument process current directory if no value given

1104632
ssd	sata
my best guess is that the laptop has a unique sata iii controller and the ssd is sata iii so maximum speed the hd is sata ii so lower speed the optical drive is sata i so lowest speed

1104632
ssd	sata
if i replace the hd with a new sata iii ssd will it perform as at sata iii or sata ii speed

1104678
vte	fontconfig
you might tweak its source actually vte s or configure fontconfig so that the italic version of your chosen font happens to be non-italic or configure your man viewer less not to use italics

1104681
copying	overwrite
so the gui stop copying while it asks you about whether you want to overwrite a pre-existing file named thumbs.db

1104690

1104932
switching	screens
you can simply switching the power off at the screens whenever you are leaving the office

1104940
lan	localhost
you ve done your dev all wrong if you re testing with localhost rather than a named-based virtual host setup where you can create your own real dummy domain and you can then configure your guests lan machines to point your dummy domain to the webserver ip via the hosts or dns which will mean no matter what machine you use whenever you go to your dummy domain it ll open your app the right way.

1104945
google-chrome	firefox
another option that has worked for me is to select a different browser like firefox reboot and then hopefully google-chrome will show in the list allowing you to select it

1104970

if however you want to separate the wireless traffic from the ethernet traffic you can do so by implementing the guest wifi network in the router s configuration

1105138
tunnel	vpn
i mean in both cases you set a essentially a tunnel between your host and remote location obviously aside from constant change of ips that last outgoing connection might not be connected by tunnel itself but still last sign of incoming data should stop on that server - when data is going back to you it should be already covered with vpn tor tunnel right

then if one of your processes is using an increasing amount of the cpu this is also a bad indication of problems with memory leaks or this could also be that you are using components called google-chrome firefox actually firefox has suffered badly from using attached plugins such as skype which lead to overflows in older versions

hash	salt
i m thinking of something like password + random salt derived from the username or hash the password with the username etc before verifying at the database level

1105611
hash	salt
hashing only protects the data stored in the database because the server takes the details entered by the user - retrieves the hash the salt and the pepper if either are used - runs the details entered and obtained from the db through the algorithm - if the result compares to the stored hash then the details are correct and lets the user in

1105611
hash	salt
salt and peppering just allows the hash to not be duplicated elsewhere in the database if two hash are identical then the password will be the same for both accounts - baaad

1105753
subnet	packets
ip subnet exist to allow routers to choose appropriate destinations for packets

1105753
subnet	packets
for our incoming packets bound for 192.168.10.2 we need only convert that packets s address to binary as humans-- the router gets it as binary off the wire to begin with and attempt to match it to each address in our routing table up to the number of bits in the subnet mask until we match an entry

1105753
subnet	packets
in a real-life router the routing table is sorted in such a manner that the longest subnet masks are checked for matches first the most specific routes and numerically so that as soon as a match is found the packets can be routed and no further matching attempts are necessary meaning that 192.168.10.0 would be listed first and 192.168.20.0 would never have been checked

1105753
subnet	packets
if router b wants to deliver packets to the 192.168.20.0 subnet mask 255.255.255.0 network it will need an entry in its routing table too

1105753
ethernet	wireless
as you get more and more hosts packed into the same ethernet network though the percentage of broadcast traffic on the wire or air in wireless ethernet can increase to such a point as to create problems for delivery of non-broadcast traffic

1105754
subnet	packets
if their router has a packets bound for 192.168.40.206 one of our switches they need only know to pass it to our router since 192.168.40.206 matches the network id and subnet mask 192.168.40.0 24 in their router s routing table and our router will get it to the destination

basically what i do then is just use synergy to switching between the displays i m using a hardware usb switching right now but i used synergy before and honestly i think it was just better than this... but since i have a gaming keyboard this allows me to have per-system keyboard configs and also allows me to switching hids like a drawing tablet if needed and i have keybound on my synergy host this would usually be linux to switching the keyboard and mouse in synergy over to the windows machine and then blank the screens then unblank the one on windows

the problem is that i want to have a computer in my workshop and one in my room and one in my workshop which are about 100-120 feet apart and i don t want to build a whole second computer so i m thinking about doing a weird connection all the way from my room to a second monitor keyboard and mouse in the basement so that i can use the same computer from both locations

some posts say that ntfs is the best way to use an external hd with both osx win other posts suggest that exfat is the best filesystems while there are also posts which suggest that hfs+ is the only way to go as osx time machine can backup to only hfs+

1112279
hfs+	ntfs
at present i m thinking to partition the drive in osx formatting 50 in hfs+ using disk utility leaving 50 unformatted and then format the remaining 50 in ntfs in windows

1112315

for current tab you can use ctrl-l to show the address bar and escape to hide it

1112321
capitalization	uppercase
buw seems to use the netbios name of your computer to generate etc hostname which according to this article is represented in uppercase where the translation algorithm from lowercase to uppercase is oem character set dependent. when you rename your computer in windows through or it retains the capitalization you give it but the netbios name is converted to all uppercase

1112325
hfs+	ntfs
if you re not going to be using time machine then the best way to do it would be to format guid gpt with two user partitions one hfs+ the other ntfs

1112328

and when i was trying to hit any keys or move the mouse to wake it up the keyboard would be frozen lights on there would stop triggering and it just remains in the state forever with the black screen of death cpu is still running and there is nothing i could do at this point but to restart the pc

1112706
ubuntu	linux
i recommend ubuntu server or desktop either or will work and is more user friendly then most other linux distros

1112706
udp	tcp
what this does is it sets whoever is using ip 192.168.1.10 to have a quota of 5gb and only accepts packets if its below this quota from udp or tcp protocols

1112732
mouse	keyboard
a keyboard or mouse connected on usb 3 would be a waste of the resource

1112748
mouse	keyboard
another solution could be windows is not allowing your mouse or keyboard to wake the computer up

1112863
exif	xmp
this answer explains how to get the details of the photograph through exif xmp etc. thanks moab for the url

1112904
youtube	vimeo
hence even though youtube or vimeo videos are hosted on html pages served over http s by http servers i assume that the embedded video players on those pages which are where the videos actually play out of are actually starting a second subsequent connection to a streaming server and streaming is occurring over rtsp or some other non-http protocol

1112928
folder	directory
i was using the powershell command get-childitem -recurse to get a list of all the directory within the same folder

1112948
folder	directory
to find the corrupted files open the folder it will give the error the file or directory is corrupted and unreadable.

1112961
wpa	dhcp
if you follow those instructions and enable the dhcp client on the access point as long as you change the ssid transmitted name and wpa wpa2 settings from the tp-link you should be good to go

1112968
switching	screens
i ve had the issue a few times where fn+f5 just stops working not showing anything on the screens or a second monitor and found solutions in using the master physical switching to toggle wireless capabilities and or reboot the machine to restore hotkey functionality

1112981
unix	bsd
please note that i do not know os-x but i think things there are very similar to the unix bsd behavior

1112981

this is even true on nfs because nfs only guarantees truly atomic behavior on mkdir and rmdir but nowhere else

1112997
ssl	https
if the website you want to replace is using ssl tls https connection it s a bit more complicated

1113035
ddms	adb
other android tools such as ddms also create adb clients

1113060
mouse	keyboard
if it were me i would start a keyboard mouse hook script in ahk do a single middle mouse click then view the key history to see what input is being mapped

1113060
mouse	keyboard
the first result in a google search for ahk mapping mouse as keyboard without quotes should get you there

1113060
mouse	keyboard
another possible workaround is to make a script that maps a keyboard button you don t use often to middle mouse click and use that script when you use programs that require a middle mouse click for navigation

1113061

1113295
ubuntu	debian
i know for sure that i ve done this before with ubuntu and debian and i ve never had this much trouble

1113321
antivirus	rootkit
the next step would be to boot into a live environment use a tool like hiren and then run one of the many antivirus tools here - rootkit revealer avira cli and perhaps even combofix if still supported

1113330
mouse	keyboard	hid	keyboard
most of the time the controller registers as an hid mouse and an hid keyboard though i gather that it s supposed to show up as a gamepad f310 when using x-input or dual action gamepad when using d-input

1113333
tunnel	vpn
but the proxy needs to be on a different connection other than what you connect through which means you would need to specify a vpn or tunnel for the connections for that to work

1113333
tunnel	vpn
in either case they would all still use your same ip unless again you have vpn or tunnel set up

1113333
tunnel	vpn
if you had a server somewhere else like a friends house and wanted to use your servers ip instead you would set up a vpn or tunnel connection from your host computer to that server then programs can use that connection instead like a browser and every site you go to would think the ip of your server is your ip address

1113364
folder	directory
using this trick one can easily change the target folder for many personal directory including the desktop

1113367
gentoo	ubuntu
the hdd is the data partition and the sdd is the root partition of all oses ubuntu versions and gentoo

1113380
filesystems	ntfs

1113489
ssd	sata
the samsung ssd works great with either the original apple or the new owc cable on either sata port

1113489
ssd	sata
the intel ssd works great in an external thunderbolt enclosure but i can not get it to be recognized when connected internally with either cable on either sata port

1113495
installation	upgrade
another option would be to use the media creation tool to create a installation media or the iso itself and do an in-place upgrade by mounting the iso and running setup.exe

1113521
next	except
in the net i found several posts for this and the following link do have quite exact instructions what to look at and try and i have also been following most of them except maybe one-two which i now will still follow on a next upgrade trial in few hours

switching	screens
while i was working it started to show strange white flashes the flash doesn t cover the entire screens and is in the form of randomly spaced bars sometimes when i switching between users

1113740
mouse	keyboard
the only way for this loop not to happen is by inserting only one ram but then it would just turn on normally only to display nothing not even post and the mouse and keyboard are not responsive even when i tried a completely new ram

1113747
post	get
if you installed new ram and you still get no post the ram wont be the problem

1113747
post	get
if you restart now and get no post beeb-codes and you are 100 sure that your ram is ok then you need to replace the mainboard

1113783
tunnel	vpn
not all vpns are created equal but if the vpn client software deployed on the clients uses a virtual network adapter you can force all traffic through it into the vpn tunnel

dmz	was
per this article i added the router as a dmz and the smc modem was 10.1.10.1 and i set the netgear subnet to 192.168.1.0 24

1113902
wan	lan	wan	subnet
you can t have the same subnet on both the wan and lan sides of a router

1113902
wan	lan	wan	subnet
so the easiest course of action would be to change the subnet between the lan of the smc and the wan of the netgear to something other than 10.1.10.x and then set the lan subnet on the netgear to be the 10.1.10.x needed by the phones

1113903

1114005
switching	airplane
windows 10 will not switching off of airplane mode

1114020
udp	tcp
it seems that rtsp is a stateful protocol and it uses udp more than tcp when streaming and it s used more as a server device like an ip camera that is connected to a tcp ip network and feeds out streams via udp etc

1114020
udp	tcp
transport layer port number is 554 3 for both tcp and udp the latter

1121218
udp	tcp	icmp	udp	icmp	tcp
note that icmp used by ping and multiple traceroute implementations does not use a tcp port or a udp port

1121222
folder	directory
i want to grab a list of directory inside a folder and output the list into an executable which uses them to run something

i went to edit a photo in windows 10 and didn t realize it had switched into tablet mode until i closed that and found the screens sideways

1121260
screens	tablet
i didn t even know there was a tablet mode and didn t enable it. this is a regular laptop not one where the screens turns into a tablet

1121302
move	drag
is there something that would from the desktop allow me to drag the file and hover over a folder have a little box pop up showing the folder s contents including subfolders and would then allow me to move the cursor to the desired subfolder and release the left mouse button.

1121314
mouse	keyboard
i want to know how using hyper-v i can have two desktops running with one keyboard controlling one one mouse controlling one for both os s

while mouse and keyboard are one part of the equation the easier one the two displays with two grahpic cards are another

1121319
debian	linux
created a new vm type linux and debian 64 bit

1121344
tunnel	vpn	tunnel	packets
vpn is a common example of a tunnel the vpn client connects to the server over the vpn protocol then other network protocols send their packets to the vpn which transmits those packets using the vpn protocol to the other side of the vpn which then re-transmits the packets on their original protocol

1121352
wan	lan
router b connected to router a s lan via router b lan port rather than the wan port

1121356
wan	lan	wan	subnet
the typical assumption is that a router s lan and wan ports are on different subnet

1121364
tunnel	vpn
tunnel l3 ip or even l2 ethernet over a udp ip-based vpn

1121367
ethernet	wireless
since wi-fi is wireless it needs to have more mac addresses in its header â in addition to the regular ethernet source destination macs all wi-fi frames also need to know the radio sender receiver station ap macs to make sure only the correct device will receive it

1121369
folder	directory
if you have the navigation pane enabled you should just be able to drag an item over a folder in the pane and after a second or so it will expand the tree allowing you to hover over a sub directory to do the same thing or place it in any of these sub directory directly

1121381
mouse	keyboard
i suspect ublock origin also fails to block some scripts which hijack the mouse and certain keyboard shortcuts

1121381
mouse	keyboard
the mobile version of twitter works fine and does not hijack the mouse and keyboard

1121458
sse	avx
you put your finger right on it - the xmm registers avail you of vector operations sse in various versions avx etc

1121508
folder	directory
how can i change the directory where claws-mail stores the mail folder

1121509

how can i change the directory where claws-mail stores the mail folder

1121570
vpn	lan
after creating a new incoming vpn connection in my windows 7 ultimate 32 sp1 the network icon in the system tray always shows a red cross mark even though i am perfectly connected to the lan internet

1121585
mouse	keyboard
this is done this way so a keyboard or mouse can wake the pc up

1121627
filtering	grouping
to use such a script create a rule with the condition sent to people or grouping entering the address you want to filtering on

1121642
cpu	processors
all i can think of with the combination of slowness lack of cpu and disk activity and no swapping is a combination of the processors being very underclocked or throttled + bad graphics drivers causing you to always use the discrete graphics chip rather than the cooler and less power hungry intel hd 3000 graphics

1121658
versioning	upgrade
note i did not upgrade from any other versioning of windows

1121727
google-chrome	firefox
if the pac file url is served by a webserver the wpad file is a http s url i would recommend first checking if downloaded versions of the same file from ie google-chrome and firefox are all exactly the same

1121727
google-chrome	firefox
once the script that google-chrome or firefox would use is obtained one must inspect it

1121732
portrait	landscape
it would be really nice if i could quickly switch between portrait and landscape

1121823
switching	airplane
its on live dvd and im using ibm thinkpad 32-bit.i use the tp-link tlwn 725n for wifi connection its working in windows .the network settings in kali linux says i should use a hardware switching to switching airplane mode off.ive connected to a router with a lan cable then turned the router off then on if thats the hardware switching .it didn t work.then on my phone i have tetherd then untethered if the phone is also a hardware switching in that case .it still didn t work

1121870
cpu	processors
and call a processors a processors rather than a cpu

1121870
cpu	processors
but know that when people use the term cpu they usually mean processors and aren t aware of any other meaning of it

1121942
folder	directory
i know how to exclude a file or folder directory from windows defender in windows 10

1121978
debian	linux
i m writing a mobile robotics controller that will run as several daemon services on an embedded debian linux platform

1121978
debian	linux
to be as compliant with traditional debian linux as possible where should i put

1121986

typically a broken sensor will report wildly fluctuating temperatures or a steady maximum or minimum range temperature all 0 s or all 1 s or increasingly simply no temperature reported at all accompanied by the bios reporting the failure

1122117
put	get
but as soon as i try to put it into a loop where i make that 0145 into commands in the script and get commands line by line from a txt file it ceases to work

1122120
sudo	passwd	sudoers	passwd
unless you have configured sudo for the account this cron job is running under to not require a passwd and you have also modified etc sudoers to comment out the line defaults requiretty and possibly added etc init.d to the secure path this will always fail when run noninteractively like it does in a cronjob

1122129

1122182
debian-based	linux
for debian-based linux distributions the following should do

1122220
stdout	stderr
win32 command line tools with redirections to wsl stdin stdout stderr to or from pipe file

1122225
folder	directory
after i remembered to wrap my folder directory in double quotes so it wouldn t trip up on spaces in directory names it appeared to just work

1122232
opera	google-chrome
i use a google-chrome opera extension ublock origin to block ads would it be possible to submit this or add this to it

1122254
installation	upgrade	versioning	upgrade
if you upgrade in-place to windows 8.1 from windows 8 you need to do a repair installation of the same versioning of classic shell that you have or install a newer versioning

1122279
installation	upgrade
i ve recently upgrade ubuntu to 16.04 and my working dual-boot installation doesn t work anymore

1122298
post	get
i would post the errors if there were any to find however i usually cannot get it to even initiate a connect let alone attempt to connect

1122304
put	get
you will then get the option to accept the meeting tentatively accept the meeting or copy the meeting i am not sure what copy the meeting will do i am guessing that it will put it onto your personal calendar but will not notify the meeting about your status you will still show up as declined

so are ncurses and pdcurses the same

1122345
pdcurses	ncurses
pdcurses pubic domain ncurses is the multi-platform public domain

1122345

bluetooth	usb
there is an unexploited market for high quality sub- 100 usb and bluetooth headphones right now

1122422
folder	directory
i want to make a .bat file to copy contents of this folder to another directory

1122431
switching	screens
this would happen if putty s dialog is set to disable switching between the normal alternate screens and at the same time putty uses the old-style xterm controls for switching normal alternate

1122431
switching	screens
what you see in the misplaced cursor is putty restoring the cursor to the location where was before the application asked putty to switching to the alternate screens

1122463
min	max
does it only allow for vbr with min max bitrate set up

1122465
folder	directory
is there a cmd command to show the folder size in side a directory

1122465
folder	dir	folder	directory
i know i can dir s a and see all the sizes of files inside folder and subfolders of directory

1122465
folder	directory
however i am trying to find a log file in the windows directory folder so was trying to find properties like if you right clicked and got properties using the gui

1122493

all that an ap does is convert an ethernet signal into a wireless one

1122519
wan	lan
the asus rtâ ac66u is set to dual wan with cable modem in wan and secondary wan set to lan 1 wired to the asus n12d1

1122523
mouse	keyboard
otherwise it installs the wrong ones and your keyboard mouse won t work even in safe mode

1122552
mouse	keyboard
my preferred search method is from the url bar because i can reach it by ctrl+l i dislike lifting my hands from the keyboard to use the mouse use hotkeys as often as possible

1122561
google-chrome	firefox
tested to work with firefox and google-chrome both windows and linux

1122562
tunnel	vpn
if you use a vpn or another kind of encrypted tunnel it will disguise the destination address â only traffic from to the tunnel server will be visible

1122607
filesystems	ntfs
ntfs filesystems also supports links which creates a virtual folder somewhere as a direct door to access another folder

1122646
freebsd	linux
lately for the purpose of smoke-testing the perl 5 core distribution i have been using virtualbox to install vms of various versions of freebsd on a linux x86_64 host

1122654
versioning	upgrade
i recently upgrade my php versioning on windows 7 from 5.5.something to 5.6.25 and at the same time i upgrade my xdebug from 2.3.1-5.5 to 2.4.1-5.6

1122670
wan	lan
my goal with this network is to connect pc2 to the internet and all the other computers in the lan and wan network

1122693
mouse	keyboard
i have a computer which i interact with by monitor keyboard and mouse

1122693
mouse	keyboard
now i want to interact with it through ssh instead with no monitor keyboard or mouse

1122699
google-chrome	firefox
i d be most interested in firefox but google-chrome would be okay too

1122728
ubuntu	linux
in order to accomplish this we set up an ubuntu linux server and connected the printer to it via cups

1122805
wan	lan
if you do add a second router you will want to disable the dhcp server on your wifi router and plug the ethernet cable into one of the lan ports instead of the wan port

1122865
x86	64bit
x-mouse button control supports all 32bit x86 and 64bit x64 editions of windows from windows xp to 10 including windows server editions

1122905
ethernet	wireless
i ve tried modifying the interface metrics on the host so wireless takes priority thus forcing the host to use the wireless nic and trying to set the win7 adapter to bridged ethernet nic but it s not working - the interface metric for the wireless nic just automatically jumps back above the ethernet card

1122948
tunnel	vpn
in a full tunnel when you connect to the vpn server it tells your client that all traffic is to be encrypted and by default routed across the vpn to the vpn server

1122948
tunnel	vpn
in a split tunnel the vpn server gives only a subset of network routes to your client

1122948
tunnel	vpn
split tunnel vpn s are less secure but faster for non-encrypted traffic

1122954
switching	screens
but when i switching it to dvi connection my monitor doesn t turn on until it reaches the locked screens

1123007
pull	push
i have tried a new bluetooth adapter on a vista laptop which upon install only is able to push files onto my mobile phone operating bluetooth but not able to pull files from the phone displaying messages that com ports need to be open for this operation

1123024
mouse	keyboard
ps keep a spare backup usb mouse and keyboard combo just in case things go south even they shouldn t so that you could revert the driver update and get back control of your keyboard

1123025
ethernet	wireless
in wireless it is assumed that the adapter is not capable of promiscous mode so virtualbox will intercept and inject data into ethernet packets sent received by the host nic namely source and destination macs

1123044
bmp	png
when you save a slide as jpg png bmp etc it exports at 96dpi so you get an image size that s the slide width in inches times 96

1123061
folder	directory
i got ssh working and went to the website directory folder and attempted to modify the root directory of my website

1123071
throttling	throttle
patches loaded contiguous free space driver performance cpu throttle if your cpu fan has a lot of dust and dirt on it it is no longer cooling as well as it did your cpu maybe throttling down some etc

1123071
ssd	sata
biggest performance gains are changing spinning sata drives to ssd additional and or faster speed ram more cpu .

1123071
disk	ram	ssd	sata
if you have the ability to swap say an i3 for an i7 on an lga 1150 socket motherboard you will gain leaps of performance cpu support isn t just based on socket but chips on the board bios etc ram cpu support are motherboard dependent where swapping ssd sata for spinning disk sata is usually not

1123071
disk	ram	ssd	sata
generally you would see generational increases with cpu change and see order of magnitude access and latency drops for sata disk to sata ssd with ram unless you started with really slow ram your performance gain on speed won t be effective but may yield still additional frame-rate differences and generally adding more ram means less swapping to disk

1123083
mouse	keyboard
so when i plug the hdd in the raspberry the hdd does not show in the file explorer the bigger problem is that when i plug it it all my other devices mouse keyboard and flash instantly die and i have to pull out the hdd to proceed using my mouse and keyboard

1123114
disk	ram
the idea of needing to keep a double-digit percentage of your disk free sounds so much like needing to have twice as much disk space as ram

1123127
mouse	keyboard
the green adapter is intended to connect a usb mouse or keyboard to a ps 2 connector on the computer

1123127
mouse	keyboard
as far as i recall such adapters were invented in the late 90s and they only work if the mouse or keyboard used is built with the necessary backwards compatibility

1123135
filesystems	ntfs
when i tried to format the newly created volume to ntfs didn t try another filesystems i got an input output error

1123225
google-chrome	firefox
i tried google-chrome firefox and internet explorer

1123231

i have an old spare machine p4 2 8 ghz 2 gib ram which i d like to reuse as a small home media archive server with a few sata disk

1123240
ssd	sata
idk and sata cable i am wondering if i could add it to my pc boot up my pc then format it so it can be used as a backup or maybe just for games as i am planning to get an ssd in the next few months

1123251
switching	screens
when i switching to the microsoft basic display adapter see screenshot computer games are unplayable but the screens brightness adjusts correctly

1123279
ubuntu	centos
i am running a centos guest in virtualbox hosted by ubuntu

1123284
mouse	keyboard
with kvm it removes the need for any receiver hardware except the keyboard display and mouse themselves

1123284
decoder	encoder
with steam link it has the mid-performance due to its native h.264 encoder decoder

1123305
hex	binary
as ramhound s comment says if you want to copy-paste the contents of an exe or any other non-text binary file you need to use a binary editor most of these are usually called hex editors because the represent each byte in the file as a hexadecimal value from 00 to ff though they will also decode the printable ones into text for you

1123310
mouse	keyboard
it still appears to be running the fans run and usb devices get power but it won t respond to input from mouse keyboard or from remote desktop

1123331
vmware	virtualbox
use vmware instead as it does unlike virtualbox have a working pc speaker

1123393
cpu	processors
processors intel core i5-2450m cpu 2.50ghz

1123430
mouse	keyboard
all my other devices mouse keyboard and flash instantly die and i have

1123430
mouse	keyboard
to pull out the hdd to proceed using my mouse and keyboard

1123450
folder	directory
warning this will delete everything it matches i would recommend you copy the entire folder you want this to work on then run the above command in that directory to look at the results

1123473
client-side	server-side
i presume that this is the client-side trace not the server-side

1123510
cpu	processors
processors intel r core tm i3-3217u cpu 1.80ghz 1.80 ghz

1123516
ethernet	wireless
we changed isp and with it came a new router via ethernet no wireless and now this link seems to be broken

1123520
mouse	keyboard
current solution right now is using the microsoft mouse and keyboard center which allowed me to bind a mouse button i used middle mouse to something called precision booster which allowed me to choose a specific percentage of my normal mouse sensitivity and sets it to that so i used 40

1123521
cpu	processors
so last year i bought my 2nd laptop which i currently use now its asus x550z its processors is amd a10 its quadcore and i bought for 640 at first its good never had seen my cpu utilization go over 70

1123537
ip-address	lan
will that only change the public ip-address or will it also make it impossible to reach from within the lan

1123539
folder	directory
you are looking at the desktop virtual folder not the actual directory location so it is going to contain other things

1123543
disk	ram
i have set up a ram disk as a kind of swap file for nvidia s instant replay which writes about 1.5gb of video every five minutes

1123566
subnet	vlan
that way the subnet are really separate â all communication between them must go through the router firewall and each vlan can run dhcp ra independently

1123566
subnet	vlan
on the router firewall create three new vlan interfaces 2 3 4 on top of the main ethernet interface and configure each to be in a new subnet 192.168.2.0 24 etc. the original 192.168.1.0 24 subnet remains untagged

1123566
subnet	vlan
for testing you could also configure another port to have vlan 2 as the default and nothing else. the switch does not need to know about ip subnet besides the management one

1123602
folder	directory
your home directory in bash isn t the same as mount point to your windows user folder

1123616
google-chrome	firefox
firefox will not use acrobat plugin and google-chrome will not run silverlight

1123631
ubuntu	linux
i ve found that on linux eg on latest ubuntu 16 i can dim screen much more that on windows

1123640
centos	linux
rhel seems to have a good reputation as a secure and regularly-updated linux distro so i m quite drawn to centos

1123679
copying	overwrite
also when copying files and presented with a conflict i have been choosing to have the files from the bad profile overwrite the files in the good profile

1123685

is there a way to do vertical rectangle selects in sublimetext 3 or atom-editor with the arrow keys

1123772
atom-editor	sublimetext
i d like to do the second step in sublimetext 3 or atom-editor

1123780
ubuntu	mint	ubuntu	linux
i have tested this on a few linux distributions such as ubuntu linux mint or fedora but the result was always the same

1123794
folder	directory
at the same time the originals will be preserved by picasa in the same directory in a hidden folder named .picasaoriginals

1123801
atom-editor	notepad++
in atom-editor you can install the multi-cursor which works exactly like notepad++

1123841
bluetooth	usb
this is why most gaming headsets that do support two-way audio in stereo quality don t use bluetooth but a proprietary wireless protocol with their own little usb dongle

1123900
mp4	h.264
output mp4 h.264 120kb regardless of the original video size

1123949
google-chrome	firefox
the issue only happens with google-chrome firefox and edge opens links perfectly

1123956
move	drag
it acts like as if it is a margin when you hover over it and click and drag it but it cannot be move past the text above and below it

1123973
spaces	delimiter
bash command arguments are usually delimiter by spaces and without the quotes bash will interpret those spaces as a delimiter and not a literal spaces also the reason why there are single quotes around the path specified for the cygpath command

1123995
beanstalk	amazon-web-services
you can use amazon-web-services elastic beanstalk which lets you run java servlets in tomcat

1124034
width	height
if i have image which is 240 x 320 width x height pixels and has 300 dpi then the print size will be 0.80 x 1.07 inches see image with goat

1124034
width	height
those numbers are computed as width dpi and height dpi respectively

1124034
width	height
based on above formula width 9.5 and height 6.5 the calculated dpi is 72

1124049
width	height
pictures are bitmaps made of pixels and don t have dpi resolution they have only dimensions width height in pixels

1124078
daemons	systemd
this systemd daemons for the linux kernel aims to do away with the need

1124079
folder	directory
after signing in there is a button more options and allows you to select from one of the pre-existing device names to reinstall the device on the same computer and puts them back into the same place but if the locations have changed it will be assumed that those files directory were deleted and put into the bin folder

1124080

sudo	passwd
i m looking for a configuration option in policykit that allows me to extend the time that needs to pass for a passwd to be requested again in a similar way you can with sudo

1124205
sudo	passwd
for instance if you type sudo echo x in a terminal and you enter your passwd if right after that you want to install some application using a graphical interface you should not be prompted for your passwd again unless it has expired

truecrypt	umount
i had 4-5 months ago set her up with a 50 gb encrypted drive using a program called truecrypt when she asked for this and told her to just mount the drive when she needed it and remember to umount it after

filesystems	ntfs
going backwards ntfs has been the de-facto for windows for some time while the de-facto for the major linux variants is the ext filesystems

1124517
filesystems	ntfs
the ntfs filesystems itself hasn t changed since windows xp 2001 a lot of features that exist like partition shrinking healing transactional ntfs etc. are features of the os windows vista 7 8 10 and not ntfs itself

1124517
filesystems	ntfs
since the filesystems itself is what governs how and where files are accessed if you re using ext4 there s a likely chance you ll notice an improvement to speed over ntfs

1124517
filesystems	ntfs
ntfs handles file fragmentation very differently than the ext filesystems and with 100k+ files there s a good chance there s some fragmentation

1124517
disk	ram
this is because of the caching linux wrote the files to ram then wrote them to the disk in the background while the cache-less windows wrote the files immediately to disk

1124521
mouse	keyboard
so literally no port is working usb audio serial keyboard mouse only vga

1124536
traceroute	packets
traceroute is a computer network diagnostic tool displaying the route and measuring transitdelays of packets across the network

1124536
icmp	udp
while in the case of windows it sends icmp echo requests instead of udp packets

1124547
min	max
in the output it shows the delays min avg max mdev

1124547
udp	tcp
some servers reserve a different amount of bandwidth to different services udp http... so testing different ports -p option udp tcp icmp... gives different info

1124547
udp	tcp
in such case you will need to rely on layer-3 measurement tools that use tcp udp packets since these layer-3 packets are more likely to bypass common firewall rules

1124584
udp	tcp	icmp	udp	icmp	tcp
basically rule 3 says where the rule has to be added and it is correct snat rules go to the postrouting queue of the nat table rule 2 specifies to which packets it applies basically to all packets from the machine with ip address 192.168.x.y and to all protocols tcp udp icmp ..

ubuntu	debian
i always did like this when i was installing ubuntu debian or anything else

1124638
folder	directory
this lets me set up links to certain directory and i can middle click and select them instantly when i save a file rather than navigate a complex folder structure

1124644
sudo	passwd
it s annoying to write the passwd anytime i open a new terminal window because of sudo command

1124716
folder	directory
if you want to apply this to multiple files in different folder cd to the base directory that has all the files and subfolders with files that you want to edit and run the following command

1124775
put	get
if you put that in your .vimrc or in a separate file in .vim plugins you ll get a cfile command you can use just like the real one except this one will also monitor the file you gave it for changes every 200ms

1124792
folder	directory
essentially you don t need to try to wildcard any folder paths and the s switch is used to delete specified files from all subdirectories from the directory you are in when you run the command and all the way down recursively from all beneath subfolders

1124806
mouse	keyboard
i want to be able to get the manufacturer for any bluetooth device whether it be a mouse keyboard headset or thermometer

scatter	graphing
i selected columns a and c of the data to create the graphing and selected the scatter chart xy chart type with just points

1124894
min	max
use the scale settings to control the min max and grid intervals

1124894
min	max
for this example i used min 0 max 2 major interval 1 minor interval 0

1124898
disk	ram
this can be caused tho from either or both your hard disk and ram

1124919
queue	fifo
many times as i learned it in school hard drives use a fifo queue for available space which means that the last thing you deleted will generally be the last thing overwritten

1124923
wan	subnet
first is the one created by cable guy wan miniport pppoe it has a ip address starting with 172 and subnet mask is 255.255.255.255 and no default gateway address

1124966
disk	ram
as far as i understand it joins the advantages of hibernation saves ram data on disk and can restore it even in case of power cut and of sleep suspend fast return to full operation

1124966
disk	ram
this makes me think that maybe hibernation and swapping ram data to hard disk don t work on my hardware and although swap space is needed to use the option hybridsleep in upower settings what happens on my system is not really hybrid-sleep but just sleep

versioning	upgrade
so i recently installed caldav carddav onto my open-xchange system and at the same time upgrade to versioning 7.6.0 rev 20 from 7.4.0

1125053

1125143
pull	push
i am reasonably confident that nothing has changed and i can pull both failed disks out at the same time and push the replacements in

1125146
filesystems	ntfs
also i m not looking for tools that parse ntfs itself or only work on ntfs filesystems i only mention ntfs because well what other local fs is going to support more nt-specific things

1125157
robocopy	xcopy
i have used windows default copier teracopy robocopy and xcopy in the past but none were a solution to this problem

1125158
ssd	sata
the datasheet indicates multiple times that this ssd only supports the sata protocol

1125158
ssd	sata
according to wikipedia both b and m keyed connections offer native sata connectivity which is what this ssd requires

1125168
wan	lan	vpn	lan
my isp does not provide me with static ip services so i bought static ip vpn service from vpnstaticip.com czech ip while im located in greece myself which uses a second router with lan ip 192.168.100.1 and which is connected through the first router from router 2 s wan port to router 1 s lan port

1125168
vpn	lan
because i effectively now connect to the internet via vpn and router 2 for all my lan which limits my download speed up to 10mpbps the max because i connect through czech while my isp supports up to 30mbps

1125168
vpn	lan
what i want for my lan is fast internet access and not to access the internet through vpn but i also want my server s publicly accessible

1125168
vpn	lan
is there a way that i can have all my lan behind router 1 and have my server s accessible both from inside my lan and outside through the static ip vpn service

1125383
socks	telnet
you open a telnet connection via the socks proxy proxychains

1125383
socks	telnet
if the telnet connection works you should see garbage characters at the prompt that means that the socks proxy is working properly

1125383
socks	telnet
if openvpn can t connect but telnet can then you may be missing authentication information for the socks proxy in your ovpn file or the socks versions implementations are not compatible

1125491
put	get
if i put the ethernet cable in my laptop directly and connect from here using pppoe i don t get these timeouts when pinging 8.8.8.8 but if i switch back and use the router they appear again

1125499
disk	ram
essentially linux takes data that s frequently or recently accessed from disk which in your case is mostly data read by the vm s virtual disk and stores a copy in ram to increase performance

1125499
disk	ram
in fact manually flushing the cache with will degrade system performance as the system will need to access the disk to read data rather than just retrieve the copy in ram

1125504
vmware	virtualbox
my suspicion is that its storage being slow and virtualbox and vmware handle io and ram usage differently

1125550
folder	directory
in bulk rename utility set append folder name to prefix or suffix and optionally add a separator character sep. and set levels to how many directory above the file should be included in its new filename

most of the devices that use the extender are attached to it wireless but i do have a single computer that is attached to the ethernet port that the extender has a wired-wireless connection

1125746
ethernet	wireless
the speeds through the ethernet on the extender are better than the wireless

1125746
ethernet	wireless
the only problem that i am having is that whenever i transfer files to and from my nas drive devices directly attached to the network transfer at 100mbps but whenever i do it through the device attached to the wireless extender via ethernet the transfer speed caps at my internet speed of 50mbps

1125757

versioning	upgrade
just as indicated in the microsoft post delete your previous versioning of windows this will delete the previous versioning of windows you had installed prior to the windows 10 upgrade

1125786
versioning	upgrade
lastly as mentioned by microsoft in this article selecting the option to perform this operation will delete the windows.old folder and prevent you from being able to rollback downgrade the update to the previous versioning of windows before the machine had installed before you completed the windows 10 upgrade

1125786
versioning	upgrade
one month after you upgrade to windows 10 your previous versioning of

1125806
filesystems	fat
so just choose to use files above 4gb and then you will be able to select a filesystems that definitely works with large files unlike the old fat

1125807

users can login and get a ticket from krb also using sasl i can connect web applications to ldap that will authenticate with kerberos userpassword attribute is sasl user_name my.domain

1125825
kerberos	ldap
after searching some more i couldn t find any web application that supports ldap administration with kerberos authentication meaning an application that will change the kerberos password and not the userpassword attribute in openldap

1125825
kerberos	ldap
so i changed userpassword to hold the actual password and with smbkrb4pwd i can synchronize the passwords in ldap and kerberos

1125825
kerberos	ldap
great i though but then i realized that if i change the password in kerberos the password in ldap won t change only if i change it in ldap then smbkrb4pwd will update it in kerberos

1125825
kerberos	ldap
and today i started setting up password policies after finishing the policy in ldap i found out i need to create a separate one in kerberos one can t it just use the same one in ldap

1125825

does atom-editor provide a macro functionality like notepad++ has

1126315
wan	lan
given your comment where you implied that you re using the wan port i can say you don t need to connect the second ap using it but directly through the lan port

1126336

so now i m beeing ddos attacked on my homeserver he got my ip through the public teamspeak server and i still got an old rent linux debian vps with a static ip and full ddos protection

debian	linux
tails is a debian linux with tor and several configurations and system checks to ensure your privacy

1126448

i strongly suggest that even running your new debian tails-flavoured linux in a vm you keep encrypting your disk with luks

subnet	packets
i used to do that in a corporate environment too for reasons different than yours needed to access my own subnet but the corporate environment had a configuration that would route by default all the packets through its gateway and said gateway didn t know my own lab isolated subnets.

1126514
subnet	packets
all packets to known routes are sent through the interface that knows the routes so it is very likely that the routes to internal corporate subnet have their own routes attached to the wired interface

i d recommend openoffice.org for the videos you ll want to upload them to youtube or vimeo so they play back on mobile devices as well

switching	screens
if the bios does not have any settings to control this feature your only choice is to use one of your monitor s alternate inputs most have two or more to connect to the motherboard and use the input button on your screens to switching to it when you need to

1126547
stdout	stderr
because of filtering stderr may be a little late in relation to stdout where echo output belongs by default

1126547
stdout	stderr
you get a bit redundant and strange-looking output because your terminal mixes stdout and stderr

1126547
stdout	stderr
of course you can use another method especially when you need to analyze stdout and or stderr along with your traces

1126572
for-loop	loops
i know your example is using a for d loops and using that to iterate into another for-loop but using a single for f loops along with the dir command and applicable switches seems to help ensure each iterated conversion etc

using all ram would be okay normally but linux policy unused ram is wasted ram falls short for this kind of accounting since the machine will eventually end up using all available ram and even though most of it as a disk cache only i still have to pay for it

1127057

1127279
mouse	keyboard
disconnect all usb devices including the keyboard and mouse

1127289

when i create a folder from windows called newfolder in the root directory

1127311
mouse	keyboard
i use synergy in order to be able to control both laptop desktop with the same mouse and keyboard

1127344
debian	linux
on server with shared folder there is linux debian installed and client have windows installed

1127344
wan	lan
i must share the folder in a wan and client must work on document directly not downloading and uploading like is a lan

1127353
ubuntu	debian
another possibility which is probably easier if you re already using a debian flavor which includes ubuntu among many others is to fetch the debian source package corresponding to the open source project this approach is unlikely to be easy if there is no such source package and follow the instructions to build the debian package from that source

1127384
mouse	keyboard
disconnecting all the currently plugged peripherals keyboard mouse speakers usb hubs printers etc. and going through every usb port one by one with ipod cable

1127513
lzo	lz4
if itâ s a fast network connection 1+ gbit s a fast compression algorithm like lz4 or lzo is most likely still worth it

1127542
put	get
the second issue is that i need to get this command to run with the zoompan filter as well and i have no idea where to even start to get that additional filter to work or where to put it in the command

1127551
fat	hfs+	hfs+	ntfs	filesystems	ntfs	filesystems	fat	filesystems	hfs+

1127793
ethernet	wireless
i helped her remotely in setting it up as a range extender wireless same ssid as the main router and didn t use the ethernet cable and it worked all right for the first day

1127815
google-chrome	firefox
as some of you may have already noticed there was figured out that the massive write traffic up to well above 20gb day generated by firefox and google-chrome web browsers through their store session functionality may harm consumer rated ssds not set up for such heavy writing access

1127815
google-chrome	firefox
where is quite easy to fix or at least workaround in firefox i struggle to find a solution for google-chrome to avoid said traffic don t need session storage tbh

1127827

just like you if i setup bridged adapter using wifi the guest gets an ip from dhcp i can ping the guest ip from anywhere on the network but the guest traffic tcp and icmp doesn t even reach the gateway

1128030
versioning	upgrade
the standard way to upgrade from one versioning of windows to another is to use change product key on the control panel system page

1128104
afp	smb
in a mac dominated network i want to change the servers samba 4.1.20 file service from afp only to smb only due to afp being more and more deprecated in macos sierra

1128104
afp	smb
the main problem are the mangled names because via afp were a lot of files and folders names with illegal characters from smb point of view

1128150
wan	lan
this makes me think you might be setting the static ip address assigned by your isp as the address of your lan connection instead of your wan connection

1128163
put	get
so even if you put passwords or credit card information on your page and somehow get it behind and authorization wall the data is not implicitly encrypted by github in such a way as to prevent hackers who might hack into github from simply exporting that data from their system

you are getting the message because your browser is sending a post instead of a get

1128265

the form values are the problem as they are not submitted on a get so that information would be lost if you refreshed the page with a get instead of a post containing the information necessary to generate the page you have loaded or are being set on the server side in the session s memory

1128278
min	max
if desired that would also be possible to calculate min avg max by shell script mdev is far beyond the scope

1128399
ubuntu	linux
i don t use ubuntu that much but from the little i saw i don t think linux is affected

1128407
disk	ram
your 20 gb virtual disk is divided in 3 substantial partitions 0.5 gb for boot 11.5 gb for what will be visible as your main disk and 8 gb for a swap partition presumably added by the installer by default because you have 8 gb of ram assigned to this vm

1128414

1128770
versioning	upgrade
i ended up rolling back to windows 10 pro versioning 1511 and selecting the defer upgrade option in updates advanced options to put off receiving upgrade for as long as possible with the hope that these bugs will be worked out by the time microsoft forces the upgrade on us

1128777

the one thing i notice is i believe my hdd was a little bit taller than the ssd but they are both sata 3 so i dont know if that makes a difference or not

1128938
filesystems	btrfs
the proxy filesystems ability to pass it to underlying btrfs and to replicate simulate fake it with ext4 simple copy instead of cow in a smart way

1128938
chmod	mkdir
but fuse implements just common operations like open chmod mkdir in a custom way this does not include btrfs-specific operations

1128938
filesystems	btrfs
direct access to btrfs bypassing proxy filesystems but this would easily break one-to-one correspondence to ext4

1128995
ubuntu	debian
i m relatively new to ubuntu having previously used debian and red-hat based distros

1129016
openbsd	debian
on openbsd this is var log authlog while on a debian system it is var log auth.log

1129125
google-chrome	firefox
pip uses proxy settings from the windows system s internet options that is used by google-chrome and internet explorer but are ignored by firefox

1129151

so the easiest option would be to move the folder and then at the original location create a symbolic link directory junction to the new location

1129290
wan	lan
the piece of malware was intersecting and hijacking network traffic but was only smart enough to hijack disrupt wan traffic not lan traffic

1129378

the last line characters could be 1 character 79 characters to maybe even potentially 80 characters at which point i d need to ensure there is no carriage return or linefeed on the last line if non-white spaces does fill it to line position 80 on the last line

1129439

carriage return linefeed at position 80 on each line and the last line needs to be exactly 80 positions over filling in with white spaces if needed and no carriage return or linefeed on it regardless

1129439

folder	directory
the c-drive is at mnt c so in order to copy the folder c tmp test1 to tmp in your bash home directory do cp -r mnt c tmp test1 tmp

1129678
cpu	processors
and even more complicated some gpus don t arrange their memory in the same way it is displayed on the monitor lines of pixels from top left to bottom right but rather arrange their memory into cells rectangles of image data - this has to be converted but can result in higher performance of vram access because concurrent access from gpu cpu and signal processors is better distributed against each other

ipv6 is a protocol in the sense that tcp udp icmp are

1130880
tunnel	packets
the tunnel provider has identical but mirrored configuration which unpacks the inner ip packets and forwards it to its native ipv6 network

1130880
udp	tcp
or fou gue many home routers don t allow port-forwarding anything that s not tcp or udp

wan	lan
server has 2 network cards 1 a wan connection - 2 a lan connection - nat is configured and works - but i want to connect to a particular ip address from the outside using port forwarding - translation - like you do on a simple router virtual server setting like for gaming

1131009
versioning	upgrade
it is not a upgrade from an older windows versioning

1131011
versioning	upgrade
so the thing is that i just upgrade bios versioning with official sony vaio tool but after it got upgrade the laptop cannot find any hard drive

1131016
put	get
when you put your windows 10 machine to sleep and then hit a key to bring it back up in a while it shows you the picture when you get rid of that it asks you to hit the login button - even when you don t actually have a password set - before taking you to desktop with start menu open.

google-chrome	firefox
adobe flash player is already included with most modern browsers firefox edge google-chrome etc all have flash pre-installed installation requirement

1131073
hard-drive	hdd	disk	ram
and instead of overwriting the files drive_c.dat and drive_c.xml made from a previous hard-drive backup deleting them might have ensured that i had sufficient disk space on my external hard drive to write the new hard-drive backup files of the same names onto that external hard drive. so making that backup took a few hours of time to produce and write .xml and .dat files totaling about 126.1 gb in size onto my external hdd with my dell computer having a 1.9-gigahertz ghz central processing unit and 6 gb of random access memory ram

1131124
udp	tcp
dns primarily uses udp though there are scenarios - zone transfers and signed queries responses - where tcp is used

1131124
udp	tcp	icmp	udp	icmp	tcp
further exacerbating the validity problem of using icmp as your basis for measuring udp responses is the fact that icmp responses are frequently given a lower quality of service qos than tcp and udp are

1131193
ssid	wlan
many routers also can be configured to work with the same ssid of the wlan ap of the modem so they act as a backboned wifi repeater

as david mentioned in his answer probably my vpn is full tunnel that s why my host can t ssh to my guest by ip address

the easiest way out is to boot into linux use a ubuntu live usb stick it won t install or otherwise ruin you windows installation as most distros natively support apt

post	get
that is your answer - but taking the opportunity to get repeat an information that is somewhat hard to find or understand if you want to customize the frame duration of any specific layer it is possible to do that by putting a special sequence in the given layer s name within gimp on it s name include the frame duration in milliseconds post fixed by ms

google-chrome	firefox
if you wish to determine why a website is running slowly you could run the in google-chrome firefox network tab m in google-chrome this is accessed by pressing f12 and clicking the network tab then refreshing the page this should reveal exactly what is slowing up the page loading and find potential issues

it was paired fine but i took my laptop home from work and paired it with a different mouse and when i came back to work the keyboard wouldn t work

i do not experience this issue with this the external keyboard mouse in any other os and all keyboards and mice i have tried plugging in experience this issue

1131443
mouse	keyboard
edit i expect this is possibly a driver issue as i plugged in my mouse keyboard combo usb into the left usb slot causing the keyboard to work fine but the mouse to work just plain weirdly

1131443
mouse	keyboard
i suspect that it s the specific brand of mouse keyboard combos i had plugged into the top-right usb that was causing issues hp mouse keyboard combo

it also affects my keyboard and mouse repeating input and printing random characters

wan	lan	vpn	lan
router2 s wan port is connected to a lan port on router1 and i use router2 to connect to a vpn using a pptp setup

1131548

instead of connecting the wan port on router 2 to the lan port on router one connect router via the lan port as well and that should resolve the issue

for a good reason i decided that i should code a file within fix.bat that would be created when fix.bat is launched and would move fix.bat from the f directory to c users start up fix.bat and in the process of all this create a few folder in c users

1131579
vpn	lan
if the devices only need to see out but don t need to be externally accessed thats all you need - if they need to be externally accessed the easiest way to do this would be to ensure the router can take dd-wrt flash this onto it and then use openvpn to set up a vpn connection into your lan

1131601
mouse	keyboard
i was right so i paired my keyboard to it than tried my mouse but it said device is incompatible please use the receiver your device came with

it s a bit longer than ctrl-v but keeps you on the keyboard rather than using the mouse

1131633
udp	tcp
the first is tcp vs udp - interactive traffic like skype generally uses udp while web browsing and ftp use tcp

1131633
udp	tcp
udp is fire and forget while tcp will resend

1131633
udp	tcp
dns is also normally udp so you would expect sites to randomly not load and tcp traffic would be excruciatingly slow with significant packet less when they do load

1131633
icmp	udp
also you should be aware that sometimes there are limits on the number of icmp some types of udp packets to prevent dos attacks - what you are saying may be related to this

1131634
wan	lan
can you confirm that the service is working whatever you access it from lan or wan

1131668
tunnel	vpn
it s suppose to be slow down you regular speed because vpn route your traffic to different tunnel to encrypt your data

filesystems	btrfs
i have a btrfs raid 6 array and i currently have enough free space to rebuild it to avoid the data loss bug that currently affects the filesystems with this raid level

1131701
mdadm	btrfs
my idea is to rebuild the array using mdadm and format the md device with btrfs

1131701
mdadm	btrfs
is btrfs over mdadm raid6 reliable

1131710
mdadm	btrfs
is btrfs over mdadm raid6 reliable

1131710
filesystems	btrfs
this is as reliable as having one filesystems formatted as btrfs which is by default a duplicated copy of the metadata and only a single copy of your data

1131842
median	percentile
to find the median we can calculate percentile buckets and see where the 50th percentile is

1131842
median	percentile
cell e4 is the percentile bucket where 50 is so the median in this case is 3

cpu	affinity
setting affinity on a process doesn t reserve a cpu for that process you specify locking out all other processes from that cpu

1131919
cpu	affinity
another horrible result of setting affinity on a process to a single cpu is that you confine all of that process s threads to the one cpu

1131941
mouse	keyboard
it ignores the keyboard if you move the mouse outside of the remote control window

filtering	grouping
so if you have a user or a grouping in the security filtering it s not enough for the user settings in the policy to get applied

1132634
filtering	grouping
you dont have to list it in security filtering but you have to add at least read permission on the gpo delegation tab to the computer or a grouping which this computer is member of

1132634
filtering	grouping
whichever computer user or a grouping to which you wish to apply the gpo settings needs to be listed in the security filtering

1132634
filtering	grouping
listing computer user or a grouping in the security filtering effectively means that you are giving the computer user or a grouping two permissions over the gpo - one permission is read and the other is apply the grouping policy

1132634
filtering	grouping
the delegation tab is giving you option to assign permissions to the gpo in more detail but you can check that if you add computer user or a grouping in the security filtering tab it will appear on the delegation tab with these two permissions read and apply

for a gpo computer settings to get applied you need to have the computer or a grouping it is in listed in the security filtering

the people at vpnbook have an openvpn section with 4 certificates to connect to each of the servers available - try both the tcp and udp options port 443 is the most likely to work as it the port used for encrypted https traffic - use of a vpn should be very hard to detect over this port

the latest versioning 3.22 of the bios can be upgrade afterwards with the same process used in the last step get the official iso image but to keep the fn-ctrl swapped you need to use the image with the same ecp versioning 1.06 the versioning 1.07 rolls back the swap

1134895
mouse	keyboard
i know you aren t going to believe this but if you want to navigate to the same window from a keyboard or mouse you can use your mouse to go down to the very bottom of the screen and when the task bar comes up go to the very right and by default is what looks like a notification icon

1135171
subshell	tput
why does stderr redirection change the output of tput in a subshell

1135199
stdout	stderr
according to strace this happens because tput only tries to read tty settings from its stdout and stderr fd 1 2

1135199
stdout	stderr
since you ve explicitly redirected stderr and the also redirects stdout tput gives up

1135247

i m new to linux ubuntu

1135521
versioning	upgrade
ok this problem did vanish upon installing the windows 10 upgrade versioning 1607 needed to be done also for other reasons

1135527
portrait	landscape
for example if page one is portrait and page 2 is landscape the header and footer on page two will look like this

1135527
portrait	landscape
as you can see even though the second page is in landscape mode the footer has automatically expanded to take the whole width but the header has remained the same size as it was in portrait mode

1135568
wan	lan
disconnect the upstream cable from the wan port and connect it to a lan port

1135604
wan	lan
maybe i should do a lan to wan setup but that looks like a lot of configuration

1135635
folder	dir
you may use attrib s d instead of dir for a similar function but different output displaying file and folder attributes that s if they re hidden system archieve type of files etc too

1135640

is there a way of extracting a list of currently installed packages in a debian ubuntu system as a script that can automatically recreate it

1135657
tunnel	vpn
this error appears when the modem in the case of dial-up or broadband connections or tunnel in the case of vpn connections is disconnected due to a network failure or a failure in the physical link to the modem

1135683
ubuntu	linux
i attempted to boot up linux ubuntu from a usb stick and it worked so i am now confident that hardware is not the problem

1135686
tortoisegit	svn
i know i know git revert but i just learned that it does not behave exactly the same as svn revert --at least not in visual studio 2015 or maybe not in tortoisegit

1135716
folder	directory
encrypting the home directory means also encrypting the .ssh folder and therefore being unable to access it via ssh if i don t log in through the server console first

1135745
vmware	virtualbox
i want to encrypt some virtual machines it s better to encrypt it inside the guest via bitlocker for windows 10 vms or with the hypervisor i m using vmware workstation and virtualbox encryption functionality

1135774
srt	subtitle
i want to burn an srt file subtitle into my mp4

countif	sumifs
my initial formula of sumifs countif was rejected for generating a circular reference error so i m wondering if there is a way to have equations dynamically update depending on another cell

1135934

alternative you can build a text string with the x-by-y reference by using offset without the width and height parameters the 10 s in the formula above and instead finding the first and last cell in a range

1136001
versioning	upgrade
don t forget to upgrade to the latest versioning of chrome browser irrespective of the platform that you are using

1136018
ansible	puppet
that said given the description of your environment you d probably get the most mileage out of a network wide firewall combined with simpler host-based firewalls to be configured via a configuration management system puppet chef ansible et al

1136045
folder	directory
ideally the solution would keep the folder password-protected even when it s transferred from one directory to another in the event of emergency backing up to another drive etc. but this isn t a requirement

i registered cmder to be able to right click on my folder and do cmder here but it s always opening in the default user directory how can i fix this

1136121
sudo	passwd	sudoers	passwd	ubuntu	linux
by default the ubuntu distribution of linux comes with root login disabled and root passwd unset so to raise his privilege level a user needs to run commands with sudo and that is permitted only when user is a sudoers having its entry in the sudoers file which is as following for brief

1136121
sudo	passwd
which when run by sudo user will not prompt for passwd sudo passwd not root passwd if rootsudotimeout didn t occur to restrict this

1136140
versioning	upgrade
apt-get upgrade will fetch new versioning of packages existing on the machine if apt knows about these new versioning by way of apt-get update

1136183
kde	gnome
it freezes almost always using both kde gnome and also other desktop environments

1136213

1136418
folder	directory
by changing the default location of the user profile directory or program data folder to a volume other than the system volume you cannot service your windows installation

1136418

edit i have formatted thumb drive to ntfs just in case anyone is wondering about the ntfs storing data in streams and cannot transfer it to fat based filesystems

bash	subshell	subshell	dash
this is because as pointed out in the other answers the first example runs in its own subshell the sh process we start with the sh -command this could have been basically any shell bash dash you name it it changes directory there does nothing and closes

1136494
filesystems	fat
first off try using an antimalware such as hitman pro maybe a malware that has more access on fat filesystems prevents you to copy files

however when i connect to my external ip using the windows built-in vpn client it gets as far as asking my credentials but then it always fails to establish a tunnel

1136666
chown	sudo	chown	chmod
therefore the script sets up the right permissions on the subfolders and that s where the need of using sudo comes from chown chmod and setfacl

1136666
sudoers	passwd
i thought it would be as simple as to add an entry in etc sudoers to allow the lighttpd user to run the createfolder.sh with no passwd

1136706
pull	push
you should have the root script pull from the regular rather than having the latter push to the former

1136730

the built-in keyboard mouse emulation mode can do this and but has pre-configured key combinations for emulating various mouse clicks and presses for dragging

mouse	keyboard
i want to be able to work with just one keyboard and one mouse and i want to be able to switch between systems on two different machines whenever i want

1136775
mouse	keyboard
you can use a kvm switch to have one mouse and keyboard connected to 2 machines

1136828
filesystems	ntfs
given that you want to use the disk in both windows and linux choosing ntfs for your filesystems was a good choice because both operating systems can mount the ntfs filesystems read-write

the only reason for me to use the vpn currently is to allow an android phone to connect to a windows box by making it look like it resides on the same lan

gre is a protocol that encapsulates tcp udp and all i really know about it is it gives me problems

3 of them are working just fine wireless keyboard mouse webcam and assorted thumb drives

1137173

then insert the installation media and restart the upgrade

1137173
versioning	upgrade
so seeing the first error message i thought that the computer was trying to upgrade my current versioning of windows which would obviously fail seeing that i have a blank ssd so i found this download windows 10 3 which gives you the choice of either upgrading the pc or flashing a usb to use on a different pc

1137173
post	get
edit will add a real screenshot when i m home but seeing as this post will probably get no attention at that time i m adding a picture of the exact same settings i had using iso image however

folder	directory
i d like to move each file in each folder up a level to eliminate this duplicate note that for the sake of simplicity i ve listed 1 file in each directory but there could be multiple files with different extensions

1137314
folder	directory
move-item takes paths as strings and when .directory.parent casts to a string it s either an empty string or just one directory name it doesn t seem to be the full path to the parent folder

1137349

how do i chroot into my arch linux installation utilizing only this gentoo live cd

1137405
bash	zsh
brackets are a used for globbing in both zsh and bash

i m experiencing an odd issue in windows 10 that involves copying files that are compressed using the ntfs filesystems to another folder that has the compression flag set so that when the file is copied it is compressed in the destination folder

1137548

for operating systems i typically use ubuntu 16.04 or centos 7

1137554
folder	directory
to do so right-click on the folder you re trying to distribute go down to send to and select compressed zipped folder. it should create a zip file in the same working directory that you can then share

however when i go to the power options control panel i don t get any choices to put the computer to sleep as shown in the screenshot below

1137795

okay by default the first lan connection should be able to ping from the lan to wan outbound rules but the rest of the lan interfaces do not have rules automatically created you will need to add rules under firewall rules lan and firewall nat outbound

1137953
sudo	passwd
i actually typically don t even set up a root passwd preferring to use sudo as needed

1137961
google-chrome	firefox
google-chrome doesn t necessarily use more or less memory or processing power than firefox because of this

in linux one of the layers of protection against malware is the fact that you need sudo privileges malware most often would not be able to crack the sudo passwd hence it s unable to do what is supposed to do

1138045
debian	linux
since the upgrade to linux kernel 4.7 debian stretch it seems that my system aurora-r4 i7 3820 is a bit slower short hangs sometimes and the most strange thing is that i can t see anymore the percentages on the cpu cores with top ksysguard etc .

1138066
mouse	keyboard
we had a similar setup for desktops at my last workplace and i sort of do this for my home setup - they quite simply they had a suitable kvm for one monitor and the keyboard and mouse and switched the secondary monitor manually at the monitor

1138071

1138266
mouse	keyboard
but the same subsystem which handles graphics output â xorg â also handles many advanced mouse keyboard input features as well and the specific feature you are trying to use â key remapping via xmodmap â is part of x11 and therefore xorg just as its name says

1138272
hash	md5
mozilla does not provide md5 hash anymore due to their insecurity â md5 has been considered broken for several years now due to its near complete lack of collision resistance

1138758

his thought is that the issue is coming from some sort of permission or as he put it sysadmin access to our sql servers and he would have to reach out to the server team and get back to me in a few days

1138761

rather than messing about in the bios there should be a boot menu option in your bios where you press a key during the post sequence when the bios logo is showing and then get a list of all the bootable devices on your system allowing you to choose which to use without actually changing their boot priority within the bios

1138835

1139145
udp	tcp
if you request udp or tcp traceroute in mtr then the different paths are shown

1139145
icmp	udp
the issue referred to is that the icmp error replies would not include any of the payload of a udp packet

1139145
icmp	udp
traceroute varies increments the udp destination port number for each probe sent out in order to reliably match icmp ttl exceeded messages to individual probes

1139145
icmp	udp
because the udp ports occur right after the ip header they can be relied on to be included in the original packet portion of the icmp ttl exceeded messages even though the icmp standards only mandate that the first eight octets following the ip header of the original packet be included in icmp messages it is allowed to send more though

1139145
icmp	udp
the source code comments explain the udp port use as well but not the use of udp over icmp echo
